The last one-hundred years have seen a boom of industrialization. While essential for human advancement, industrialization has also given rise to ultra-processed, low cost, readily available foods to sustain a growing population. A consequence of consuming these foods is an increase in the rate of chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. Scientists and laypeople alike have started looking at solutions for these epidemics; alternatives focus not just on medications but the adoption of significant dietary and lifestyle changes. This quest for the "ideal" diet for health and longevity has brought to light several ancient cuisines, and some have been thoroughly studied, like the “Mediterranean Diet.”

The concept of the Paleolithic diet started in the 1970s, and its popularity soared after the publishing of the book The Paleo Diet: Lose Weight and Get Healthy by Eating the Foods You Were Designed to Eat by Loren Cordain in 2002. Since then, the public has shown a tremendous interest in this diet, also called the “cave man diet” or “Stone Age diet.” Many cookbooks have been published claiming to have Paleolithic recipes. The central tenet behind this diet hinges on reverting back to what our prehistoric ancestors ate and rejecting modern-day, processed diet in order to improve our healthcare outcomes. The challenge with this diet however, is that is conflicting versions are presented to the public.

Thankfully, several breakthrough developments in the field of anthropology in the last few years have helped dieters and practitioners better understand the Paleolithic diet. Perhaps one of the most popular misconceptions is that our ancient ancestors were mainly carnivores when, in fact, they mostly ate a plant-based diet. The diet was very broad and heavily influenced by geographical location and food availability.

Scientists and anthropologists have been able to reconstruct this diet based on evidence gathered from archeological remains and by studying modern tribes. In the modern world, about a dozen or so tribes still follow a hunter and gatherer concept. These tribes are located in different parts of the world and in all climatic terrains. The most extensively studied tribe is the Hadza tribe from central Tanzania as the African continent is considered the birthplace of human evolution and where the majority of hominid prehistoric fossils are found. Since the Hadza group resides in the tropical forest, their diet mainly consists of plants, fruits, tubers, and game animals. One of the most popular food groups for them is honey. There also are studies available on some Nordic tribes, who subsist mainly on fish and other seafood.

Based on these findings, the Paleolithic diet most likely consisted of the following-

- Plants - These included tubers, seeds, nuts, wild-grown barley that was pounded into flour, legumes, and flowers. Since they had discovered fire and stone tools, it is believed that they were able to process and cook these foods.

- Animals - Because they were more readily available, lean small game animals were the main animals eaten. As per some estimates, animal products contributed to only about 3% of the whole diet. Animals had not yet been domesticated so dairy products were most likely not included.

- Seafood - The diet included shellfish and other smaller fish. It was a major component of the diet in coastal regions.

- Insects - A variety of insects and their products, including honey, honeycombs, were eaten. They were a major fallback food. Recently, the interest in edible insects, called entomophagy, has increased. The United Nations released a list of edible insects as an alternative to meat products, as insects can provide similar nutritional benefits.
