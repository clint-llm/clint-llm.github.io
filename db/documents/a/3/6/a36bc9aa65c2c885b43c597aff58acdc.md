Foot ulceration is among the most common health issues, and its prevalence has increased recently. It is one of the major causes of amputations, particularly in patients with uncontrolled diabetes. The lifetime risk of developing a foot ulcer in patients with diabetes is more than 33%. Diabetic foot ulcer causes a lot of morbidities and accounts for approximately two-thirds of all United States non-traumatic amputations. Infections in these patients are thought to be limb-threatening conditions. This activity outlines and reviews the evaluation, treatment, and management of foot ulceration and reviews the role of interprofessional teams in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the contributing factors and underlying causes of foot ulcerations, including peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy, biomechanical structural deformities, and soft tissue changes.
- Describe the evaluation of foot ulceration.
- Outline the variety of treatment options for foot ulcerations.
- Summarize the interprofessional team approach required for successful healing of foot ulceration.
