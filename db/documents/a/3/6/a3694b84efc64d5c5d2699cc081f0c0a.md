- Antisocial personality disorder is one of the best-documented diseases in all of the literature pertaining to psychiatry, including etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, neuroanatomy, heritability, and interventional treatment. However, an established treatment algorithm and specialized psychopharmacology currently fail to exist.

- Better preventative measures are necessary as many of those with ASPD may only be assessed upon incarceration after the harm has already occurred. One is not apt to seek help for ASPD symptomatology. Many only seek assistance for co-occurring mental disorders or only present for court-mandated assessments.

- Even with the remission rates in advanced ages, ASPD causes much turmoil to the patient and the patientâ€™s surrounding community. The lives of those with ASPD remain negatively impacted even after remission.
