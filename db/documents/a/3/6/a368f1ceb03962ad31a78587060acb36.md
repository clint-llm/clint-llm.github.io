Biceps tendon rupture is a relatively common disorder that is chiefly seen in people with repetitive lifting activities. The patient often first presents to the emergency department, urgent care clinic, or primary care provider, including a PA or nurse practitioner. The diagnosis is made by a clinical exam. If the primary clinician is unsure about management, an orthopedic consult is necessary. Distal biceps tear should be promptly referred to orthopedic surgeons as delay in treatment can cause significant proximal retraction of the tendon. Patients should be urged to undergo rehabilitation with a physical and/or occupational therapist for recovery. The interprofessional management of these injuries can include the patient's clinician or mid-level provider, orthopedist/surgeon, nursing staff, and physical therapists, all working collaboratively and communicating openly to optimize patient results.

The nurse should also educate the patient on injury prevention. The key to preventing this injury is to educate the patient on modifying the risk factors such as discontinuation of smoking and stretching before physical activity. After the injury is diagnosed, work-specific or sports-specific training is often recommended before returning to the original activity. For most patients, full recovery is possible within 8Â to 12 weeks.
