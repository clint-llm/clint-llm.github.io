Richard Schatzki was a renowned radiologist who described a ring-like structure in patients with dysphagia in articles from 1953 to 1963, and that structure would later bear his name. Schatzki ring is described as a circular membrane of mucosa and submucosa that is seen at the squamocolumnar junction of the distal esophagus. It appears as a thin membranous structure that does not contain any muscularis propria. It has an upper surface that is covered with squamous epithelium and a lower surface that is covered with columnar epithelium and is always associated with a hiatal hernia.
