The degree of histologic severity of LHB tendon disease states does not correlate with the degree of pathology demonstrated on either MRI or from direct intra-operative inspection. Furthermore, other studies suggest that the duration of symptoms does not correlate with the histologic severity. Also, the more proximal zones of the LHB tendon (i.e., the intra-articular and bicipital groove portions) consistently demonstrate higher histologic grades of tendinopathy compared to tissue specimens examined from more distal LHB tendon zones.

While histologic grading of the severity of tendinopathic changes remains separate from the clinical presentation and MRI- and/or intraoperative findings, there are some noteworthy pathologic patterns associated with increasing grades of severity of tendinopathy.

**Grade 0**

- Tenocytes are normal in appearance

- Myxoid degenerative material not present

- Collagen remains arranged in tight, cohesive bundles

- Blood vessels arranged inconspicuously between collagen bundles

**Grade I**

- Tenocytes are rounded

- Myxoid degenerative material present in small amounts between collagen bundles

- Collagen remains arranged in discrete bundles, but a slight separation between bundles becomes apparent

- Capillary clustering is evident (< 1 cluster per ten high-power fields)

**Grade II**

- Tenocytes are rounded and enlarged

- Myxoid degenerative material evident in moderate to large amounts

- Collagen bundles lose discrete organization as the separation between individual fibers and bundles increases

- Capillary clustering is increased (1 to 2 clusters per ten high-power fields)

**Grade III**

- Tenocytes are rounded and enlarged with abundant cytoplasm and lacuna

- Myxoid degenerative material abundant

- Collagen disorganized, loss of microarchitecture

- Capillary clustering is increased (>2 clusters per ten high-power fields)

**Other changes associated with****tendinopathy**:

- Tenosynovium

- Irrespective of histologic grade of tendinopathy, the surrounding bicipital sheath/synovium demonstrates varying degrees of synovial hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and proliferation

- Low-grade degenerative tendinopathy:

- Total cellularity (cell density, cells/ mm): minimal increase
- Apoptotic index (% relative to the total number of cells counted): minimal increase

- Moderate grade degenerative tendinopathy:

- Total cellularity (cell density, cells/ mm): peak increase
- Apoptotic index (% relative to the total number of cells counted): moderate increase

- Severe grade degenerative tendinopathy:

- Total cellularity (cell density, cells/ mm): decreases
- Apoptotic index (% relative to the total number of cells counted): peak increase

Histologic studies have consistently reported that irrespective of patient age, severity of symptoms, and duration of symptoms, acute inflammatory changes are rarely evident upon histologic specimen analysis.
