Giant congenital melanocytic neviÂ are caused by mutations resulting in the activation of the MAPK pathway. The same mutations are found in their associated neurological melanocytic proliferations. Recent case reports have shown promising results using drugs that block this pathway trough MEK (MAP/ERK kinase) inhibition in neurocutaneous melanosis. Larger trials are needed in order to validate their use.
