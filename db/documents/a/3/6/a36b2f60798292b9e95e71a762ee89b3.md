The treatment of brachial plexitis is conservative, based on analgesia andÂ physiotherapeutic rehabilitation. Analgesia is best achieved with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Some studies have suggested that corticosteroid use early in the disease may reduce pain and weakness recovery time, but their clinical significance is still to be proven. Physiotherapeutic rehabilitation, which may include kinesiotherapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, deep dermal therapy, cryotherapy and/or functional electric stimulation, has been shown to be effective in reducing pain and weakness, as well as in regaining muscle trophism and functional status.
