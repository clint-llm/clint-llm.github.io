The ACL is the most commonly injured ligament in the knee. The annual reported incidence in the United States alone is approximately 1 in 3500 people. However, data may not be accurate as there is no standard surveillance. Most ACL tears occur in athletes by noncontact mechanisms versus contact mechanisms, such as rotational forces versus a direct hit to the knee. The most at-risk athletes for noncontact injury include skiers, soccer players, and basketball players, while the most at-risk athletes for contact injury are football players.
