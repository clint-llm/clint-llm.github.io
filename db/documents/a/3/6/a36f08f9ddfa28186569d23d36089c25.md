Breast reduction surgery, also known as reduction mammoplasty, is a procedure to reduce overall breast volume, maintain nipple-areola viability, and achieve a shape that is aesthetically pleasing. Before deciding if a patient is a candidate for this type of procedure, a detailed medical history, including the age of breast development, previous or anticipated pregnancies or breastfeeding, weight change, smoking history, and overall medical status should be obtained. The family history of breast cancer is important as well. Symptoms relating to breast weight such as the neck, back, and shoulder pain are documented. Thorough preoperative assessment is essential, including a physical examination of size, shape, elasticity, looseness, striae, rashes, bra strap grooving, any asymmetry, masses, and consistency. The position of the nipple-areola complex relative to the inframammary fold is assessed. Measurements are done from the sternal notch to the nipple and nipple to the inframammary fold to assess the degree of vertical correction. It is not uncommon for a patient with severe breast ptosis to present requesting reduction when they require a mastopexy or breast lift. Although reduction mammoplasty and mastopexy are fundamentally different, both operations require similar techniques.
