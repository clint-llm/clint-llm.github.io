The exact age constituting a febrile seizure varies slightly throughout medical literature with 6 months to 60 months (5 years) being a common working definition. Febrile seizures are extremely common, occurring in up to 4% of children in this age group. Some children have a single febrile seizure event, and others have multiple events over early childhood.
