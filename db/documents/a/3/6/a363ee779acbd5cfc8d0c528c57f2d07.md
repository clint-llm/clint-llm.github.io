In varicose vein pathology, two main index events are involved: venous hypertension and valvular incompetence. The mentioned events induce a cascade of immune cells and pro-inflammatory signaling pathways resulting in the consequent venous wall remodeling. However, the opponent's school of thought argues that the venous wall alteration is the index event. Collectively, venous arterialization, smooth muscle cell hypertrophy, and hyperplasia are the histopathological findings in varicose vein disease. Insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-4 may be involved in the mentioned changes.

The mentioned insulin receptor, similar to other receptor proteins of the IRS substrate family, mediates cell signaling from the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor (IGF-1R). Accordingly, insulin and IGF-1 regulate IRS-4 expression. The regulation occurs via the activation of IR/IGF-1R. Consequently, altered IRS-4 expression may be associated with impaired cellular growth and glucose dysmetabolism. Thus, histopathological evaluation of IRS-4 elucidated that IRS-4 overexpression could be served as a prognostic measure and a potential therapeutic target.
