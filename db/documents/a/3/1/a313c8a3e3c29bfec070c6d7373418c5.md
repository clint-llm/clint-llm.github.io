Monitoring for blood gas POCT is also covered in Jacobs et al.'s proposal. Monitoring is conducted via monthly investigation of quality indicators involving proficiency testing, maintenance performance, patient identification, alert value confirmations, and quality control performance. In instances of blood gas readings aside from POCT, teams can implement the same protocol, this time involving the multiple teams included in laboratory-processed samples. These measures would ensure higher confidence that testing is being performed correctly. For example, monitoring blood sample labeling or the laboratory's processing time for blood gases could result in upholding a higher standard of patient care and improved patient data.
