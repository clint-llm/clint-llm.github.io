CHARGE syndrome is an inherited disorder caused by a mutation in the DNA-binding protein-7 CHD7 gene. CHARGE syndrome is an acronym for coloboma, heart disease, atresia of the choanae, retarded growth and mental development, genital anomalies, and ear malformations and hearing loss. CHARGE syndrome can have high morbidity, but the morbidity can be minimized by early diagnosis and treatment. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of CHARGE syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients and counseling families of patients with this syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the etiology and describe the pathophysiology of CHARGE syndrome.
- Outline the typical presentation and most common physical examination findings associated with CHARGE syndrome.
- Summarize the important aspects of medical and surgical management of CHARGE syndrome, including occupational, physical, and speech therapy.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by CHARGE syndrome.
