The impact of central pain disorder affects multiple conditions.

- In rheumatoid arthritis, central pain is associated with neuropathic symptoms, increased pain scores without changes to inflammatory markers, increased adverse outcomes, and reduced remission rates.

- Central sensitization is associated with the increased use of opioids, as well as increased pain severity in patients with osteoarthritis, and is related to poorer patient outcomes.

- Patients with bilateral knee pain are at increased risk for joint pain in areas other than the knees at a one-year follow-up.

- For spondyloarthritis, central sensitization correlates with worse outcomes and disease scores, as well as poorer results in treatment.

- Centralized pain in lupus carries associations with more significant sleep disturbances, mood changes, and worse outcomes.

- In chronic back pain, central pain syndrome causes more significant pain and mood changes, as well as increased adverse outcomes. Joint hypermobility syndrome correlates with increased pain severity and poorer patient outcomes.

- In patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, central pain syndrome is associated with poorer surgical outcomes, while in lateral epicondylitis, it is associated with more severe pain, increased duration of pain, and greater risk of failed treatment responses.

- For chronic whiplash injuries, centralized pain correlates with cognitive disturbances, increased pain, and poorer outcomes.

- Preoperative increases in fibromyalgia pain scores correlated with the administration of moreÂ postoperative morphine equivalents and a reduced response to NSAIDs.
