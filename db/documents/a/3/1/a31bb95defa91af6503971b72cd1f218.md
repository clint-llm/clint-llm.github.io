Care is necessary when operating on or around the ovaries, especially if the patient would like to maintain fertility. Multiple possible emergent surgeries are possible, which include the ovaries, and thus, it is essential to understand the anatomy. Ruptured ectopic pregnancies, ovarian torsions, or emergent cesarean sections are just a few surgeries where ovaries are at higher risk for injury. Ovaries have an abundant blood supply, and thus it is important to control bleeding, or in the case of torsion, that there is the restoration of blood flow before definitive damage occurs to the ovaries.

One of the biggest concerns is the close approximation of different structures to the ovaries. Damage to the bladder, intestines, arterial, or venous system can all have life-altering consequences. For example, an important anatomical structure to be aware of is the bilateral ureters, which typically lay in close approximation to the ovary and its ligaments. Clamping a ureter accidentally during a procedure can lead to dysfunction in the ureter and possible ipsilateral renal failure.
