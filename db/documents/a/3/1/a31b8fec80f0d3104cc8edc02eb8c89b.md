Anginal chest pain, characteristic ECG changes, and rising and/or falling pattern of cardiac troponins suggest ACS. ECG may reveal ST-elevation in transmural ischemia or infarction and T-wave inversion or ST-depression in subendocardial ischemia. An echocardiogram may reveal regional wall motion abnormalities in the involved coronary territory. The patient should be taken to the cardiac catheterization lab upon the diagnosis of ACS.

**Coronary Angiography**

A coronary angiogram is always the initial diagnostic procedure when a patient presents with ACS. The characteristic angiographic appearance of spontaneous coronary artery dissection is the beaded appearance of the coronary artery due to multiple radiolucent lumens with extraluminal contrast staining or near occlusion of the vessel caused by intramural hematoma or dissection flap.

The most common pattern is the stringlike appearance of the segment due to diffuse stenosis (present in about 70% of patients), and the left ventriculogram may show wall motion abnormalities.[Video 1] [Video 2]Coronary angiogram was found to be associated with iatrogenic catheter-induced dissection in about 3% of patients with SCAD.

**Intracoronary Imaging**

Intracoronary imaging modalities like intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrate dissection flaps, intramural hematoma, intimal tear, and true and false lumens. Although intracoronary imaging has a higher spatial resolution than angiogram, its use is only reserved for non-diagnostic angiography.

Limited availability of intravascular imaging systems in the cardiac catheterization labs, risk of worsening dissection, and overall preference for conservative management make catheter-based angiography the first-line diagnostic modality for spontaneous coronary artery dissection.

**Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA)**

CCTA is not performed in the acute setting, and invasive coronary angiography is always the initially performed procedure in ACS.
