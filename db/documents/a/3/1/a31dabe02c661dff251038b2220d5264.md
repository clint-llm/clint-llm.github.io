With the initiation of RRT, the clinical syndrome of uremic encephalopathy improves. This process may occur in days to weeks. The EEG changes take several months to recover and may not return to baseline. Some cognitive changes in the brain may be irreversible. That is one more reason to initiate RRT before the onset of UE. Uremic encephalopathy is typically more severe in patients with acute kidney injury due to the neurotoxicity of nitrogenous solutes and other osmotically active toxins.
