Little League shoulder is the result of excessive rotational and distractional forces that occur with repetitive overhead throwing. This repetitive microtrauma leads to cartilage damage of the proximal humeral epiphysis. It is believed thatÂ the rotational force has a larger role than the distractional force in developing the condition.

The epiphyseal plate is at increased risk for injury because it is weaker than neighboring ligaments. This distinction is significant and explains why this age group is more likely to suffer growth plate injuries, whereas adults would suffer tendon or ligament injuries. The epiphyseal growth cartilage is also at higher risk for injury due to repetitive action than adult cartilage.

Another factor posited to contribute to Little League Shoulder is the angle of humeral retrotorsion. A recent case study suggested a rapid change in the humeral retrotorsion angle may increase susceptibility to growth plate damage.
