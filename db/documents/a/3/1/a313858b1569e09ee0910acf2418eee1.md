Lorazepam can be administered orally (0.5 mg tablet, 1 mg tablet, 2 mg tablet, oral concentrate solution 2 mg/mL, 1 mg extended-release capsule, 2 mg extended-release capsule, and 3 mg extended-release capsule). In addition, it can be administered via intravenous(IV) or intramuscular(IM) injection (2 mg/mL solution and 4 mg/mL solution). The onset of its action is 1 to 3 minutes if administered IV and 15 to 30 minutes if administered IM.

**Anxiety Disorder**

The initial starting dose is 2 to 3 mg orally; repeat the dose 2 to 3 times per day; the maximum recommended dosage is 10 mg daily.

**Insomnia Due to Anxiety or Stress**

In patients under 65 years of age, the dose is 0.5 to 2 mg orally at bedtime, and in patients over 65 years of age, the dose is reduced to 0.5 to 1 mg at bedtime.

**Premedication for Anesthesia**

If given IM, the dose is 0.05 mg/kg administered 2 hours before surgery (maximum dose 4 mg). If administered IV, the dose is 0.044 mg/kg, administered 15 to 20 minutes before surgery (maximum dose 4 mg). In patients older than 50 years of age, the maximum dosage is 2 mg.

**Status Epilepticus**

Administered IV, the dose is 0.1 mg/kg (maximum dose 4 mg), at a maximum rate of 2 mg per minute; may repeat in 5 to 10 minutes. Note: Must dilute dose with 1:1 saline.        According to American Epilepsy Society guidelines, parenteral lorazepam is one of the first-line treatments for convulsive status epilepticus.

**Agitation in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Patient**(off-label use)

An IV Loading dose is 0.02 to 0.04 mg/kg (maximum single dose 2 mg); the Maintenance dose is 0.02 to 0.06 mg/kg every 2 to 6 hours as needed or 0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg per hour with a maximum dosing of less than 10 mg per hour.

**Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium**(off-label use)

IV dose is 1 to 4 mg every 5 to 15 minutes until the patient is calm; can repeat every hour as needed. IM dose is 1 to 4 mg every 30 to 60 minutes until the patient is calm; can repeat every hour as needed.

**Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome**(off-label use)

According to ASAM (American Society of Addiction Medicine) clinical practice guidelines, lorazepam is one of the most frequently used drugs for managing alcohol withdrawal. The symptom-triggered regimen can be administered orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously at 2 mg to 4 mg per hour as needed; the severity assessment scale must determine the dose. The fixed-dose regimen can be administered orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously at 2 mg every 6 hours for four doses, followed by 1 mg every 6 hours for eight additional doses. Note: Symptom-triggered regimen is preferable to the fixed-dose regimens; lower doses and shorter treatment duration are in order. Lorazepam is preferred in patients with cirrhosis.

**Chemotherapy-associated Nausea and Vomiting**(off-label use)

Lorazepam is used for breakthrough nausea/vomiting or adjunct to standard antiemetics. It can be given orally, intravenously, or sublingually at 0.5 to 2 mg every 6 hours as needed.

**Psychogenic Catatonia**(off-label use)

IM dose is 1 mg to 2 mg; clinicians can repeat the dose in 3 hours and then again in another 3 hours if the initial and subsequent doses are ineffective. It can be administered orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously; initially, 1 mg and may be repeated in 5 minutes if necessary. If the initial challenge is unsuccessful, one may increase the dose to 4 to 8 mg daily and continue treatment for up to 5 days.

**Vertigo**(off-label use)

According to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery((AAO-HNS), lorazepam (1-2 mg every 8 hours) is preferred when a rapid onset of action is required to relieve vertigo in Meniere's disease.

**Use in Specific Population**

**Pregnancy Considerations:**It is pregnancy category D medicine. There are documented case reports and case-control studies showing an increased risk for cleft palate and cleft lip using lorazepam and other benzodiazepines in the first trimester. Third-trimester use of lorazepam and benzodiazepine is associated with an increased risk of causing neonatal withdrawal symptoms. If lorazepam needs to be used during pregnancy, it should be used with extreme caution, and the benefit has to outweigh the risk.

**Breastfeeding Considerations:**Lorazepam is found in low levels of breast milk. Studies report that it does not cause adverse reactions in breastfed babies with standard maternal dosages.

**Hepatic Impairment:**Product labeling does not have information on using lorazepam in patients with hepatic impairment. As discussed above, lorazepam can be used cautiously in patients with hepatic impairment.

**Renal Impairment:**Manufacturers recommend precautions in case of using frequent doses of lorazepam over relatively short periods in patients with renal disease. According to a review, if benzodiazepines are required, lorazepam is a reasonable first-line choice for patients with ESRD.

**Potentially Inappropriate Medication (PIM) in Older Adults:**According to the American Geriatric Society Beers Criteria, lorazepam is identified as a potentially inappropriate medication for older adults. Older patients have increased sensitivity to benzodiazepines and decreased clearance. Patients have an increased risk of cognitive impairment, falls, and fractures. However, using lorazepam may be reasonable for patients with seizure disorders, alcohol withdrawal, severe generalized anxiety disorder, and periprocedural sedation.
