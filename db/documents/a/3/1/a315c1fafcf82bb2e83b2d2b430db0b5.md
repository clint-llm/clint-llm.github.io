Wound healing is a critical physiological process to maintain the integrity of the skin as a mechanical barrier after trauma. It can be generally divided into hemostatic, inflammatory, proliferative, and remodeling phases. Complex wounds classically arrest in the inflammatory phase without further progression. Many factors can lead to this, including poor systemic conditions or poor local tissue environments such as vascular compromise or infection. Proper understanding of the healing process is essential when addressing any complex wound. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of complex wounds and highlights the importance of the interprofessional team approach when evaluating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the basic concepts of wound healing and discuss factors that affect the healing process.
- Explain how to evaluate patients presenting with complex wounds.
- Describe the current practice in the treatment of complex wounds.
- Outline the management by an interprofessional team in dealing with complex wounds.
