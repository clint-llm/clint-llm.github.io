Heart failure divides into four stages, according to the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guidelines

Stage A- At high risk for HF but no structural heart disease or symptoms of HF

Stage B- Asymptomatic LV dysfunction: structural heart disease but no symptoms or signs of HF

Stage C- Overt HF: structural heart disease with symptoms of HF

Stage D- Refractory HF.

Symptoms of HF are only in stages C and D.

**Classifications**

New York Heart Association ( NYHA) classifies HF based on HF symptoms and functional limitations intoÂ four classes

Class I: asymptomatic LV dysfunction with no limitations on physical activity or symptoms.

Class II: mild symptoms with slight limitation of physical activity. Ordinary activities lead to symptoms.

Class III: moderate symptoms with marked limitation of physical activity. Less than ordinary activities lead to symptoms.

Class IV: severe symptoms at rest.
