Monitor renal function (BUN/Cr every 1 to 2 days based on the stability of renal function), Ins and Outs (daily), hearing parameters (baseline and weekly audiograms), symptoms of vertigo/dizziness (daily), peak concentrations (conventional dosing, no need in once-daily dosing) and trough concentrations (both conventional and once-daily dosing, repeat every 2 to 3 days and prolong if plasma concentrations are stable.

**Conventional Dosing Concentrations**

- Obtain peak concentrations (1 hr after the start of a 30 min infusion) after 24 hrs or four half-lives

- Obtain trough concentrations (30 min before the next scheduled dose) again after

**Goal Concentrations**

Peak:

- Serious infection: 20 to 25 mg/dL

- Life-Threatening infection: 25 to 30 mg/dL

Trough:

- Serious infection: 1 to 4 mg/dL

- Life-Threatening infection: 4 to 8 mg/dL

**Once Daily Dosing Concentrations:**

- Monitor after the initial dose, no need to wait for four half-lives

- Clinicians can use the Hartford nomogram (multiply drug concentration scale by a factor of 2 to use) to estimate the appropriateness of the once-daily dosing (ODD) regimen.

- Recommend confirmatory trough concentration 30 min before the next scheduled dose if using the nomogram: less than 2.5 mg/dL (goal trough with ODD)
