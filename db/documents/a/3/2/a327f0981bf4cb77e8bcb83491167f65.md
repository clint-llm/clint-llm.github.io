In obstructive azoospermia, spermatogenesis is often normal. However, the exact pathology of non-obstructive azoospermia is often idiopathic.

Non-obstructive azoospermia may be due to several causes.

- Androgen insensitivity

- Chemotherapy

- Congenital absence of germ cells (Sertoli cell-only syndrome)

- Heavy metal exposure

- Hyperprolactinemia

- Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, as in Kallmann syndrome

- Impaired sperm production due to chromosomal abnormalities as in Klinefelter syndrome or Y chromosome microdeletions of subregions AZFa, AZFb, or AZFc

- Infections such as mumps and orchitis

- Radiation therapy (Experimentally, epsilon aminocaproic acid has been shown to protect sperm DNA from radiation damage, but this has not yet been approved for clinical practice.)

- Spermatogenic (maturation) arrest

- Testicular torsion

- Translocation or inversion of azoospermia factor cryptorchidism

- Varicoceles

Etiological classification according to pretesticular, testicular, and post-testicular causes:

**Pretesticular Causes**(Secondary testicular failure)

**Testicular Causes**

**Post Testicular Causes**

- They are endocrinal abnormalities related to the hypothalamus, pituitary, and male gonads (testes)

- Usually involves disorders related to spermatogenesis.

- They include causes leading to ductal obstruction at any site in the male reproductive tract.

- Treatment improves fertility outcomes.

- Treatment doesn’t generally improve fertility outcomes as the disorders are typically irreversible.

- Treatment improves fertility outcomes.
