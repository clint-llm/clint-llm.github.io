The pharmacologic agents frequently used for sphenopalatine ganglion block are local anesthetics (4% cocaine, 2% to 4% lidocaine, or 0.5% bupivacaine), depot steroids, or 6% phenol.

For the intranasal approach, a cotton tip applicator or catheter is needed. There are 3 approved SPGB devices. There is a void in the literature regarding the efficacy and tolerability of the two of them. These catheters are both inserted along the anterior nasal passage and are placed superior to the middle nasal turbinate.

For the infra-zygomatic approach, a 10 cm curved blunt 20 or 22 gauge needle is preferred. Alternatively, a 22 or 25-gauge 3.5-inch short-bevel needle with the distal tip bent to a 15-degree angle may be used. Additionally, a C-arm and 0.5Â to 1 mL of nonionic, water-soluble contrast are needed.

The transoral approach requires a curved dental needle.
