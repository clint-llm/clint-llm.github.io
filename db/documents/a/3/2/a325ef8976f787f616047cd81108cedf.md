Evaluation of the nail with onychoscopy should be performed for disorders of pigmentation, infection, inflammatory diseases, connective tissue diseases, tumors, and trauma, as detailed below:

**Pigmentation**

The archetypal lesion of pigmentation is longitudinal melanonychia, where pigmentation is usually located in the nail plate longitudinally, though it can be transverse. Melanonychia is first evaluated by establishing if the pigment is melanotic or non-melanotic (e.g., blood). Next, if melanotic, it must be determined if the etiology is matrical melanocytic activation or proliferation; if determined to be due to proliferation, it must be established as either benign or malignant.

Melanocytic activation is common in darker skin types and various conditions, such as lichen planus, drug-related (e.g., antimalarials), postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, traumatic melanonychia, or as part of a benign pigmentary lesion (e.g., lentigo).

Malignant melanocytic proliferation (e.g., nail matrix melanoma) often demonstrates a brown or black band that may show irregularities in color, parallelism, spacing, and thickness; melanoma may also present as diffuse darkness with barely visible lines, and variability in hues may point out the possibility of melanoma.

Non-melanotic pigmentation is usually due to subungual hematoma or infection. Subungual hematoma has reddish-purple to black lesions with well-circumscribed reddish dots or streaks at the distal edge in the acute phase and splinter hemorrhages with a linear pattern in the chronic phase.

Leukonychia must be classified as true, apparent, or pseudo-leukonychia. In true leukonychia, altered keratinization of the distal nail matrix produces white pigmentation in the nail plate, whereas the discoloration originates in the nail bed in apparent leukonychia and has an external origin in pseudo-leukonychia. True leukonychia from repetitive trauma often presents with transverse or punctate white marks that move distally as the nail.

A white discoloration of the lunula is typical of proximal subungual onychomycosis.

**Infections**

Onychoscopy plays an important role in diagnosing onychomycosis; after all, onychoscopic-guided sampling can help provide the best yield for microbiologic evaluation.

Onycholysis is often seen in onychomycosis as a jagged nail plate edge with intermittent spikes, but onycholysis can have other causes, such as nail psoriasis and trauma.

Although often presenting as a white-yellow streak, onychomycosis can present as longitudinal or transverse melanonychia, where fungal colonies clump into pigmented granules in the bands.

Subungual hyperkeratosis is also seen in onychomycosis,****corresponding to the indented and crumbled areas.

**Inflammatory Diseases**

Onychoscopy has markedly improved the visualization of minute features in nail psoriasis.

Onycholysis has a distinct erythematous or bright yellow-orange border at the proximal end of the onycholytic band, which is relatively straight. In psoriasis, pitting of the nails and splinter hemorrhages have been observed as the most common feature, followed by onycholysis.

Onychoscopic examination of the proximal nail fold shows reduced mean capillary and capillary architecture alterations in the form of coiled capillaries and dropouts. On onychoscopic examination of the hyponychium, irregularly distributed, elongated, tortuous, and dilated capillaries, similar to those seen in psoriasis of the skin, are observed. The capillary density correlates with the severity of disease and treatment response directly. In some cases, the capillaries, which appear as red dots, can be visible on the proximal nail fold.

Rheumatoid arthritis has been observed to have tortuous capillaries with dilated loops and a normal number of capillaries and without hemorrhagic spots, though one study does report findings of angiogenesis being common.

**Connective Tissue Diseases**

Connective tissue diseases benefit from onychoscopy in the evaluation of nail fold capillaries. Capillaroscopy may also serve as a valuable tool in systemic diseases for predicting the development of visceral complications and digital ulceration.

In systemic sclerosis, the nail fold capillary destruction occurs secondary to vasculopathy and microangiopathy.

In systemic lupus erythematosus, prominent subpapillary plexus with tortuous capillaries is seen.

In dermatomyositis, nail fold capillaries are grossly enlarged with tortuous, dilated capillary loops and multiple hemorrhagic spots; prognostically, this finding correlates with myalgias and arthralgias.

**Tumors**

Onychopapilloma is a benign neoplasm of the distal matrix/proximal nail bed. Onychoscopy shows a band of longitudinal erythronychia from the lunula to the distal margin, often associated with splinter hemorrhages.

A glomus tumor is a benign vascular hamartoma of the glomus body arising from the thermoregulatory smooth muscle cells.

Onychomatricoma is a rare matrix tumor that is usually benign and presents with a classical tetrad of ungual hyperkeratosis, splinter hemorrhages, xanthonychia, and overcurvature of the nail plate, both transversely and longitudinally; on dermoscopy it often has parallel lateral edges, nail pitting, thickening of the free edge, dark dots, splinter hemorrhages, and longitudinal parallel white lines.

Pyogenic granuloma, on onychoscopy, shows a vascular pattern with reddish discoloration and regular vessels (which appear as dots at low magnification and lines at higher magnification) with a milky red veil.

**Trauma**

Nail tic disorders, such as onychotillomania, show characteristic features like the absence of the nail plate with multiple obliquely oriented nail bed hemorrhages, gray pigmentation of the nail bed, and the presence of wavy lines—uneven longitudinal pigmented lines in different planes due to uneven or absent nail plate growth after recurring trauma.
