Formation of the eye in the human embryo begins approximately three weeks into embryonic development and continues through the tenth week. Cells from both the ectodermal and the mesodermal tissues contribute to its development. Specifically, the eye is derived from the neuroepithelium, the surface ectoderm, and the extracellular mesenchyme which consists of both the neural crest and mesoderm. Neuroepithelium forms the retina, ciliary body, iris, and optic nerves. Surface ectoderm forms the lens, corneal epithelium, and eyelid. The extracellular mesenchyme forms the sclera, the corneal endothelium, stroma, blood vessels, muscles, and vitreous.
