The route of administration available in opioid use is diverse and includes oral, enteral, transdermal, subcutaneous, epidural, intrathecal, aerosolized, and intravenous. The primary route of administration for an opioid anesthetic is intravenous in either repeat injections or continuous infusion. Mixtures of local anesthetic and opioids in an intrathecal approach are also useful for select cases.

Opioid agents chosen for anesthesia include more commonly known drugs like fentanyl, morphine, and hydromorphone, as well as drugs that are only used intraoperatively by anesthesiologists, like sufentanil, remifentanil, and alfentanil, which are significantly more potent than morphine.
