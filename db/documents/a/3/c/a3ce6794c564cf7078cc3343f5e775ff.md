The history and physical examination of a patient with duodenal injury are generally nonspecific. The trauma evaluation will always start with an effective primary survey, including airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure. At this point, a secondary survey will be performed to include a head-to-toe injury inventory and examination. This secondary survey will also involve obtaining an “AMPLE” history, including allergies, medications, past medical history, last oral intake, and events leading to the presentation.

Physical examination in relation to possible duodenal trauma is primarily related to the abdomen. This abdominal examination starts with an inspection to evaluate for distention, seat-belt signs, ecchymosis, lacerations, penetrating wounds, and possible evisceration. With penetrating wounds, the number and location of wounds should be noted. Although the classic abdominal examination then proceeds into auscultation, this step has less benefit in the setting of acute abdominal trauma and is often not performed.

The next steps in examining the abdomen are percussion and palpation to evaluate for tympany and peritoneal signs.

History largely relates to the events around the trauma, such as the mechanism of injury. Symptoms such as abdominal pain, pain radiating to the back, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or hematemesis could all be related to injury of the duodenum.
