The presence of paraspinal edema in non-contrast MRI has been observed to have the highest sensitivity (97%) for SEA compared to psoas (54%), bone marrow (65%), and disc edema (66%), respectively.

A plain roentgenograph or CT may reveal a narrowing of the disk and bone lysis.

The necrotic center being avascular gives the characteristic ring-enhancing pattern.

Serum ESR >30 mm/hr and a serum CRP >10 mg/L has sensitivity of >95% in SEA.

The CSF analysis only reveals features of parameningeal inflammation showing increased proteins and pleocytosis.

Recent advances in nuclear imaging such as Indium-biotin scans and F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography show increased uptake.

Myelography is no longer recommended.

CSF cultures are positive only in 25% of cases, and due to concurrent risks of meningitis or subdural infection, they are now only recommended during myelography only.

Blood cultures or CT-guided needle aspiration have high yields.

Open or minimally invasive procedures cultures positivity in almost 78.8Â to 90.5% of cases.
