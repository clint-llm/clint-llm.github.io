Albendazole is one of the most used antiparasitic drugs used throughout the world due to its low cost and high efficacy. Most of the time, this drug is well-tolerated with very few side effects; however, this drug should not be used without physician monitoring or approval due to the risk of severe side effects such as pancytopenia; this effort requires an interprofessional team. Patients with liver dysfunction require regular liver function tests and monitoring due to the increased risk of side effects. [Level 3]

Pharmacists can make a significant contribution to the care of patients taking albendazole by creating the proper formulation for the patient to administer. For example, patients with high aspiration risks or swallowing dysmotility can benefit from oral suspensions, and children can benefit from dissolved tablets or oral suspensions as well to increase their adherence to drug therapy. They can also check for potential drug-drug interactions and serve as a point of patient counsel about the medication and how to take it.

For patients with neurologic involvement, ophthalmologists can observe potential retinal progression and resolution of the disease. Infectious disease specialists can coordinate care with primary care providers to ensure proper infection treatment. Nurses are integral in the treatment process as they are often the direct interface with the patient and can obtain information regarding medication side effects and patient adherence. With interprofessional management and monitoring, albendazole therapy has its best chance of achieving positive patient outcomes. [Level 5]
