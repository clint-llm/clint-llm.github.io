Basic labs such as complete blood count, metabolic panel, coagulation panel, and urinalysis should be obtained as part of the trauma work-up. Retrograde cystography, either computed tomography (CT) or conventional X-ray, is indicated for hemodynamically stable patients with gross hematuria, blood at the meatus, inability to void, pelvic fracture with microscopic hematuria, or penetrating injury to the pelvis, buttock, or lower abdomen. Conventional X-ray and CT cystography have similar sensitivity and specificity. Intravenous contrast CT scan with a delayed phase is less sensitive and specific than retrograde cystography in detecting bladder trauma.
