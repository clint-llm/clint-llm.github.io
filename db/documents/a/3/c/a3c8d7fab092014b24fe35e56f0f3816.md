Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is a member of the epidermal growth factor family of tyrosine kinase receptors. This family includes HER1(Erb1), HER3 ( Erb3), and HER4 (Erb4) besides HER2. HER receptors are essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival.

All HER proteins share common structural features, including extracellular ligand-binding domain and transmembrane domain, and intracellular protein tyrosine kinase domain.

Activation of HER2 mediated signaling pathways occurs by heterodimerization with ligand-activated EGFR or HER3 or by homodimerization when it is present in high concentrations such as in cancer. These dimerizations would lead to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, which initiates downstream signaling cascades such as PI3K/AKT signaling cascade, Ras/MEK/ERK, and JAK/STAT, that regulate cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, motility, apoptosis, survival, invasion, migration, adhesion, and angiogenesis.

Observation shows that HER3 plays an essential role in HER2- mediated oncogenic signaling.

HER2 containing heterodimers have the highest mitogenic potential among all HER complexes. Between all HER2 pairs, HER2/HER3 heterodimer is the most potent activator of the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade via binding of the p85 subunit of PI3K to HER3.
