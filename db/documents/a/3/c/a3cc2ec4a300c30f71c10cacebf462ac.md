Pulsus paradoxus is not a disease state. It is a physiologic manifestation of an underlying disease process and treatment should address the underlying pathology. If cardiac tamponade is suspected and pulsus paradoxus is present, consideration should be made for urgent or emergent pericardiocentesis. An exception to this would be pericardial effusion secondary to aortic dissection or myocardial rupture; these patients require emergency surgical intervention.
