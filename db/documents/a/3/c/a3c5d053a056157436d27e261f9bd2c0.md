No pathognomonic signs exist for trichinosis. Symptoms of Trichinella depend on the current stage of infection. During the enteral (intestinal) phase, the initial symptoms are mild transient diarrhea and nausea (from the intestinal invasion of the larvae), vomiting, upper abdominal pain, low-grade fever, and malaise. These begin 1-2 days after ingestion of infected meat. From 2-6 weeks after ingestion, intestinal symptoms disappear, and symptoms from the parenteral stage (skeletal muscle) appear. They include but are not limited to periorbital or facial edema, diffuse myalgia, and a paralysis-like state. The severity of disease is in correlation with the number of larvae ingested.
