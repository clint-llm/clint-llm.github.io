While most of the population can respond to a typical hearing test in which they respond to sounds presented to different ears, a proportion of the population cannot respond due to lack of speech development (infants), disease, or trauma. A more universal test is the auditory brainstem response (ABR). This test does not require patient feedback. It records the summed changes in the electrical activity of auditory areas within the brainstem in response to auditory cues. Variations in activity from normal values show evidence for auditory dysfunction. Because the test shows values for multiple auditory nuclei, it also provides data for physicians to isolate regions of trauma or disease.
