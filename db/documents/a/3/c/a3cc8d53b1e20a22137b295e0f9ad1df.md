Once the koilonychia has been diagnosed, the nail can become more blanched and spoon-shaped if the underlying disease is not being treated. How quickly the spoon nails return to normalcy, usually depends on the underlying cause. If they are related to anemia, the nails seem normal within 4–6 months of increasing the iron intake. Patients with PVS have an excellent outcome but are at an increased risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx or upper esophagus. Hence, patients with PVS should be screened for aerodigestive tract carcinoma. The toenails grow out much slower than the fingernails and may take a year and a half to regrow compared to half a year by the fingernail.
