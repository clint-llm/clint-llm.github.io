Patients with HTC display a spectrum of signs and symptoms. Moreover, there is a significant heterogeneity reported in the clinical profile of patients with similar biochemical reports.

**Tumoral Calcinosis**

The most common presentation in such patients is painful calcified masses, particularly in peri-articular regions exposed to repetitive trauma/pressure.

Such calcifications have also been found incidentally in small and large vessels, including carotids, coronary, iliac, and aorta.

**Hyperostosis and Inflammatory Symptoms**

Many patients present with recurring bony pains, particularly involving tibia bones, but also reported in ulna, radius, and metacarpals. On examination, localized tenderness, redness, increased local temperature are noted, mimicking features of osteomyelitis.

**Dental Involvement**

Teeth are involved very commonly in HTC. The various dental defects reported include pulp chamber obliteration, pulp stones, shortening of roots with bulbous enlargement in the middle, and enamel changes. Besides, a peculiar thistle shape of roots has been described. Also, the roots have often been found curved, a process called dilaceration. These dental changes are most commonly seen in premolar teeth.

**Eye Involvement**

In HTC, calcific deposits have been described in eyelids, conjunctiva, and cornea. Such deposits may cause eye discomfort and itching. Calcification has also been reported in the elastin-rich membrane between the retina and choroid.
