Laboratory studies are usually unremarkable unless mass effect causes compression of critical organs and causes laboratory abnormalities (E.g., compression of the ureter can lead to renal failure), or the disease is fairly advanced to cause subtle lab abnormalities (anemia of chronic disease, elevated sedimentation rate, etc.). However, no lab abnormality can specifically point towards a diagnosis of AS.

Advanced imaging like CT scan, MRI, or PET scan is required to define the anatomy of the tumor and the extent of spread.

The final diagnosis is established via biopsy and histopathology.
