Urinary retention isÂ the inability to pass urine and can be acute or chronic. Although uncommon in women compared to men, it can still lead to significant issues of permanent bladder damage, renal deterioration, stones, infections, and Foley catheter dependency when not recognized and treated early. Patients should speak with their doctors if they have any issues with urination, such as dribbling of urine intermittently, a foul smell of urine, a feeling of incomplete emptying, hesitancy, etc. Checking a post-void residual urine volume with either a straight catheterization or ultrasound can quickly establish or eliminate a diagnosis of urinary retention.
