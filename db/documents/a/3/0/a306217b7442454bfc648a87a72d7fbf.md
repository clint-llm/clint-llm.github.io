Hepatobiliary scintigraphy evaluates the function of hepatocytes, patency, and integrity of the biliary ducts, gallbladder contractility, and sphincter of Oddi function. The following conditions can be evaluated using a hepatobiliary scintigraphy exam:

- Acute cholecystitis (calculous and acalculous)

- Chronic gallbladder disease (aka functional gallbladder disease or chronic cholecystitis)

- Biliary leak

- Biliary obstruction (to include stent patency and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction)

- Biliary atresia

Acute cholecystitis is one of the most common clinical indications for HBS exams.

A biliary leak can be seen following damage to the biliary system and is most common after cholecystectomy, liver procedures such as wedge resection or segmentectomy/lobectomy, transplantation, as well as hepatic trauma.

Biliary obstruction is seen in multiple scenarios to include choledocholithiasis, stricture, biliary or pancreatic tumor, and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SODD).

Biliary atresia is a rare congenital disorder which can cause irreversible liver damage if not surgically corrected within the first 2 to 3 months of life. This surgery is a stop-gap measure allowing the child to grow and ultimately receive liver transplantation. HBS can be extremely useful for differentiating it from severe neonatal hepatitis which may cause a similar presentation of neonatal jaundice.
