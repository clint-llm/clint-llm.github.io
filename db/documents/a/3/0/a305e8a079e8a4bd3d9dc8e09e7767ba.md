Cyanocobalamin is a medication used to manage and treat vitamin B12 deficiencies. Chemically it belongs to a class called "corrinoids," and it is a crystallizable cobalt complex. The name cyanocobalamin derives from the cyanide group attached to the molecule. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for cyanocobalamin as a valuable agent in managing vitamin B12 deficiencies and other off-label uses (and other applicable disorders). In addition, this activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with such conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of cyanocobalamin.
- Describe the mechanism of action of cyanocobalamin.
- Outline the potential adverse effects of cyanocobalamin therapy.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration amongst physicians, nurse practitioners, nutritionists, and specialists like hematologists, gastroenterologists, geriatricians, and others in evaluating cyanocobalamin therapy.
