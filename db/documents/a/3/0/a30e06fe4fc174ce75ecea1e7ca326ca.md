In the US, the mortality from post-abortion complications has dropped significantly chiefly because illegal abortions are not performed to a high extent. In addition, most emergency department triage systems have streamlined the process of managing acutely ill patients immediately. However, delay in treatment can lead to septic shock which does carry a high mortality. The other factor that has lowered mortality is patient education on when to seek help following an abortion.
