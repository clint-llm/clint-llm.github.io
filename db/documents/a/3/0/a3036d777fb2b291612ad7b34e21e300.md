This activity highlights the pathophysiology of stress hyperglycemia, the role of various anti-diabetic medications, the optimal glycemic targets, and the importance of an interprofessional team approach in providing enhanced care to these patients during the perioperative period.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the roles of history-taking, glycated hemoglobin A1c and antihyperglycemic drugs (oral, non-insulin injectable, and insulin) in the perioperative period.
