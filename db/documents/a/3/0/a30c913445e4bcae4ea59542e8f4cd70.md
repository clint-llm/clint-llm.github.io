Diagnosis of atrial arrhythmias is reliant on detection. Cardiac telemetry must be used judiciously and appropriately monitored. Healthcare professionals should understand the indications for initiating and discontinuing cardiac telemetry. Appropriate personnel should monitor telemetry and obtain 12-lead ECGâ€™s to aid in the diagnosis of dysrhythmia when they occur.

Proper management of atrial tachycardia requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level V]
