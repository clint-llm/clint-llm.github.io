Treatment is largely supportive and involves discontinuation of all serotonergic therapies, control of agitation with benzodiazepines and defervescence.

In severe cases of serotonin toxicity where patients required endotracheal intubation and ventilatory support, hypertonicity, rigidity, and high-grade fever were evident.

Muscular rigidity is thought to be the primary cause of hyperthermia and death so patients with severe symptoms should be rapidly cooled. If benzodiazepines do not sufficiently control muscle spasm or temperature is greater than 41.1 C, intubation with neuromuscular blockade and paralysis can be considered.
