Patients should be encouraged to continue stretching and range-of-motion exercises with a home exercise program following physical therapy treatment. The patient should be deterred from sedentary activities or prolonged joint immobilization. Reducing physical labor and exercise to light activity for pain avoidance is acceptable. However, full activity restriction is not the proper recommendation. There are no weight bearing precautions for this condition.
