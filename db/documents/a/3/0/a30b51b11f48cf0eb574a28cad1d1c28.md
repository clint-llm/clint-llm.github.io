Esophageal reconstruction requires a multidisciplinary approach to treatment. Patients will likely be evaluated by several types of doctors, including hospitalists, cardiologists, oncologists, radiation oncologists, thoracic surgeons, general surgeons, and plastic surgeons. Besides physicians, these patients may need to meet with physical therapists, occupational therapists, dietitians, and even psychologists. They will also be cared for by numerous nurses, care managers, and ancillary staff. Every member of the team is required to care for these patients after esophageal reconstruction.
