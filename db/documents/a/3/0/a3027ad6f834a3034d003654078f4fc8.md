The prognosis after an HPV infection is good, but recurrences are common. Even though there are many treatments for warts, none works well, and most patients require repeated treatments. The HPV infection can also result in vulvar intraepithelial dysplasia, cervical dysplasia, and cervical cancer. Some women remain at high risk for developing vaginal and anal cancer. The risk of malignant transformation is highest in immunocompromised individuals. Finally, when a patient has been diagnosed with HPV infection, there is a 5-20% risk of having other STDs like gonorrhea and/or chlamydia.
