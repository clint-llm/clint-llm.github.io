Hypoaldosteronism in children is rare, but proper and timely recognition can be life-saving. Many advances have elucidated the mechanisms in the etiology, pathophysiology, genetics, evaluation, and management of HA, and a better understanding of these concepts will help reduce morbidity and mortality.

HA can occur isolated or as part of generalized adrenal failure.

In infancy, the presentation is often dramatic with a salt-wasting crisis; older children present with failure to thrive or poor growth. A high index of suspicion is required in children with hyperkalemia but a negative CAH screen. Hyperkalemia in the absence of renal insufficiency may indicate the presence of hypoaldosteronism.

ALD synthase deficiency is treated with NaCl and fludrocortisone and has a good prognosis, PHA AD and PHA AR are resistant to fludrocortisone, the former has a good prognosis while in the latter the outcome is poor due to generalized disease.

Identification of high-risk patients will aid better management of post-adrenalectomy complications in Conn syndrome.

The knowledge that various medications, including over the counter and alternative medicines cause HA, will improve patient outcomes.

High-risk patients with diabetes and mild renal dysfunction are prone to type 4 RTA. Care is required in diligently avoiding medications like potassium-sparing diuretics and NSAIDs and trimethoprim.
