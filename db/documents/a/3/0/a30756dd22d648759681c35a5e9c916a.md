When possible, having an assistant present during the procedure is helpful. However, the well-prepared and well-practiced clinician can place a central venous catheter with little to no assistance. It is also recommended that the performer of the procedure, have a second team member (i.e nurse) confirm the removal of the wire from the patient and document this in the nursing charts to match the physician charting.
