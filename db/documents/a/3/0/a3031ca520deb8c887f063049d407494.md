Understanding how to accurately and effectively diagnose acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a primary focus in hospitalized patients as the sequela of VTE including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), are of the most common preventable causes of hospital deaths, and their complications are a source of substantial long-term morbidity.

Phlegmasia is a term that has been used to describe extreme cases of lower extremity DVT, which may progress to critical limb ischemia and potentially limb loss. This entity was first described by Fabricius Hildanius in the 16 century, and then in 1938, it was Gregoire who coined the term phlegmasia cerulea dolens translating to “painful blue inflammation,” differentiating it from the more commonly seen phlegmasia alba dolens or “painful white inflammation.”
