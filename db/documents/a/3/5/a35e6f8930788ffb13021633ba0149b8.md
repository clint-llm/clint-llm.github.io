CVI is part of the group of "cystic persistent primitive structures" of brain midline as theÂ absence of septum pellucidum(ASP), the cavum septi pellucidi (CSP), and the cavum vergae (CV).

These cystic structures are present during the brain's developmental process in the embryonic period, and they regress between the seventh month of intrauterine life and the second year of postnatal life. They are normal findings during fetal life, but they persist in a certain proportion of the adult population.

These cerebral cavities do not have ependymal coverage, and they do not have a lining of choroid plexus cells. They are in direct communications with the subarachnoid space, and the ventricular system separates them, so they cannot be considered part of the ventricular system.

CVI is an anatomic variation originating from a protrusion of the pia mater into the primitive neural tube during the third fetal month.
