Upper eyelid blepharoplasty, whether performed for cosmetic or functional reasons, is one of the most common operations performed on the face. Eyes and eyelids are the central features of the face that are seen by others and by patients every time they look into a mirror. We also converse with others looking from eye-to-eye. This explains the popularity of products designed for use on eyebrows, eyelids, and eyelashes. This activity describes the indications and contraindications for upper eyelid blepharoplasty and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating patients prior to the surgery.
