Morphea is a rare skin disorder that can affect both children and adults with equal frequency. Autoimmune dysregulation plays a role in the etiology of morphea, but patients should be educated about external factors like trauma, radiation, and friction in morphea. Genetic predisposition is considered to play a role in etiology, and studies show that family members of morphea are at higher risk of other autoimmune diseases.

Patient education helps them to make informed decisions about the treatment options and prognosis of morphea. Patients who are being prescribed medications like corticosteroids, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil should be referred for pharmacy education about common side effects, contraception and medication interactions to improve compliance.
