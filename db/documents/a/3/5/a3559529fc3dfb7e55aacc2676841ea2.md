The TORCH infections include causative organisms Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, HSVÂ 1 and 2, hepatitis B virus, HIV, and others like syphilis, parvovirus, and varicella. Transmission of the pathogens may occur prenatally by the transplacental route, perinatally by blood or vaginal secretions. Postnatal infections tend to be less impactful. Others, such as HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis, can be transmitted via sexual contact to a susceptible mother. Rubella and varicella can be prevented by properly immunizing mothers.
