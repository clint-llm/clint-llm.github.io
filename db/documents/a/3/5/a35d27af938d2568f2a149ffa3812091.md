Tiotropium maintenance therapy has well-established benefits for treating chronic obstructive lung disease. Mortality in chronic obstructive lung disease is often due to complications, including hyperinflation, decreased exercise tolerance, pulmonary infections, and chronic obstructive lung disease exacerbations. Tiotropium has been extensively studied in clinical trials and proven to prevent the progression of obstructive lung disease and these complications. This activity reviews the indications and contraindications, adverse effects, and monitoring of tiotropium. This activity also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in collaborating to manage patients who are using tiotropium.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of tiotropium.
- Describe contraindications to tiotropium use.
- Review tiotropium toxicity.
- Outline working relationships among interprofessional healthcare providers to promote the safe use of tiotropium and promote medication adherence.
