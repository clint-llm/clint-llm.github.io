The confirmed case of tropical pulmonary eosinophiliaÂ is treated with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) for 21 days. DEC is active against both microfilariae and adults. Signs and symptoms respond dramatically with DEC, which is the characteristic of TPE.

Concomitant therapy with corticosteroids reduces inflammation of airways in a chronic setting. It is postulated that lower respiratory tract inflammatory cells release superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, which causes chronic respiratory tract inflammation and mild interstitial lung disease that is reduced by corticosteroids. Strongyloidiasis infection in the lung should be ruled out before starting corticosteroids due to the risk of disseminated infection.

Other agents used for treatment include ivermectin (acts on microfilariae) and albendazole (acts on adult worms). However, there is no published data available.
