The SEMS and PRIMETEST trials are ongoing to evaluate the role of RPLND in seminoma. The TIGER trial is a phase III international trial to determine the optimal first salvage treatment in relapsed or refractory germ cell tumors. In this trial, Paclitaxel, Ifosfamide, cisplatin (TIP) is compared with high-dose chemotherapy with paclitaxel followed by carboplatin and etoposide TICE in relapsed germ cell tumors.
