Central venous access is indicated in certain hospitalized patients. Common indications for central venous catheter placement include inadequate peripheral venous access, hemodynamic monitoring or recording of central venous pressures, peripherally incompatible infusions due to potency or irritation of administered medications, and implementing various therapies, including dialysis. However, central venous access is not without potential risks to the patient. Thus, institutional protocols must be followed properly to ensure successful and safe placement. Moreover, bundles are in place for routine management to prevent catheter-associated complications. The most common complications include infection, thrombosis, and other mechanical difficulties. This activity aims to illustrate how to manage central venous catheters safely and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in preventing catheter-associated complications.

**Objectives:**
- Identify appropriate indications for central venous catheter insertion.
- Select appropriate equipment and utilize proper antiseptic techniques to prevent infections of central lines.
- Identify and manage the most common complications of central venous catheter placement and utilization.
- Apply effective interprofessional team processes to improve care coordination and communication to reduce central venous catheter-associated morbidity.
