The pathologic basis includes:

- Infection with Campylobacter jejuni is a result of orally ingested contaminated food or water. Infection influences include several factors including the dose of bacteria ingested, the virulence of organisms, and the immunity of the host. The median incubation period is 2 to 4 days. C jejuni multiplies in the bile and then invades the epithelial layers and travels to the lamina propria producing a diffuse, bloody, edematous enteritis. Pseudomembranous colitis is caused by toxin-producing Clostridium difficile. The disease develops as a result of altered normal microflora (usually by antibiotic therapy such as cephalosporin and beta-lactam antibiotics) that enables overgrowth and colonization of the intestine by Clostridium difficile and production of its toxins.

- Inflammation in ulcerative colitis involves the rectum in 95% of patients and extends proximally in a continuous pattern. The disease may affect the entire colorectum (termed pancolitis) or only limited to the rectum (termed proctitis). Some patients may develop limited terminal ileal involvement (backwash ileitis) that can be challenging to differentiate from Crohn disease.

- The pathophysiology of microscopic colitis is not well understood. Several hypotheses have been placed to explain the disease underlying mechanisms and pathogenesis including genetic predisposition, autoimmunity, immune dysregulation to a reaction to a luminal antigen such as various infectious agents and medications, as well as bile acid malabsorption.

- In ischemic colitis, the duration and severity of hypoperfusion will determine the colonic injury. Reperfusion injury could also be a significant contributing factor. Patients with ischemic colitis usually have (1) comorbidities including heart failure, atherosclerosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), atrial fibrillation (emboli), concurrent malignancy and hematological disorders (thrombosis). (2) Iatrogenic causes including abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, bowel preparation media for a colonoscopy and colonoscopy. Two mechanisms may cause bowel ischemia, the first is diminished bowel perfusion due to low cardiac output (heart failure, shock), and the second is occlusive disease including atherosclerosis, embolism with inadequate collateral circulation.

- In drug-induced colitis, the pathophysiology and pathology vary and may mimic microscopic colitis and or ischemic colitis.

- In colitis secondary to immune deficiency disorders, several factors might be responsible for colitis and diarrhea including HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy, opportunistic infection (particularly cytomegalovirus), and cryptosporidiosis.
