The overall prognosis for MVP is benign.Â  Most asymptomatic individuals are not aware that they have MVP and do not require treatment. Complications associated with MVP include infective endocarditis, mitral valve regurgitation, arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation), transient ischemic event, or systemic embolism. The major predictor of mortality in MVP is the degree of mitral valve regurgitation and ejection fraction.
