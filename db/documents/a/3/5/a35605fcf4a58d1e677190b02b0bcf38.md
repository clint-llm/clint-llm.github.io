The dura mater is very important to the clinician because it is a barrier to the internal environment of the brain, and surgically, the neurosurgeon and clinician who interpret imaging should understand its anatomy.

Dural tears are a frequent complication of lumbar spine surgery.

**Lumbar Puncture**

Diagnostic lumbar puncture is one of the most commonly performed invasive tests in clinical medicine.

Knowledge of the anatomy of the lumbar spine is essential for anyone performing a lumbar puncture. The lumbar puncture needle transverses the following structures in order: skin, subcutaneous tissue, supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum, epidural space, dura mater, arachnoid mater, and lastly the subarachnoid space where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is stored.
