The primary blood supply of the proximal humerus comes from anastomoses between the anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries.

The axillary artery continues to become the brachial artery, which, along with one of its branches, the profunda brachii artery, will give off peri-osteal arteries to provide the blood supply for the rest humerus and its attached muscles.
