In the first dorsal compartment of the wrist, a tendon sheath encloses the abductor pollicis longus (APL) and the extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) tendons at the lateral border of the anatomical snuffbox. The functions of these muscles are as follows:

**Extensor Pollicis Brevis (EPB)**

- Radial abduction of the wrist (0 to 25 degrees)

- Thumb extension (90 degrees)

**Abductor Pollicis Longus (APL)**

- Wrist radial abduction (0 to 25 degrees)

- Thumb abduction (70 to 80 degrees)

De Quervain tendinopathy affects both the abductor pollicis longus and the extensor pollicis brevis at the point where they pass through a fibro-osseous tunnel (the first dorsal compartment) from the forearm into the hand.

The etiology of de Quervain tendinopathy is not well-understood. In the past, attribution was to occupational or repetitive activities involving postures that maintain the thumb in extension and abduction. Women have been reported to be four times more likely to be affected than men, and there has been an increasing incidence in nonwhite individuals and those older than 40 years of age.
