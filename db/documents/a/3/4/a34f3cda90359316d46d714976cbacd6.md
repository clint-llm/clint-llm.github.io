Prescribers starting patients on benazepril for any of its indicated uses should coordinate their efforts with other interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians, mid-level practitioners, pharmacists, and nursing staff. Pharmacists should check for appropriate dosing, potential drug interactions, and contraindications. Nurses should help with regular blood pressure checkups and ensure proper drug administration, reporting any abnormalities to the team. An interprofessional team approach is always necessary when administering any medication, and benazepril is no exception; this will increase the chances of therapeutic success and minimize adverse drug reactions.
