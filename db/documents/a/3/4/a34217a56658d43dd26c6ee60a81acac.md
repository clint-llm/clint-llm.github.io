Lymph nodes are generally found in close association with blood vessels. The axillary lymph nodes receive their blood supply from the axillary artery, and venous drainage occurs via branches of the axillary vein. Interestingly, it has been shown that stage II breast cancer and above are associated with a significant increase in the number of blood vessels in axillary lymph nodes.
