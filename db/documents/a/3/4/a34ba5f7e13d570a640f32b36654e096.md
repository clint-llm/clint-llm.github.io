It is widely accepted that Paget disease is associated with some underlying breast malignancy, usually ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive ductal carcinoma. It is theorized that these malignant ductal epithelial cells migrate toward the skin through the lactiferous ducts and ductules. There are no clearly identified distinct risk factors except those which are common to other breast cancers.

These risk factors are as follows: old age (above 50 years old), a personal history of breast abnormalities like lobular carcinoma in situ or atypical hyperplasia, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, or both, dense breast tissue as identified by the mammogram, radiation exposure, particularly to the chest, increase the risk of breast or ovarian cancers due to inherited gene mutations like BRCA1 and BRCA 2, hormone replacement like estrogen therapy after menopause, high-risk ethnicity for breast cancer, e.g., White race women are more likely to develop breast cancer than black or Hispanic women, drinking large amounts of alcohol.
