Cryosurgery was first described in the 1800s and has since evolved into a mainstay of therapy within dermatology. Cryosurgery is an effective alternative to more invasive techniques and can be delivered quickly and cost-effectively in an outpatient setting. Because this is a non-invasive technique, cryosurgery can produce excellent cosmetic outcomes. This activity highlights the indications, contraindications and complications of cryotherapy.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for cryotherapy.
- Summarize the complications of cryotherapy.
- Review the mode of action of cryotherapy.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients undergoing cryotherapy.
