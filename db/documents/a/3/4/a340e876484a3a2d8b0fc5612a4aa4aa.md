The adverse effects of procaine administration are similar to those of other aminoester anesthetics. Increased intravascular levels mediate most side effects; this can be due to overdosage, entry into intravascular spaces, and potentiation from reduced metabolism. More rarely, patients may experience adverse effects secondary to hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy.

Hypersensitivity may develop in patients either due to procaine or constituent components in the therapeutic suspension such as sulfites (local vasoconstriction) or chlorobutanol (antimicrobial preservative) with aminoesters more likely to induce hypersensitivity than aminoamides.

Systemic presence of procaine at supratherapeutic levels results in the compromise of multiple organ systems in a dose-dependent manner known as local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). Procaine, like other anesthetics, binds to beta-adrenergic receptors in addition to voltage-gated sodium channels to mediate cardiotoxic and neurotoxic effects.
