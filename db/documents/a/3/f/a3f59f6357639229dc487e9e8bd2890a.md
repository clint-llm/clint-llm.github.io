Several clinical conditions can trigger a cholinergic crisis. Outlined below are the most commonly encountered disorders:

**Overmedication with Acetylcholine Esterase Inhibitors AChEI in the Treatment of Myasthenia Gravis**

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune condition that affects the neuromuscular junction by producing autoantibodies against the ACh receptors at the postsynaptic membrane

One of the treatment modalities for myasthenia gravis is the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) such as pyridostigmine. AChEI prevents the breakdown of ACh by inactivating AChE. This stops the breakdown of ACh and increases its level and duration of action at the postsynaptic membrane. Excessive use of AChEI in the treatment of a patient with MG may precipitate a cholinergic crisis which is characterized by both muscarinic and nicotinic toxicity

Myasthenic crisis is a complication of MG. Precipitants of the myasthenic crisis include infection, surgery, menstruation, and certain medications like quinidine, calcium channel blockers (verapamil, nifedipine, felodipine) and antibiotics (gentamicin, ampicillin, streptomycin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin)

It is important to identify which of the two conditions is causing muscular weakness. A simple test that can be done involves giving a dose of edrophonium, 2 mg intravenous. The medication produces clinical improvement in myasthenic crisis but worsening of symptoms in cholinergic crisis

**Exposure to Organophosphates**

Cholinergic crisis can be precipitated by exposure to drugs that inhibit AChE, for example, nerve gas and organophosphate compounds used in pesticides, insecticides, and herbicides. Exposure might be via inhalation of vapors, ingestion, or direct contact of the chemical with the skin or mucous membrane

Organophosphates are chemical compounds used extensively as agents of chemical warfare. Nerve gases are one of the deadliest agents in chemical warfare. Examples of such chemicals are sarin, tabun, soman, GF, and VX. Organophosphates work by inhibiting the action of AChE. This causes excessive stimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors at the postsynaptic membrane. ACh binds to the endplates of smooth muscles and secretory glands causing nausea, vomiting, bronchospasm, miosis, blurry vision, bronchorrea, and sialohorrea. Nicotinic effect on skeletal muscle can cause fasciculation and flaccid paralysis. Nerve gas poisoning can vary in severity from mild to moderate or severe.

Acute or chronic exposure to pesticides and insecticides containing organophosphates also can trigger a cholinergic crisis. Commonly used insecticides are malathion, parathion, diazinon, fenthion, and trichlorfon. Typically, patients are encountered in rural settings where pesticides and herbicides are used extensively. Examples of pesticides apart from organophosphates are carbamate, organochlorine, and pyrethroid insecticides. Apart from the muscarinic and nicotinic effects seen in cholinergic crisis, patients exposed to organophosphates might also exhibit neurological symptoms like a headache, dizziness, tremor, and paresthesia

**Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockage**

Lastly, use of a reversal agent like neostigmine or pyridostigmine for neuromuscular blockages can also trigger a cholinergic crisis
