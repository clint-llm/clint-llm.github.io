The following proteins, among others, are targeted by autoantibodies in paraneoplastic pemphigus:

- Desmoglein types 1 (160 kD) and 3 (130 kD) – Desmosome, extracellular (Dsg1, Dsg3)

- Desmoplakin 1 (250 kD) and 2 (210 kD) – Desmosome, intracellular

- Bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 (230 kD)– Hemidesmosome/lamina lucida (BP230)

- Envoplakin (210 kD) – Desmosome, intracellular

- Epiplakin (more than 700 kD) - Desmosome, intracellular

- Periplakin (190 kD) – Desmosome, intracellular

- Alpha-2-macroglobulin-like-1 antigen (170 kD) (A2ML1) - protease inhibitor

Autoantibodies against plakin proteins are characteristic of PNP and not typically found in other forms of pemphigus.
