**Seasonal Changes**

The neurotransmitters involved in the suprachiasmatic nucleus' circadian activity also affect other seasonal processes. In the winter, melatonin rhythms are delayed by approximately 90 minutes compared with those of the summer. Levels of serotonin (5-HT) peak between October and November before declining again and reaching a nadir between December and January. Reductions in 5-HT concentrations during the winter months coincide with an increased prevalence of seasonal affective disorder during this period. Rodent studies have shown that changes in 5-HT production from the midbrain raphe nuclei affect circadian behavior and neuroendocrine rhythms. In the early autumn months of August to October, the number of vasopressin-containing and VIP-containing neurons is significantly higher than in the late spring months of April to June.

**Age-related changes**

Increasing disruption of the sleep-wake cycle is an expected phenomenon of normal aging. Approximately 40 to 70% of elders experience chronic sleep disturbances. Nakamura and colleagues conducted in vivo studies of aging mice and found reduced-amplitude electrical activity from the SCN as well as decreased neuronal efferent projections from the SCN to the subparaventricular zone of the hypothalamus.
