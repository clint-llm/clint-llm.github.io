Physicians are often solely held accountable for providing an appropriate medical screening examination and correct documentation. However, 20% of EMTALA violations result from emergency department nurses; this can range from incorrect transfer documentation to innocent advice on where to get faster care. While nurses cannot be held liable under EMTALA, they are held accountable under their states' Nurse Practice Act, and they can also be named in medical malpractice lawsuits.

Other hospital care staff, such as pharmacists and physical therapists, are unlikely and rare causes of EMTALA violations. However, all care staff should ensure every patient is getting appropriate care regardless of insurance status and ability to pay.
