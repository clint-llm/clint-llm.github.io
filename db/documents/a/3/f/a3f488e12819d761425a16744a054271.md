Therapeutic plasma exchange is a useful procedure to eliminate from circulation the particular pathologic entity.  It is normally reserved as a treatment adjunct or when initial therapies have failed. The Journal of Clinical Apheresis produces guidelines on the use of Apheresis in clinical practice. This is an evidence-based guide to a vast collection of diseases requiring this treatment.  Per disease and the state of the patient, this guide helps determine when TPE is appropriate and what the expected end results.  Coordination of care amongst the various healthcare personnel is required to ensure patient safety, the propriety of therapy in each particular situation, and application of alternative and/or adjunct therapies indicated for a particular patient.
