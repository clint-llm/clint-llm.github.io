The clinical presentation of Candida auris infection is similar to that of other Candida species. C. auris has been isolated from different body sites, including the nose, pharynx, sputum, lungs, pleural cavity, heart, blood, liver, abdominal cavity (peritoneal fluid), rectal or stool culture, urine, vagina, bone, axilla, groin, wounds/surgical tissue, pus, ear, and brain.

Isolates from non-sterile body sites such as the genitourinary tract, skin and soft tissues, and lungs likely represent colonization rather than actual infection.

Clinical conditions reported include bloodstream infections (fungemia), myocarditis, urinary tract infection, surgical wound infections, burn infections, skin abscesses (related to catheter insertion), otitis, meningitis, and bone infections.

Compared to other Candida species, which are typical commensals of the gastrointestinal tract and not typically associated with nosocomial transmission, C. auris has been shown to thrive on the skin.C. auris forms a multilayer biofilm that proliferates best in the milieu that mimics sweaty axillary skin conditions.

Risk factors associated with Candida auris infections are similar to those of other Candida species.
