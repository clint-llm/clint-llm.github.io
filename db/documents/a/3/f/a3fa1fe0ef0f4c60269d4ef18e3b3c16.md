Stereotactic radiosurgery is an option for select AVMs, particularly those with a nidus < 3 cm in diameter and for deep AVMs. Potential advantages include the ability to be performed as an outpatient, non-invasive approach, and no recovery period. Disadvantages include a 1- to 3-year latency period between radiosurgery and actual ablation of the lesion, during which time the risk of hemorrhage remains.

The Pittsburgh radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation-grading scale was developed to predict outcomes after radiosurgery.
