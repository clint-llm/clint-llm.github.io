Otitis media with effusion generally resolves spontaneously with watchful waiting. However, if it is persistent, myringotomy with tympanostomy tube insertion is considered an effective treatment.

Adenoidectomy is currently utilized in cases of OME that involve enlarged adenoids and is an important addition to management in patients with OME.

Childhood hearing loss can affect language development.

Clinician decisions for the correct interventional treatment of OME for a specific patient include a variety of factors.

- Comorbidities of the patient

- The severity of hearing loss

- OME presence unilaterally or bilaterally

- Effusion duration

- Age of patient

Social factors

- Cost to patient

- Patient’s likelihood of adherence to treatment

- Familial assistance with treatment

A patient-focused approach should be adopted when assessing hearing disability. How the child is coping socially and at school is more important than the results of audiometry investigations.
