Laryngeal and tracheal stenosis is a very complex problem and a major cause of acute airway compromise.

Laryngeal and tracheal stents are solid or hollow materials used to prevent the lumen collapse or stabilize a surgical reconstruction of the larynx or trachea. The stents can be made of absorbable or non-absorbable materials of various sizes and shapes.
