Although the precise cause is not presently known, it is thought to be due to a developmental disorder involving arrest of compaction of loose myocardial meshwork during fetal ontogenesis. It has been traced back to a single point mutation in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene. Various studies have linked left ventricular non-compaction as an autosomal dominant inherited disorder. It has possible links to mutations in several genes like ZASP,  dystrobrevin and tafazzin.  It has been known to be a part of various syndromes like the Barth, Noonan,  Roifman or Toriello Carey syndrome.
