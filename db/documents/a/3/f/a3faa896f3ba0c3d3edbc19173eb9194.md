Clinically, the diffusion capacity of the lung (DLCO) is measured using low concentrations of carbon monoxide. DLCO can be calculated by the equation VCO = DLCO (PACO â€“ PaCO). PaCO is approximately zero due to hemoglobin binding so that the equation can rearrange to DLCO = VCO / PACO. To measure DLCO, low CO content air is breathed for 10 seconds, with the flow of CO into and out of the lungs being measured to calculate VCO.

DLCO is related to the diffusion coefficient (D) of carbon monoxide, the alveolar area (A), and the alveolar thickness (T) according to the equation DLCO = D x A / T. Because D is a constant, the value of DLCO provides insight into the alveolar area and thickness that impacts gas exchange. Also, the diffusion of other gases can be calculated at different pressure conditions by correcting for their different diffusion coefficients.

The V/Q ratio of the lung is measurable by the multiple inert gas elimination technique (MIGET). The lung divides into a number of compartments, and a mixture of 6 gases is inhaled.
