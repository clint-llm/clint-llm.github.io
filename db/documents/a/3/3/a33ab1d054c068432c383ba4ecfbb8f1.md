Rhesus (Rh) incompatibility refers to the discordant pairing of maternal and fetal Rh types. It is associated with the development of maternal Rh sensitization and hemolytic disease of the neonate (HDN). An individual can be classified as Rh-positive if their erythrocytes express the Rh D antigen; otherwise, an individual is Rh-negative if they do not. This phenomenon becomes clinically significant if a mother that is Rh-negative becomes sensitized to the D antigen and subsequently, produces anti-D antibodies (i.e., alloimmunization) that can bind to and potentially lead to the destruction of Rh-positive erythrocytes. This is of particular concern if an Rh-negative mother is carrying an Rh-positive fetus, which can result inÂ consequences along the spectrum of HDN ranging from self-limited hemolytic anemia to severe hydrops fetalis.
