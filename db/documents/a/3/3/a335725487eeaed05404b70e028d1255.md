Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) has been in a race with technology since it was first introduced; the advances in the equipment offer a massive playground for the application of ESS beyond chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). The main indications include CRS, pituitary tumors, skull base defects, sinonasal tumors, and complications of acute rhinosinusitis, among many other pathologies. A stepwise technique addressing all sinuses provides a good result in cases of CRS, and a wide and safe pathway when addressing structures beyond the sinuses. This activity reviews the anatomy and indications for ESS and explains the role of the inter-professional team in managing patients who undergo ESS.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of endoscopic sinus surgery.
- Describe the technique of endoscopic sinus surgery.
- Summarize the potential complications of endoscopic sinus surgery.
