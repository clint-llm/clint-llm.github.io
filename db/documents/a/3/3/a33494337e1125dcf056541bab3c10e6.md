Gastroenteritis occurs when there is a fecal-oral contact, ingestion of contaminated water or food, and person to person. This is the most common way of acquiring this infection and making it the main cause for norovirus and Shigella outbreaks. This disease is associated with bad hygiene and poverty.

In the United States, rotavirus and noroviruses (accountable for almost 58% of all cases) are the most common viral agent that causes diarrhea, followed by enteric Adenoviruses, Sapovirus, and Astroviruses.

The main risk factors for gastroenteritis are environmental, seasonal, and demographics, being you children more susceptible. Other diseases like measles and immunodeficiencies put the patient at a higher risk for a gastrointestinal (GI) infection. Malnutrition is another significant risk factor, like vitamin-A deficiency or zinc deficiency.

Most of the episodes are acute diarrheas, lasting less than one week. When diarrhea lasts more than 14 days, it is consideredÂ persistent diarrhea and accounts for 3% to 19% of episodes. Around 50% of death cases due to diarrhea.
