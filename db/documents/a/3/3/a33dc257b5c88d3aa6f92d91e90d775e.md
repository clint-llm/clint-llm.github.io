Trauma is the most common cause of the acquired subglottic stenosis, and the trauma can be external or internal. External trauma is more common in adults and is due to roadside accidents and clothesline injuries. Internal laryngeal trauma is iatrogenic, secondary to endotracheal intubation. Intubation compromises 90% of the cases of acquired subglottic stenosis in children due to the completely cartilaginous ring in the upper airway and the pseudostratified, ciliated, columnar respiratory epithelium with loose areolar tissue in this region. The severe injury occurs after 17 hours of intubation in adults and after 1 week in neonates.

Premature infants tolerate more prolonged intubation due to more pliable cartilage and the high location of the neonatal larynx in the neck with posterior tilt and funnel shape. Endotracheal tube size should allow an air leak at 20 cm of water pressure. The safest material to use for prolonged intubation includes polymeric silicone and polyvinyl chloride. Nasogastric tubes can also cause pressure necrosis and perichondritis. Normally during the third month of gestation, the laryngeal lumen is recanalized after normal epithelial fusion is completed. However, in congenital stenosis, the recanalization fails to happen. Other causes include burns, ingestions, infection, and inflammation (gastroesophageal reflux disease, Wegener’s granulomatosis).
