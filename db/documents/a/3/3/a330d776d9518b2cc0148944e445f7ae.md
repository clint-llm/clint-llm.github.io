Many laboratory tests can assess for choriocarcinoma, including complete blood count (CBC), coagulation studies, body chemistries, renal function panels, liver function panels, type and screen, and quantitative hCG.

The United Kingdom registers and monitors all patients with hydatidiform or molar pregnancies and utilizes the following criteria to start chemotherapy for gestational trophoblastic disease:

- Plateaued or rising hCG following uterine evacuation

- Heavy vaginal bleeding

- Gastrointestinal or intraperitoneal bleeding

- Histologic evidence of choriocarcinoma

- Evidence of metastases in brain, liver, or gastrointestinal tract

- Lung opacities greater than 2 cm

- Serum hCG greater than 20,000 IU/L 4 weeks following evacuation

- Elevated hCG greater than 6 months after evacuation even when decreasing

Following the diagnosis of choriocarcinoma, the healthcare professional should evaluate patients for metastasis; the lungs are the most common site for metastasis.

In males who have developed choriocarcinoma, the testicular anatomy is usually very small or even regressed, leaving only metastatic disease and cells.
