Those suffering osteoporotic vertebral column fractures can focus on preventing new fractures and treating the underlying condition that will lead to improved quality of life. Weight-bearing exercises and muscle strengthening are critical parts of building strong bones. Healthy food choices, smoking cessation, and limited alcohol consumption should be part of a comprehensive treatment plan. For those with osteoporosis, bisphosphonates or other anti-osteoporosis medications can be used to reduce the risk of fractures.
