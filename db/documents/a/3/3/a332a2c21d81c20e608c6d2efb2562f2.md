The barium swallow study, also known as a barium esophagogram or esophagram, is a contrast-enhanced radiographic study commonly used to assess structural characteristics of the entire esophagus. It may be used for the diagnosis of a wide range of pathologies including esophageal motility disorders, strictures, and perforations. It may also be used to characterize more distal pathology such as a hiatal hernia or gastric volvulus. This activity reviews the barium swallow study, its indications, and contraindications, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating patients with esophageal pathology.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures evaluated by a barium swallow study.
- Describe the technique for performing a barium swallow study.
- Review the potential risks and benefits of performing a swallow study using barium versus gastrogaffin.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by esophageal pathology undergoing a barium swallow study.
