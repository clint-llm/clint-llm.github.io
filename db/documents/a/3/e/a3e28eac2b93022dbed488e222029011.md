Differential diagnoses for internal degloving injuries include seroma, abscess, vascular injury, compartment syndrome, and deep venous thrombosis. However, history and physical exam, coupled with appropriate imaging, should be able to direct the clinician to the correct diagnosis. In the acute trauma setting, a seroma or abscess should be less likely. A vascular injury, while possible, should be ruled out with a distal neurovascular exam, ankle-brachial index, and CT angiogram if necessary. Likewise, a deep venous thrombosis would most likely have more generalized limb swelling and could be easily evaluated with duplex ultrasound. Compartment syndrome of the thigh is rare and, while possible, should be ruled out by the physical exam. If in question, compartment pressure measurements can be obtained.
