Patients with pre-existing anticoagulant or antiplatelet use have a poorer outcome with TBI. Acute, rapid reversal of anticoagulant agents should be considered early. Correction agents for patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents with TBI include Vitamin K, Protamine Sulfate, Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC), Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP), Activated factor VIIa (rFVIIa). The identification of an up-to-date medication list is extremely important to choose the appropriate correction agent.
