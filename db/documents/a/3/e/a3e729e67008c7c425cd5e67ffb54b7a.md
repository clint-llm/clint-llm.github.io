Falls account for one of the most common and serious issues contributing to a disability, especially among elderly individuals. Tinetti et al. in 1988 defined a fall as an event that results in a person coming to rest on the ground or other lower-level unintentionally, which is not as a result of a major intrinsic event (such as stroke) or overwhelming hazard. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of falls and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who present after a fall or multiple falls.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of falls in the elderly.
- Describe the patient history associated with falls in the elderly.
- Summarize the management considerations for patients presenting with falls.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by falls.
