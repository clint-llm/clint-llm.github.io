The goals of the evaluation are to confirm the diagnosis and determine the underlying etiology.All patients get a CT scan and lower endoscopic evaluation

**CT Scan**

The first and best test is a CT scan with oral or rectal contrast without IV contrast (greater than 90% accurate)

**Colonoscopy**

Colonoscopy has a low sensitivity (11% to 89%) for detecting fistula tract. It is used to rule out malignancy preoperatively

**Cystoscopy**

This test also low sensitivity (less than 50%) versus a CT scan for detecting CVF. Clinicians usually do not see fistula tract but see edema at the site. It is indicated if there is suspicion for a malignant fistula of the bladder, for example, a history of bladder cancer, bladder mass on CT, or an absence of colonic pathology.

**Barium Enema**

A barium enema is less commonly done today; CT and endoscopy have largely replaced it.  It can be useful in the diagnosis of CVF (only 30% Sn) and underlying etiology, for example, colon cancer or diverticulosis.

**Poppy Seed Test**

In this test, the patient ingests poppy seeds, and their urine is examined in 48 hours. It has a 100% detection rate of CVF but provides little information regarding disease location or etiology

**MRI**

MRI is useful in complex fistulas in Crohn’s patients; high-costplain radiography.
