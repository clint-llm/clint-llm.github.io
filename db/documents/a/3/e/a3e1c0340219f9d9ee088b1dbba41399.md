The levator labii superioris muscle, also known as the quadratus labii, contributes to facial expression and movement of the mouth and upper lip. It courses alongside the lateral aspect of the nose, and its primary function is elevation of the upper lip. It is also involved in movements such as expressions of disgust, sadness and disdain, nasal flaring, retching (vomiting), and even to show oral content. Its origin is on the lateral aspect of the nose, and it extends laterally towards the zygomatic bone. The levator labii superioris receives its blood supply from terminal branches of the facial artery and the infraorbital branch of the maxillary artery. The zygomatic branch of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) innervates the levator labii superioris.
