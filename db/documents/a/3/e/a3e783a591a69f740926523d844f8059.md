**Case Scenario #1**

**A 4-year-old child is admitted to the hospital for a third episode of hypoglycemia and lethargy. Prior workup has been unable to determine an organic cause. The child is observed in the hospital for three days, and no underlying pathologic process is discovered. The mother stays with the child, is extremely protective, and engaged in making sure "all stones are overturned" to find the cause of the child's condition. The child is set for discharge in the morning at 4 am. While making rounds, the nurse finds the mother wide awake standing at the bedside. During her examination, the child has a seizure. A bedside rapid blood sugar test reveals a dangerously low level. Glucagon is administered, and the child recovers quickly. What should the nurse do?**

In this case, there is reasonable cause to suspect child abuse, specifically "fabricating, feigning, or intentionally exaggerating or inducing medical symptoms or disease which results in potentially harmful medical evaluation or treatment to a child through any recent act," as well as a basis to report. A nurse is a mandated reporter of suspected child abuse and is therefore required to make a report of suspected child abuse to Childline, via phone at 1-800-932-0313 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) or electronically via the Child Welfare Portal at www.compass.state.pa.us/cwis, if there is reasonable cause to suspect that a child is a victim of child abuse, and they come into contact with the child in the course of employment, occupation, and practice of a profession or through a regularly scheduled program, activity, or service, or they are directly responsible for the care, supervision, guidance or training of the child, or are affiliated with an agency, institution, organization, school, regularly established church or religious organization or other entity that is directly responsible for the care, supervision, guidance or training of the child. Given the gravity of the situation, in this hospital setting, clinicians and social workers should also be contacted.

**Case Scenario #2**

**A 13-year-old girl is brought to her pediatrician because of a recent decline in her grades. During a private interview, she admits she has "problems with boys at school" and "bad dreams about boys always staring at her." The child privately admits she regularly gets up in the middle of the night and sleeps with the biological mother on her side of the bed, with her stepfather next to her mother. The child indicates the stepfather has commented that she is a "looker," has "big headlights," and needs to "fend off the boys at school." The pediatrician attended high school with the stepfather and knows he is not the "brightest bulb" but seems to care about the child genuinely. The child indicates the stepfather wears pajamas, has never touched her, and always knocks before entering the bathroom or her room. She says she is very anxious about attending school and is afraid to speak with her mother about her school problems. She says her stepfather has always been "very good" to her mother and is always kind and considerate to her as well. She does not want to get him into trouble but feels his comments about her appearance add to her anxiety. What should the pediatrician do in this situation?**

Given the totality of the circumstances, there may not be reasonable cause to suspect child abuse; however, there remain numerous concerns, such as the child's problems at school, nightmares, child co-sleeping at the age of 13, and the stepfather's inappropriate comments to the child. General concerns for a child's safety, health, and well-being may be reported to ChildLine for assessment of services and supports. The PA CPSL prescribes that a person, hospital, institution, school, facility, agency, or agency employee acting in good faith shall have immunity from civil and criminal liability that might otherwise result from making a report of suspected child abuse or making a referral for general protective services, regardless of whether the report is required to be made under the PA CPSL.

**Case Scenario #3**

**A 16-year-old child presents to the emergency department due to acting out at school. Shortly after arrival, the child asks for a sandwich. The school could not reach the biological mother, and the biological father is deceased. The child indicates his mother is on a honeymoon on a boat somewhere in the Cayman Islands. He is currently being taken care of by his grandmother, who is at work as a dietician, but she will be home shortly. The mother left him with $200 ten days ago and told him to buy local fast food for both of them for dinner. He admits he was told not to spend more than $20 daily and avoid dessert due to his grandmother's diabetes. He says he is out of money because he bought dessert daily and spent $30 instead of $20. He says he is "starving." There is no food in the house besides the fruits, vegetables, and frozen meals his mother provided. Which of the following would be an appropriate response of the emergency department health providers?**

The child should be given food, and the grandmother should be contacted. Additionally, while there may not be reasonable cause to suspect child abuse, the PA CPSL prescribes that a person, hospital, institution, school, facility, agency, or agency employee acting in good faith shall have immunity from civil and criminal liability that might otherwise result from making a report of suspected child abuse or making a referral for general protective services, regardless of whether the report is required to be made under the PA CPSL. General concerns for a child's safety, health, and well-being may be reported to ChildLine for assessment of services and supports.
