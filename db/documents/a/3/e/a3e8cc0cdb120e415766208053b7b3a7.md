The lungs are the respiratory organs responsible for the exchange of gasses between the bloodstream and the atmosphere.

Many organs possess compensatory mechanisms for hypoxia. The compensatory mechanism most relevant to the discussion of oxygen transport is the production of the hormone erythropoietin (EPO) by peritubular fibroblasts in the renal cortex.
