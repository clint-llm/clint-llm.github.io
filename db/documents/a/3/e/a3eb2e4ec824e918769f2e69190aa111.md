Potential contraindications to central venous access via the femoral vein are the following:

- Thrombosis

- Skin infection at the site of needle puncture

- Trauma

- Distorted anatomy

- Coagulopathy

Since thisÂ procedure has life-saving potential, the contraindications noted above are relative. Additionally, if these issues are encountered at the femoral site, an alternative site (e.g., internal jugular vein, subclavian vein) should be considered.
