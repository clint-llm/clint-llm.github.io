The central event in the pathogenesis of ichthyosis is the disruption of the epidermal barrier. The integrity of the cornified cell envelope is responsible for the maintenance of the barrier function of the skin. In ichthyosis vulgaris, loss of function mutations of the FLG gene leads to defective filaggrin formation, which is an important component of the cornified cell envelope.

The stratum granulosum is characterized by keratohyaline granules. Profilaggrin is an important component of these granules. During keratinocyte differentiation, profilaggrin is cleaved into filaggrin peptides, which in turn, are responsible for the alignment of keratin intermediate filaments. Ultimately, these complexes get cross-linked and are responsible for the compactness of the cell envelope.

Loss of function mutations of FLG, commonly, the R501X and c.2282del4, lead to an absolute or relative deficiency of filaggrin.

In normal epidermis, filaggrin is eventually degraded into water-retaining amino acids, in particular histidine, that serves as a natural moisturizer. FLG mutations cause a deficiency of histidine and its metabolites, one of which is urocanic acid, which is a natural photoprotective agent. Hence in ichthyosis vulgaris, there is an upregulation in UVB induced synthesis of vitamin D, ultimately leading to an increase in serum vitamin D levels.
