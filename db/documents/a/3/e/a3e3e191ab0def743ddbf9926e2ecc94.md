When muscular dystrophy is suspected after history and examination, creatinine kinase level followed by dystrophin gene deletion analysis or muscle biopsy with dystrophin antibody staining is the mainstay of the laboratory studies to confirm the diagnosis.

**Creatinine Kinase (CK) Level**

Raised creatinine kinase level indicates muscle degeneration, attaining a maximum of around 10 to 15 yrs of age.

**Genetic Analysis**

Genetic analysis is usually sufficient for diagnosis and commonly used in the modern era. This is performed for the detection of deletions and duplications by several methods such as Multiplex ligation-dependant probe amplification (MLPA), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

**Electromyography**

Electromyography may be indicated to differentiate between primary nerve process disease and myopathy, identifying the muscle group for optimal biopsy. However, electromyography is almost never used in diagnosis.

**Muscle Biopsy**

Muscle histology reveals necrosis, regeneration, fatty replacement, endomysial fibrosis but is not specific for diagnosis.

**Electrocardiograms (ECG)**

Electrocardiograms are an important part of surveillance for supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in cardiomyopathies or symptomatic patients.

**Other Tests**

Liver function tests for transaminases, pulmonary function tests, and spinal radiographs to follow the progression of scoliosis are also important but less important.
