Technetium-99m is a radioactive isotope of technetium which can be attached to iminodiacetic acid (IDA) compounds and their derivatives.  Current practice most commonly utilizes Tc-99m mebrofenin which is preferred due to its excellent extraction efficiency by the liver, which allows for diagnostic imaging of the biliary system in the presence of acute or chronic biliary disease.

HBS acquisition requires a large field-of-view gamma camera together with a low-energy all-purpose collimator for imaging of the 140 keV photons of Tc-99m.
