Failed back surgery syndrome is a condition with a complex etiology and many factors that predispose patients towards chronic pain. These predictive factors generally divide into preoperative (patient) factors, intraoperative factors, and postoperative factors.

Preoperative patient factors associated with failed back surgery syndrome include anxiety, depression, or other psychiatric comorbidities, obesity, smoking, the presence of litigation or workerâ€™s compensation claims, and physical or radiologic findings such as stenosis, fibrosis, and disc herniation.

Intraoperative risks for developing failed back surgery syndrome include operating at either the wrong vertebral level or operating at a single level while the origin of pain spans several levels, thus providing insufficient pain relief.

Long-term complications of the surgery, either avoidable or inevitable, may also lead to the development of failed back surgery syndrome in some patients. Surgery may exacerbate existing symptoms or cause new symptoms by inducing spinal stenosis, spinal instability, epidural fibrosis, or disruption of adjacent discs.
