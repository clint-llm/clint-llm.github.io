**Counterstrain**

- Lay the patient in the prone position and have the practitioner sit on the same side as the affected piriformis muscle

- Locate the tender point at the body of the piriformis muscle

- Classically this can be found 2 to 3 inches medial and slightly cephalad to the greater trochanter, or;
- Bisect the distance between the PSIS and ILA of the ipsilateral side, then bisect the distance between this point and the ipsilateral greater trochanter

- Have the practitioner suspend the patient's lower extremity off the edge of the table, flex the hip (approximately 135 degrees) while also abducting and externally rotating as needed until tenderness is relieved

- Hold the position for 90 seconds and slowly return the patient to a neutral position

- Reassess patient for tenderness

**Muscle Energy**

- Lay the patient in the supine position and have the practitioner stand on the same side as the affected piriformis muscle

- Bend the knee of the affected side and place the foot of that side on the lateral aspect of the opposite knee

- Have the practitioner push knee medially until meeting the restrictive barrier

- Have the patient push against the practitioner's resistance for 3 to 5 seconds, allow for a period of isometric relaxation, then engage a new barrier; repeat three times.

- Return the patient to a neutral position and reassess using supine or prone piriformis testing.
