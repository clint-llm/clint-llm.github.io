Interprofessional collaboration and care coordination between physicians (particularly oncology specialists), mid-level practitioners, nursing staff, pharmacists, and other healthcare providers enhance team performance and patient outcomes.

Communication among healthcare professionals between various clinical disciplines is crucial. For example, any dose greater than 100 mg/m^2 for a single treatment course requires verification with the initial medication prescriber. The oncology specialty-trained pharmacist should also monitor for the extensive drug-drug interactions with cisplatin and promptly alert the ordering clinician upon finding any reason for concern.

Nurses need to be aware of the importance of hydration and monitoring the site of IV infusion for extravasation. Also, all clinicians should monitor the patient for signs of infection, renal impairment, and the development of tumor lysis syndrome. Open communication between the interprofessional team is vital to prevent the adverse effects of this agent while optimizing its therapeutic effect, driving optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
