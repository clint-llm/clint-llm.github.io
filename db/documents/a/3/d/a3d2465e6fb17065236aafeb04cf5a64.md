The test for CEA measurement is usually conducted on a blood sample collected by the health care personnel/phlebotomist. A small quantity of the blood (3Â to 5 cc) is collected in a vial and sent to the laboratory to estimate the CEA Level. The risks associated with such a procedure are minimal, including needle site pain/stinging, bruising, bleeding, or infections. The procedure takes less than five minutes and does not need specific requirements, such as fasting. Occasionally, a CEA test is performed on other bodily fluids such as pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, or rarely cerebrospinal fluid.
