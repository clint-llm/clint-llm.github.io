TMS is based on the Faraday law of electromagnetic induction consisting of a passage of high-intensity brief current in a copper wire which in turn converts into an extracranial magnetic field and generates an intracranial electrical current. The nature of the neural circuit activated by TMS depends upon the orientation and the type of TMS coil being used. It can be a round-coil that is relatively more powerful, or it could be a figure-of-eight-shaped coil that is more focal. The figure-of-eight-shaped coil produces maximal current at the intersection, and thus it is also known as the double-cone coil. H-coil is another configuration that allows slower fall-off of the magnetic field.
