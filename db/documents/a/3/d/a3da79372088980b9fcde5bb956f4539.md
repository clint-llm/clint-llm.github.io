Moisturizers are topically applied products designed to increase the water content of the skin. Ingredients used in these products have a range of actions, including preventing transepidermal water loss and promotion of desquamation. This activity will review the role of the skin barrier function, maintenance of water balance in the skin, and how these functions relate to moisturizing agents.

**Objectives:**
- Review the physiology of the skin barrier and how moisturizers can improve this function.
- Identify the role of moisturizers in the management of a patient with an impaired skin barrier.
- Summarize the treatment considerations for a moisturizer when approaching a patient with dry skin.
- Identify the importance of collaboration amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for a patient using moisturizers to increase their skin barrier protection in the management of atopic dermatitis.
