The decision to order an echocardiogram requires an interprofessional team approach. The assessment of fluid status is a physical exam finding that can be performed not only by physicians but also by the nursing staff, and this can be used to help aid in the decision to order an echocardiogram. Interprofessional communication is important when treating any patient, including those with a cardiac history, and it is vital for all staff to continuously assess a patient's fluid status and need for further imaging assessments. Adequate communication about the specific indication for echocardiography for each specific patient, will help ensure optimal views and help improve the clinical utility of this test.
