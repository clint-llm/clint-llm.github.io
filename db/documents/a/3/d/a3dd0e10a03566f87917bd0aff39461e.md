Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta, most commonly occurring just beyond the left subclavian artery. However, it can occur in various other locations of the aortic arch (proximal transverse) or even in the thoracic or abdominal aorta. The narrowing of the aorta raises the upper body blood pressure, causing upper extremity hypertension. Unrepaired coarctation leads to premature coronary artery disease, ventricular dysfunction, aortic aneurysm/dissection, and cerebral vascular disease by the third or fourth decade of life.
