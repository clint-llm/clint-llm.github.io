The relationship between afterload and cardiac output is somewhat intuitive as one would expect the flow to increase as the load against which the heart contracts decreases. Several researchers during the 1960s and 1970s sought to develop this understanding at the cellular level. Experiments by Sonnenblick on isolated cat papillary muscle strips demonstrated that the extent and velocity of muscle shortening decrease as the load on the muscle is increased. A major limitation of this study was its basic design employing the use of isolated muscle strips. Monroe and French overcame this by using isolated whole-preparation dog hearts to show an inverse relationship between peak aortic flow and arterial impedance. Ross et al. took this one step further and examined the effects of changing LV afterload in anesthetized dogs by injecting or withdrawing blood from the aorta between systolic contractions. They reported similar findings to the previous studies giving further support for an inverse relationship between afterload and cardiac output due to alterations in sarcomere shortening.Â Figure 1 is a graphic representation of the effect of increases or decreases in afterload on the cardiac output, which is illustrated by shifting the baseline Frank-Starling curve downward or upward, respectively.
