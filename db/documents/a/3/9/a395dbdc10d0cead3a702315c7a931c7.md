H2 receptor antagonists are well-absorbed after oral administration, and all H2RAs are available as a tablet for oral use. Nizatidine is also available as a capsule or an oral solution. Famotidine, one of the most commonly used agents, is available as a chewable tablet, oral powder for suspension, or in combination formulations containing calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide or ibuprofen. Of the H2RAs, famotidine is available as an intravenous solution for use in hospital settings.

H2 receptor antagonists may be used as needed for gastric symptom relief or prophylactically 30 to 60 minutes before known food or beverage triggers. H2RAs may also be taken concomitantly with antacids if both quick relief of symptoms and a longer duration of action are desired. For best results, patients should take once-daily doses of H2RAs at bedtime. The more common twice-daily doses can be taken once in the morning and once in the evening.
