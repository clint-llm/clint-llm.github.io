MEN4 is a rare condition causing tumors of multiple endocrine glands. The spectrum of endocrine gland tumors is similar to MEN1, making it important to differentiate the two through genetic testing. To date, very few cases have been reported. As a result, the penetrance of the disease is not fully understood. To optimize outcomes, the management of these patients should be undertaken by an expert multidisciplinary team in a tertiary care center.
