A common complication that arises during regular spontaneous vaginal deliveries is shoulder dystocia. Shoulder dystocia occurs when the shoulders of the fetus become lodged behind the maternal pubic symphysis, impeding descent and expulsion. There are many documented and practiced maneuvers primarily aimed to resolve shoulder dystocia. The most common of these maneuvers is the well-known McRobertâ€™s maneuver. This activity reviews the role of McRobert's Maneuver, its indications, contraindications and complications and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of shoulder dystocia.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomy of the pelvis that is relevant for labor and delivery.
- Describe the indications for the McRobert's Maneuver.
- Review the technique of performing the McRobert's Maneuver.
- Explain the importance of a trained interprofessional team performing the McRobert's Maneuver to relieve shoulder dystocia.
