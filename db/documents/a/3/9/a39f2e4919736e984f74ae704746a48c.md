Public education and information serve as the first line of defense against plant-related toxic exposures. These exposures are overwhelmingly unintentional and, thus, through education, may be reduced. Patients should be aware of the toxicologic potential of plants to which they may become exposed, for example, by purchasing indoor plants or foraging activities. Plant chemistry is complex, and its products may exert toxic or therapeutic effects- acutely or chronically.

Owing to the evolution of information technology, non-health-care professionals may access data regarding potential toxic exposures through a few routes, including books, internet search engines, and mobile applications. With the advent of poison control centers in 1953 and open-source programs such as WIKITOX, information regarding toxic exposures has become widely available and accessible to the public. Primary care providers may also serve as a valued source of information.
