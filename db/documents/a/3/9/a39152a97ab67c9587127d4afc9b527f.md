It is essential to have high clinical suspicion to eliminate causative agents of tubulointerstitial nephritis and treat associated systemic disorders. Treatment is supported by the clinician's experience, study series, case reports, and randomized control trials. Therefore, treatment should be according to the underlying etiology. Discontinuation of drugs is the first line of therapy in drug-induced TIN, with alternative drug administration to treat infections that often lead to the reversal of renal injury.

A multicenter retrospective study revealed improvement in renal function in cases of early prompt corticosteroid administration after diagnosis and removal of drugs. It showed complete recovery in about 54% of people who received steroid treatment compared to only 33% with no steroid treatment. Also, the need for chronic dialysis is more, i.e., up to 44% in the no corticosteroid treatment group compared to only 4% in the steroid-treated patient group.

The role of mycophenolate mofetil has been demonstrated in recent studies.

Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants, i.e., azathioprine, is indicated mainly in cases associated with systemic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as Sj√∂gren syndrome, sarcoidosis, SLE, TIN with uveitis, and other granulomatous disorders. A retrospective study advocated improved prognosis of corticosteroid use in granulomatous interstitial nephritis regardless of the extent of fibrosis and inflammation on biopsy.

Management of infection-related TIN is the treatment of underlying infections with appropriate antibiotics. Besides, there are no other well-described treatment methods. Corticosteroids have little or no role in an infection-related TIN.

Supportive and conservative care should be provided to patients with adverse effects of medications and severe renal failure. These measures include fluid and electrolyte management, avoiding volume depletion or overload, adequate hydration, symptomatic relief of fever, rash and systemic symptoms, avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs, supportive dialysis, etc.
