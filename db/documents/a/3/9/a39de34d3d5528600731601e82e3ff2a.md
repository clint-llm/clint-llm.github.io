The identification of an axillary sentinel lymph node is typically in the axillary fat pad in the level I or level II lymph nodes of the axilla. These lymph nodes are referred to by anatomists as the pectoral nodes and clavicular nodes. The axillary fat pad lies deep to the fascia superficialis of the axilla and has a different texture than subcutaneous fat. The surgeon divides the superficial fascia during sentinel lymph node biopsy. The clavipectoral fascia lies deep to the pectoralis major muscle and invests the axillary artery and vein, as well as the axillary nerve. Two branches off the axillary artery can be encountered during axillary surgery: the lateral thoracic artery and the thoracodorsal artery. There are two motor nerves of concern in axillary surgery: the long thoracic and the thoracodorsal nerves. Injury to the long thoracic nerve, which provides innervation to the serratus anterior muscle, causes winging of the scapula. Several small sensory nerves traverse the axillary fat pad, including the intercostobrachial nerve. Injury of these nerves causes numbness of the medial upper arm. The surgeon should not encounter the brachial plexus during axillary dissection, provided that dissection is inferior to the axillary vein, which is an important landmark. Dissection superior to the axillary vein does not increase lymph node count for axillary dissection and can cause severe lymphedema and nerve injury.
