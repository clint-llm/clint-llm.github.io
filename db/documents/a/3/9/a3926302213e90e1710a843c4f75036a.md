Optimal dietary therapy for obesity should be tailored considering efficacy, long-term sustainability, presence of comorbidities (for example, diabetes mellitus), safety, affordability, nutritional value, cultural food preferences, and long-term adherence. It has to be practical with realistic long-term goals without ignoring overall health promotion.

A healthy lifestyle and nutritional education need to be imparted from an early age. There needs to be a more proactive approach from parents in providing dietary education. Lack of affordability of healthy foods and ready availability of processed foods are also contributory factors in obesity. These factors can only be addressed by policy change and food guidelines. The patient should be provided with necessary resources about healthy food choices and referred to a dietitian when necessary. There is an abundance of nutritional information on the internet that can sometimes be overwhelming and confusing to the patient. Patients need to be guided on navigating the data, how to read food labels and nutritional information. It is vital to empower patients with nutritional information and give control of their health in their hands.
