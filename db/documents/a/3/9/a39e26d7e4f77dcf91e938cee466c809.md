According to Ommaya et al.,  80 % of CSF leak is due to nonsurgical trauma, 16 % is iatrogenic, and 4 % is spontaneous.

Nearly 2.8 million people in the United States sustained a head injury that resulted in an emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death between 2007 and 2013. Skull base fractures occur in approximately 4% of these injuries, accounting for 21% of all skull fractures. Male patients are predominant (78%), and the mean age was 49.

A cerebrospinal fluid leak is also a known complication of post-trauma surgical procedures, endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery, operations involving the lumbosacral spine, as well as diagnostic or therapeutic lumbar puncture. The CSF leak incidence after primary spine surgery varies from 5.5% to 9% and 13.2% to 21% for second-look surgeries.
