Routine screening of plasma glucose levels in at-risk patients would aid early diagnosis and intervention to limit the complications and mortality risks of diabetes. In particular, continuous glucose monitoring in intensive care patients has been suggestedÂ to help prevent severe hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia and associated mortality risks. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can detect hypoglycemia or hyperglycemic episodes early and provide guidelines for rapid insulin/interventional adjustments. Hence, real-time access to accurate glucose measurements alerts health professionals to the efficacy of treatment and helps decrease the risk of missed episodes of hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia.

If elevated, serum glucose monitoring can inform and direct care for several potentially deleterious sequelae. As a result, everyone on the interprofessional healthcare team must be involved in the testing, patient education, monitoring, and therapy when appropriate. This includes clinicians, specialists, nurses (including specialty-trained nurses), and pharmacists, so everyone is on the same page and directs their efforts to optimize patient care and outcomes.
