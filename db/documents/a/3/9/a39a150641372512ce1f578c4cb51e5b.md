# Continuing Education Activity

Acute coronary syndromes are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis has a central role, as to allow a timely reperfusion strategy. The De Winter pattern consists of an electrocardiographic pattern which, in a proper setting, is highly suggestive of acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of patients who present with the De Winter pattern and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology and the current state-of-the-art data concerning the pathophysiology of the De Winter pattern.
- Outline the typical presentation and the adequate evaluation of patients with the De Winter pattern.
- Review the differential diagnosis associated with the De Winter pattern.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who present with the De Winter pattern in an appropriate clinical context.

# Introduction

Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality.

Though differentiation between ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is pivotal,Â over the years, several electrocardiographic patterns associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events have been described.

The De Winter pattern, first described in detail in 2008 and consisting of specific changes in the ECG, has been associated with an acute presentation of a left anterior descending (LAD) artery occlusion.

# Etiology

The De Winter pattern is associated with occlusion of the coronary arteries, most often the LAD, though cases involving other coronary arteries (such as the right coronary artery and the circumflex artery, whether isolated or in association) have also been described.

Most cases reported occlusion due to atherosclerotic disease (in line with other presentations of myocardial infarction),

# Epidemiology

The De Winter pattern is an infrequent presentation, with different case series reporting it to occur in 2% to 3.4% of anterior myocardial infarction patients.

# Pathophysiology

Though the specific pathophysiology associated with the De Winter pattern is still not fully ascertained, several potential mechanisms have been proposed. One which has garnered substantial interest relates to subendocardial ischemia, with ensuing subendocardial (as compared to subepicardial) action potentials at a hyperacute stage of the event (before transmural ischemia becomes predominant).

# History and Physical

Given that the De Winter pattern is generally associated with an ACS, patients present with features consistent with this diagnosis such as oppressive acute chest pain and shortness of breath.

Findings on physical examination vary as detailed in the Killip classification.

# Evaluation

The ECG findings consistent with this pattern, as proposed in the seminal article by De Winter et al., consist of an ST-segment upsloping depression at the J point of 1 to 3 mm in leads V1 to V6, associated with tall and symmetrical (positive) T waves.

However, it should be acknowledged that strict criteria remain elusive,

Interestingly, albeit initially described as comprising a static pattern,

Cardiac biomarkers, specifically high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) should be assessed, though (as stressed in contemporary guidelines) this should not delay the reperfusion strategy.

# Treatment / Management

In the proper clinical context (compatible with an ACS), the presence of the De Winter pattern should lead to a high degree of suspicion for a LAD artery occlusion.

After adequate reperfusion, patients should be admitted to a monitored unit (coronary care unit / intensive cardiac care unit), with subsequent management in terms of therapy and ancillary testing depending on the specific clinical course as detailed in the current guidelines.

# Differential Diagnosis

Though in an appropriate clinical setting, most cases of this pattern comprise an acute occlusion of the LAD artery, it should be highlighted that similar changes in repolarization can be present in other clinical scenarios.

Among these, hyperkalemia should be considered. Importantly, in this entity, a different clinical presentation, as well as the fact that T waves tend to be narrow and peaked (presenting a sharp apex), should be noted.

# Prognosis

As discussed above, the De Winter pattern is associated with acute occlusion of a coronary artery, most notably the LAD.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

As early diagnosis plays a prominent part in the management of individuals with an ACS and given the potential adverse outcomes associated with an acute LAD occlusion, improving patient presentation is of paramount relevance. In this regard, ensuring educational tools in a community for the most common symptoms associated with this pathology is one important strategy.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

As reviewed in the present article, in an appropriate clinical context, the De Winter pattern is highly suggestive of acute occlusion of the LAD artery.
