Bronchospasm involves the constriction of the smooth muscle layers of the small airways. If left untreated, bronchospasm can progress to respiratory distress and ultimately, respiratory failure. This activity outlines the varying etiologies and clinical phenotypes, evaluation processes, and management strategies of bronchospasm. Additionally, the interdependent roles of the interprofessional team are highlighted in the care for pediatric patients with bronchospasm.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of bronchospasm medical conditions and emergencies.
- Outline the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of bronchospasm.
- Review the treatment and management options available for bronchospasm.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance bronchiolitis and improve outcomes.
