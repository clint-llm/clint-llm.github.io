Because bruxism is a multifactorial condition, an interprofessional team should work together to manage the disease better and improve patients' quality of life, including dentists, mental health nurses, pediatricians, primary caregivers, neurologists, and psychotherapists.

Bruxism management relies on the recognition of potential causative factors. Nocturnal bruxism is usually not cured by an intervention. The behavior possibly diminishes with age.

The outlook for most patients is guarded; despite treatment, in many cases, the condition recurs.
