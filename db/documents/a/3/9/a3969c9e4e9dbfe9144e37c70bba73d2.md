The interprofessional approach requires a team including primary care, ophthalmologists, and geneticists, to effectively screen and design management protocol promptly to reduce both morbidities as well as mortality. These patients need annual systemic evaluation by a physician, annual ophthalmologic examination in children and less frequently in adults, and periodical developmental assessment in children. Regular blood pressure monitoring and MRI for follow-up of clinically suspected intracranial tumors and other internal tumors should be done.
