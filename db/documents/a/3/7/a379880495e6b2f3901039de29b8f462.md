A prompt and timely surgical intervention followed by appropriate antibiotic therapy (minimum of 6-8 weeks) is the mainstay of management.

Fluorescein aids in localizing and planning surgical strategies.

Sometimes intraoperatively, instead of frank pus, solid inflammatory tissue, and antibioma may be encountered and has to be biopsied and safely excised.

A recent systematic review found that laminectomy and myelotomy were undertaken in 58.5% of cohorts, and stereotactic needle aspiration was performed in 62.8% of the same.

Prophylactic complete resection of CDS has been advised to prevent catastrophic complications in the future.****

Almost 25â€“40% of ISCA is sterile.

Skin commensals (S. epidermides, S. aureus), Enterobacteriaceae, and anaerobes are commonly involved in CDS.

Microbiological agents implicated in the causation of IMSA include:

- Staphylococcus (25%)

- Streptococcus

- Escherichia coli

- Proteus

- Listeria

- Schistosomiasis

- Bacteroides

- Pseudomonas

- Brucella

- Hemophilus

- Histoplasma

- Actinomyces

- Mycobacterium tuberculosis

- Fungal infections****

Early broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics effective against Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, enteric Gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes should be promptly initiated.

A recent systematic review has shown antibiotics usage in only 87% of cohorts with 137 cases of ISCA.
