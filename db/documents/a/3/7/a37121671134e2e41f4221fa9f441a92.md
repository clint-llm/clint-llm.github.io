The gold standard for diagnosis of candidemia is based on direct fungal detection in blood cultures. The advantage of cultures is the ability to do susceptibility testing. However, sensitivity is low, reaching only 21% to 71% in some studies. Cultures have the further disadvantage of taking a long time to grow and being negative in cases where candidemia has subsided but has caused a persistent deep-seated tissue infection without bloodstream infection.

- In patients with localized findings, a biopsy should be done and sent for culture and gram staining.

- Other markers of infection like Candida mannan antigen and anti-mannan antibodies and B-d-glucan have the advantage of resulting faster but can have a high false-positive rate.

- New polymerase chain reaction tests are being developed and evaluated in clinical trials. They show promising results. Currently available is the T2Candida test.

- When evaluating a patient with suspicion for invasive candidiasis, consideration should be made to order blood both cultures and one non-culture method like B-d-glucan.
