Immunity to polio may be conferred by using a single antigen inactivated polio vaccine or as part of a combination vaccine. The volume of solution injected for each is 0.5 mL, but the route of delivery differs. While the single antigen inactivated polio vaccine may be administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously, all three combination vaccines should be administered only intramuscularly. The site of administration depends on the patient's age and size, with preference given to the anterolateral thigh in infants and the deltoid in children and adults.

The clinician should check the CDC guidelines for administration regimens based on the following age groups and scenarios:

- Pediatric immunization for children 6 weeks of age and older

- Unvaccinated adults with exposure risk

- Incompletely vaccinated adults with exposure risk

In the case of the oral poliovirus vaccine, single vials contain 0.5 mL of vaccine solution, which is administered with a pipette into the mouth and swallowed by the recipient.Â No doses of the oral polio vaccine have been given in the USA since the year 2000.
