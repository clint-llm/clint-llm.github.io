A VIPoma is a rare and challenging tumor to diagnose and treat. Successful care will be enhanced by a coordinated interprofessional team of an endocrinologist, gastroenterologist, gastroenterology nurse, surgeon, pharmacist, oncologist, and oncology nurse managing the treatment of a patient with this condition. Nurses monitor patients, notify the team of changes in status, and educate the patients and family about the condition. Pharmacists review prescriptions and check for interactions. [Level 5]
