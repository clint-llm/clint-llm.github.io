Knee dislocation is a relatively common injury seen in the emergency department. Because the dislocation can be associated with a neurovascular injury that can lead to the loss of a limb, an interprofessional team must manage these patients. The triage nurse must be fully aware that a dislocated knee can disrupt the vascular supply to the distal leg and hence, immediate admission and consultation with an emergency department physician are necessary. A vascular surgeon consult is in order if there is a loss of pulses in the leg, and a radiologist may be consulted to image the blood supply. Orthopedic consultation is also necessary in almost all cases. Nursing will also participate in post-procedure care, including medication administration and monitoring of vitals. For most patients who obtain prompt management, the outcomes are good. However, delay or missing a vascular injury can be associated with severe consequences. In delayed cases, even after treatment, a chronically unstable and painful knee is not uncommon.
