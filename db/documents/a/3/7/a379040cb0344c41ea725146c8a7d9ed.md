As discussed above, the medical simulation environment provides almost endless opportunities in skills training, communication development, professional and inter-professional team building, all within the confines of a safe environment conducive to such objectives. Obtaining SSH accreditation is still relatively new for simulation sites/centers, and therefore published data relating SSH accreditation with clinical outcome improvement is still largely lacking at this time. The value of simulation-based education concerning improved psychomotor skills (e.g., laparoscopic surgical skills, suturing skills, etc.) that translates to the clinical setting is becoming more abundant in the literature, but this is outside the scope of this review article topic.

The information provided in this article is mostly based on the experiences obtained preparing and obtaining SSH accreditation from gleaned experiences and contributions of a number of our colleagues from across the U.S., all of whom are experts in simulation-based medical education.Â Hence the evidence presented in this article is rated V: expert opinion.
