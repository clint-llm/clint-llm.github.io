The maximum dose of ranibizumab is 0.5 mg single dose monocular, and intravitreal injection allows the drug to penetrate all retina layers, minimizing systemic effects. When cultures of endothelial cells from human organ-cultured donor corneas received treatment with varying concentrations of ranibizumab,Â no cytotoxic effects of ranibizumab were observed.
