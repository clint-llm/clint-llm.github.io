Anterior glenohumeral joint dislocations are the most commonly encountered joint dislocations. They can be the result of low or high-energy trauma. This activity will review its presentation, pathology, evaluation, and acute and long-term management, which requires an interprofessional approach.

**Objectives:**
- Identify common injury presentations for anterior shoulder dislocation.
- Outline a complete physical exam for anterior shoulder dislocation, including glenohumeral landmarks and neurovascular status.
- Review indications for emergent orthopedic consultation and expedited outpatient follow-up.
- Describe various closed reduction techniques for acute anterior shoulder dislocation by an interprofessional team.
