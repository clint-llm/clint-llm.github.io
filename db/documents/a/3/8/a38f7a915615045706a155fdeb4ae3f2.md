All members of the trauma team should ensure they have sufficient personal protective equipment such as gloves, masks, and gowns to protect themselves. A stethoscope is the next critical piece of equipment as it is necessary in order to listen to breath sounds bilateral; a pulse oximeter should also be applied at this time. Supplies for resuscitation such as large-bore IVs warmed saline, and appropriate tubing should be readily available in the trauma bay. Supplies to maintain the airway should be readily available, including a bag-mask device, end-tidal CO2 monitoring device, intubation tray, and surgical airway kit. In case the patient has a pneumothorax, large-bore angiocatheters for potentialÂ needle thoracostomy and a chest tube kit should be easily accessible. The trauma bay should also be equipped with an EKG and a portable x-ray machine to be used once the primary survey is complete as an adjunct to the primary survey.
