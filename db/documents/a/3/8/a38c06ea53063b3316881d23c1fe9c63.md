Microscopic findings in breast fat necrosis are dependent on the age of the lesion. A newly insulted adipose cell will first lose its nucleus, which is then replaced by foamy histiocytes or macrophages filled with dead adipose cells in the process of debridement. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages may present as morphologic evidence of remote hemorrhage. Degranulation of histocytes activate interstitial infiltration of plasma cells, and eventually lymphocytes.  Immunostaining may be used to rule out carcinoma, looking for the presence of CD68 and the absence of pan-cytokeratin, which confirms cells to be foamy histiocytes, diagnosing fat necrosis.

At lower magnification, necrotic material appears wrapped by a zone of fibrous tissue. Fibrosis, in turn, may lead to the formation of an irregular spiculated mass due to the retraction of nearby vascularized tissue within 2 to 4 weeks after breast surgery. Calcification surrounding these lesions may be noted in masses 6 to 12 months old. Areas of significant fibrosis may be associated with dysmorphic calcification, and these lesions may need further assessment to rule out malignancy.
