When papular acrodermatitis of childhood was initially described in the 1950s, it was believed to beÂ a manifestation of hepatitis B virus infection. This was in large part due to the prevalence of anicteric hepatitis in these patients. While this association is still common in hepatitis B endemic areas, it is rare in the United States since the advent of the hepatitis B vaccine. Ongoing studies have demonstrated that papular acrodermatitis of childhood can occur following a wide variety of viruses. These viruses include but are not limited to Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, adenovirus, influenza, enteroviruses, echovirus, hepatitis A virus, herpes simplex viruses, HHV-6, HIV, mumps, parainfluenza virus, parvovirus B19, poxviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and rotavirus. Additionally, it has been reported after vaccination, including influenza, Calmette-Guerin bacillus, diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, Japanese encephalitis, and measles vaccines. The Epstein-Barr virus is the most commonly reported cause of papular acrodermatitis of childhood in the United States. However, in many cases, no infectious trigger is identified. The relationship between these potential triggers and the manifestation of papular acrodermatitis of childhood is not well defined but is presumed to be immunologically mediated.
