Cervical insufficiency is a well -recognized cause of late miscarriage, and the diagnosis is often made retrospectively after a woman has had a second-trimester loss. Most of the women have no symptoms or only mild symptoms beginning in the early second trimester. These includeÂ abdominal cramping, backache, pelvic pressure, vaginal discharge which increases in volume, vaginal discharge which changes from clear to pink, and spotting.

The diagnosis of incompetent cervix is usually made in three different settings:

- Women who present with a sudden onset of symptoms and signs of cervical insufficiency

- Women who present with a history of second-trimester losses consistent with the diagnosis of cervical incompetence (history-based)

- Women with endovaginal ultrasound findings consistent with cervical incompetence (ultrasound diagnosis)

The digital or speculum examination reveals a cervix that is dilated 2 cm or more, effacement greater than or equal to 80%, and the bag of waters visible through the external orifice (os) or protruding into the vagina. The diagnosis is frequently made on the basis of history retrospectively after multiple poor obstetrical outcomes have occurred.
