Castleman disease (CD) is a rare, nonclonal lymphoproliferative disorder having distinct subtypes depending on its etiology, pathology, and clinical presentation. It can affect lymph nodes of any body region, imitating both benign and malignant malformations, including the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Pathologically it can be classified as hyaline vascular type (HV-CD), plasma cell type, mixed type, and human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 associated Castleman disease.

Clinically it manifests as the more common unicentric ( localized or unifocal ) Castleman disease (UCD) and the less common multicentric ( generalized or multifocal ) Castleman disease (MCD).
