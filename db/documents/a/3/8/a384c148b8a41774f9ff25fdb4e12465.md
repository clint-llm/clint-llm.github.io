Rickets is a condition characterized by a defect in mineralization of the epiphyseal plates. Rickets could be inherited or acquired. The acquired rickets (nutritional) is the most common cause of rickets worldwide. The spectrum of presentation varies from being asymptomatic to irritability, growth retardation, and sudden death. In order to avoid long term complications, rickets must be promptly diagnosed and aggressively treated. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation of conditions causing rickets and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with rickets.
