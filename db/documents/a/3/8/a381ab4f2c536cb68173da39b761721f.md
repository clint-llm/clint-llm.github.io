The primary feature is the degeneration of neurons in the putamen, caudate as well as the cerebral cortex. The preferential degeneration of the enkephalin-containing medium spiny neurons in the basal ganglia in the indirect pathway provides the basis for chorea. Additional loss of substance-P containing medium spiny neurons in the direct pathway results in the development of dystonia and akinesia. The region-specific pattern of loss of neurons in the cortex and basal ganglia in the affected patients could explain the phenotypic variability.

There are multiple theories in the pathogenesis of HD, and more than one process can occur at the same time:

- Neuronal aggregates: Intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions containing the mutant HTT are components of the proteolytic pathway in HD. Accumulation of these mutant protein aggregates could lead to an impairment of the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway.

- Transcriptional dysregulation.

- Excitotoxicity: This is due to a combination of increased glutamate as well as glutamate agonist release from the cortical afferents.

- Mitochondrial dysfunction and altered energy metabolism.

- Changes in axonal transport and synaptic dysfunction.
