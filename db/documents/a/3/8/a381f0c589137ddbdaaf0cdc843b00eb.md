Patients usually present with generalized weakness and fatigue, gingival bleeding, petechiae or ecchymoses, visual changes secondary to retinal hemorrhages, epistaxis, or menorrhagia or infections. Patients may also present with thrombotic complications such as deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, etc. Some patients with advanced disease may present with overt disseminated intravascular coagulation and frank bleeding.

Pancytopenia is common at presentation. The key difference between APL and AML is that many patients with the former ae at risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation and associated hyperfibrinolysis. The coagulopathy has to be managed as a medical emergency otherwise it often leads to CNS and pulmonary hemorrhage.
