Neurofibromas are the most common peripheral nerve sheath tumor and are often found either by patients or during routine skin exams. These lesions appear as soft, skin-colored papules or small subcutaneous nodules. There are three main types of neurofibromas: localized, diffuse, and plexiform. The majority of neurofibromas are sporadically-occurring and localized and have an extremely low risk of malignant transformation. However, the plexiform type is pathognomonic for neurofibromatosis type 1 and carries an increased risk of malignant transformation. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of neurofibromas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the appearance of a neurofibroma.
- Explain how to counsel a patient with multiple cutaneous neurofibromas or a plexiform neurofibroma.
- Identify management considerations for patients presenting with neurofibromas.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by neurofibromas.
