Diagnosis of erosive lichen planus is most often made based on a presentation with a typical history and clinical appearance. The biopsy of the lesion is usually performed when the diagnosis is in question or to rule out malignancy. As mentioned above, ulceration of the lesion may result in the absence of the characteristic lichenoid features on histology.

Regardless of the location of the patientâ€™s symptoms, full evaluation of the cutaneous and mucosal surfaces should be performed when lichen planus is suspected. Patients with lichen planus frequently present with manifestations in more than one location. A thorough review of other systems should also be obtained to identify any symptoms suggestive of mucosal involvement, such as esophagus, conjunctiva, urethra, anus, or larynx. Untreated erosive lichen planus frequently progresses to scarring and functional impairment, especially when undiagnosed and untreated.
