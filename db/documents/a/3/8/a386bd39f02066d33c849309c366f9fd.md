SD-OCT has revolutionized the detailed architectural view of the macular hole. Typically, a true operculum (containing neuroretinal tissue) is not seen in a macular hole, compared to operculated holes in peripheral retinal degenerations that have a portion of avulsed retinal tissue (operculum) floating in the vitreous. However, two different types of opercula have been described in stage 3 full-thickness macular hole.

- Pseudo-opercula (61%) - contains only glial tissue (Müller cells and fibrous astrocytes). Anatomical closure rates were better compared to true opercula, but visual outcomes were similar once the macular hole closed, though chances of a final vision of at least 20/40 were higher in the pseudo-opercula group.

- True opercula (39%) - contains both glial tissue and neural tissue (cones) due to avulsion of neuroretinal tissue from full-thickness foveal tear. This also suggests that direct foveal traction has a role in the pathogenesis of macular holes.

Posterior cortical vitreoschisis occurs before macular hole formation, which leaves a hypocellular vitreous attached to the macula. Very minimum cellular proliferation usually takes place before the onset of a macular hole with minimum hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the retinal pigment epithelium.

We often get the epiretinal membrane attached to the vitreoretinal interface.

The loss of photoreceptors in the area of hole formation is another characteristic feature.
