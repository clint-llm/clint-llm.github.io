Osteonecrosis is a degenerative bone condition characterized by the death of cellular components of the bone secondary to an interruption of the subchondral blood supply.[1]Â It is also known as avascular necrosis, aseptic necrosis, and ischemic bone necrosis. It typically affects the epiphysis of long bones at weight-bearing joints. Severe cases can lead to the destruction of subchondral bone or the collapse of an entire joint.

The most common sites for AVN are the femoral head, knee, talus, and humeral head. The hip is the most common location overall.
