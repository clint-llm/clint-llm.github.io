Anatomical variations of the posterior tibial artery commonly arise from variations of the popliteal artery. The three most frequent variations in the branching of the popliteal artery are a high origin of the anterior tibial artery, the trifurcation of the anterior tibial artery, peroneal artery, and posterior tibial artery, and a hypoplastic or aplastic posterior tibial artery. The specific order and percentages of these variations differ slightly between literature reviews; however, they make up the top three anatomical variations in each review article.
