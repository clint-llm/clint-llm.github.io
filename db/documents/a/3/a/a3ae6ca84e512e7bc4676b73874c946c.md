Despite a number of available treatment options, the outcome of PED in recovery remains variable. Few defects may respond quickly with a single intervention, whereas others may take weeks to resolve, necessitating a multi-modal approach. The key to a good prognosis is early diagnosis and treatment because defects treated early recover more rapidly and completely. Therefore, the primary objective is to intervene as soon as possible to allow for rapid re-epithelialization and minimize secondary complications.
