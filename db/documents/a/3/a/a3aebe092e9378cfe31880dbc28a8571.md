In discussing the vascular supply provided by the brachial artery and its branches, one mustÂ note that in the case of the upper extremity; each respective muscle often receives vascular supply from more than one artery. The following is a listing of the branches of the brachial artery along with the structures to which they provide vascular supply:

- Brachial artery: biceps brachii muscle, triceps brachii muscle, coracobrachialis muscle

- Profunda brachii artery: deltoid muscle, triceps brachii muscle, anconeus muscle

- Superior ulnar collateral artery: supplies the periarticular arterial anastomoses of the elbow and elbow joint

- Inferior ulnar collateral artery: brachialis muscle, biceps brachii muscle, coracobrachialis muscle

- Ulnar artery: elbow joint, central and medial forearm muscles, common flexor sheath

- Radial artery: elbow joint, lateral forearm muscles, carpal bones and joints, thumb and lateral index finger
