Benedikt syndrome is best understood as a collection of symptoms, as described above, arising from mesencephalic damage to the ipsilateral red nucleus, substantia nigra, third cranial nerve, and cerebral peduncle.

Although often associated with thrombo-ischemic events as in Weber and Claude syndromes, there are scant case reports in the literature describing specifically ischaemic thromboembolism causing Benedikt syndrome, a study of 308 brainstem infarcts failed to detect a single case of Benedikt syndrome.
