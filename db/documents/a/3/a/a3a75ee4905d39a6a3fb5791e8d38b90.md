Macrocytosis refers to the finding of enlarged red blood cells (RBCs). The measurement of RBC size is reported in the complete blood count (CBC) as mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Most elevated MCV reports are accompanied by an elevated mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). Elevation of MCV and/or MCH suggests macrocytosis. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of macrocytosis and highlights the role of the healthcare team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of macrocytosis.
- Review the appropriate evaluation process for macrocytosis.
- Outline the management options available for macrocytosis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of macrocytosis and improve outcomes.
