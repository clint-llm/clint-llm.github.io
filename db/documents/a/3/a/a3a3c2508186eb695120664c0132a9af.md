Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is an agency of the United States Department of Labor, created under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) of 1970 by Congress and signed into law by President Richard Nixon on December 29, 1970. OSHA was created to ensure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women by setting and enforcing standards and by providing training, outreach, education, and assistance.

The passage of the OSH Act and subsequent creation of OSHA has led to unprecedented changes in workplaces across America, and a significant reduction in workplace hazards which can cause injuries, deaths, or illness.
