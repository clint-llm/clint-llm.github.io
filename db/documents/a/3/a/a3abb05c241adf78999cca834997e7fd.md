Man in a barrel syndrome results from damage to the bilateral upper extremity motor fibers, sparing the bilateral lower extremity motor fibers. Bilateral symmetric damage isolated to the upper extremity motor fibers in the motor cortex, corona radiata, internal capsule, basal ganglia, brainstem, anterior spinal cord, cervical nerve roots, brachial plexus, peripheral nerves, or neuromuscular junction can result in MIBS. Damage to the anterior horn cells, such as in HTLV-1 orÂ amyotrophic lateralizing sclerosis, can also present with bilateral upper extremity weakness.
