Merkel cells appear in the basal layer of the epidermis and use A-beta nerves to detect indentation and tactile stimuli to reconstruct spatial images. Merkel cells are involved in Merkel cell-neurite complexes located in skin areas with high tactile acuity, such as vibrissal follicles, glabrous fingerpads, and highly sensitive areas of hairy skin called touch domes. Merkel cells use slowly adapting type I (SAI-LTMs) responses to represent sustained pressure.

Ruffini endings are deep in the dermis and are postulated to have slow adapting type II mechanoreceptors (SAII-LTMs), but researchers have not fully studied them. They are large, thin spindle-shaped cylinders comprised of perineural tissue, such as collagen fibers and Swann cells, and have a fluid-filled capsule space as the inner core. They have low-threshold regions and sense skin stretch by interacting with collagen fibers.

Meissner corpuscles use A-beta as well to detect skin movement through type I rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors (RAI-LTMs). These are tuned to detect rapid movement, or flutter, and to control grip. They are in the dermal papillae layer of the skin and organize into flattened, horizontal lamellar cells enmeshed in connective tissue. These receptors have four times the sensitivity as Merkel cells but lack the ability to determine spatial differences. Their location is at the fingertips and soles of the feet. When feeling tactile indentation, the collagen fibers around the Meissner corpuscles stretch and cause the corpuscle to deform, triggering multiple action potentials. When the pressure is released, the corpuscle regains its shape, and again volleys off multiple action potentials. RAI-LTMs and SAI-LTMs most likely combine to form a complete picture of tactile stimulation.

Pacinian corpuscles detect high-frequency vibration and are in the dermis of glabrous skin. These cells use type II, rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors (RAII-LTMs). The corpuscles are large and oval-shaped with onion-shaped lamellar cells surrounding an A-beta nerve ending. RAII-LTMs are the most sensitive and cover large areas of skin. This arrangement makes them very adept at picking up vibrations with great accuracy but unable to localize the sensation with any spatial acuity. These nerve organs allow us to interpret the change in vibration as our hands manipulate objects.

The pilosebaceous unit, containing hair follicles, works to produce hair fibers and oils, participates in wound healing, and holds reserves of immune cells and pigment-producing cells. The isthmus and upper bulge region of a hair follicle contains a piloneural collar. The piloneural collar contains mechanoreceptors that transmit sensation through the hair follicle. Different hair follicle types are defined by their length, hair shaft thickness, and kinks. The types are called zigzag, auchene/awl, and guard.
