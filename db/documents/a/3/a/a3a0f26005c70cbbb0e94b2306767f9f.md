The bowel, which is composed of the small and large intestines, is vital to life as it absorbs nutrients necessary for all body functions. It is essential to understand the embryology of the bowel as errors in development serve as the basis for many congenital diseases.

The gastrointestinal tract divides into the foregut, midgut, and hindgut. The foregut forms the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and the duodenum up to the ampulla of Vater. The midgut forms the distal duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, ascending colon, and proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon. Finally, the hindgut forms the distal one-third of the transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and the rectum.
