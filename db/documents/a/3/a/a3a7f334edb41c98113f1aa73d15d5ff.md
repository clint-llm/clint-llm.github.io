The prognosis depends on the underlying etiology. In some cases, such as transient myasthenia and infantile botulism, there is complete recovery with minimal to no complications. Hypotonia in sepsis or due to other illnesses like CHF also improves once the disease is treated. Certain conditions, such as spinal muscular atrophy and Pompe disease (classic infantile type), can be fatal early in life. Having an interprofessional team approach towards the patient by providing rehabilitation services, nutritional support, home care services, and involving various specialists can alter the prognosis leading to better outcomes.
