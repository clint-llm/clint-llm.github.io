In the era of technological advances, a thorough examination of the respiratory system retains its importance in diagnosing disorders of the respiratory system. Auscultation of the chest is among the oldest bedside diagnostic techniques used to assess airflow through airways. It is an easy, safe, non-invasive and cost-effective diagnostic technique.

**Pathophysiology**

Over the years there have been various theories explaining the mechanism of egophony. In 1894, Dr. Frederick Taylor described egophony as a musical discord.

**Mechanism of egophony in consolidation
**

The sound of the vowel "E" has a low frequency in the range of 100 to 200 Hz as compared to the low frequency of "A" which may reach up to 600 Hz. The sound "E" consists of a high frequency in the range of 2000 to 3500 Hz. Consolidation creates a dense medium that facilitates the transmission of lower frequencies. Hence in a patient with an underlying consolidation, an "E" is transformed into an "A."

**Mechanism of egophony in pleural effusion
**

In the case of pleural effusion, fluid accumulates in the pleural space. This fluid compresses the overlying lung parenchyma, making it more solid than usual. Due to this change, there is an alteration in the lung acoustics that preferentially transmits higher sound frequencies and gives rise to an egophony.
