Serious adverse effects of warfarin include bleeding and significant hemorrhage. A significant hemorrhage (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, hematemesis, intraocular bleeding, hemarthrosis) can occur at virtually any site on the body. Patients should receive education about easy bleeding or bruising, which is a common adverse effect. A clinician should also counselÂ patients about the proper management of cuts, bruises, and nosebleeds. The risk of bleeding and hemorrhage is dependent on multiple variables, including the intensity of anticoagulation and patient susceptibility. Individuals should undergo an assessment for their risk, with appropriate adjustments to their treatment plan made accordingly.

Other adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and an altered sense of taste.

Rare cases of purple toe syndrome, warfarin-induced skin necrosis, and there are reports of calciphylaxis with warfarin therapy.
