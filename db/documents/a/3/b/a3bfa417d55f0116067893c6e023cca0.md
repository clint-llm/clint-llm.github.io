The hyaluronic acid filler is available in varying sized, preloaded syringes, and the concentration depends on the specific brand chosen.

When administered intraarticularly, injection is performed directly into the joint space of the knee. It is recommended to aspirate any joint effusion if present. Strict aseptic technique is necessary during the administration. Injection of lidocaine or another local anesthetic is optional before the intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid. The patient should refrain from vigorous or prolonged weight-bearing physical activity for at least 48 hours post-injection. Several preparations are available, each with differences in the number of injections in each series, molecular weight, origin (avian or bacterial), viscosity, ad presence or absence of cross-linkage.

For topical use, it is recommended to clean the wound with normal saline and debride the wound if needed before applying hyaluronic acid preparation. A thin layer shall be applied to the ulcer or wound, and excessive rubbing shall be avoided. After application, the wound shall be covered with a sterile non-stick gauze pad or dressing. For use in dermatoses, hyaluronic acid preparation can be applied directly to the affected area.
