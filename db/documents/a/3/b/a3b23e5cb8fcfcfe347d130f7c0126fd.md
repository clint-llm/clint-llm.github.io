Most cases of food poisoning and non-foodborne diarrheal disease have minimal to no complications if volume status is adequately managed. However, the bloodstream infection can result in toxin-mediated intravascular hemolysis and septic shock.

A beta toxin produced by type C strains can cause hemorrhagic necrosis of the jejunum, also known as enteritis necroticans or pigbel. It usually occurs in resource-limited countries (particularly Papua New Guinea) following pork consumption or has been associated with the consumption of pork chitterlings in resource-rich settings. In addition, the simultaneous ingestion of sweet potatoes may often potentiate it. Sweet potatoes contain trypsin inhibitors that prevent the intestinal degradation of the toxin. Symptoms of pigbel abdominal distention, pain, and dilated thickened bowel loops with segmental necrosis.

Clostridial myonecrosis may require extensive debridement, amputation, and complications of severe sepsis, including shock, encephalopathy, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death.
