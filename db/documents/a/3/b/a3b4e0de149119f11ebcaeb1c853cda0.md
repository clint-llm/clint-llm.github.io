The diagnosis and management of pinguecula are essential for the healthcare professional. The interprofessional team can include ophthalmologists, optometrists, and nurses. The optometrist and nurses play a crucial role in asymptomatic cases of pinguecula. Good communication and counseling of patients by optometrist and nurses will educate the patient regarding the risk factors for causing pinguecula. This approach would, in turn, prevent the progression of pinguecula or worsening of symptoms.
