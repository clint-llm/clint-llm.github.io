Administration requires the removal of contact lenses. This topical ophthalmic solution is instilled into the eye in droplet form. The lacrimal sac should be compressed with the fingertip for 2 to 3 minutes after administration to reduce systemic absorption and systemic adverse effects. The tip of the dropper should not touch any surface as it might contaminate the drug. In a child, ensure the drug does not get to their mouth. Hands require washing before and after instilling the drop. The individual should avoid driving and not engage in potentially hazardous activities during pupillary dilation. After pupillary dilation, sensitivity to light may occur, and sunglasses may be necessary.

An infrequently used option is spray application. Several studies have shown that using tropicamide in its vaporized form is just as effective in achieving increased pupil diameter but with less patient-reported discomfort.

Along with the active ingredient (tropicamide), the drop has multiple inactive ingredients. These include benzalkonium chloride (preservative), purified water, edetate disodium dihydrate, and boric acid. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide are used to adjust pH to 4.0 to 5.8. For refraction, one drop of tropicamide 1% is put in each eye 5 minutes apart. For examination of the fundus, 0.5% strength is an option. Tropicamide may dilate pupils in acute anterior uveitis, and one drop every 5 to 10 minutes should optimally dilate the pupil.
