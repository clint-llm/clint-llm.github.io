Candidal species cause oral candidiasis when a patient's host immunity becomes disrupted. This disruption can be local, secondary to oral corticosteroid use. Overgrowth of the fungus then leads to the formation of a pseudomembrane. Vaginal infections can colonize neonates as they pass through the birth canal. Alternatively, neonates and infants may contract the disease through colonized breasts when breastfeeding. A patient's oral Candida infection can often lead to GI involvement and subsequent candidal diaper dermatitis. Candidal species thrive in moist environments. As such, females can develop vaginal candidiasis as well.

In healthy patients, the patient's immune system and normal bacteria flora inhibit candida growth. Consequently, immunosuppression such as diabetes, dentures, steroid use, malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, and recent antibiotic use often leads to the disease.
