A small number of cases describe symptomatic hypocalcemia following pamidronate administration. In each case, however, patients had pre-existing derangements contributing to their symptoms, including renal insufficiency and low vitamin D levels secondary to lifestyle, previous GI surgery, and medication history. Recommendations for the management of pamidronate overdose include appropriate correction of the electrolyte disturbance and pre-treatment supplementation with calcium and Vitamin D.
