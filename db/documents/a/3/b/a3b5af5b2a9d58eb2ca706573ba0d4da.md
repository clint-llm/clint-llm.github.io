RNAPâ€™s mechanism of transcribing DNA into RNA is highly conserved across prokaryotes, archaea, and eukaryotes. To begin the process of bacterial transcription, along with core polymerase, an additional specificity factor is also necessary. These specificity proteins recognize certain elements in the promoter DNA and determine the start site of transcription. In bacteria, these specificity factors have the name of sigma subunits. Sigma, together with core, form the bacterial RNAP. Though research has now identified hundreds of sigma, the main sigma factor, sigma70 in Escherichia coli or sigma A in other bacteria, is responsible for exponential growth and regulation of housekeeping genes.

To initiate the process of bacterial transcription, sigma and core together first binds to double-stranded DNA.
