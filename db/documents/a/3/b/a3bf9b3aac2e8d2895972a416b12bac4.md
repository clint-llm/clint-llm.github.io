All decompression sickness cases should have initial treatment with 100% oxygen until HBO therapy is available. Neurological, pulmonary, and mottled skin lesions should be treated with HBO therapy even if seen several days after development. Fluid administration is indicated, as this helps minimize dehydration. The recommendation to administer aspirin is no longer valid, as analgesics may mask symptoms. Patient placement is in the supine position or the recovery position if vomiting occurs. The Trendelenburg position and the left lateral decubitus position (Durant's maneuver) may be potentially beneficial if air emboli are suspected, but these positions are no longer recommended for extended periods, owing to concerns regarding cerebral edema. If the patient experiences an altered mental status or is unconscious, initial management should focus on the treatment and stabilization of ABCs, (airway, breathing, and circulation). Patients should receive HBO treatment as soon as possible.

Patients that need evacuation to a definitive treatment center by aeromedical transport should fly on pressurized aircraft. If unpressurized aircraft, such as helicopters, are the only means of transport then flight altitude should be limited to 300 m or 1000 ft if possible.
