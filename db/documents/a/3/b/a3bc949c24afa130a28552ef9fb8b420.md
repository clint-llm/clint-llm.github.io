Kallmann syndrome and genetic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism patients require life long hormone replacement therapy for normal sexual function and fertility. Fertility may not be restored in some cases because the response to hormonal therapy varies from person to person.

Pituitary adenomas may resolve spontaneously if small in size (microadenomas). Microadenomas should have periodic monitoring. Macroadenomas require imaging at least annually to monitor enlargement and may require surgical removal.

Stress-related hypogonadotropic hypogonadism usually resolves after the alleviation of stress and has a good prognosis. Weight-loss related hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, like anorexia nervosa, usually resolves after weight gain.
