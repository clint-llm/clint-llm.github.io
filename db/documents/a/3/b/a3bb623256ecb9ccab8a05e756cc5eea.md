CMV endotheliitis can cause irreversible endothelial dysfunction, vision loss, and secondary glaucoma. In the Japan Endotheliitis study, 60.6% of the eyes retained corneal clarity without additional corneal transplantation. Complications associated with systemic treatment such as pancytopenia and myelosuppression should be monitored periodically. Systematic treatment should be discontinued if pancytopenia or myelosuppression occurs.
