Herpes gingivostomatitis is a viral infection characterized by high-grade fever and painful oral lesions, occurring most commonly in children from ages 6 months to 5 years. Out-patient management is sufficient in most situations, but hospital admission may be warranted if the patient develops complications. The disease is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a primary care provider, an internist, a pediatrician, a nurse practitioner, an emergency department physician, an infectious disease specialist, and a pharmacist. Coordination by different health care experts is necessary to improve patient outcomes and enhance patient care.
