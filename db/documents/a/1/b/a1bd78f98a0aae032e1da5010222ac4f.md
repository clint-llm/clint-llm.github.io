Prevalence is greater in children than in adults, with recent studies demonstrating 0.77 adult visits to every 1 pediatric clinic visit for Eustachian tube dysfunction. An estimated 90% of children develop otitis media with effusion, a recognized sequela of ETD, prior to starting school. Approximately 1% of the adult population is diagnosed with ETD. Males are more likely to be diagnosed before the age of 20, with females more likely affected at older ages. No statistically significant difference between seasons has been proven.
