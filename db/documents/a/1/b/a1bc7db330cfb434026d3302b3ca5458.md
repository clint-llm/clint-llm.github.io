Complicating factors during diagnosis and treatment of CRE is identifying resistance to previously discussed drug regimens. Commonly induced resistance mechanisms in CRE to other active antimicrobials include aminoglycosides, fosfomycin, and BLBLI.

The acquisition of a single point mutation in the 16S rRNA methyltransferase leads to resistance of all aminoglycosides.de novo or in combination with other resistance mechanisms. It is best studied in NDM cpCRE but can also be present in many other carbapenem producers.E.coli, but many other Enterobacteriaceae, including ESBL and CRE, do not demonstrate resistance. Resistance to this drug is typically seen by selecting for resistant microbes through monotherapy of fosfomycin.bla and bla induce resistance, respectively.
