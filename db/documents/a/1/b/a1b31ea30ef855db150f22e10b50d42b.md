Parents should be educated on the importance of early vision exams for their children. School vision screenings may be the first time amblyopia is suspected. If a child has been diagnosed with amblyopia, parents should be educated that if untreated, the vision loss from amblyopia is typically irreversible. The importance of treatment should be emphasized with the parents. Children may not want to wear glasses or patches, but parents need to ensure that their child goes through with the treatment. Providers should encourage parents at every visit to continue treatment, as amblyopia treatment may need to continue for a long period of time.
