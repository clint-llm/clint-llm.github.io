Pentoxifylline (PTXF) is a vasoactive agent that improves the flow of blood by reducing its viscosity.

It is FDA approved for the symptomatic treatment of claudication. It has been found to be inferior to cilostazol or a supervised exercise program.

- Claudication is associated with chronic occlusive peripheral vascular disorders of the lower extremities.

Pentoxifylline is also used off-label for the treatment of venous ulcers and severe alcoholic hepatitis.

- Venous ulcers:  A Cochrane review found pentoxifylline to be effective in treating venous ulcers with or without compression therapy compared to placebo or no treatment.

- Severe alcoholic hepatitis:  Pentoxifylline is a tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitor, a major cytokine in the pathogenesis of alcoholic hepatitis. In a meta-analysis, researchers noted pentoxifylline to be superior to placebo in the prevention of fatal hepatorenal syndrome without any survival benefit in one month. It may be an effective treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis when there are contraindications to corticosteroids.
