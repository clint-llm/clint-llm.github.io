In addition to the physical exam, assessment of substance use should include a thorough history that screens several psychiatric symptoms to diagnose and rule out disorders. The patient should be asked about any current life stressors, and the patient should be screened for current depression, mania, trauma, anxiety, and psychosis.

Current substance use screening questions include:

- Which substance(s) are used? Certain substances can cause more negatives effects than others, so it is important to determine which ones were used, which may help in the recovery process.

- When was the last time the substance was used, and how much and how often was it used? The negative consequences of withdrawal symptoms may be fatal, such as from benzodiazepines or alcohol. If the provider was notified of the last use, then appropriate treatment can be administered on time. Also, recent substance use can influence an individual’s behavior and cognitive processes, such as being agitated from Methamphetamine or Cocaine. This would help in the treatment process. For example, a patient may not need inpatient admission if the exhibited psychotic symptoms were substance-induced instead of a psychotic episode of Schizophrenia. The frequency of substance use helps determine the severity of the dependency.

- Any experience of withdrawal symptoms? Some substance use can lead to severe withdrawal symptoms. Alcohol and Benzodiazepine withdrawal can lead to seizures and have the potential to be fatal.

- What is the user’s perception of using the substance(s)? How an individual perceives illicit substances will vary from person to person. Some individuals use substances to cope with life stressors, while others may use it as an alternative to medications such as cannabis for treating their anxiety.

- Any feelings or readiness to change, such as cutting back use or quitting? Does the patient have any cravings for the substance?

Past Psychiatric History: if the patient has any psychiatric history, detailed information regarding mental health history should be obtained. When asking about a period in the past, it is easier to have the patient recall an event by age than recall the year. The questions to ask include:

- Have you been diagnosed with any psychiatric diagnosis in the past by a physician? This question should be asked, and it should be verified if the diagnosis was made by a medical professional or if someone else told them the diagnosis.

- Any history of medication trials for substance use or other mental health disorder? This open-ended question may not have a complete answer because the patient may have difficulty recalling the complicated names of medications from the past. If the patient affirms taking medications but cannot recall the name, an effective way to get the information is to call the pharmacy to get the list or get the medical records from their last prescriber.

- Any history of self-harm or attempted suicide? Perceptual disturbance during an intoxicated state may lead to hallucinations, such as having bugs or snakes on their skin. The visual hallucinations may lead to self-harm to rid self of the hallucinations. Also, auditory hallucinations of commanding nature may result in a suicide attempt. If past suicide attempts are identified, then it is recommended to ask when the first attempt was, how many were attempted, and what lead to the suicide attempts,

- Any history of violence towards others? A study regarding ED visits due to Cocaine-induced chest pain found 40% of the patients were involved in violence a year after discharge from the ED.

- At what age were the first and last psychiatric hospitalization? How many hospitalizations regarding substance use or other mental health illness can you recall? These questions should be asked in more detail and asked about the differences of being treated in the ED, such as for psychiatric stability or due to intoxication, and if the patient was admitted to inpatient for stabilization. Those who are treated in the ED due to intoxication usually are stabilized and discharged after a day. But those admitted to the inpatient for psychiatric care are admitted for at least 5 days or so until they are psychiatrically stabilized.

Substance Use History Questions:

- At what age did the individual initiate use of the substance? This question is asked because substance use affects brain development and can influence impulsive/risky behaviors from an early age. Substance use at an early age can predispose people to be cardiac and neurological disorders in adulthood.

- What benefit is sought out from substance use? Those who use substances may not always use them for recreational use. Some may use it for self-treatment of their co-morbid psychiatric or medical illnesses or dealing with stress. For example, those who are diagnosed with ADHD may use Cocaine or Methamphetamine as an aid to focus. Some may use Cannabis to treat their anxiety, insomnia, or neuropathic pain. Therefore, it is important to be aware of what is the motivation behind substance use.

- Has the individual ever attempted to cut back or stop using? This question helps to determine the motivation for change.  It should be followed up by questions assessing periods of success and potential barriers to implementing strategies to reduce or eliminate use.

- Has the patient previously received treatment for a substance use disorder? Treatment options can include community self-help groups, outpatient treatment clinics, intensive outpatient programs, medical detoxification, or residential treatment facilities (Rehab)

- Is there a family history of drug use? If so, have there been any fatalities from substance use? It is important to be aware of any substance use by other family members because family influences the individual’s risk of substance use.
