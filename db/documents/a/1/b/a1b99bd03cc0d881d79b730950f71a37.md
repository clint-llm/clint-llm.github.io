The most common adverse effect associated with protamine administration includes an anaphylactic response consisting of systemic hypotension, pulmonary vasoconstriction, allergic reactions, pulmonary hypertension, bronchoconstriction, and bradycardia. The incidence of anaphylactic reactions ranges from 0.06% to 10.6%.

Excess protamine can also negatively impact platelet function, interfere with coagulation factors, and stimulate the breakdown of the clot.

Pulmonary hypertension is a potentially catastrophic adverse response to protamine administration; it is believed to be due to thromboxane A2 release. This release of thromboxane has been shown in studies to increase pulmonary vascular resistance by up to 10 times.

Hypotension from protamine infusion is thought to be due to intracellular calcium release and nitric oxide release.
