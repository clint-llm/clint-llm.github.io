The development of malignant tumors, i.e., basal cell carcinoma, within a nevus sebaceous is a reported complication occurring in less than 1% of these lesions. Other non-malignant basaloid proliferations likely occur with higher frequency. Biopsy of any suspicious growths within this epidermal nevus should be performed and interpreted by an experienced dermatopathologist to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures. Other extracutaneous malignancies should be screened based on symptoms and risk factors.
