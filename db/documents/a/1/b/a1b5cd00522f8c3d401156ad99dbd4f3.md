The use of the HU to measure tissue density has aided radiologists in the interpretation of images and diagnosis of disease. Its use is identified in different specialties of medicine.

The following are some of the uses of HU that have been identified in the literature:

- In diagnosing fatty liver

- As a quantitative measurement in the evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodules and thyroid nodules

- To determine bone mineral density

- To estimate bone quality before spinal instrumentation,

- HU of paraspinal muscles have helped identify patients at risk for sarcopenia

- In the characterization of bile duct lesions

- Predictor of growth in meningiomas

- Predictor of spontaneous expulsion of lower ureteric stone

- HU of interpeduncular cistern hematomas can predict symptomatic vasospasms

- In the differential diagnosis of odontogenic cysts

- In predicting outcomes of intracerebral hemorrhage by measuring the HU in the perihematomal edema

- In identifying tandem occlusion in acute ischemic stroke

- In the diagnosis of acute venous thrombosis in the pediatric population

With continued further advancements in technology, researchers are studying semi-automated measurements of tissue to aid the radiologist in the evaluation and diagnosis of disease. Semi-automated HU measurements of solitary pulmonary nodules have shown to be an accurate approach to determining malignant from benign solitary pulmonary nodules.
