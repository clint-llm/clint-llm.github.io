Dosunmu et al. studied the causes of fourth nerve palsy and found that the most common causes were presumed congenital (49%), hypertension (18%), and trauma (18%). Other causes seen included hypertension with diabetes (5%), post-neurosurgery (3%), intracranial neoplasms (1%), diabetes (1%), and post-Herpes Zoster ophthalmicus (1%).  No cause could be determined for 4% of cases.

In a study by Bagheri et al.,  presumed congenital was found to be the etiology of fourth nerve palsy in 76.7% of cases, and trauma accounted for 16.4 % of the cases.
