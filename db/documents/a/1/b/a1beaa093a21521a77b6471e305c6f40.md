The traumatic open abdomen involves an incision along the midline of the anterior abdomen. The anatomy of the abdominal wall at this location, from superficial to deep, consists of the following:

- Skin

- Subcutaneous tissue (Camper's fascia)

- Superficial fasciaÂ (Scarpa's)

- The linea alba or midline of the rectus sheath (composed of the aponeuroses of the external oblique

- Internal oblique, and transversus abdominis muscles),

- Transversalis fascia.

Below the transversalis fascia lie the preperitoneal space and parietal peritoneum. All of these layers are divided to gain access to the abdominal viscera.
