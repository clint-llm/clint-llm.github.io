A suspicion of central centrifugal alopecia should be considered in every case of alopecia involving the vertex in female patients of Afro-Caribbean descent.

A hair pull test needs to be performed to rule out telogen effluvium. This is a test usually yields 2 to 5 telogen hairs on pulling 50 to 100 hairs in a normal adult, but it may be increased up to 3 to 5 times in telogen effluvium. Signs of hyperandrogenism like acne, hirsutism, prolongation of menstrual cycles, and obesity need to be noted as they are associated with female pattern hair loss.

An extreme elevation in androgens is suggestive of a virilizing tumor. Further, nutritional deficiencies need to be ruled out. This can be done by ascertaining the levels of vitamin D, serum iron, ferritin, and total iron-binding capacity. A baseline complete blood counts, renal function test, liver and thyroid function tests, syphilis serology, and antinuclear antibody screening helps in ruling out other minor causes of hair loss. An absence of hyphae in KOH mount from the scalp scraping may help in ruling out tinea capitis. Finally, two 4-mm punch biopsies (for vertical and horizontal sectioning) from the active margin of the alopecia may help in the confirmation of the diagnosis.
