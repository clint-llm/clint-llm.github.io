A major, compelling solution to the challenge of healthcare, both on the individual and collective levels, is to effect preventive change through lifestyle modification. This concept is not new: Hippocrates taught about the importance of prevention over 2000 years ago.

It has been estimated that only one-fifth of the modifiable determinants of healthcare come from the care medical practitioners provide (figure 1).

In 2009, researchers analyzed lifestyle and body weight using pre-existing data from the large European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutritionâ€“Potsdam study.

Patients with these four characteristics had almost a four-fifths reduction in chronic disease (78%, 95% CI 27 to 83%) after adjusting for sex, age, occupational and educational status. A subsequent study using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that only 2.7% of Americans have a lifestyle that approximates the four factors mentioned in the previous study.
