PGÂ is associated with the presence of IgG autoantibodies against BP180, which predominantly recognize the NC16A domain of BP180. BP180 is not only expressed in the skin, but also in the first trimester of pregnancy in the placental cytotrophoblastic and syncytiotrophoblastic cells as well as in the epithelial cells of the amniotic membrane. Autoimmunization may occur due to loss of tolerance to this 180 kDa placental antigen, resulting in a local allogeneic reaction against the fetoplacental unit. This process, which is promoted by abnormal expression of placental HLA class II antigens, is accompanied by alterations in the placental basement membrane. After that, there is an immune response in the skin.
