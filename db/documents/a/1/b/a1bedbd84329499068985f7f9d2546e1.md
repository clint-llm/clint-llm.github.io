For infectious disease, initial measures are often aimed at prevention. Knowledge of endemic areas, awareness of nocturnal sandfly activity, and exposure to animals in areas known to harbor disease is important. As sandflies are very small, even smaller than mosquitos, a bed net with maze patterns three times smaller than standard is required. Further impregnation with permethrin may also decrease risk. Attempts at vaccinating dogs and utilizing insecticide dog collars has also been shown to decrease disease burden.

For limited CL, disease often resolves spontaneously. However dermatologic disease can be destructive, increase secondary infections, or leave permanent disabling scars. First line treatment options for the limited cutaneous disease include intralesional forms of pentavalent antimonals, including sodium stibolgluconate and meglumine antimoniate. Alternative regimens include systemic miltefosine, amphotericin B, pentamidine isethionate, paromomycine, or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Many of these systemic agents are limited by severe adverse effects. Heat or cryotherapy are treatment options reserved for cases of < 5 cutaneous lesions.

For patients with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, systemic treatment is often required. Meglumine or stibogluconate have been first-line therapy and the WHO recommends antimonial pentavalent for a mucocutaneous disease. Treatment success rates have been as high 95% if high dosing strategies are utilized, although low dosing strategies are often used to minimize adverse effects. Azole therapies (i.e., fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole) have been used in isolation and in combination with amphotericin B. Their use is limited by regional variants of the disease and resistance as well as having a minimal additive benefit to the already effective amphotericin. Agents established with good cure rates (= 90%) include amphotericin B (liposomal or colloidal dispersion), amphotericin B deoxicholate, and pentamidine. Other, less effective therapies include antimonial pentavalent and itraconazole.

Visceral leishmaniasis requires treatment, and agents commonly used include antimony sodium stibogluconate, amphotericin, paromomycin, and oral miltefosine. The agent of choice is often determined by native species as resistances vary tremendously. Summatively, sodium stibogluconate is used in East Africa but has high failure rates in India. Liposomal amphotericin B is available primarily in resource-rich countries, and other formulations of amphotericin B are used in India. Paromomycin has good cure rates in India but is not as efficacious in Africa. It is used as a combination therapy in Africa with sodium stibogluconate. Pentamidine is used in South America for primary treatment and as secondary prevention of disease in patients with AIDS in Europe.
