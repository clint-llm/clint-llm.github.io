Management of palatal clefting requires an appreciation of the anatomy and embryology as well as the physiology of the upper aerodigestive tract and how it relates to speech, swallowing, breathing, and hearing. The incidence of palatal clefting ranges from 1 to 25 per 10,000 live births, with the exact number primarily dependent on patient ethnicity; White-race individuals are most likely to be affected, and Blacks are least likely.

Cleft palates come in many forms, including submucous clefting, secondary palate clefting, primary and secondary palate clefting, and complete clefting, which includes the alveolar ridge and lip. Cleft width, laterality, and degree of velopharyngeal dysfunction vary among individuals, as do comorbidities. Roughly half of all palatal clefting cases are nonsyndromic, but myriad syndromes may also be associated with cleft palates. Every patient is different, and every cleft palate is potentially unique.
