Getting a good history is vital in the care of patients with a diabetic ulcer. The history should include the duration of diabetes, glycemic control, other pre-existing complications of diabetes including sensory neuropathy, history of peripheral vascular disease, callus, previous ulcer, prior treatment, and the outcome. The detailed history should also include information regarding the footwear and foot.

The clinical examination should include examining the peripheral pulses of the feet, looking for any anatomical anomalies, the presence of callus, signs of vascular insufficiency, which may indicate loss of hair, muscle atrophy, and location of the ulcer. Also assess for the presence of purulence, scabs, and evidence of neuropathy by examining with a monofilament.

Features indication neuropathy include:

- Paresthesia

- Hypo or hyperesthesia

- Dysesthesia

- Anhydrosis

Ulcers are most common in the weight-bearing areas such as the plantar metatarsal head, heel, tips of hammer toes and other prominent areas. Other physical features include hammertoes, brittle nails, calluses, and fissures.
