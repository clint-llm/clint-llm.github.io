Pain on propofol injection usually occurs in younger patients from 20 to 40 years old. It is also more common in females and in a peripheral IV site.

When propofol infusion syndrome was first identified, the typical presentation was a pediatric patient in the ICU under sedation with high doses of propofol.  With the reporting of more cases, the average age has increased to around 58 years old.  Overall, the incidence of PRIS is 1.1% in those who receive propofol ­­ infusions.  PRIS more commonly occurs in males than in females. Studies have varied the estimated mortality rate from 18 to 32%.
