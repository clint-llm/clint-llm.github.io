Z-plasties are typicallyÂ used by plastic surgeons but are also routinely employed by facial plastic surgeons, otolaryngologists, ophthalmologists, urologists, orthopedic surgeons, and dermatologists, among others. The scope of the procedure may be limited, with the surgery occurring under local anesthesia in a clinic, or it may be significant, requiring a full operating room and staff operating as a coordinated interprofessional team. For this reason, ensuring that not only is there a surgeon experienced with flap transposition techniques but also assistants familiar with the necessary instrumentation and nurses comfortable managing the postoperative course of patients who have undergone Z-plasty is critical to optimizing functional and aesthetic outcomes.
