The most commonly used peak flow meter is a simple hand-held device that patients can reuse many times. Various manufacturer's models vary widely in styling, but they are typically cylindrical plastic devices with a mouthpiece on one end and an indicator and readings along the body.

Peak expiratory flow rate, by itself, has limitations that make it inferior to FEV1 in clinical utility. However, traditionally FEV1 measurement at home was not practical or technologically feasible. Several miniaturized smart devices are now available on the market that will calculate both parameters, and some are even capable of interfacing with other devices to allow the automatic tabulation of data and transmission to health care providers. Prices for these devices continue to decline and are commonly available for less than one hundred dollars. Clinicians should prepare for these types of devices as they become more prevalent.
