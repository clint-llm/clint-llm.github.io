Sarcocystosis is caused by parasites of the Sarcocystis species, an intracellular protozoan parasite. It has a global distribution and is sporadically reported to cause human infections. Sarcocystosis is relatively rare as a majority of human infections tend to be asymptomatic and are detected incidentally. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, evaluation, and treatment of sarcocystosis infection and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in identifying and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology and epidemiology of sarcocystosis.
- Explain the evaluation and available investigations in patients with sarcocystosis. 
- Review the available therapeutic options in the treatment of sarcocystosis.
- Summarize the importance of an inter-professional team to enhance the clinical outcomes in patients with sarcocystosis.
