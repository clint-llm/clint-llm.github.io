Metolazone is a cardiovascular agent, specifically a quinazoline diuretic related to the thiazide class. Metolazone works by inhibiting sodium transport across the epithelium of the renal tubules (mostly in the distal tubules), decreasing sodium reabsorption, and increasing sodium, chloride, and water excretion. The FDA has approved metolazone to treat salt and water retention, causing edema accompanying congestive heart failure or kidney disease. It is available in a generic formulation in the United States. It is used alone or with other diuretics in congestive heart failure, to treat hypertension, and in other conditions where diuresis provides a clinical benefit. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of metolazone, pertinent for interprofessional team members in treating patients with conditions where it is of clinical value.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of metolazone.
- Review the various indications for using metolazone in patient care.
- Summarize the adverse events associated with metolazone therapy.
- Outline the contraindications to metolazone therapy.
