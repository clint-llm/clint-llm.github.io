According to the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, hyperbaric oxygen treatment should be given at a pressure of 2.0 to 2.5, with oxygen administration for a total duration of 60 to 90 minutes per treatment. Depending on the patient’s clinical condition, hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be administered 1 or 2 times daily. There are no guidelines for the optimal number of treatments needed for intracranial abscesses (ICA). However, in the largest series of ICA patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, the average number of sessions was 14 in the absence of osteomyelitis. Radiologic findings and a patient’s clinical response should be used to help determine the duration of hyperbaric oxygen therapy needed, thus requiring each patient’s therapy to be individualized.
