The central nervous system comes from the neurectoderm, which gives rise to the neural tube and neural crest. The neural tube begins to form anatomical structures, induced by various transcription factors such as sonic the hedgehog, allowing proper migration, orientation, and patterning of cells. The rostral anterior and caudal posterior neuropores close when the neural tube forms. Problems with these neural tube closures result in neural tube defects with elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein in prenatal testing. Following closure, the primary vesicles form. The primary vesicles include the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon. The primary vesicles will then give rise to the secondary vesicles, including the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, metencephalon, and myelencephalon. The cerebral hemispheres, including the somatosensory cortex, arise from the telencephalon. The telencephalon is a secondary vesicle that comes from the prosencephalon.
