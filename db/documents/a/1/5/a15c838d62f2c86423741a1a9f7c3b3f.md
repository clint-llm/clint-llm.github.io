Pathological hip fractures can be as a result of either primary bone tumors or metastatic disease. If malignancy is suspected, then a full-length femoral X-ray and MRI of the femur should be obtained to assess the extent of the malignancy. Surgical management is then dependent on the disease prognosis following discussion with the oncology physicians. A curative resection and reconstruction is an option with curable disease. For patients with an incurable malignancy, then palliative procedures to reduce pain and restore mobility are indicated. Intra-operative tissue sampling can be useful to determine the origin of the primary tumor.
