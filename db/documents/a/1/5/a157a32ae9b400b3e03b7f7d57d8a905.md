PHFs classically fall under a bimodal distribution by age and energy level.Â  This bimodal pattern is very common and clinicians should recognize the high-energy (e.g. Motor vehicle accident in young patients) versus low-energy (e.g. elderly patient status post ground level fall) paradigm in various groups and fracture patterns

PHFs most commonly occur in patients over 65 years of age
