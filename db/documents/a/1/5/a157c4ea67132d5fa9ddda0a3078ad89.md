The clinical presentation of zinc toxicity from acute ingestion includes vomiting, hematemesis, nausea, muscle cramps, watery diarrhea, and diffuse abdominal pain, which has a broad differential with many possible causes. Thus a very high level of suspicion is required to diagnose zinc toxicosis. Certain patient populations may be at higher risk, such as pediatric patients or patients with psychiatric illness who may ingest nutritional supplements in a large volume or a foreign body containing zinc.

Acute toxic ingestions of zinc sulfate and concentrated zinc chloride will primarily cause GI effects, with abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and hematemesis due to caustic effects. There are also rare reports of renal injury.
