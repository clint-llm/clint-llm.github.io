Azotemia is a biochemical abnormality, defined as elevation, or buildup of, nitrogenous products (BUN-usually ranging 7 to 21 mg/dL), creatinine in the blood, and other secondary waste products within the body. Raising the level of nitrogenous waste is attributed to the inability of the renal system to filter (decreased glomerular filtration rate-GFR) such as waste products adequately. It is a typical feature of both acute and chronic kidney injury. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and management of azotemia.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of azotemia.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with azotemia.
- Summarize the management options available for azotemia.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with azotemia.
