Menkes kinky hair disease is a rare X-linked recessive progressive multisystemic disease of copper metabolism. Patients usually exhibit a severe clinical course with death in early childhood. Early diagnosis of Menkes disease is clinically very challenging because of the subtle clinical features and nonspecific biochemical markers. Accurate diagnosis is important for proper management to reduce morbidity and mortality and also for parental counseling and prenatal diagnosis.

Menkes et al first describedÂ the disease in 1962.
