HDL is composed of cholesterol, triglycerides, and various apolipoproteins. In particular, the composition of HDL is apolipoproteins Apo-AI, Apo-AII, Apo-AIV, Apo-AV, Apo-C1, Apo-CII, Apo-CIII, and Apo-E.[1]

- Apo-AI is the primary structural apolipoprotein of HDL and activates Lecithin–Cholesterol AcylTransferase (LCAT).

- Apo-AII is also a structural protein in HDL and acts as an activator of hepatic lipase.

- Apo-IV has an unknown function.

- Apo-AV activates lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is responsible for triglyceride lipolysis.

- Apo-CI is responsible for activating LCAT.

- Apo-CII is responsible for activating LPL

- Apo-CIII is responsible for inhibiting LPL.

- Apo-E is a ligand for the LDL receptor.
