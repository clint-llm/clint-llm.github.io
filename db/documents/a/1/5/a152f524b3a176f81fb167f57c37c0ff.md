Healthcare professionals of many specialties are involved in providing care for patients with mechanical back strains. Physicians and nurses, especially in the acute setting, must be familiar with red flag symptoms of back pain that may require more urgent interventions and possible surgical consultation. Conservative management of acute mechanical back strains after a complete assessment is reasonable as the course is usually self-limited; this includes superficial heat, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and muscle relaxants.

Chronic mechanical back strains require an interprofessional team approach due to the psychosocial factors involved. Initial non-pharmacologic therapy includes exercise, interprofessional rehabilitation, manipulation, and acupuncture. First-line pharmacologic therapy is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs followed by duloxetine or tramadol as second-line therapy.

Mechanical back pain requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, physical therapists, chiropractors, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level 5]
