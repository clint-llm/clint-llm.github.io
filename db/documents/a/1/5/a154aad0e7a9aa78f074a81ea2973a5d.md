The most severe complications seen in uncal herniation are coma or death due to the failure of management strategies to reverse the herniation syndrome. Depending on the amount of tissue involved in the herniation, the patient is also at risk for the development of brainstem or cortical ischemia because of the anatomical proximity of major blood vessels. There are few cases of a rare complication of chronic uncal herniation seen mostly in children with Dandy-Walker syndrome or other cystic cavities in communication with the fourth ventricle because of posterior fossa shunting.
