Patients take acetazolamide with or without food and should drink plenty of fluids with the medication. Available dosages are 125 mg, 250 mg, and 500 mg tablets.

Intravenous (IV) administration of acetazolamide is available. However, intramuscular (IM) administration of acetazolamide is not recommended.

The dose range recommended for the treatment of glaucoma is 250 mg per day to 1000 mg per day. Typically, the dose will be 250 to 500 mg per day. For treating altitude sickness, the range is 250 to 500 mg daily in 2 oral doses.

**Use in Specific Patient Population**

**Patients with Renal Impairment:**Use is not recommended in cases of marked kidney disease.

**Patients with Hepatic Impairment:**Acetazolamide is contraindicated in cirrhosis because of the risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy.

**Pregnancy Considerations:**The use of acetazolamide in pregnancy has not been recommended because of teratogenic effects in preclinical studies. But in a study of pregnant patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, no conclusive evidence of the adverse effects of acetazolamide during pregnancy was observed.

**Breastfeeding Considerations:**Data suggests that maternal doses of acetazolamide up to 1000 mg daily deliver low levels in milk and would not be anticipated to cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants. In addition, various international professional guidelines consensus that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide are acceptable in breastfeeding.
