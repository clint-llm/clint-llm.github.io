Small vessel vasculitides are either ANCA-associated vasculitides or immune complex vasculitides.

Immune complex vasculitides can give similar signs and symptoms to ANCA-associated vasculitides. The main difference is on histopathology that immune complex vasculitides show abundant immune complex deposition in affected tissues. It can be caused by infections such as hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Human Immune deficiency virus (HIV), or endocarditis. It can also be caused by autoimmune conditions such as SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjögren syndrome. Cryoglobulinemia is one of the immune complex vasculitides that is caused by chronic hepatitis C infection.

Antiglomerular basement membrane disease (Goodpasture syndrome) can mimic ANCA vasculitis, which involves kidneys and lungs. Around 10 to 40 percent of patients with anti-glomerular basement membrane disease have ANCA positivity (dual-positivity). These patients are at higher risk of relapse.

Atrial myxoma also can present with fatigue, fever, weight loss, purpuric skin rash, neurologic involvement, and lung injury due to embolization.

Malignancy rarely can mimic vasculitis, either from the disease itself like lymphoma that involves blood vessels or as a paraneoplastic disease.
