Subclavian vein thrombosis (SCVT) is a condition where a blood clot forms in the subclavian vein. SCVT can occur from multiple etiologies and is a potentially life-threatening pathology if not treated promptly. SCVT occurs due to either a primary etiology or a secondary etiology. Primary thrombosis is further delineated as effort-induced (Paget-Schroetter syndrome) or idiopathic (frequently associated with undiagnosed malignancy). Secondary subclavian vein thrombosis is associated with catheters or lines in the vein. While primary thrombosis is rare, the incidence of secondary thrombosis continues to rise due to complex cardiac devices and long-term central venous catheter (CVC) placement in cancer patients. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of subclavian vein thrombosis and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of subclavian vein thrombosis.
- Describe the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of subclavian vein thrombosis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for subclavian vein thrombosis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of subclavian vein thrombosis and improve outcomes.
