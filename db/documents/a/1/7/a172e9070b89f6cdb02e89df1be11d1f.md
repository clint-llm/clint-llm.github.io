Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a different clinical entity from acute coronary syndrome related to atherosclerotic disease. It is frequently seen in younger pre-menopausal women with risk factors including pregnancy and fibromuscular dysplasia.

Pregnancy-related SCAD has a worse clinical outcome. It is important to recognize that SCAD doesn’t affect premenopausal women alone with several reports demonstrating a mean age of 52.1±9.2 years, with 62.3% of the women being post-menopausal.

There should be a high index for clinical suspicion in younger women presenting with chest pain. It is infrequent, misdiagnosed, and underestimated diagnosis with significant consequences of ventricular arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and sudden cardiac death.
