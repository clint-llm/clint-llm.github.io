Modern electrodiagnostic equipment combines a hardware unit with a stimulator, amplifier, control panel, and a computer containing special software for signal processing and storage.

- Surface electrodes for NCS are usually made from silver-silver chloride, platinum, or stainless steel and require appropriate coupling medium to ensure electrical contact (gel, adhesive, paste, or saline).

- Only disposable needle electrodes are currently used for needle EMG to prevent transmission of infectious diseases (hepatitis, HIV, prion disease).  Two main types of needle electrodes are used for routine EMG.

- The monopolar electrode has a sharpened pointed tip that serves as an active electrode, and another surface electrode placed on the skin serves as a reference.
- The concentric needle has a central insulated wire within the cannula; the tip of the wire is an active electrode, while the shaft of the cannula serves as a reference. This allows close positioning of active and reference electrodes, minimizing noise.
