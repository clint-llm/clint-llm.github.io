NF2 patients typically present with tumor-related symptoms around 20 years of age. The most common intracranial tumor associated with NF2 is vestibular schwannoma which is typically bilateral in these patients. Patients typically present with tinnitus, sensorineural hearing loss, and balance problems. The cutaneous features in NF2 are less common and more subtle than NF1. The most common skinÂ finding is an elevated plaque-like lesion which may be hyperpigmented than the surrounding skin. The other cutaneous abnormalities are subcutaneous nodules representing swelling of the nerves and cutaneous tumors which generally represent schwannomas rather than neurofibromas. Patients with meningiomas develop symptoms based on their locations and include a headache, seizures, or focal neurological symptoms. NF2 patients tend to develop meningiomas earlier than those with sporadic meningiomas. Approximately 20% of children with meningiomas have NF2. Patients with intraspinal tumors present with pain, muscular weakness, and paresthesia.

The clinical diagnosis of NF2 is based on the presence of any one of the following criteria

- Bilateral vestibular schwannomas less than 70 years of age

- Unilateral vestibular schwannoma before age 70 years and a first-degree relative with NF2

- Any two of the following: meningioma, schwannoma (non-vestibular), neurofibroma, glioma, cerebral calcification, cataract AND first-degree relative to NF2 OR unilateral vestibular schwannoma and negative LZTR1 testing

- Multiple meningiomas and unilateral vestibular schwannoma or any two of the following: schwannoma (non-vestibular), neurofibroma, glioma, cerebral calcification, cataract

- Constitutional or mosaic pathogenic NF2 gene mutation from the blood or by the identification of an identical mutation from two separate tumors in the same individual.
