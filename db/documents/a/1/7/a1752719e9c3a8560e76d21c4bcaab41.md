In the United States, lung cancer is the second most common cancer following breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men, not including skin cancer. Lung cancers comprise about 14% of all new cancers. About 220,000 new lung cancers are diagnosed each year with about 155,000 deaths estimated. Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer in both men and women. The number of deaths due to lung cancer surpasses the deaths attributable to prostate, breast, and colon cancers combined. Over the past several decades, the incidence of lung cancer has been declining in men, but just only recently in women.
