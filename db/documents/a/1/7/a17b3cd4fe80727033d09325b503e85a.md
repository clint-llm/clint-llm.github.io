The somatosensory nervous system maintains the sensation within the various dermatomes of sensation throughout the body. The somatosensory pathway serves as the conduit between the different sensory modalities within the body, sending information from the periphery to the postcentral gyrus and associated cortices to convey information from the surrounding environment. Peripheral mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors, thermoreceptors, and nociceptors transmit information via specific nerve fibers that enter the central nervous system tracts towards the brain. Each carrying a unique modality of sensation, these senses are ultimately processed and integrated into the central nervous system to help individuals interact with their environmental stimuli. The ultimate destination of these sensory stimuli is the somatosensory cortex.
