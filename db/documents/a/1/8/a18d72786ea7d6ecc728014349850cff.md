Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of death worldwide. It has been widely accepted that it is due to the insufficient blood supply to the cardiac tissue. In an attempt to intervene, physicians in the 1970s studied ligation of canine coronary arteries and documented prevention of necrosis with ligation release under appropriate time limits. Initial therapeutic reperfusion was established using intravenous and intracoronary thrombolytic agents, and several studies were conducted on them.
