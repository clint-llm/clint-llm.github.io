The diagnosis of actinic purpura is usually clinical and based on history and physical examination. In the rare cases where a biopsy is performed, the histological study will show a thinned epidermis ascending on an altered dermis with quantitatively reduced collagen fibers and abnormal elastic fibers. The walls of the dermal vessels have a normal tensile structure, but there is extravasation of red blood cells and hemosiderin deposits marked by Perl’s staining. In about 10% of cases, there is a neutrophilic infiltration that may lead to the misdiagnosis of actinic purpura as neutrophilic dermatosis or leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Coagulation analysis is rarely necessary and usually shows no abnormalities.
