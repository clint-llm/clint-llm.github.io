Tiotropium is a second-generation and long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist that exerts its primary therapeutic effect on the M1, M2, and M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in the lungs preventing acetylcholine binding. Once the patient inhales the medication as either an inhalation spray or inhalation powder, the quaternary ammonium compound reversibly binds to M1 mAChRs of the nerve ganglia of the lung, M2 mAChRs postganglionic nerve fibers of the lung, and M3 mAChRs of the smooth muscles and mucous glands of the lung. Specifically, when tiotropium binds to the M1 and M3 mAChRs, this molecule ultimately inhibits Gq alpha-protein stimulation of the phospholipase C pathway, preventing intracellular calcium influx from inducing a cellular response in the respiratory airways.

A unique chemical property of tiotropium is that it is a quaternary ammonium compound; this makes the medication highly specific to targeting the mAChRs of the respiratory pathway without the capability to be absorbed across the alveolar-capillary beds to enter the systemic circulation. Of the three mAChRs, tiotropium has equal binding capabilities to the M1, M2, and M3 mAChRs in the lungs but has been observed to have prolonged anticholinergic effect only on the M1 mAChRs and M3 mAChRs and rapid dissociation to the M2 mAChRs.
