Albuterol, also known as salbutamol, has an indication for the treatment and prevention of bronchospasm (acute or severe) in patients with reversible obstructive airway disease, including exercise-induced bronchospasm.

Albuterol has an off-label indication for adjuvant treatment of hyperkalemia.

Currie G. et al. conducted a study on Canadian pediatric emergency department physician treatment choices for wheezing preschool patients. Most physicians treated pediatric patients with albuterol in the emergency department and at discharge. The additional treatment with oral glucocorticoids varied from 12 to 81% and factors that determined treatment were age, atopy history, and the type of wheezing, e.g., continuous. Currie G. et al. found that the physicians were willing to enroll their patients in a randomized clinical trial to help with guidance on when to add an oral glucocorticoid for treatment.
