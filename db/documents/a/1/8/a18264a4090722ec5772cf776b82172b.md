Given the significant comorbidities associated with obesity, an emphasis should be placed on prevention & weight management because weight loss has been shown to decrease the associated risks.

Diet modification alone can be useful to lose weight and can be very simple for the health care professional to advise. However, encouraging weight loss through a low-calorie diet plan, exercise plan, and psychotherapy in the form of cognitive-behavioral therapy is significantly more effective.

An interprofessional team is optimal in order to support the patient from pharmacological, surgical, dietary, and psychological aspects, with each specialty bringing the best evidence-based practice to create a personalized, effective weight loss program to help patients achieve their weight loss goals.
