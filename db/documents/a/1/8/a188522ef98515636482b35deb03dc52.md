Patient education is crucial for hearing loss in the elderly. Often, patients may assume their hearing loss is a part of aging that cannot be controlled or has little impact on their lives. Although, with education about the possible treatments and overall prognostic role of hearing loss, patients are better equipped and better able to evaluate their condition.

Ensuring patients have an adequate follow-up with audiology and understanding their hearing aids or amplification device is vital in the correct and beneficial usage of hearing aids. Proper ear protection and ear health should be advised for all patients, including avoidance of excess noise or ototoxic exposure that may further worsen hearing loss.
