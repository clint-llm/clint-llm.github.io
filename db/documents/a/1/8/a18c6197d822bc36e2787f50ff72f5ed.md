Impulsivity is a trait ubiquitous with human nature. What separates humans from life forms of lower sentience is the evolution of neurocircuitry within the prefrontal cortex that allows one to practice self-governance. Self-governance, or self-control, has many monikers. Moffitt, for example, uses the sobriquet conscientiousness to express this notion of self-restraint.

Self-regulation arises from the existence of a conflict between two mutually exclusive inner psychic agencies, or more descriptively in Freudian terminology, between the impulsive id and the captious superego. One can either eat the cake, or not eat the cake, however, one cannot, both eat the cake and, at the same time, not eat the cake. Freud postulated that socialization was a process by which juveniles appreciated how best to suppress immediately satisfying urges, and instead consider what might be most beneficial for one's future self.

Normative behavior encompasses both reactive and stolid patterns; however, psychopathology arises in the event of impaired self-regulation, giving rise to disinhibition.

Of note, a classification change occurred in the transition from DSM IV to 5.
