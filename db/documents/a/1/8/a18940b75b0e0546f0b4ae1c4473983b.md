Patients and family members should be informed about genetic inheritance, course of the disease, treatment, risks to other members, and the importance of family history. Information about the disease should be shared in a way that the patient and family can understand. But some fundamental messages should be common to all patients. Patient education is essential to clear the confusion about their diseases and enhances patient compliance towards treatment and follow up. This automatically comforts the treatment overload and maintains a good patient-doctor relationship. Patients always have the desire to clear any doubt and to know about their diseases, and their queries should be answered honestly as it is their right. Taking the consent before any intervention, discussing the treatment plans and options, and letting them choose the best one after full description and counseling are vital parts of the management plan. Having knowledge about signs and symptoms makes them aware at the time of onset of disease or any progression of complications that allow them to consult the clinicians earlier that may improve the outcomes.
