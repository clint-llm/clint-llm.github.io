Examination of a patient with cervical spine fractures should begin with a thorough trauma examination of ABCs (check of theÂ airway, breathing, and circulation). Injury to the cervical spine has the potential to compromise respiratory and cardiovascular function and even once stabilized these patients must be closely monitored for the ongoing possibility of changes in the respiratory and cardiovascular function. Next, formal strength and sensation testing of the upper and lower extremities, as well as rectal tone and palpation of the cervical spine should be performed. This is most commonly done following the ASIA scoring system. Acute spinal cord injury is important to identify as early decompression within 24 hours can increase the chance of neurological recovery.
