Interpolated flaps, along with rotation, transposition, and island flaps, comprise the pivotal flap category of facial reconstruction techniques.

While there are numerous interpolated flap options that may be employed in facial reconstruction - nasolabial flaps, temporoparietal fascia flaps, pericranial flaps, inferior turbinate flaps, facial artery musculomucosal flaps, and temporalis muscle flaps, among others - the paramedian forehead flap had remained a workhorse technique since World War I, even though its origins stretch back to at least 600 BC, when it was used for repair of nasal defects from punitive mutilation.

Utilization of the paramedian forehead flap in nasal reconstruction requires at least a two-stage procedure, with operations typically separated by three weeks, and some surgeons prefer to utilize a third stage to permit further refinement of the flap's contour.
