The majority of patients are asymptomatic and do not need medical therapy for hyperuricemia, as they will never develop gout or nephrolithiasis. The unnecessary cost of medication and the potential for adverse effects outweighs the benefit of starting medication. Urate-lowering medications in asymptomatic patients are only indicated in those undergoing cytolytic therapy for malignancy to prevent tumor lysis syndrome.

Urate-lowering medications:

- Allopurinol: xanthine oxidase inhibitors; used as prophylaxis against gouty arthritis, nephrolithiasis, and chemo-related hyperuricemia

- Probenecid: inhibits URAT1 resulting in increased uric acid secretion, and is used as second-line therapy for gout

- Rasburicase: recombinant uricase that converts uric acid to allantoin, which is much more water-soluble and readily excreted from the kidneys and used as prophylaxis against chemo-related hyperuricemia
