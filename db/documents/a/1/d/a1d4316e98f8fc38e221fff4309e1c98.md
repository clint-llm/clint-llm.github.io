Patients with SCI should be educated about their acute and chronic risk of decremental BMD levels and the potential for low-impact fractures. Particularly, emphasis should focus on the initial and most vulnerable clinical window acutely following the SCI. The core treatment options for osteoporotic patients involve early education on how to achieve and maintain healthy bone mass levels and extensive education and counseling on the relevant social, environmental, and lifestyle risk factors that compromise bone health.
