Splints may be applied by physicians, physician assistants, first-responders, medical assistants, and technicians with the proper training. Although a sole individual may apply a splint, assistance is commonly needed for ease of application. A second provider can gather materials, aid in reduction, and secure the injured limb in position so that the primary provider can adequately place and mold the splint.
