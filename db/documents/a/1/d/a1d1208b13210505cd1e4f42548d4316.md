Carvedilol is a relatively well-tolerated drug with fewer frequent adverse events than other beta-blockers, and the adverse events are dose-related.

Adverse drug reactions include weight gain, depression, impotence, and memory loss. It is essential to recognize that abrupt discontinuation of carvedilol can lead to rebound hypertension. Hepatotoxicity from carvedilol is rare, but mild-to-moderate elevations in aminotransferase levels have been documented in < 2% of patients on carvedilol therapy, which are generally asymptomatic, resolving even with the continuance of therapy. Thus, clinically apparent liver injury from carvedilol is rare and perhaps associated with the idiosyncratic reaction to the carvedilol or its metabolites.

**Drug-Drug Interactions**

Antidepressants such as fluoxetine, duloxetine, paroxetine, and bupropion are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6. They can increase the concentrations of β-blockers, including carvedilol, potentially increasing the risk of serious adverse events such as hypotension, bradycardia, and fall.

Carvedilol and digoxin both slow atrioventricular conduction and decreases the heart rate. Concomitant use of carvedilol and digoxin can increase the risk of bradycardia.
