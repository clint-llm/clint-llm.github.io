The underlying cause of trochanteric bursitis can be repetitive microtrauma, blunt trauma, or idiopathic. Overuse of the surrounding musculature leading to tendinopathies of the gluteus medius and/or minimus is common. Repetitive hip abduction seen in stair climbing or cycling can contribute to an inflammatory cascade of the bursa.Â Older patients who sustain falls directly over the bursa can initiate an inflammatory cascade within the tissue. Sedentary or bed-bound patients are also prone to trochanteric bursitis, as constant pressure over the greater trochanter of the proximal femur can also initiate the inflammatory response of the bursa.
