The safety profile of secukinumab leaves it highly recommendable. Since secukinumab interferes with the normal immune process, it enhances the risk of infections, including staphylococcal and candidal; however, mild disease results and is not disseminated**.**Another possible toxic effect is the carcinogenic potential, with existing reports of malignancies such as non-melanoma skin cancers (basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma), melanoma, bladder cancer, and thyroid cancer.

According to product labeling, in clinical trials, doses of 30 mg/kg intravenously have been administered without toxicity. However, the patient should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of toxicity and adverse drug reactions in the event of overdosage. There is no antidote to secukinumab. Management is primarily supportive.
