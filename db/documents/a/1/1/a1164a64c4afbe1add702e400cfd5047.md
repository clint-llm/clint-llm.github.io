Celiac disease is an enteropathy of the small intestine. It is triggered by exposure to gluten in the diet of susceptible people. The susceptibility is genetically determined. The condition is chronic, and currently,Â the only treatment consists of permanent exclusion of gluten from the food intake.

Patients with celiac disease can present with diarrhea and failure to thrive; some may be asymptomatic.
