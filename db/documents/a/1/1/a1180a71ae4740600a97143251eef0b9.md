Penetrating head trauma is best managed by an interprofessional team that consists of a neurosurgeon, emergency department physician, neurologist, intensivist, neurosurgical nurses, physical therapy and an internist. When the brain is injured, this can lead to impairment in almost every organ system. The key is to prevent further complications like pressure sores, deep vein thrombosis, failure to thrive, aspiration pneumonia and contractures. Healthcare workers should be proactive and involve speech, occupational and physical therapists early on in treatment. The overall outlook for patients with penetrating head trauma depends on age, comorbidity, extent, and site of brain injury and presence of neurological deficits at the time of presentation. Even those who survive, the recovery can take months or years. Residual neurological deficits are common in survivors.
