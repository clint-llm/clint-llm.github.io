Untreated congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy can result in poor visual development and occlusive amblyopia. Although the risk of developing amblyopia decreases the younger a child is treated, earlier interventions are associated with increased risk of graft dehiscence, suture induced amblyopia, and increased exposure to anesthesia.

Astigmatism is a significant risk with corneal grafting. The risk for astigmatism is highest in PK procedures and can sometimes be severe enough to result in amblyopia.

Lens trauma during EK grafting is possible due to a childâ€™s clear, crystalline lens. Trauma can result in the development of an iatrogenic cataract. One method used to protect the lens during EK is with pilocarpine, a cholinergic agonist, which induces miosis.
