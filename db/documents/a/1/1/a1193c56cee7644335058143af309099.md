The ulnar nerve carries both sensory and motor fibers from the C8 and T1 dorsal rami. The nerve courses along the medial arm from the anterior to the posterior compartment, through the medial intermuscular septum, called the arcade of Struthers. The arcade is formed by the medial head of the biceps, medial intermuscular septum, and internal brachial ligament.Â It then passes posterior to the medial epicondyle of the humerus, giving off its first branch providing proprioception to the elbow joint. At the distal elbow, the ulnar nerve passes underneath Osbourne's ligament (retinaculum between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle). It continues through the flexor and pronator muscles of the forearm and into the wrist, superficial to the flexor retinaculum. The ulnar nerve enters the hand through Guyon's canal, a fibro-osseous tunnel formed by the pisiform and hook of the hamate. In the hand, the ulnar nerve branches to give rise to a palmar cutaneous (nerve of Henle) and dorsal cutaneous branch. The dorsal cutaneous nerve bifurcates further into radial and ulnar branches providing sensation to the dorsal hand.
