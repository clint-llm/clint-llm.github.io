In addition to understanding and confidently identifying the five flexor zones and further sub-categorizing zone 1 into the Leddy classification system, it is essential to be knowledgeable of the Boyes preoperative classification, denoting preoperative conditions of the tendon under concern.

**Grade 1**- good: minimal scarring with mobile joints and no trophic changes

- At this stage, tendon reconstruction is considered, if indicated, as the soft tissues should be healed, mobile, stable, free of joint contracture, and demonstrate full passive motion.

**Grade 2**- cicatrix: heavy skin scarring secondary to injury or prior surgery; deep scarring because of failed primary repair or infection

**Grade 3**- joint damage: injury to joint with restricted range of motion

**Grade 4**- nerve damage: injury to digital nerves resulting in trophic changes in finger

**Grade 5**- multiple sites of damage: involvement of multiple fingers with a combination of the above problems

If the indications for a single-stage repair (Boyes grade 1) are not satisfactorily appreciated (Boyes grade 2 to 5), patients are generally considered candidates for two-stage reconstruction.
