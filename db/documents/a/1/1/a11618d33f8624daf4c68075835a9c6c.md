There is no specific preparation for the endoscopic vein harvesting procedure. However, preoperative bedside venous doppler mapping is of great importance before harvesting. Many centers consider this test mandatory as it provides crucial information regarding the location and quality of the greater saphenous vein as a conduit. The scan provides measurements typically within margin of 95% confidence level of the predicted conduit diameter.

The vein course, size, and quality undergo inspection to asses which side to be harvested or even aborting the procedure entirely in cases of small vein diameter (less than 1.5Â to 2 mm), grossly dilated veins, and extensive varicosities. This test is noninvasive and is typically performed in under ten minutes.
