MCNs are rare when compared to pseudocysts and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, with few studies reporting on epidemiology. Reportedly MCNs account for 29% of neoplastic cystic lesions of the pancreas. Predominantly MCNs are seen in females, and the mean age of diagnosis is between 40 to 50 years (range 4 to 95 years).
