The prognosis of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is excellent after the underlying cause is successfully treated. Recurrence of the ulcer may be prevented by maintaining good hygiene and avoiding alcohol, smoking, and NSAIDs. Unfortunately, recurrence is common with rates exceeding 60% in most series. NSAID-induced gastric perforation occurs at a rate of 0.3% per patient per year. However, unlike in the past, mortality rates for peptic ulcer disease have decreased significantly.
