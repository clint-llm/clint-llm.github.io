Proper positioning of the patient can facilitate access to anatomical locations during surgical procedures and promote appropriate physiologic function during pathologic states, for example, the Trendelenburg position to increase the venous return in a hypovolemic patient. Care to position the patient properly both facilitates procedural aims and aids in preventing subsequent complications.
