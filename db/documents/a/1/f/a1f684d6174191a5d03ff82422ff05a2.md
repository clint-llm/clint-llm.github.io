Hypoglycemia is often defined by a plasma glucose concentration below 70 mg/dL; however, signs and symptoms may not occur until plasma glucose concentrations drop below 55 mg/dL. The symptoms of Whipple's triad have been used to describe hypoglycemia since 1938. For the Whipple triad, the practitioner must first recognize hypoglycemia symptoms, obtain low blood glucose, and finally, demonstrate immediate relief of symptoms by the correction of the low blood glucose after treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hypoglycemia and highlights the interprofessional team's role in educating patients with this condition about follow up care.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of hypoglycemia.
- Explain the diagnostic approach on how to determine that a patient has hypoglycemia.
- Review the management options available for hypoglycemia treatment.
- Summarize the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in prompt diagnosis of hypoglycemia and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
