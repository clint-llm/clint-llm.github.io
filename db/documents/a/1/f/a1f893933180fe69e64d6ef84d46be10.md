Aphasia is the inability to vocalize or understand spoken or written language. Primary progressive aphasia refers to the group of neurodegenerative diseases showing gradual speech and language impairment as the primary presenting symptom without significant cognitive, physical, or behavioral components. Although aphasia is usually the sudden onset of deficits in expressing or understanding language, such as in stroke, primary progressive aphasia involves the gradual impairment of these functions. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of progressive nonfluent aphasia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of progressive nonfluent aphasia. 
-  Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation to diagnose progressive nonfluent aphasia.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for progressive nonfluent aphasia.
- Summarize the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance recovery and rehabilitation from progressive nonfluent aphasia and improve outcomes.
