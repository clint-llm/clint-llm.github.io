Penicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic. Included in the penicillin family of antibiotics are penicillin G, penicillin V, procaine penicillin, benzathine penicillin as well as over 15 related compounds with broader antibacterial effects. Type 1 and type 4 hypersensitivity reactions mediate the most common allergies to penicillin. Serious allergic reactions to penicillin are Type 1 and mediated by IgE. Risk factors for IgE mediated reactions include high-dose parenteral administration and repetitive or frequent dosing of penicillins. Most severe reactions occur between the ages of 20 to 49 years. Previously, PCN related antibiotics such as cephalosporins were avoided given concern for cross-reactivity. Current research suggests that similarities between the chemical structures of the R-side chains are what determines cross-reactivity between classes of penicillin-related compounds, enabling greater use of antibiotics previously avoided. Of note, amoxicillin is the most common of the penicillins associated with cross-reactivity.
