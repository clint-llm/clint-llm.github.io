Patients taking amoxapine should be monitored for resolution or reduction of symptoms, withdrawal symptoms from abrupt discontinuation, weight and BMI, blood pressure, blood glucose, worsening of depression, suicidality, or unusual behavior at the initiation of therapy, or when changing the dose. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is also necessary for older adults and patients with preexisting cardiac disease or hyperthyroidism. There is an increased risk of hyponatremia in the elderly population; therefore, electrolytes require monitoring in patients above 65 years of age.
