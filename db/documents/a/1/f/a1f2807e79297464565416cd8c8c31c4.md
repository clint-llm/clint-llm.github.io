Given the nonspecific signs of neonatal sepsis, several differentials must be considered, including but not limited to:

- Infection due to other agents ( virus, fungal or parasite)

- Congenital heart disease

- Neonatal encephalopathy

- Metabolic disease

- Prematurity and associated complications ( respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, apnea of prematurity, and others)

- Hypo or hyperthyroidism

- Transient tachypnea of the newborn

- Meconium aspiration

- Hypoglycemia
