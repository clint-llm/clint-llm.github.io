Type III hypersensitivity reaction can be treated based on the clinical presentation:

- Removal of the offending agent is the mainstay of treatment of type III hypersensitivity reaction.

- Antihistamines and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can provide symptomatic relief.

- Corticosteroids are used in severe cases to suppress inflammation. They are also used as premedication to prevent hypersensitivity from happening.

- Avoiding exposure to anÂ allergen is critical to the management of HP. In addition, corticosteroids are helpful in patients with inflammatory features.

- SLE is treated based on the individual patient's disease condition. Hydroxychloroquine is essential for long-term treatment in all SLE patients.

- The patient must be hospitalized in cases of hemodynamic instability, life-threatening symptoms, or unclear diagnosis.

- Many infectious and autoimmune diseases are linked to type III hypersensitivity reactions. A consultation with the rheumatologist, immunologist, and infectious disease specialist must be considered.

- Treatment of autoimmune disorders (e.g., SLE) includes one or a combination of hydroxychloroquine, NSAIDs, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, mycophenolate, and tacrolimus.
