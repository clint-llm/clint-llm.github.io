Patients should be educated on the possible etiologies and concomitant shoulder pathologies seen in association with proximal biceps pathologies. A point of emphasis should be given to including any LHB tendon pathology that may be seen in association with other known shoulder pathologies. For example, a patient should be not only educated on the injury affecting the rotator cuff itself, but also the potential for co-existing injury to the biceps tendon. Discussion,  especially with older patient populations, should include that the planned concomitant procedure (i.e., the tenotomy or tenodesis procedure) may or may not occur. By doing this, the patient’s postoperative expectations can be adequately managed before performing surgery.
