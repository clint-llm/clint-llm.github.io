Cardiac trauma can be categorized as either blunt or penetrating according to the mechanism of injury. Outcomes range from spontaneously-resolving arrhythmias to lethal injury. Those with lethal injuries often succumb quickly, with an estimate that 90 percent of individuals with lethal injuries expire before arriving at a hospital. Of those that make it to the hospital, survival is estimated at between 20 and 75 percent. This activity reviews the evaluation, management, and treatment of cardiac trauma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review common mechanisms of injury associated with cardiac trauma.
- Explain how to evaluate a patient for cardiac trauma.
- Describe management options for patients with cardiac trauma.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication in order to improve rapid diagnosis and management of cardiac trauma and improve patient outcomes.
