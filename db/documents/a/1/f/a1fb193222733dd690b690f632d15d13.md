Currently, there is no available antidote for intravenous phenylephrine. Hypertension in the setting of excessive dosing or an exaggerated response is usually short-lived due to the short duration of action. The treatment for hypertension or symptomatic reflex bradycardia is discontinuing the administration of phenylephrine and chronotropic agents or vasodilators as needed. Treatment for tissue extravasation of peripherally administered phenylephrine is largely supportive care (aspiration of fluid, warming, elevation), but subcutaneous phentolamine is an option used.
