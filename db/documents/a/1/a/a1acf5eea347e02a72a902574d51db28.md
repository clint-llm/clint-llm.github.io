The skull imaging study has a long list of indications that can practically be classified as trauma, benign or malignant focal skull lesions, and systemic pathologies affecting the skull. CT is the principal modality in imaging of the traumatic skull lesions since it not only provides perfect visualization of cortical bone but also offers a very short imaging time allowing immediate intervention before brain damage or death. Besides, it is regarded as the most accurate method in the detection of a cerebrospinal fluid leak. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) allows rapid volumetric image data acquisition, and with the use of sub-millimetric slice thickness, it permits multiplanar reformations (MPR) and 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions.
