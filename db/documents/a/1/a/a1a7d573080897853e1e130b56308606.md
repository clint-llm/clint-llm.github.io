Hemolacria is typically a benign and self-limited process. However due to associations with severe systemic and ocular diseases a thorough evaluation is warranted for all patients presenting with hemolacria.

All patients presenting with haemolacria should undergo a comprehensiveÂ ocular examination as well as a systemic examination to look for organic causes and sources of the hemorrhage. Specifically, the history of systemic diseases (hematological disorders, coagulopathies, hypertension) and medications like warfarin, aspirin or clopidogrel is necessary.

When no ocular or systemic causes are present, psychiatric diseases and vicarious menstruation must be ruled out before labeling the etiology as 'unknown' or 'idiopathic.'
