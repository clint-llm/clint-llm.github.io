The scope of practice for the NPD practitioner reflects the changing landscape in healthcare. NPD practitioners can use these standards to achieve the outputs of NPD practice, which are learning, change, and professional role competence. This provides energy to move towards the desired outcomes of optimal care and population health, thereby benefiting the healthcare consumer/partner. NPD practitioners incorporate considerations for diversity, equity, and inclusion into their initiatives to ensure that all healthcare staff is prepared to address social and digital determinants of health in healthcare consumers/partners. All NPD practitioners must know of and adhere to the NPD standards of practice. NPD practitioners can use them in various ways to enhance NPD practice and advance the specialty. A study by Harper and MaloneyÂ outlined the organizational value of NPD practice.
