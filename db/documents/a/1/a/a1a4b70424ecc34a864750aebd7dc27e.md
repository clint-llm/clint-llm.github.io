Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) of the carotid artery is a non-atherosclerotic and noninflammatory disease that can lead to stenosis and/or aneurysm of medium-sized arteries. FMD is a rare disease that mainly affects the distal extracranial internal carotid and renal arteries. FMD most commonly affects middle-aged women; however, it can affect anyone of any age and gender. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, presentation, diagnosis of FMD and highlights the role of the healthcare system in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of fibromuscular dysplasia.
- Review the treatment of fibromuscular dysplasia.
- Summarize the investigations in a patient suspected of having fibromuscular dysplasia.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by fibromuscular dysplasia.
