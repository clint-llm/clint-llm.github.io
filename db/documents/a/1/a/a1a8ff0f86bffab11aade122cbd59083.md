Normally eosinophils are present throughout the gastrointestinal tract except the esophagus. A study in the pediatric population revealed that the established eosinophilic density per high power field per mm2 showed no eosinophils in all biopsies from normal mucosa esophagus (total number=33).

There is no established cutoff to make a diagnosis of eosinophilic gastroenteritis. However, the following are the proposed numbers based on reported literature

- Stomach: greater than or equal to 30 eosinophils per high-power field in 5 HPF

- Duodenum: greater than or equal to 30 eosinophils

- Ileum: more than 56 per HPF in the ileum

- Right colon: more than 100 per HPF

- Transverse and descending colon: more than 84 per HPF

- Rectosigmoid colon: more than 64 per HPF
