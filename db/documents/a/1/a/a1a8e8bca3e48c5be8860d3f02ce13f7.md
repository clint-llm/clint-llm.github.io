Spinal cord compression that results in neurological deficits is a medical emergency that necessitates intervention with radiation therapy and steroids to preserve neurological function.

When considering management for metastatic lesions to the spine, consultation with an orthopedic or neurological surgeon who specializes in spinal stabilization is indicated to determine the mechanical stability of the spine. The "Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score" or "SINS" score is a scoring system that is the most widely accepted instrument for assessing the stability of the spine with metastatic lesions. The SINS scoring system utilizes six criteria to determine a score that predicts the need for surgical stabilization of the spine. The SINS scoring system is based on:

- The location of the affected vertebral segment in the spine

- The presence of mechanical pain

- The bone lesion quality

- The presence of deformity or malalignment at the affected segment

- The extent of vertebral body involvement

- The presence or absence of posterior element involvement

A total score is calculated by the sum of the individual scores in each of the above categories and results in being able to classify all lesions as either "stable," "potentially unstable, possibly requiring surgical stabilization," and "unstable requiring surgical stabilization."
