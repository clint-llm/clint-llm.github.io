Recombinant parathyroid hormone falls in a new category of osteoporosis therapy called anabolic therapy. It is the first approved drug in this category and has been shown to improve outcomes for patients with osteoporosis. Like any therapy, teriparatide also comes with potential side effects, notably a theoretical risk of osteosarcoma. The interprofessional healthcare teamÂ should be aware of the evidence related to this side effect and communicate it effectively to their patients in a manner that assists the patient in making the best-informed decision and acknowledges both the worrisome nature of an osteosarcoma risk and the clinical benefit of this therapy (reduction in vertebral and nonvertebral (e.g., hip) fractures and strengthening of bones). Orthostatic hypotension should also be a concern, and patients need to be informed about preventing and managing it. This issue is a high priority, especially in this osteoporotic patient population, where a slight fall might result in a catastrophic fracture. That is why interprofessional collaboration and open communication between clinicians, specialists, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists must be in place to optimize therapeutic results, counsel patients and answer their questions, and remain vigilant for potential adverse effects. With interprofessional teamwork, there will be a greater chance for better patient outcomes.
