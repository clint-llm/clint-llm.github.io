The cause of scaphocephaly is the premature closure of all or most of the sagittal suture. Physiologic sagittal suture closure starts at 22 years of age. Sometimes, a complete fusion may not occur; however, most individuals have it closed between 30 and 50 years old. The specific etiology of craniosynostosis, especially the nonsyndromic type of craniosynostosis, is still not completely understood, but most cases are sporadic. Many factors have been studied and implicated, and these include genetic mutations, metabolic and hematologic syndromes, teratogens (i.e., valproic acid), maternal smoking, and advanced paternal age.

A combination of external factors and genetic mutations is implicated in this condition's etiology. There have been more than 100 mutations associated with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. The most common and most studied mutation is the fibroblast growth factors (FGFR) gene 1-3.
