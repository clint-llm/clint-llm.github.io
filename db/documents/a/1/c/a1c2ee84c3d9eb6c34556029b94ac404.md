The robotic TKR  has increased significantly over the last years. Robotic TKR improves surgeons' ability to control implant positioning, ligament balance, and limb alignment, leading to increased prosthesis survivorship. As this technology continues to increase, more long-term studies are required to check how robotic surgery will affect implant survivorship. There are promising mechanical, radiographic, and clinical results of robotic TKR. Hence, most arthroplasty surgeons support the continued usage of this robotic technology to improve surgical accuracy and patient outcomes in knee arthroplasty.

Revision knee surgery is indicated for postoperative complications with the main focus on implant loosening, whether septic or aseptic. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of a 10-year follow-up study showed a higher survival rate for the robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasties.
