**Medical Management**

**Antibiotics**

Antibiotics are the mainstay in managing lens abscesses and safeguarding the eye from endophthalmitis. They can be given as topical, oral, intravenous, subconjunctival, and through the intravitreal route. They help in controlling infection and prevent the spread of abscesses.

**Topical**

The drugs implicated are

- Moxifloxacin 5 mg/ml

- Fortified tobramycin 14 mg/ml

- Cefazolin 50 mg/ml

- Gentamicin 13.6 mg/ml

- Cefuroxime 50 mg/ml

**Subconjunctival**

- Cefazolin 100 mg

- Gentamicin 20 mg

- Cefuroxime 125 mg

- Amphotericin B injections 0.01 mg/0.1 cc

**Intravenous**

- Cefazolin sodium

- Gentamicin

- Sulphamethoxazole 240 mg

- Trimethoprim 1.2 g

**Intravitreal**

- Ceftazidime 2 mg

- Vancomycin

**Oral**

- Flucloxacillin 250 mg

- Pivampicillin 500 mg

- Metronidazole 400 mg

- Ofloxacin 200 mg

- Imipenem 200 mg

**Antifungals**

Lens abscesses can also result from fungal species; hence topical, oral, and intracameral antifungals are needed. Topical antifungals have a slower penetration. Accordingly, hourly administration is warranted to get adequate anterior chamber penetration.

**Topical**

- Natamycin 5%

- Voriconazole 1%

- Itraconazole 1%

**Oral**

- Fluconazole 150 mg

- Voriconazole 200mg

**Intracameral**

- Voriconazole 0.1cc

**Intrastromal**

- Voriconazole 0.1 cc

**Corticosteroids**

Corticosteroids are the mainstay in controlling inflammation. They should be used only when the infection has been controlled. The treating surgeon should be cautious while starting the steroids as it may flare up the abscess and vitritis and lead to the rapid multiplication of microorganisms leading to endophthalmitis. The postoperative steroid regimen is continued after cataract extraction, lens aspiration, and IOL implantation. They can be given through topical and oral routes. In rare cases, if there is persistent posterior segment inflammation, steroids are needed through intravenous and intravitreal routes. Topical steroids help treat conjunctival and scleral inflammation. Steroids can suppress the host's immune system, leading to deeper penetration and proliferation of the fungus. This can result in rebound anterior segment inflammation.

**Topical**

- Prednisolone acetate 1% 10 mg/ml

- Dexamethasone 0.1%

- Betamethasone 0.05%

**Adjuvant Drugs**

**Cycloplegics**

Cycloplegics help to control anterior chamber inflammation, relieve ciliary spasms, relieve pain, break posterior synechiae, prevent the formation of synechiae and prevent the breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier. They are vital in controlling inflammation.

**Drugs Implicated**

- Atropine 1%

- Cyclopentolate 1%

- Homatropine 2.5%

**Antiglaucoma Drugs**

They are needed to control intraocular pressure from uncontrolled inflammation, trabecular meshwork blockage, and trabeculitis. Miotics and prostaglandins are contraindicated in ocular inflammation.

**Drugs**

- Timolol 0.5%

- Brimonidine 0.2%

**Surgical Management**

**Evacuation of Lens Abscess**

Whenever there is a breach in the anterior capsule and cortical matter disturbance, the lenticular material should be removed immediately to prevent endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis.

**Lens Aspiration**

Young patients have no nucleus with lens matter, and the lenticular matter is mostly cortical. Hence the lens material can be easily aspirated from the paracentesis using bimanual irrigation and aspiration**.**

**Extra Capsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE)**

In today's era, ECCE is not practiced much but is a viable option for abscess removal through the superior limbal incision.

**Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery (MSICS)**

Another nuclear management option is MSICS, by performing a sclerocorneal tunnel for cataract and abscess removal**.**

**Phacoemulsification**

Those surgeons who don't practice ECCE and MSICS can use phacoemulsification as the primary process for lens removal.

**Anterior Vitrectomy**

In some cases where there is zonular dialysis and posterior capsular breach, vitreous prolapse occurs in the anterior chamber. These cases require automated anterior vitrectomy along with the primary procedure.

**Pars Plana Vitrectomy**

In cases where there is a nucleus drop, cortical matter drop in the vitreous cavity, non-resolving vitritis, vitreous hemorrhage, and endophthalmitis will require a para plana vitrectomy along with pars plana lensectomy or vitreous lavage.

**Aphakia Management**

Earlier aphakia management was a matter of debate in cases of lens abscess. Primary IOL implantation reduces the visual rehabilitation time and defers additional surgical procedures. However, it is always advisable to defer primary IOL implantation in these cases. Primary IOL implantation can cause severe uveitis and manifest as cells, flare in the anterior chamber, keratic precipitates at the back of the cornea, posterior synechiae at the back of the cornea, pigments on the IOL, and vitritis. Secondary IOL implantation as a staged procedure has good outcomes in these cases and prevents developing infection and inflammation. A 3-piece hydrophobic IOL is stable for these cases.

**Nd YAG Laser Capsulotomy**

Nd YAG laser capsulotomy will be needed once posterior capsular opacification is developed. This should be attempted only after three months of quiescence.

**100% Oxygen**

The administration of 100 percent oxygen has also been tried as a treatment for lens abscess.
