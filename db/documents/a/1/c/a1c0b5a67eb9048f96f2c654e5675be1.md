**Eden-Lange Procedure**

Few surgical procedures primarily involve the levator scapulae. The Eden-Lange procedure, first described in 1924, aims to recreate the functionality lost in trapezius muscle palsy, better known by the eponym "winged scapula." The tendon of the levator scapulae is transferred to the acromion, while the rhomboids are attached to the infraspinatus fossa.

**Modified Eden-Lange Procedure**

The Modified Eden-Lange procedure is a variant also performed to reproduce native scapular positioning. Instead of transferring the rhomboid to the center of the scapula, the surgeon transfers the rhomboid minor to the supraspinatus fossa, and the rhomboid major is attached to the infraspinatus fossa. The levator scapulae muscle is then attached to the spine of the scapula.

**Thoracotomy**

The levator scapulae have been reportedly implicated in thoracotomy for excision of the lung. A common deep aponeurosis covering the levator scapulae and serratus anterior must be recognized and released to avoid functional consequences of dynamic shoulder instability.
