The most common presentation is one of recurrent severe pruritus, papular dermatitis, lichenified dermatitis, and areas of skin depigmentation, especially around the shins, giving rise to the name "leopard skin." Skin depigmentation happens as a result of chronic rubbing of the skin (which may involve the use of stones and other coarse materials) in response to severe itchiness induced by an immunological response to dying or dead microfilariae. These normally present years before ocular manifestations ensue.
