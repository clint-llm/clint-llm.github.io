Due to the heterogeneity of symptoms upon presentation, coronary artery vasospasm (CAVS) should be on a differential when a patient is presenting with symptoms. It is important to recognize CAVS when compared to obstructive atherosclerotic coronary artery disease due to different approaches to treatment. Due to patients having recurrent symptoms resulting from CAVS further research needs to be implemented to better understand the pathogenesis and impact of treatment options.
