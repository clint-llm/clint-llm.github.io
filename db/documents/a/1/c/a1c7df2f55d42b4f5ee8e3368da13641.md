Because the FDA does not directly regulate black cohosh, the actual ingredients may differ from vendor to vendor. Some may be adulterated. Adulterants in any supplement may include pharmaceutical and synthetic analogs. Trace amounts of heavy metals are also known to be present in unregulated supplements.

Adverse effects may not be attributable to merely one chemical compound. In clinical trials using black cohosh to treat menopausal symptoms, it was found that it was associated with a low incidence of adverse effects. Those reported were musculoskeletal complaints, uterine bleeding, and breast pain. Users who have taken large doses most commonly have reported gastrointestinal side effects and rashes. Dizziness, nausea, and vomiting are less common side effects. The US Pharmacopeia has determined that black cohosh may be responsible for more than 30 cases of liver damage. Worldwide, there have been 83 reports of liver damage associated with the use of black cohosh. Elevated liver enzymes, liver failure, and other associated hepatic disorders have been reported. No causal relationship has been established.
