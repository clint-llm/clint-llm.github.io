In many patients, no underlying genetic abnormality is identified in patients with a right aortic arch; however, a right aortic arch can be associated with Digeorge syndrome (22q11 deletion) as well as conotruncal congenital heart defects such as tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus, and d-transposition of the great arteries.

- Mirror image branching of the head and neck vessels. The first branch left the innominate artery, the second right carotid, and the third right subclavian.

- Most common (59%).
- Often associated with conotruncal congenital heart disease (truncus arteriosus and tetralogy of Fallot)

- Aberrant left subclavian artery from a diverticulum of Kommerell as a fourth branch from the aorta. The first branch is left carotid, second right carotid, and third right carotid.

- Second most common with a prevalence of approximately 40%.
- Not usually associated with congenital heart disease.
- Completes a vascular ring

- Obliteration/isolation of the left subclavian artery with collateralization. Otherwise, the arch branching is similar to type 2.

- Third most common with a prevalence of 1.5%.
