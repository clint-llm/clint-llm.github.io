The pathophysiology of MMD remains unclear, though genetic predisposition is theorized in East Asian countries. Mutations in BRCC3/MTCP1 and GUCY1A3 genes are implicated in Moyamoya syndrome. Affected individuals are found to have concentric and eccentric fibro cellular thickening of intima within the intracranial portion of ICA. In a study involving the Midwestern US population, an unusually high prevalence of type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disorders, and other autoimmune disorders were found in the moyamoya cohort which may point towards an autoimmune association. Chronic brain ischemia resulting from the narrowing is believed to be causing an overexpression of proangiogenic factors (fibroblast growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor) which, in turn, would cause the development of a fragile network of collateral vessels

The following types of MMD (with the chromosome involved) have been described in the literature:

- MYMY1 - chromosome 3p

- MYMY2 - RNF213 gene on chromosome 17q25

- MYMY3 - chromosome 8q23

- MYMY4 - X-linked recessive condition characterized by MMD, short stature, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and facial dysmorphism.

- MYMY5 - ACTA2 gene on chromosome 10q23

- MYMY6 with achalasia - GUCY1A3 gene on chromosome 4q32
