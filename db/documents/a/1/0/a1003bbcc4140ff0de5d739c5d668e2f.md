Seronegative spondyloarthropathies (SpA) are a family of rheumatologic disorders that classically include

- Ankylosing spondylitis (AS)

- Psoriatic arthritis (PsA)

- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) associated arthritis

- Reactive arthritis (formerly Reiter syndrome; ReA)

- Undifferentiated SpA.

Recently, these disorders have been differentiated further into three additional categories including non-radiographic axial SpA (nr-axSpA), peripheral SpA, and lastly, juvenile-onset SpA. This family of disorders shares several clinical features and has common genetic associations.
