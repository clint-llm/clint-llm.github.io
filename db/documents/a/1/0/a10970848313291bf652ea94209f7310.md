Klippel-Feil syndrome presents with an abnormal fusion of 2 or more bones in the cervical spine. This creates a characteristic appearance of a short neck with resulting facial asymmetry, low hairline, and limited neck mobility. This can lead to chronic headaches, limited range of neck motion, and neck muscle pain. More importantly, it can also result in spinal stenosis, neurologic deficit, cervical spinal deformity, instability, and spinal stenosis. Patients can be poly-syndromic in their presentation as well. This activity reviews the evaluation of Klippel Feil syndrome and the role of the interprofessional team in managing this rare condition.
