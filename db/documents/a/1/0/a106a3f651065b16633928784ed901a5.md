The acute rejections predispose to chronic graft dysfunction.

T Cell-Mediated rejections have better graft survival, especially when they respond to therapy and the serum creatinine reaches near to the previous baseline after the treatment.

Acute rejections occurring after three months, vascular rejections, and the rejections not responding to therapy (serum creatinine not reaching 75% of baseline value) are associated with poor graft survival.

The appearance of de novo DSAs at any time post-transplant is associated with 5% poor graft outcome per year as compared to recipients without these antibodies.

Due to the above-mentioned graft outcomes, each episode of acute rejection needs to be treated and monitored thoroughly by optimizing the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen.
