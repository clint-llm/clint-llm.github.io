Prothrombin complex concentrate is a newer biological agent and is not yet widely available. It may be used as a medium to reverse bleeding and improve patient outcomes through interprofessional collaboration between clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nursing staff, and pharmacists. Pharmacists can be an excellent resource in this setting, guiding clinicians concerning dosing and indications for administration and answering team members' questions about the medication. This type of interprofessional team coordination can result in more effective therapy when using PCC when indicated, producing improved outcomes. [Level 5]
