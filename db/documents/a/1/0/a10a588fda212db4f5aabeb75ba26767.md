Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a rare and aggressive variant of chronic pyelonephritis. It usually occurs due to chronic nephrolithiasis and infection. The diagnosis is often confused with renal cell carcinoma, and a computed tomography (CT) scan, as well as histology of the mass, helps to confirm the diagnosis. Since it can involve adjacent structures or organs, early diagnosis and treatment with nephrectomy have an excellent prognosis. This activity describes the evaluation and management of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.
- Describe the imaging findings associated with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.
- Outline the treatment options available for xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.
