There is conflicting evidence as to whether pseudocholinesterase deficiency plays a role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. However, increased levels of BuChE and altered structure/function of the enzyme are observable in patients with Alzheimer's disease, specifically within the pathognomonic amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.

Plasma cholinesterase levels were significantly higher in patients with drug addictions (most notably, cocaine) than those without, suggesting it serves a significant role in addiction pathophysiology.

Hepatocytes function as the primary synthesis pathway for plasma cholinesterase. Serum levels of plasma cholinesterase may serve as a valuable biomarker of liver function with an excellent correlation to the currently accepted standards of serum albumin, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, and MELD score (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease).
