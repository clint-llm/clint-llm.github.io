Infections of the deep neck tissues are complicated, in diagnosis, localization, access, and management. The anatomy of the neck is complex with critical structures of the airway, gastrointestinal system, and major vessels and nerves. The affected tissues may be deep and impossible to palpate or visualize externally. Nearby structures can become involved in the inflammation and lead to neurovascular, bony, or airway issues. It is crucial to understand different neck abscesses and how they may present as well as the best ways to treat them.
