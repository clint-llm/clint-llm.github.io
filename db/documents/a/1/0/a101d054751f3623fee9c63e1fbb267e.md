Since the initial TIMI 1 study, the TIMI flow grading system has been used globally to measure epicardial flow and is considered the “gold standard” model compared to other modalities. It has been studied to show the predictability of clinical outcomes. The global utilization of streptokinase and tissue plasminogen activator for occluded coronary arteries (GUSTO) studied TIMI grade flows and 30-day mortality. The original investigators analyzed data from the GUSTO trial and noted “a lack of patency at 90 minutes (TIMI grade 0 or 1) was associated with mortality of 8.9 percent, and patency (TIMI grade 2 or 3) with mortality of 5.7 percent (P = 0.04). The mortality rate among patients with TIMI grade 2 flow was 7.4 percent, and the rate among those with TIMI grade 3 flow was 4.4 percent (P = 0.08). The difference between the mortality rate associated with grade 3 and the rate associated with grade 0 or 1 was significant (P = 0.009).”

Additionally, patients with TIMI 3 before angioplasty are less likely to develop left ventricular complications and have improved survival. Other examples of clinical significance include a demonstration of increased mortality risk in a patient with low TIMI grade flow (0-2) post-PCI for STEMI among patients with cardiogenic shock, compared to normal post-PCI TIMI grade flow.
