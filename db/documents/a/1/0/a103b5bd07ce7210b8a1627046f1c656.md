The disease is immunological; representing a type III hypersensitivity reaction. The exact mechanism by which PSGN occurs is not fully determined. The body responds to nephrogenic streptococcal infection by forming immune complexes containing the streptococcal antigen with a human antibody.

The presence of immune complexes leads to the activation of the alternate complement pathway causing infiltration of the leukocytes, and proliferation of the mesangial cells in the glomerulus thus impairing the capillary perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Reduction in GFR can lead to renal failure (oliguria or anuria), acid-base imbalance, electrolyte abnormalities, volume overload, edema, and hypertension.
