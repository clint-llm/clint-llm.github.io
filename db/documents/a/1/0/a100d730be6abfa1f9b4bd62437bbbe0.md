Transrectal ultrasound of the prostate is a crucial tool in the evaluation of prostate pathology. Understanding of the techniques used allows tests to be ordered for the correct scenarios and possibly in situations they may not have been ordered in the past. Advancing techniques also allow for better diagnosis and alleviate the need for cross-sectional imaging and, therefore, radiation. Given the increasing burden of prostate cancer, infection, and BPH on the healthcare system, inexpensive diagnostic tools, provide a prompt diagnosis, and are easy to perform will become even more important. That is what TRUS represents.
