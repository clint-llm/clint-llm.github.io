Tuberculosis pulmonary inflammation is characterized by lung tissue destruction and necrosis, unlike other lung infections that affect mainly the airways.M. tuberculosis include cell wall mycolic acid glycolipids, lipoarabinomannan (LAM), sulfatides, and trehalose dimycolate.

M. tuberculosis cell wall also contains different kinds of mycolic acids that are integral to the organism growth inside macrophages.

Unlike most gram-negative bacteria, the main virulence factor ofÂ tuberculosis evolves around "survival" within its human host, rather than actively attacking the host or evading its defenses. The main example is when it develops cholesterol uptake mechanisms from the host to enhance its survival.
