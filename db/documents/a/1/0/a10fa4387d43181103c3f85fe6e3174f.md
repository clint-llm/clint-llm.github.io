While the neurologist usually initiates zonisamide treatment, patient follow-up is usually done by the primary care provider and nurse practitioner. Patients receiving therapy with zonisamide need monitoring of their renal function and CBC at regular intervals. Further, signs and symptoms of depression and behavior change should be monitored closely. Monitoring of serum levels of the drug is recommended for all patients to ensure appropriate dosing. Serum levels may not correlate with the dose because it has concentration-dependent erythrocyte binding. The patient response usually correlates well with drug serum level. Patient compliance with the medication should be reinforced at every interaction by the nurse and pharmacist. These examples of interprofessional team collaboration will contribute to therapeutic success with zonisamide therapy while minimizing adverse events. [Level 5]
