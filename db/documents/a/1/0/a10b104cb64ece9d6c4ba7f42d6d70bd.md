**Home Medications and Diet**

Injuries involving the upper or lower jaw or teeth should prompt recommendations for a soft or liquid diet and avoid extremes in food temperature. The provision of liquid-form medication prescriptions is often necessary. Patients with injuries involving the sinuses or nasal cavity should be given sinus precautions.

**Follow Up**

Follow up for most pediatric fractures will involve a pediatric facial specialist; timing of follow up should be discussed with the specialist, though usually within one week is reasonable if there are no urgent operative indications. Dental injuries should be referred to a pediatric dentist. If possible, any images and radiological reports obtained in the emergency department should be provided to the patientâ€™s caregivers to minimize the need for subsequent radiation when re-imaging; this also allows outside providers to compare later stages of healing to the initial injury.
