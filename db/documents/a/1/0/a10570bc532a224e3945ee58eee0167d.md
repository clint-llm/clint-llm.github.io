Lurasidone metabolism is primarily via the cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP3A4. Therefore, when used concomitantly with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, it is recommended to decrease the lurasidone dose to half of the original level with a starting dose of 20 mg and a maximum dose of 80 mg/day. Similarly, when combined with moderate CYP3A4 inducers, the lurasidone dose may be increased appropriately.

Examples of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors are clarithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and grapefruit juice.

Examples of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors are verapamil, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fluvoxamine, andÂ tofisopam.

Examples of strong CYP3A4 inducers are rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's wort.

Examples of moderate CYP3A4 inducers are modafinil and armodafinil.
