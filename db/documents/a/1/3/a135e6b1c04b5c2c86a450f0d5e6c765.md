Intraocular lenses (IOLs) are among the most significant inventions in Ophthalmology. Before intraocular lenses were invented, removing cataracts (aphakia) made the patient highly hyperopic. High-powered convex glasses were required to give good distance and near visual acuity. Such glasses caused multiple visual aberrations. Monofocal intraocular lenses are indicated for the visual correction of aphakia after extracapsular cataract extraction. Such lenses have a single focus and are usually planned to correct the distance vision. Patients having such lenses need glasses for near. Monofocal toric IOLs and monofocal IOLs with enhanced depth of focus are further advancements in technology. This activity describes different types of monofocal IOLs, indications of monofocal IOLs, and the use of such intraocular implants by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify various types of monofocal intraocular lenses and their indications.
- Describe pre-procedural planning and preparation to perform successful implantation of monofocal intraocular lenses.
- Summarize the complications of the procedure of implanting monofocal intraocular lenses.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for monofocal intraocular lenses and enhance post-surgical management.
