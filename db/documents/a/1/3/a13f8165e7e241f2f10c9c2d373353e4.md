Several potential mechanisms have been studied concerning the pathogenesis of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Retrospective observational patient data, hospital data from patients with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy in hospital epilepsy monitoring units (EMU), importantly, the MORTEMUS trial (MORTality in Epilepsy Monitoring Unit Study), as well as eyewitness accounts, have identified respiratory abnormalities, cardiac arrhythmia, and attenuation of cerebral function as commonly observed peri-ictal phenomena.

Multiple studies have evaluated respiratory factors that may contribute to SUDEP. In most reported SUDEP cases, the patient was discovered in a prone position, likely during sleep, suggesting suffocation

Although cardiac arrhythmias have also been identified, signs of respiratory abnormalities (apnea, abnormal breathing patterns, hypoxia) are more commonly associated with brain dysfunction and were more commonly observed in witnessed and monitored cases of SUDEP. As the heart rhythm is generated independent of brain function, cardiac arrhythmia present in cases of SUDEP may suggest a secondary mechanism of the disease, such as channelopathy.
