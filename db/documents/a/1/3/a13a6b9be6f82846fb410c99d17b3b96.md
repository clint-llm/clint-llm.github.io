An evidence-based approach to preexposure HIV prophylaxis

More evidence has accumulated that pre-exposure HIV prophylaxis may be a better and more effective way to treat patients at high risk for HIV. Healthcare workers should be aware of this regimen since it is cheaper, simpler and safer than the traditional HAART regimen. Once preexposure prophylaxis is initiated, the goal is to ensure compliance, side effects of the medications and educate the patient on lowering of high-risk behaviors. While short-term studies indicate that pre-exposure HIV prophylaxis does work, more long-term studies are needed to determine if this also results in a lowering of HIV cases and slows down the HIV epidemic.
