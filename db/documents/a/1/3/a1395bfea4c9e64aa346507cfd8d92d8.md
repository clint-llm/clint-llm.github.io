Dermatographism lesions appear following mechanical trauma to the skin, most consistently stroking of the skin. A wheal forms and develops in approximately 5 to 10 minutes. The wheal will persist for about 15 to 30 minutes. The deeper the edema into the dermis, the larger the wheal will appear. In symptomatic dermatographism, pruritus accompanies the wheal. The pruritus worsens at night (thought to be related to the pressure of the bedding and sheets contacting the skin) and friction to the area from external stimuli, heat, stress, emotion, and exercise.

Dermatographism most commonly involves the trunk and extremities, and other body surfaces. The least common areas reported are the scalp and genital area; however, symptomatic dermatographism has been correlated in the literature with dyspareunia and vulvodynia.

There are several rare subtypes of dermatographism:

- Red dermatographism (small punctate wheals, predominantly on the trunk)

- Follicular dermatographism (isolated urticarial papules)

- Cholinergic dermatographism (similar to cholinergic urticaria – large erythematous line marked by punctate wheals)

- Delayed dermatographism (tender urticarial lesion reappears 3 to 8 hours after the initial injury that persist up to 48 hours)

- Cold-precipitated

- Exercise-induced

- Familial
