The word 'synovial' is a misnomer in synovial sarcoma, as the development of the tumor is not limited to the synovium and can originate anywhere in the body. The pathognomonic translocation between chromosomes X and 18 leads to the expression ofÂ several SS18:SSX fusion proteins described in this tumor's pathogenesis. SS18:SSX1 and SS18:SSX2 (and rarely SS18:SSX4) are the fusion proteins expressed in 95% of patients diagnosed with SS and are essential in establishing the diagnosis. The fusion proteins bind to the BAF complex (BRG1- or HBRM-associated factors), which displaces the tumor suppressor BAF47. The modified BAF complex leads to the activation of Sox2 (sex-determine region Y-box 2), which is necessary for the proliferation of synovial sarcoma.
