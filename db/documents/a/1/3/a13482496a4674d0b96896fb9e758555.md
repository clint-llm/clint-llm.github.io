A cardiologist most often prescribes isoproterenol. However, the use of the drug requires an interprofessional team that consists of ICU nurses and other nursing staff, intensivists, cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, critical care specialists, and pharmacists. The drug only has an application as an intravenous drip for severe bradycardia and cardiac arrest. It is sometimes used to manage hypovolemic shock and bronchospasm. Isoproterenol can cause tachyarrhythmias and hypertension at high doses. When used in the ICU, the patient requires close monitoring. Because of the availability of pacemakers and other chronotropic drugs, the use of isoproterenol has diminished in the current medical paradigm.

As stated, isoproterenol requires interprofessional collaboration for effective use. The ordering clinician (MD, DO, NP, or PA) decides to use the drug, but the entire healthcare team must be involved. This team includes specialists, as listed above, as well as pharmacists and other nursing staff.

The pharmacist needs to verify dosing and perform thorough medication reconciliation; it would be prudent to enlist the assistance of a Board Certified Cardiology pharmacist when ordering isoproterenol, as their extensive additional training can be a good resource for the team regarding interactions, dosing and dose adjustments, and advising the team on what to monitor for potential adverse events.

Nursing is at the front lines for entering patient medication history and also conducting the monitoring necessary when administering isoproterenol. Any abnormal results or concerns require communication with the team, including clinicians and the pharmacy, for dosing or drug changes. This is essential, given the nature of the conditions treated with isoproterenol and the potential adverse events and/or drug interactions, which can cause severe problems for the patient—as with pharmacy, having nursing staff with additional specialized cardiology training can prove to be of significant benefit. Only with this type of collaborative team effort and interprofessional communication can the interprofessional team optimize isoproterenol therapy, resulting in improved outcomes with fewer adverse events.
