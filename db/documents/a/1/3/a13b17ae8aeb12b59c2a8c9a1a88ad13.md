After the skin is marked, the local subcutaneous soft tissues are anesthetized with 1 to 3 mL of 1% lidocaine hydrochloride for local anesthesia. A 23-gauge 3.5-inch spinal needle is then used with a stylet in place with an anterior/vertical approach through the soft tissues until reaching the humeral head cortex.

Intermittent fluoroscopy allows for careful centering of the needle hub over the needle tip to ensure a precise perpendicular approach into the joint space. The needle is slightly retracted to avoid immediate termination within the humeral head hyaline cartilage. The stylet is removed, and a small volume of anesthetic is then injected to ensure a low-pressure intra-articular placement and anesthetization of the cortical surface. A test contrast injection with approximately 0.5 to 2 mL of contrast ensures that the needle does not terminate within an adjacent bursa and is truly intra-articular.  Intra-articular contrast movement, as evidenced by a small column of contrast between the glenoid and humerus, confirms intra-articular placement for imaging documentation. A syringe containing the corticosteroid with or without a connecting tube is then attached to the 23-gauge needle, and the steroid is subsequently injected into the joint. In the case of an MR arthrogram, the syringe contains approximately 10 mL of diluted gadolinium, and approximately 8 to 10 mL is injected into the glenohumeral joint.

If the acromioclavicular joint is being injected, the local soft tissues are similarly anesthetized with lidocaine. A needle is advanced in a similar vertical approach until the joint capsule is penetrated. A small volume of contrast confirms the intracapsular position of the needle via fluoroscopy. This verification is followed by an injection of approximately a 1 mL mixture of a 0.5 mL triamcinolone (40 mg/mL) and a 0.5 mL lidocaine solution.
