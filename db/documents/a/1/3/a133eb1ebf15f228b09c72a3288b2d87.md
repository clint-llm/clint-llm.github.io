Specular microscopy is challenging to ascertain in patients with small micromovements and nystagmus patients.

Specular microscopy has revolutionized the management of FECD and cataract patients and is also an important tool for assessing the endothelial status on serial follow-ups. Understanding and working knowledge of specular microscopy are highly imperative for all ophthalmologists to guide the management and prognosis of all patients.
