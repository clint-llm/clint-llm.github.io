Clinical examination: Myotonia can be observed by asking patients to repeatedly open and close their eyes or to open and close their fist. Repeated tapping of a muscle similarly induces myotonia.

Biochemical investigations are usually unremarkable, although mild elevations of creatinine kinase have been described up to three to four times the upper limit of normal.

Genetic testing is considered the gold standard. However, in many patients, mutations within the CLCN1 gene are not identified despite significant clinical features correlating with a myotonic picture. A multigene panel is usually performed initially, including the CLCN1 gene, as well as other genes of interest such as SCN4A (discussed in differential diagnoses). Genetic testing and selection of techniques used should be undertaken by specialized centers in order to evaluate variants of unknown significance (VUS), correlate identified mutations with clinical phenotype, and minimize costs. If a multigene panel does not identify an explanatory mutation, genomic techniques, including exome sequencing and mitochondrial sequencing, may be employed.
