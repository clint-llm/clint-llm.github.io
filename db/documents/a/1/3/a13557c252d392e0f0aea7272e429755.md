The incidence of colon polyps increases in direct correlation with age. By age 50, colorectal cancer screening studies have demonstrated a prevalence of 25% to 30%, increasing to 50% by age 70 in high-risk Western countries such as the United States. Colon polyps are rare in the younger population, present in only one to four percent of 20 to 30-year-olds. Villous adenomas account for 5% toÂ 15% of all adenomas.
