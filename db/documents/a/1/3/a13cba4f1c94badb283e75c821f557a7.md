The following five distinct shellfish-poisoning syndromes can result from the toxicity:

- Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) - Symptoms usually commence within two hours of exposure, but can begin anywhere between 15 minutes and 10 hours after eating contaminated shellfish.

- Neurologic shellfish poisoning (NSP) - The illness associated with NSP is less severe than that with PSP. Patients usually present with gastroenteritis, burning sensation in the rectum, paresthesias of the face, limbs, and trunk. There may also be myalgias, ataxia, vertigo, and inability to distinguish hot/cold sensation.

- Diarrheal shellfish poisoning (DSP) - It is associated with stomach and intestinal symptoms that begin between 30 minutes and a few hours after exposure and include severe diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and chills.

- Amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) - Mostly, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain appear within 24 hours of consuming toxic shellfish. These symptoms are followed by headache, loss of memory, and cognitive decline.

- Azaspiracid shellfish poisoning (AZP) - Consuming contaminated shellfish may result in symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps.
