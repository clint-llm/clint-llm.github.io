Symptoms may include dyspnea on exertion (most common), fatigue, lethargy, exertional syncope and exertional chest pain, abdominal edema or distension, and lower extremity edema.

The clinical signs occur late, being observed at an advanced stage of the disease far after the development of pulmonary hypertension.

Physical findings may include:

- Jugular venous distension: Prominent jugular V wave, indicating the presence of tricuspid regurgitation

- Peripheral (ankle) edema: The best sign of RHF, but it is not specific and can arise from other causes

- Cardiovascular: Palpable left the parasternal lift, loud S2 (accentuation of the pulmonary component of the second heart sound) narrow splitting of S2, a holosystolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation at the left lower sternal border, right-sided S4 heart sound

- Abdomen: Hepatomegaly, ascites.
