**Bridge-to-Transplantation**

The purpose of Bridge-to-Transplantation (BTT) is to provide circulatory support to transplant-eligible patients with HFrEF until a donor's heart becomes available.

**Destination therapy**

Destination therapy (DT) is used in patients with HFrEF who are ineligible for cardiac transplantation. The newer devices with improved durability have shown increased survival rates in this category of patients.

**Bridge-to-the-Decision**

LVADs have been used as a temporary measure in patients with end-organ dysfunction due to HF (relative contraindication to transplantation). Stabilization of hemodynamics with improvement in renal function, nutritional status, and reduction in pulmonary hypertension can help make them transplant-eligible.

**Bridge-to-Recovery**

Bridge-to-Recovery (BTR)****provides temporary ventricular support in some HF patients and has been shown to improve myocardial function and promote recovery

Strong indications for either BTT, DT, or BTR are as follows. All must be applicable

- NYHA class IV for 60 to 90 days

- Maximal tolerated medical therapy and certified respiratory therapy/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator if indicated

- Chronic dependence on inotropic agents

- LVEF less than 25%

- Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure greater than or equal to 20 mmHg

- Systolic BP less than or equal to 80 to 90 mmHg or cardiac index less than or equal to 2 L/min/m2, evidence of declining renal or right ventricular function
