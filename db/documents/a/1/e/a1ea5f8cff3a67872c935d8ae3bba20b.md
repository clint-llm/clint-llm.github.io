Optic nerve sheath meningiomas are rare benign tumors of the central nervous system. Although they are slow-growing, their location directly affects the anterior visual pathway and can lead to severe visual loss. Treatment of this condition is controversial, as the proximity of the tumor to the optic nerve makes it difficult to completely remove it without causing secondary complications. This activity describes the pathophysiology, presentation, and management of optic nerve sheath meningiomas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of optic nerve sheath meningiomas.
- Describe the presentation of optic nerve sheath meningiomas.
- Summarize the treatment options for optic nerve sheath meningiomas.
- Explain the importance of enhancing care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by optic nerve sheath meningiomas.
