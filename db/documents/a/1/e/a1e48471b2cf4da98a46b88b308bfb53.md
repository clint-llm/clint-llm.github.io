A review of the literature has not revealed any studies which examine the natural progression of the disease. Furthermore, most studies focus on the treatment of the disease in its late stages. Ultimately, if undiagnosed, patients with SON will develop end-stage osteoarthritis and require total knee arthroplasty. Several studies have demonstrated outstanding results of TKR in patients with SON, as previously discussed. Modern advances in surgical techniques, improved biomechanical implants, and improved perioperative and postoperative medical management have led to these excellent outcomes in patients undergoing TKR due to SON.
