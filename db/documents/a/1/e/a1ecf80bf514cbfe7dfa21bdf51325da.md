**Statins**have significantly reduced coronary artery disease rates, TIA rates and strokes.

Statins inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. They decrease LDL, thereby reducing mortality.

Examples include - Atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, pitavastatin decrease LDL by >50% (high intensity statins)

Lovastatin, simvastain, decrease LDL moderately (moderate intensity statins, decrease LDL between by 30%-50%)

Fluvavastatin, pravastatin decrease LDL mildly (decrease LDL-C by <30%)

**Bile acid sequestrants**

Cholestyramine, cholesterol, cloesevelam.

They bind to bile acids and decrease absorption of cholesterol and increase LDL receptors.

**PCSK9 inhibitors**- Alirocumab and Evolocumab cause a decrease in LDL cholesterol levels through decreased degradation of LDL receptors.

**Ezetimibe**- It selectively inhibits cholesterol absorption in the intestine by binding to the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein.

Exercise along with decreased intake of dietary saturated fat aid in decreasing the prevalence of high serum cholesterol and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
