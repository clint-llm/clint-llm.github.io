Deterioration of visual acuity due to reflections is common with prisms greater than ten prism dioptres. The vision deterioration with Fresnel prisms is more than with conventional prisms. A 30-prism dioptre conventional prism might reduce visual acuity from 20/20 to 20/30. This is lesser than the Fresnel prism, which reduces visual acuity from 20/20 to 20/100.
