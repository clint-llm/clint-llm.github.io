Adequate cell specimens are necessary to analyze the RER organelle properly. There are different techniques used for the different types of histological sections. A light microscopy study requires specimens prepared through either the paraffin technique, frozen sections, or semithin sections. The paraffin technique is most commonly used to prepare this type of section. For electron microscope studies, the method used to make histology sections is similar to the method for semithin sections.
