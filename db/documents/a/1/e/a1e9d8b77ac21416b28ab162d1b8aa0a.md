Rolando fractures are the result of compressive forces acting along the axis of the metacarpal shaft when the trapezo-metacarpal articulation is in a flexed position.

The locus minoris resistenziae (or point of least resistance, also known as the weakest part of the bone) is the anteromedial margin of the base of the first metacarpal which obliquely detaches, as in the Bennett-type fracture patterns.  However, a true Rolando fracture characteristically presents with the concomitant fracture of the stronger, dorsolateral process that separates from the body of the bone, giving rise to the second fragment.
