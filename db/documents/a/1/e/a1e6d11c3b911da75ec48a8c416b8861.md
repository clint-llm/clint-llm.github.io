The wrist joint forms at weeks 5 and 6 from mesenchyme in each limb bud. Synovial joint formation is induced by Hox transcription factors at specific points along the developing limb bones.

For the wrist, a slightly more complicated process occurs to develop the final joint. Initially, the lunate bone is located between the developing radius and ulnar bones.  The ulna itself forms an articulating surface within the joint. Through differential growth patterns, the lunate eventually migrates into its physiologic and anatomic location, and the distal ulna eventually resorbs proximally until it no longer articulates with the wrist joint itself.  In effect, the articular disk takes its place.
