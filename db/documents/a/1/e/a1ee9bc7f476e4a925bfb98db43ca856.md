Cortisol is an adrenal steroid hormone required for the endocrine function that is produced in the second month of fetal life. Poor cortisol production is a hallmark of CAH. Inefficient cortisol production results in elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Increased ACTH stimulation induces hyperplasia of the steroid-producing cells of the adrenal cortex. The defect results in adrenal hyperplasia.

Cortisol deficiency in CAH is usually partial. The synthesis of cortisol shares steps with the creation of aldosterone, testosterone, and estradiol. The resulting excess or decreased production of these hormones produces multiple problems.

**Prevention**

Prenatal chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis can detect CAH during pregnancy.
