There are operative and non-operative options for the treatment of common peroneal nerve injuries. Non-operative treatments include ankle-foot orthoses and physical therapy. An ankle-foot orthotic (AFO) may be used for foot drop when surgery is not warranted or during surgical recovery. The specific purpose of an ankle-foot orthotic is to provide toe dorsiflexion during the swing phase, medial or lateral stability at the ankle during stance, and, if necessary, some push off stimulation during the late stance phase. There have been advancements in ankle-foot orthotics in recent years, including carbon fiber that provides even more energy for push-off during the stance phase as well as being lighter and more comfortable to use for patients. Physical therapy for common peroneal nerve injury includes a program of stretching, strengthening, mobilization, manipulation, and proprioceptive and balancing exercises. It may also include icing, ankle bracing, and/or taping.

Surgical indications for common peroneal nerve injuries include a rapidly deteriorating lesion and no signs of improvement within three months and open injuries with suspected nerve laceration.
