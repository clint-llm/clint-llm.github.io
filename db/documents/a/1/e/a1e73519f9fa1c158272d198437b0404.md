ALCL (ALK-positive) is a moderately aggressive T cell lymphoma. The overall prognosis is better than other peripheral T-cell lymphomas. ALCL (ALK-positive) has a better prognosis than ALCL (ALK-negative) with a 5-year overall-all (OS) of 80% compared to 48%. International Prognostic Index (IPI), is a useful prognostic tool in ALCL (ALK-positive). The index assigns one point for each of the following variables:

- Age >60 years

- Serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration greater than normal

- ECOG performance status of 2 or greater

- Clinical stage III or IV disease

- >1 involved extranodal site

MYC gene rearrangement is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. The morphological variants small-cell and lymphohistiocytic variant also confer inferior prognosis compared to the common type histology.  The IPI has shown significant prognostic value, compared to other lymphomas. Research has shown no prognostic difference between classic and variant translocations. Relapses of ALCL (ALK-positive) usually remain sensitive to chemotherapy; allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is usually only for refractory cases.
