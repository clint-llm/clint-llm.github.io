Stroke mimics are projected to increase substantially in the coming years, leading to an increase in resource consumption in an already-taxed healthcare system.

Interprofessional collaboration and communication are of utmost importance in the treatment of strokes and stroke mimics. Timely communication between emergency medicine physicians,Â nurse practitioners, neurologists, and emergency and neurology specialty-trained nursing staff decreases delays to the initiation of thrombolysis if appropriate, which leads to increased efficacy of treatment. This early communication between members of the healthcare team may likewise lead to earlier identification of stroke mimics, helping to mitigate their burden on the healthcare system, including the increased cost to the patient and healthcare system, unnecessary use of stroke facilities, and inappropriate and unnecessary treatment.
