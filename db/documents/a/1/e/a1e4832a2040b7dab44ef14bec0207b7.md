Although there are reported cases of adverse events after receiving the Hib vaccine, these events are considered rare, and most are not considered contraindications for future doses of the Hib vaccine. The only current contraindication to receiving future doses of the Hib vaccine is when an individual has had a prior severe hypersensitivity reaction (such as anaphylaxis) to the vaccine or its constituents.Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoidÂ conjugate)], Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate), or [Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (meningococcal protein conjugate)]. The combination vaccine [diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis adsorbed, inactivated poliovirus, and Haemophilus b conjugate (tetanus toxoid conjugate)] has its own set of several relative contraindications that merit consideration because it is a pertussis-containing vaccine. The only other absolute contraindication to the Hib vaccine is age less than six weeks old.
