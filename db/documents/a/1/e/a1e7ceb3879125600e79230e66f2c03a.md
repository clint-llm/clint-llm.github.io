Abnormal color vision typically subdivides into congenital and acquired forms. The congenital disorders of color vision occur due to defects in genes encoding cone opsins, genes that encode the expression of cone opsins, and genes for proteins involved in phototransduction (such as PDE and CNG channel subunits). Such defects have a wide range of possible outcomes and may feature different rates of progression, retinal degeneration, and loss of visual acuity. Guanylate cyclase deficiencies can lead to Leber congenital amaurosis and severe vision loss early in life. In contrast, rod dystrophies leading to retinitis pigmentosa may cause late color vision abnormalities as degenerating rods affect cone structure and function. Additional causes of color vision defects include fundus albipunctatus and Stargardt disease. Acquired color vision deficiency, or dyschromatopsia, can occur due to any injury or disruption to visual pathways.
