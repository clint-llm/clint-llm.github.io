Intramural hematoma of the esophagus (IHE) or dissecting intramural hematoma of the esophagus is an uncommon condition that presents with acute esophageal symptoms. The patient may present with dysphagia. In most cases, there is no specific treatment as the hematoma will spontaneously regress. This activity describes the pathophysiology of an intramural esophageal hematoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of intramural esophageal hematoma.
- Review the presentation of a patient with an intramural esophageal hematoma.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for esophageal hematoma.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the management of intramural esophageal hematoma and improve outcomes.
