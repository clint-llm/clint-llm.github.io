Perioperative vision loss (POVL) is defined as either partial or complete vision loss following a non-ocular surgical procedure. It includes the clinical manifestations of various ophthalmologic conditions. POVL was first reported in 1948 involving a patient with suspected optic globe injury secondary to sustained increased pressure from improper positioning on the headrest.
