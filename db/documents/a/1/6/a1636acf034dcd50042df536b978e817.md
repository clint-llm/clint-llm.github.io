Metacarpal fractures have several different presentations and can have detrimental effects on the hand if not treated correctly; thus, they require the efforts of an interprofessional team. Classifying these injuries appropriately will give the clinician the tools to choose the correct treatment plan and, if necessary, engage in operative fixation. If there is any ambiguity, an orthopedic specialist should consult on the case. Orthopedic specialty nurses can also significantly contribute to these cases by assisting with operative and non-operative reduction. The nurse can also answer patient questions, perform appropriate follow-up, and inform the treating clinician of any concerns. All interprofessional team members should maintain accurate and updated patient records, so all caregivers have accurate patient data. Being vigilant throughout the treatment process will also help to identify complications to these injuries to provide the best possible outcome for the patient for every level of health care provider on the interprofessional team. The interprofessional approach will yield optimal patient results with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]
