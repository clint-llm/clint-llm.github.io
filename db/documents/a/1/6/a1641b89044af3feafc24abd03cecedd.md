Because trench fever may result in a spectrum of diseases ranging from mild, non-specific symptoms to severe debilitating illnesses, it can help consult a specialist early in the course of the illness. These patients are best managed with an interprofessional team approach that includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), nurses, and pharmacists, all working collaboratively to achieve optimal patient outcomes. It is important to consult an infectious disease specialist and a cardiologist if a patient is diagnosed with endocarditis or bacillary angiomatosis. Nurses can assist with patient assessment and provide patient counseling, as well as coordinate the activities of the various clinicians and serve as a communication coordinator for the team. Pharmacists will verify dosing, perform medication reconciliation, and offer patient counseling regarding drug regimens. All team members must engage in open communication with other team members and maintain accurate records, so all practitioners involved in care have the same accurate and updated data. This interprofessional approach will yield the best possible patient outcomes with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]
