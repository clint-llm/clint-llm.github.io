In the setting of inadvertent methotrexate overdose, leucovorin must start as soon as possible; 10 mg/m^2 must be administered every 6 hours till the concentration of serum methotrexate falls below 10^-8 M on the methotrexate assay. The levels of serum methotrexate require monitoring once every 24 hours until the level falls below the threshold, and renal function must be monitored with daily checks of the serum creatinine levels. If the serum creatinine rises by more than 50% over the previous day's baseline or if the methotrexate one day after admission level is measured to be greater than 5 x 10^-6 M or serum methotrexate value at two days is greater than 9 x 10^-7 M, the dose of leucovorin should get increased to 100 mg/m2 administered intravenously till the serum methotrexate value falls below 10^-8 moles. Hydration is essential, and the team should start a sodium bicarbonate drip; the sodium bicarbonate dose gets titrated to maintain a urinary pH above 7.0.

For patients receiving leucovorin rescue after high dose methotrexate therapy, methotrexate and serum creatinine levels require monitoring at least once a day. Hydration and urinary alkalinization are essential. Leucovorin must continue till the methotrexate level falls below 0.05 micromolar. If delayed excretion is suspected or if raised creatinine levels appear, the dose of leucovorin must increase.

Patients receiving leucovorin along with 5-fluorouracil should have monitoring of serial complete blood counts with differential counts. The CBC and differential must be obtained after the first two rounds of chemotherapy and repeated once a week. Counts should get repeated after courses until reaching the lowest anticipated WBC count. Routine monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) and serum electrolytes should take place before each course. In the presence of severe stomatitis, gastrointestinal toxicity, a WBC nadir of 1000 to 1900/ mm^3, or a platelet nadir 25000 to 75000/mm^3, the dose is decreased by 20%. In the presence of severe gastrointestinal toxicity, a WBC count below 1000/mm^3, or a platelet count less than 25000/mm^3, the dose must decrease by 30%. If none occurs during a course, the dose of leucovorin and fluorouracil may increase by ten percent.

When administered for folic acid deficiency, up to 1 mg per day can be administered intramuscularly. Serum levels of leucovorin do not require checking. Reticulocyte counts measure the response to treatment, and serial hemoglobin measurements, measuring indirect bilirubin, LDH, serum iron, and potassium levels can be considered.
