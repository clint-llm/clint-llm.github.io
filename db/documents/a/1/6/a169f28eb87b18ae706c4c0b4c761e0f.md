The typical presentation of a rectus sheath hematoma is abdominal pain and its associated symptoms like nausea and vomiting. The pain is often sudden in onset, sharp, and does not radiate. In extremely rare cases, the hematoma may be large and present with hypovolemia, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Physical exam usually reveals a palpable localized mass that is non-pulsatile. The Fothergill sign is a mass in the abdominal wall that does not cross the midline and does not change with flexion of the rectus muscles. This suggests a rectus sheath hematoma and is useful to determine if the abdominal mass is within the abdominal wall or intraabdominal cavity. It is not a highly sensitive sign and is often inconclusive in individuals who are obese.

The clinician should obtain a thorough medical history to determine the presence of any risk factors like surgery, coughing, constipation, asthma, bronchitis, anticoagulation therapy, and use of oral anticoagulants and corticosteroids.
