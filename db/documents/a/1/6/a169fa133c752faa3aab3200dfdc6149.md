Catatonia is often thought to precipitate secondary to another underlying illness. Psychiatric disorders can present primarily with symptoms of catatonia. Mood disorders such as bipolar disorder and depression are the most common disorders in which catatonia manifests. A psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia can also be associated with catatonia, and historically schizophrenia recognition and diagnosis included symptoms of catatonia or was subtyped if catatonic symptoms were present. When catatonic symptoms present, the cause is likely psychiatric, but many medical etiologies can lead to catatonia. Neurologic insults such as strokes, neoplasms, or other diseases such as Parkinson's can lead to catatonia. Autoimmune, paraneoplastic, infectious, metabolic, and certain drug exposures and poisonings can lead to the development of catatonia. The differential for the cause of catatonia is very broad, and a new case of catatonia without a significant psychiatric history should be a cause for further evaluation for an underlying insult.
