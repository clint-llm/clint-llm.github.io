Most patients will fully recover without deficits, however, complications are more likely in those with other comorbidities such as sickle cell disease or trait or increasing size of hyphema. For example, elevated intraocular pressure is seen in 13.5% of grade I to II hyphemas; whereas, there is a 52% risk with grade IV hyphemas. The prognosis for normal vision is also affected by the grade of hyphema. Grade I hyphemas have about 90% rate of normal vision; whereas, grade IV has only a 50% to 75% prognosis for normal vision.
