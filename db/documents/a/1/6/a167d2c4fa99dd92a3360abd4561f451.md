# Indications

Anifrolumab is one of three anti-type-1 interferon agents currently under investigation as a potential treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Initial in vivo studies observed higher levels of serum interferon (IFN) in patients with autoimmune disease as opposed to those of healthy controls.

Anifrolumab has gained traction as a promising drug for SLE, as demonstrated in the MUSE study (phase IIb), TULIP-1 (phase III), and TULIP-2 (phase III).

The U.S Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved anifrolumab. As of this writing (July 2021), the drug is still in process with the regulators.

# Mechanism of Action

Anifrolumab is a humanized IgG1k monoclonal antibody that binds to subunit 1 of the type 1 IFN receptor (IFNAR1). It inhibits the formation of an IFN/IFNAR complex and subsequent gene transcription.

IFN alpha is the predominant type 1 IFN implicated in SLE pathogenesis. As a pleiotropic cytokine secreted by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, IFN alpha is responsible for monocyte maturation, neutrophilic NETosis, and polyclonal B-cell expansion and differentiation.

Anifrolumab has been shown to correct defects of the innate and adaptive immune system. SLE patients, especially those with high type 1 IFN gene signature status, had altered protein expression, the reversal of cytopenias, and normalization of immune cell populations when treated with anifrolumab.

# Administration

Two routes of administration, subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV), have been studied in human subjects.

Anifrolumab 300 mg IV appeared to be more efficacious as it achieved a higher Cmax and shorter Tmax. Researchers did not measure bioavailability in this study; however, there was a quantifiable serum anifrolumab concentration in the treatment groups at least 28 days after the initial dose. Serum concentrations dropped below a detectable threshold by 84 days post-dose. In the MUSE study, anifrolumab 300 or 1000 mg IV was administered every four weeks for 48 weeks to the treatment groups. Interestingly, it exhibited non-linear pharmacokinetics via trends in trough concentrations.

# Adverse Effects

The most commonly reported adverse effects include upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, infusion-related reaction, bronchitis, and urinary tract infection. Other effects include sinusitis, arthralgia, back pain, and cough. Notably, the incidence of herpes zoster was higher with anifrolumab compared to that of placebo.

# Contraindications

There is no clinical trial data of anifrolumab use in pediatrics, pregnancy, and patients with renal/hepatic impairments. Additionally, researchers excluded patients with active severe lupus nephritis or neuropsychiatric SLE in clinical trials. Thus, at the current moment, anifrolumab should not be administered in this subset of populations.

Due to anifrolumab’s side effect profile, clinicians should exercise caution in patients with an active infection or a history of herpes zoster.

# Monitoring

Drug effects are measured primarily with clinical response. Examples of assessments utilized in clinical trials to measure efficacy include the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K), SLE responder index (SRI), Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI), counts of swollen and tender joints, reductions in glucocorticoid dose, and annual flare rates.

Trending IFN titers, IFN gene signatures, anti-dsDNA antibodies, and complement as parameters to monitor disease activity following anifrolumab administration remain unclear.

# Toxicity

Anifrolumab is safe, tolerable, and effective for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. In MUSE and TULIP-1, at higher anifrolumab doses, there were numeric increases of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to study discontinuation. However, statistical significance was not evaluated. To date, there is no distinct anifrolumab serum level that predicts effectiveness and toxicity. Routine measuring of serum levels in clinical practice remains unclear. There is no antidote available. Phase IV clinical trials would help assess the possible toxic effects of anifrolumab.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

SLE is a heterogeneous condition composed of many responsible biochemical pathways and a wide array of phenotypes. An interprofessional healthcare team approach to treating SLE that includes clinicians (including mid-level practitioners), specialists, nursing staff, and pharmacists is necessary.

Overall, anifrolumab is a novel IFNAR1 antagonist that can assist in achieving clinical remission or low disease activity in patients with SLE. If approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration, anifrolumab should only be used as adjunctive therapy to standard immunosuppressants in adults aged 18 to 70 with SLE. Future clinical trials exploring the use of anifrolumab in lupus nephritis and neuropsychiatric SLE are needed to expand clinical indication. Before using anifrolumab, healthcare providers should conduct a thorough history and physical to assess baseline clinical status. Patients should be vigilant in monitoring for signs of infections, particularly herpes zoster.
