Mental health disorders in military and veteran populations can be diagnosed through detailed history-taking; however, mental status or cognitive testing and labs may be needed to distinguish between several medical and psychiatric illnesses. Timely diagnosis and intervention are best achieved through interprofessional collaboration.

Primary care providers can screen populations at risk and can likely be the first to suspect PTSD, depression, suicidality, SUDs, and comorbidities. Nurses can be instrumental in patient education and monitoring and can be a conduit between care teams. Social workers serve as outpatient counselors and are indispensable in these disorders with such pervasive social effects. Pharmacists should be consulted when utilizing pharmacotherapy, especially in those with comorbid medical and psychiatric illnesses. Psychologists and psychiatrists can guide or provide care, especially for patients with high acuity or complexity.

All treatment and intervention should involve the patient and family as part of the interprofessional treatment team, as social support is an overarching driver in both the pathogenesis and recovery of these disorders. These interprofessional methods will result in better patient outcomes.
