Menetrier disease is a rare disease that presents with common gastrointestinal symptoms like weight loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Patients should be educated that no one treatment has been proven effective. A nutrition consult may be useful to teach patients about the importance of a high-protein diet. Patients should also be made aware of the potential for malignant transformation, so close follow-up with the gastroenterologist is recommended.
