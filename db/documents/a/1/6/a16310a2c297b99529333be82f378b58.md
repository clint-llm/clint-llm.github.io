The embryological origin of the medial lemniscus, just like the entire nervous system is of neural ectoderm origin. The neural ectoderm further divides into three main sub-divisions that contribute to the DCML pathway.

The neural plate, responsible for the central nervous system (CNS) develops cerebral vesicles, including

- The myelencephalon, which develops into the medulla oblongata

- The metencephalon developing into the pons

- The mesencephalon developing into the midbrain

- The diencephalon developing into the thalamus

- The telencephalon developing into the cerebral cortex

As previously described, all ofÂ these structures are important components of the DCML tract and its development. Furthermore, the protein Netrin-1 secreted from the floor plate of the medulla oblongata plays an important role in the development and migration of the axons forming the medial lemniscus.

The neural crest cells responsible for the peripheral nervous system (PNS), including the somatic sensory nerves, give rise to first-order neurons of the DCML pathway. It contributes to the development of tactile mechanoreceptors such as Meissner corpuscles giving light touch and vibrations, Ruffini corpuscles detecting tension in the skin, Merkel discs detecting pressure, and Pacinian corpuscles detecting high-frequency vibration.

Lastly, the ectodermal placodes, which provide cranial sensory ganglia, develop into the chief sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve whose axons also join the medial lemniscus pathway to provide conscious proprioception, vibration, fine touch, and 2-point discrimination of the head.
