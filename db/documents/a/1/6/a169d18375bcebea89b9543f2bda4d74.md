Age-appropriate equipment is key to the safe and successful performance of regional procedures in children. Smaller gauge, shorter needles are essential for neuraxial procedures. Short block needles can be used for peripheral nerve blocks. A majority of the complications reported in the French-Language Society of Paediatric Anaesthesiologists (ADARPEF) could be attributed to inappropriate equipment.

Chlorhexidine is the most common skin disinfectant used prior to regional blocks. Chlorhexidine has prolonged residual action and helps prevent bacterial colonization of continuous catheters.

Ultrasonogram (USG) has become a piece of integral equipment in the anesthesiologist’s toolbox. It helps in the precise localization of the nerves and administration of very small LA doses to block nerves safely and effectively. It has also paved the way for a range of plane blocks, including transversus abdominis plane block and erector spinae plane block. In addition, appropriate pediatric size probes with a smaller footprint facilitate better visualization and block placement.
