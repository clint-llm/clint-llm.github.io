**Embryology.**The development of the coagulation system begins in the fetus. The various clotting factors and the coagulation proteins initially get expressed in the endothelial cells during early gestation. They usually are undetectable in the plasma until after the first trimester. There is a transient gap in the development and maturation of the hemostatic proteins from the early second trimester until term due to some unclear mechanisms. Due to the similar structure and functionality of the hemostatic coagulative proteins in the fetus and the similarity in the platelet expression, there is a rarity in the occurrence of any thrombotic/hemorrhagic complications in the healthy fetus unless there is any form of uteroplacental insufficiency due to any maternal or fetal factors.
