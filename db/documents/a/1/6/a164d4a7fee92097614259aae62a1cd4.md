The word "gastroenteritis" originates from the Greek word gastron, meaning "stomach," and enteron, meaning "small intestine." So the word "gastroenteritis" means "inflammation of the stomach and small intestine." Medically, gastroenteritis is defined as a diarrheal disease, in other words, an increase in bowel movement frequency with or without vomiting, fever, and abdominal pain. An increase in bowel movement frequency is defined by three or more watery or loose bowel movements in 24 hours or at least 200 grams of stool per day. It is classified in many ways, but according to the duration of symptoms, it is described as acute, persistent, chronic, or recurrent.

- Acute: 14 days or fewer than 14 days in duration.

- Persistent: More than 14 but fewer than 30 days in duration.

- Chronic: More than 30 days in duration.

- Recurrent: Diarrhea that recurs after 7 days without diarrhea.
