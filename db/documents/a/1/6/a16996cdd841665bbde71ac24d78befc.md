Equipment greatly depends on the type of exercise involved. These are as follows.

- Aerobic exercise: often requires no equipment in terms of running outside but a patient may choose to use such machines as ellipticals,

- Strength exercise: usually involves the use of weights. In calisthenics, one often requires gymnastic equipment.

- Mobility: usually involves static and dynamic stretching. Time stretching does not count towards the recommended 150 minutes of exercise per week. Most patients who exercise using every major joint do not need to incorporate specific mobility work.
