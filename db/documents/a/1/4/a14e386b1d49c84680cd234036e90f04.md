Aphasia differsÂ from dysarthria which results from impaired articulation. Dysarthria is a motor dysfunction due to disrupted innervation to the face, tongue, or soft palate that results in slurred speech. Conduction aphasia differs from Wernicke and Broca aphasia in that there is an isolated inability to repeat. Neurodegenerative disorders such as primary progressive aphasia lead to a gradual loss of language function.
