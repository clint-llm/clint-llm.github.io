The differential diagnosis for facial paralysis is long and broad, but acute facial paralysis in the setting of head trauma is rarely a result of anything other than a temporal bone fracture.

However, strokes typically result in multiple neurological symptoms, including other cranial neuropathies, headache, nausea and vomiting, vital sign instability, and potentially limb weakness, rather than isolated facial nerve palsy.

Similarly, the differential diagnosis for acute hearing loss or vertigo is broad. It includes barotrauma, noise trauma, cholesteatoma, sudden sensorineural hearing loss, superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome, autoimmune inner ear disease, labyrinthitis, Ménière's disease, BPPV, neoplasm, and many others.
