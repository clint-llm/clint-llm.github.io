Acute interstitial pneumonia is a form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia with an acute onset and a rapidly progressive course that frequently leads to diffuse lung injury. This activity outlines the background, etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, presentation, and management options. We also highlight the role of the healthcare team in improving care for this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of acute interstitial pneumonia.
