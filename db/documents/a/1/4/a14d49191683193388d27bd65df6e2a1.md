Sciatic nerve blockade is absolutely contraindicated in two situations: active area of infection where needle puncture will occur and the refusal of a competent patient to undergo the procedure. Other contraindications are relative and include alteration of normal coagulation mechanisms, systemic sepsis or isolated infection, and documented neurological disease or deficit. Before performing a regional anesthetic on these patients, careful consideration must be given to the expected benefit of the block, the potential of a complication occurring, and the expected degree of injury from such a complication.
