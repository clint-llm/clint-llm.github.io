An interprofessional approach with medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, interventional and diagnostic radiologists, and surgical oncologists to address the patientâ€™s condition is essential.

Physical examination findings associated with classic findings of hepatic disease (caput medusa, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites) should also prompt a thorough evaluation. It is essential to perform a rectal exam with a subsequent colonoscopy to check for masses and blood in the stool. Patients with a strong family history of colon cancer or who are past due for their colonoscopy should receive screening. As hepatic disease may arise from elsewhere, a thorough physical exam auscultating for adequate breath sounds and palpation of lymphadenopathy are important in decision-making for care.
