Pulseless electrical activity (PEA), also known as electromechanical dissociation, is a clinical condition characterized by unresponsiveness and impalpable pulse in the presence of sufficient electrical discharge. A lack of ventricular impulse often points to the absence of ventricular contraction, but the contrary is not always true. It means that the electrical activity is pertinent, but not sufficient, condition for contraction. In the case of cardiac arrest, the organized ventricular electrical activity does not usually follow sufficient ventricular response. This activity reviews pulseless electrical activity, its causes, its pathophysiology, management, and prognosis of this entity.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of pulseless electrical activity.
- Explain the pathophysiology of pulseless electrical activity.
- Review the diagnosis and management of pulseless electrical activity.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team effort in the successful resuscitation of a patient with pulseless electrical activity.
