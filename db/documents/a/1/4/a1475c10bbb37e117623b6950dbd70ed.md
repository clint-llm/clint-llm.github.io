Differential diagnosis of hypergastrinemia includes vagotomy, PUD secondary to Helicobacter pylori infection, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use, gastric outlet obstruction, renal insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, and autoimmune gastritis (Type A).

The etiology of peptic ulcers includes the overuse of NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and aspirin. A clinician may be unable to distinguish abdominal pain from excess acids and ulcers from PUD and ZES, but ZES causes more diarrhea and esophageal disease.Helicobacter pylori produce urease which acts near G cells and causes urea hydrolysis and alkalization, affecting D cells and diminishing somatostatin cell release secondary to inflammation. Gastric outlet obstruction causes antral distention, which activates parietal cells via acetylcholine.

Patients with chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease and undergoing dialysis have elevated serum gastrin. Gastrin clears through the kidney, and renal insufficiency will prevent the kidney from working properly. One study revealed an increase in gastric cell growth in a rat model with uremia resulting from proton back diffusion in the stomach, causing less mucosal barrier protection.
