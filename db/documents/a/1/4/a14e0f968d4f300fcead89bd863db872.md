Arterial wallsÂ are composed of three tissue layers:

**Tunica Adventitia (Externa)**

This is the outer covering of the artery. It is composed of connective tissue, collagen, and elastic fibers, which allow distension of the wall during various pressure changes.

**Tunica Media**

It is located between the adventitia and intima. It is composed of circumferentially oriented smooth muscle and elastic fibers.

**Tunica Intima**

The inner layer is composed of an elastic membrane and smooth endothelium.
