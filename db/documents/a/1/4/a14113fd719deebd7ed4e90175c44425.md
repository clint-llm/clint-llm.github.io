Taste is functionally crucial for a few reasons. Taste sensation can change according to the body’s specific nutritional needs at different points in time, thereby guiding an organism to particular sources of whatever nutrient it needs, e.g., salt depleted animals in which adrenalectomy has been performed will choose drinking water that has a higher content of salt to replete body stores.

Once taste signals reach the central nervous system, multiple reflex pathways are activated, leading to the body “preparing” for a meal, with increased salivation and elevated secretory activity in the stomach.
