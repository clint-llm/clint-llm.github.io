Adrenal adenomas are benign neoplasms of the adrenal cortex. Adrenal adenomas are the most common cause of incidentally found adrenal tumors known as “adrenal incidentalomas.” Adrenal adenomas can be either hormonally active or inactive. These tumors are usually detected incidentally on imaging done for unrelated reasons and only in some cases do patients present with symptoms and/or features of hormonal abnormalities, most commonly overproduction of an adrenal hormone.
