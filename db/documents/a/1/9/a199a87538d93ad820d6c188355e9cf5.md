When vision is significantly affected, the patient needs to be educated to use safety glasses to protect the unaffected eye. All patients who developed CON should attend their regular ophthalmologist care visits to evaluate for visual improvement or deterioration.

As the etiologies of CON are multiple, the patient needs a complete evaluation by an interprofessional team to reach the cause and get urgent treatment to improve the outcome.

Early decompression is recommended, but good results can still be obtained even if decompression is delayed. Patients should see an ophthalmologist as soon as they have symptoms. More than half of the patients improve irrespective of the pre-operative visual status.

For tumoral etiologies, 60% of patients will experience some improvement after optic nerve decompression.
