- Pioglitazone is known to derange liver function. Therefore, liver function tests should be obtained prior to starting pioglitazone and periodically thereafter. The frequency of liver function test monitoring should be based on clinical judgment.  Liver function tests may improve with pioglitazone treatment in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

- Pioglitazone should be used carefully in patients with NYHA Class I and II heart failure. Patients should receive counseling to look out for signs like shortness of breath, rapid weight gain, and/or edema (peripheral or pulmonary) after drug initiation and dose changes.

- Assess and maintain bone health in accordance with current standards, especially in female patients.

- Patients are encouraged to report any warning signs of bladder cancer, like red-colored urine (hematuria), increased urge or frequency of urination, weight loss, etc.
