The technique of applying Fresnel prisms varies based on whether the spectacle lens is in or out of the frame.

Spectacle lens out of frame – The Fresnel prism is cut with the scissors as close as possible to the size of the carrier lens. The optical flush is trimmed along the beveled edge of the spectacle lens with the help of a razor blade. This is then inserted into the spectacle frame.

Spectacle lens in the frame – The inside rim of the spectacle frame is traced over the Fresnel prism. This is then cut with the help of scissors and can be applied over the spectacle lens.

Attachment of Fresnel prism sheet onto the spectacle lens. First, the spectacles and the Fresnel prisms are washed with a gentle liquid detergent to clean grease or soil. Then submerge the spectacles and Fresnel prism in a large cup full of lukewarm water. Clean small air bubbles clinging to the surface. Position the Fresnel prism with a smooth side towards the inner layer of the spectacle lens with water. The final adjustments can be made by pushing the Fresnel prism and pressing it dry. The edges of the Fresnel prisms should be inspected to rule out any overlapping over the spectacle frames. Remove and reapply if any dust particles or air bubbles are noticed.
