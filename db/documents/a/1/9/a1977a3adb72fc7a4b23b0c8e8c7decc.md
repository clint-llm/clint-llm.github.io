Microscopic exam of liver biopsies performed in patients with cystic fibrosis-associated liver disease demonstrate a wide spectrum of histopathological changes ranging from pan acinar steatosis, cholestasis, bile duct proliferation, portal inflammation to fibrosis of varying degrees of severity and nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Neutrophils were the most predominant inflammatory cells. While hepatic steatosis and focal biliary cirrhosis are common findings in pediatric patients with CFLD, focal biliary cirrhosis is not as common in adult patients with CFLD. Portal hypertension in patients with CFLD is not entirely due to fibrosis or cirrhosis, but non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH) also plays a role with demonstrated evidence of presinusoidal type portal hypertension because of obliterative venopathy with fibrosis.
