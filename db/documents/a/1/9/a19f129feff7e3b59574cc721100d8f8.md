Rectal prolapse refers specifically to prolapse of some or all of the rectal mucosa through the external anal sphincter. In pediatric populations aged between infancy and age 4, rectal prolapse is usually a self-limiting condition, responding to conservative management. The highest incidence of rectal prolapse has been noted in the first year of life. However, children presenting after age 4 usually have a chronic condition predisposing them to have developed rectal prolapse. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology and presentation of rectal prolpase and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of rectal prolapse.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with rectal prolapse.
- Summarize the treatment options for rectal prolapse.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by rectal prolapse.
