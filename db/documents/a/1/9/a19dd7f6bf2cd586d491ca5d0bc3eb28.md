Once diagnosed, to treat serious tamponade pathology; you must first address resuscitative measures including intravenous (IV) access, oxygen as needed and cardiac monitoring. Intravenous fluid boluses may be needed to promote right heart filling and function to temporize poor hemodynamics. For definitive treatment of tamponade, however, a pericardiocentesis is necessary. This is typically performed in a cardiac catheterization lab in a non-life-threatening situation. However, in urgent conditions, for example, in patients at risk of arrest or who may have arrested, percutaneous pericardiocentesis may be performed in the emergency department. Once a pericardiocentesis and removal of fluid have been performed, and the patient is stabilized, further investigation is required to determine what pathophysiological process lead to the effusion.

For other causes of alternans including WPW, ventricular arrhythmias, and bundle branch block, therapy must be directed toward the underlying cause, withÂ the early emphasis on hemodynamic stability of the patient as the first step in treatment.
