The SGR, like other dorsal spinal structures, is vascularized predominantly by the two, paired, posterior spinal arteries which supply the posterior one-third of the spinal cord. However, multiple, complex anastomoses exist with the posterior spinal arteries to provide collateral blood supply and ensure adequate perfusion.
