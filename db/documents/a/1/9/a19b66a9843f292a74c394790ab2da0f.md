The Achilles tendon reflex is a simple maneuver that is part of any lower extremity neurologic exam. It can be performed relatively easily both in the clinic and inpatient environment. However, differences in technique and experience can lead to varying intra-patient results. Various case-control studies have been published that compare the traditional Achilles tendon tap to the plantar tap and the reproducibility across different experience levels (Level 3).

When comparing the two Achilles reflex methods, it was shown that the traditional Achilles tendon tap had less inter-observer and intra-observer reliability.

The ubiquitous nature of the Achilles reflex test and its use by senior physicians, junior physicians, medical students, nurses, and physician assistants, necessitate a reliable confirmatory alternative. Considering the interdisciplinary structure of patient care teams with varying levels of experience, it is prudent to consider using the plantar tap method. Particularly for patient populations that you may suspect a diminished or altered reflex response, such as the elderly, diabetic, and hypothyroid patients.
