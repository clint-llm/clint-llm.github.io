The management of trichosporonosis is with an interprofessional team that includes a dermatologist, infectious disease expert, pharmacist, and hematologist. Complete removal of the nodule and infected hair is the treatment for white piedra. Topical antifungal drugs may help but those with allergies to azoles, other options include selenium sulfide. In neutropenic patients, voriconazole, itraconazole, and fluconazole have all been used with partial success.

Another alternative is amphotericin B and should be used in unresponsive and resistant trichosporonosis along with voriconazole or micafungin. The pharmacist should educate the patient on the potential benefits of the antifungal agents and their adverse effects. Nurses who look after these patients should monitor for signs of progression as some patients with invasive disease may not respond to the medications. Every attempt should be made to reverse the state of immunosuppression or neutropenia.

Lastly, it is important to remember that echinocandins have no effect when treating this fungal infection. Regardless of the antifungal options, a cure for invasive trichosporonosis depends on the duration of neutropenia and source control by surgical intervention.

An interprofessional team approach is vital in order to improve patient outcomes. All clinicians who look after these patients should communicate with each other so that the patient is not deprived of the current standard of care.
