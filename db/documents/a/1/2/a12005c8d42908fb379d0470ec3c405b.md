Reflux nephropathy is best managed with an interprofessional team approach. Close coordination is required between obstetricians and nephrologists in pregnant females with high suspicion of RN, for early diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of maternal-fetal comorbidities. A coordinated effort between obstetricians and neonatologists is needed to prevent renal damage, as early diagnosis and treatment of VUR are necessary before the neonate develops a UTI. It might be beneficial to offer to screen to infants whose father has VUR.
