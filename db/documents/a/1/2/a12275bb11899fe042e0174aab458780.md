Herpangina is a viral infection that is generally self-limited but may lead to serious complications. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, and specific diagnostic investigations are ordered in unclear presentations. Health-care providers must be well-versed with the range of clinical presentations seen in herpangina and should be able to differentiate it from other pediatric disorders with a similar presentation. They need to educate the family regarding the disease, the home-management, and prevention. An interprofessional approach with effective communication between the members of the healthcare team, including internists, pediatricians, nurses, and pharmacists, is essential for effective patient care and improved outcomes.
