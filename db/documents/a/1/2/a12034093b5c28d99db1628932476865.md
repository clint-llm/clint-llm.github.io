Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, accounting for 85% of cases. Additional risk factors for lung cancer include second-hand smoke, asbestos, radon, and other environmental factors. Smoking is associated with all types of lung cancer. However, the strongest associations are with SCLC and squamous cell lung cancer.

Cigarette smoke contains many organic and inorganic carcinogens including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), aromatic amines, N-nitrosamines, benzene, vinyl chloride, arsenic, and chromium among many others. There is a dose-dependent relationship between the degree of smoke exposure and the relative risk of lung cancer. The dosage of smoke depends on the type of cigarette, duration of inhalation, and presence of a filter.
