The wheat allergy is either IgE-mediated or non-IgE-mediated allergic reaction to wheat proteins. The result can be life-threatening and can lead to an anaphylactic reaction. Celiac disease is an example of a non-IgE-mediated wheat allergy. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of wheat allergy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in educating patients about their condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the history and physical exam findings associated with a wheat allergy.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with a wheat allergy.
- Explain the treatment considerations for patients with a wheat allergy.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by wheat allergy.
