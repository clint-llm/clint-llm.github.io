There are few reports in the literature regarding the estimated incidence rate of shoulder dislocations among the general population. The consensus in the literature cites an incidence rate of traumatic unidirectional dislocations ranging from 1% to 2% in the general population.

One study from the 1980s reported that over ten years, the adjusted incidence of initial traumatic shoulder dislocations was 8.2 per 100000 person-years. The incidence rate seen in males was greater than that seen in females.

- 72% of shoulder dislocations occurred in men

- The highest incidence rate (80.5 per 100000 person-years) occurred in male patients aged 16 to 20 years

- The highest incidence rate in female patients occurred in women aged 61 to 70 years

- The overall incidence rate in male patients was 40.4 per 100000 person-years

A 2013 study out of Ontario, Canada, similarly found that young male patients had the highest incidence of shoulder dislocation events, in addition to the highest risk of recurrent dislocation events.

A 2010 study reported from United States census data analyzed the epidemiologic trends for emergency department presentations secondary to shoulder dislocations from 2002 through 2006. The authors noted an overall incidence rate of 23.9 per 100000 person-years, with the male incidence rate being about 2.6-fold that of the female incidence rate.

**Athletic Population Considerations**

The young athletic population has garnered significant attention in the literature, secondary to the multitude of risk factors predisposing these patients to primary and recurrent dislocation events.

A 2007 study by Owens et al. prospectively collected all traumatic shoulder instability events at the United States Military Academy over 12 months. The study followed over 4000 students during this period, and the authors found that the probability of a student sustaining at least one shoulder instability event during the academic year was 2.8%.

- Greater than 85% of all instability events occurred in males

- 85% of instability events were subluxation episodes, while the remaining 15% were dislocation events

A 2014 study reported that the prevalence of shoulder dislocation during one rugby season was about 15%. The authors noted that rugby players entering the current season with a history of a previous shoulder dislocation managed non-operatively. In this subset of athletes, about 55% sustained a shoulder dislocation during the season.

A 2018 epidemiologic study comparing high school and collegiate athletes across nine different sports demonstrated that collegiate athletes are at higher risk of shoulder dislocation than their high school counterparts.

**Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON)**

The MOON instability cohort published a 2018 study reporting the descriptive epidemiology of patients undergoing shoulder stabilization procedures across a multicenter consortium.

- 82% (709 of 863 total patients) were male

- Anterior dislocations made up the majority of cases; about three-fourths in both male and female patient subgroups

- Football and basketball were the most common sport-related presentations

- Anterior labral tears were seen in two-thirds of case presentations, while 41% had a Hill-Sachs lesion noted on pre-operative MRI

**Adolescent and Pediatric Patient Considerations**

A recent Level II prognostic cohort study reported results from approximately 2,000 adolescent and pediatric patients ages 10 to 16 years, presenting to an emergency department and requiring closed shoulder reduction. Results showed that the incidence of dislocation was highest among males aged 16 years (164.4 episodes per 100000 person-years), while the incidence was lowest among patients aged 10 to 12 years. Moreover, the re-dislocation rate was highest in 14 to 16-year-old patients (37% to 42% re-dislocation rate), and the lowest re-dislocation rates (0% to 25%) were in patients aged 10 to 13 years old.
