Care of patients with EIs is an interprofessional, usually consisting of multi-specialty teams, including traumatologists/acute care surgeons, thoracic surgeons, otolaryngologists (for upper aerodigestive injuries), gastroenterologists, and intensivists. Mortality rates associated with EI range between 10% to 40% and depend on a variety of factors, including the cause of the perforation, the presence of any underlying (pre-existing) pathology, the location of the perforation, any diagnostic or treatment delay, the method of treatment employed, and the extent of the injury. Comorbid conditions, as well as the patient's functional and nutritional status, also play an important prognostic role. For a patient who survives their EI, high levels of morbidity, long hospital and ICU stays have been reported. Subsequent (post-discharge) quality of life can be negatively affected by EI. Because esophageal injuries occur infrequently and may produce vague symptoms, diagnostic and therapeutic delays are not uncommon.
