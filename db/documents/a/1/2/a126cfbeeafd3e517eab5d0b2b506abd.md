No contraindications are in the prescribing information. However, patients with acute coronary syndrome, mesenteric ischemia, and ischemic limb should not get angiotensin II as vasoconstriction may potentially worsen these conditions. Nearly half of the study population was over 65, and safety data was no different for patients under versus over that age. No data exists for the use of angiotensin II in pediatric patients at this time, though clinical trials have begun. The potential for mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, or adverse effects on fertility have not been studied. Patients with burns, acute coronary syndrome, bronchospasm, liver failure, mesenteric ischemia, active bleeding, abdominal aortic aneurysm, patients with a neutrophil count of less than 1000, and patient on high dose glucocorticoids were excluded from the ATHOS 3 trial. Thus the efficacy of this medication in these conditions is unproven and requires caution.
