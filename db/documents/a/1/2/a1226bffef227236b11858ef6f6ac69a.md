AHO phenotype is commonly observed in pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) type 1A, 1C, and pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP), rarely observed in patients with PHP1B and not described in PHP2.GNAS1 gene that codes for Î±-subunit of the stimulatory G protein. GNAS gene is located on the telomeric end of the long arm of chromosome 20 (20q13.2-20q13.3).GNAS1 mutations, which manifest with AHO phenotype plus hormonal resistance. In contrast, those with paternally inherited GNAS1 mutations present with the AHO phenotype alone with no hormonal resistance (PPHP). PHP2B results due to methylation abnormalities of GNAS.
