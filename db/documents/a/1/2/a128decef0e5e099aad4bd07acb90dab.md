A thorough history is a critical first step toward making a diagnosis. A stroke should be high on the differential for a patient presenting with sudden, focal neurological deficits and/or an altered level of consciousness. Based on clinical presentation alone, it is almost impossible to differentiate between a hemorrhagic and an ischemic stroke. Common signs and symptoms include hemiparesis, sensory deficits, diplopia, dysarthria, and facial droop. More posterior strokes present with a sudden onset of ataxia and vertigo. Symptoms commonly attributed to increased intracranial pressure, such as nausea, vomiting, headache, and blurred or double vision, may provide evidence supporting a hemorrhagic stroke. In addition to gathering information about the symptoms, one needs to establish the time of their onset to decide whether fibrinolytic therapy is an option once the diagnosis of ischemic stroke is confirmed.

A neurological exam is performed to ascertain stroke location, establish baseline function upon hospital admission, rule out a transient ischemic attack (TIA) and other stroke mimickers, and deduce potential comorbidities. It is composed of testing cranial nerve function, the range of motion and muscle strength, sensory integrity, vibratory sense, cerebellar function, gait, language, mental status, and level of consciousness. Baseline function is determined via the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), which focuses on the level of consciousness, visual and motor function, sensation and neglect, cerebellar function, and language capabilities.

Common signs and symptoms of stroke include:

- Numbness or weakness of the face

- Change in mental status

- Trouble speaking or understanding speech

- Visual disturbances

- Homonymous hemianopsia - loss of half of the visual field
- Loss of peripheral vision

- Hemiparesis or hemiplegia - Weakness or paralysis of the face, arm, and leg on the same side

- Ataxia - unsteady gait and inability to keep feet together

- Dysarthria - difficulty in forming words

- Dysphagia - difficulty in swallowing

- Paresthesia - numbness and tingling of extremities

- Expressive aphasia - unable to form understandable words

- Receptive aphasia - unable to comprehend the spoken word
