Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia presentation varies from the asymptomaticÂ state to palpitations, fatigue, syncope, or even cardiac arrest during exercise. Sometimes one will see prominence in the left side of the heart due to enlargement of the right Ventricle. Other than this, the physical exam is usually unremarkable.
