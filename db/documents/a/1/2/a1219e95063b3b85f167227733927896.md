To date, no FDA approved treatment modality exists for impulse control disorders (ICDs). Even still, management remains similar across the spectrum of all impulse control disorders. Strategies of salience that have demonstrated therapeutic value consist of reducing positive reinforcement of undesirable behavior, encouraging prosocial behavior, utilizing nonviolent discipline, and applying predictable parenting strategies. Specific therapies that are commonly implemented include parent management training (PMT), multisystemic therapy (MST), and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) with parent management.

Although unproven, in the setting of non-amenable aggression, providers may feel the necessity to prescribe mood stabilizers, antidepressants, or atypical neuroleptics.
