Patients with pulsatile tinnitus can present in many different clinical environments. Health practitioners in primary care need to know when it is appropriate to refer patients to an otolaryngologist. In the otolaryngology office, the physician will work closely with the audiologist to help begin the work-up on the patient. Otolaryngology specialty trained nurses play a crucial role as they will help coordinate future appointments and imaging studies that may be necessary. They will also assist in educating the patient and family regarding the condition and any medications they try. After a thorough workup, the otolaryngologist needs to begin constructing a treatment team based on the suspected etiology of the patientâ€™s symptoms. This team may include practitioners from radiology, neurosurgery, cardiology, otolaryngology nurses, and the primary care team. If surgery becomes a treatment modality, the health-care team will grow immensely to include nurses, surgical technicians, pharmacists, and physical therapists. These health care professionals will all play a vital role in providing patients with quality care, and a team approach will produce the best outcomes. [Level 5]
