Monitoring includes measurement of the following:

- Serum digoxin levels

- Serum potassium

- Temperature

- Blood pressure

- Continuous electrocardiogram

- Assessment of renal function via serial measurements of serum creatinine, BUN and GFR

- Monitoring signs of volume overload in children (<20kg)

Parameters that require measurement before and after infusion include temperature, blood pressure, ECG, and serum potassium.

**Serum Digoxin Concentration**

It is important to measure serum digoxin before administration because post-administration levels do not correlate to clinical toxicity. Lab values take into consideration both unbound and bound serum digoxin levels. Furthermore, digoxin immune fab can also interfere with digitalis immunoassay measurements. The assay does not possess the ability to distinguish between free or bound digoxin. Therefore, this increases the risk of attaining false-positive results. It is considered clinically safe to re-consider serum digoxin levels only when fab fragments have been completely excreted from the body. Complete elimination varies from days to weeks. As a general rule of thumb, three weeks after administration qualifies as safe to reuse serum digoxin levels for clinical decision making. Equilibration of digoxin in the body requires at least 6 to 8 hours. Therefore, measurements may also be inaccurate if levels are drawn too close to dose administration. The rise of serum-free digoxin after Fab administration should not be considered alarming. Most of these digoxin molecules are bound to fab and will not bind to cardiac Na/K ATPases.

**Serum Potassium Concentration**

Digoxin results in a shift of potassium to the outside of the cell. Administration of Fab results in the redistribution of potassium back into cells resulting in hypokalemia. Serum potassium returns to baseline within 2 to 6 hours. Therefore, potassium levels must be monitored hourly for 4 to 6 hours after administration. The improvement in potassium level is a sign of clinical efficacy. If necessary, potassium supplementation is also an option.

**Monitoring Precautions**

- **Cardiac Disease:**Patients with atrial fibrillation require a careful administration of digoxin immune fab. Sudden loss of a negative dromotropic effect on the AV node confers substantial risk for developing rapid ventricular response (ventricular tachycardia). In patients chronically digitalized for heart failure, worsening of inotropic function is expected upon administration of digoxin immune fab. Therefore, it is important to obtain vital readings, ECG, and serial potassium levels. Patients must also receive continuous cardiac monitoring. With therapy, cardiac rhythm disturbances are usually controlled within 3 hours. After achieving rhythm control, cardiac monitoring is necessary for another 4 hours. The patient will require no monitoring if symptoms do not persist during this period. However, in patients with co-existing renal failure, monitoring must continue.

- **Renal disease and Geriatric patients:**Digoxin immune fab is excreted via the renal system. In renal disease or failure, the elimination half-life is expected to increase 10-fold while the Vd remains unchanged.

- **Pediatric Patients:**Children (< 20 kg) should be monitored extensively for volume overload undergoing large dose therapy.
