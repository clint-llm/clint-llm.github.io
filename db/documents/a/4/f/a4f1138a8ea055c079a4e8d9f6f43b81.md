Metformin, FDA-approved in 1994, is an antidiabetic agent used in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin comes in both immediate-release and extended-release and is available in several combination products with other antidiabetic agents.

Typically at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, lifestyle management such as diet and exercise are recommended. Metformin is often used as monotherapy or in combination when diet and exercise are not effective at lowering hyperglycemia. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), metformin is the preferred first-line agent in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus in adults and children ten years and older. Per Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2018, if a patientâ€™s A1c is less than 9% at diagnosis, then metformin monotherapy is recommended. If the A1c is greater than 9%, then metformin is recommended in combination therapy. Metformin is not indicated in type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Metformin also has several non-FDA-approved indications, including gestational diabetes, management of antipsychotic-induced weight gain, type 2 diabetes prevention, and the treatment and prevention of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Currently, metformin is the only ADA-recommended antidiabetic for pre-diabetes.
