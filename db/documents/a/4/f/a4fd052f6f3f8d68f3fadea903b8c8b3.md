**Laboratory Tests**

Usually used to rule out differential diagnoses.

- Increased serum amylase less than four times than normal levels can be associated with PPU.

- Serum gastrin levels are useful in patients with a history of recurrent ulcers to establish the diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

- Leukocytosis and high C-reactive protein level indicate existing of inflammation or infection.

- Blood cultures are necessary before starting antibiotics.

- An arterial blood gas measures the level of metabolic compromise in septic patients.

**Radiography**

In acute upper abdominal pain, an urgent upright chest radiograph (CXR) is a basic essential test for duodenal perforation. Upright CXR shows free air below the diaphragm in 75% of patients. However, it can be normal, especially in patients who present early after symptoms initiation.

A non-contrast CT scan is suitable to see free air just below the anterior abdominal wall in patients with acute kidney injury. The diagnostic accuracy of PPU detection by CT scan is about 98%.

CT features of perforation include duodenal wall thickening, extravasated oral contrast, the presence of extraluminal air, fat stranding, and periduodenal fluid collection.
