Leiomyomas of the esophagus rarely cause symptoms when they are smaller than 5 cm in diameter. When these tumors grow larger, they become more symptomatic in patients. The most common symptoms are dysphagia, chest pain, vague retrosternal discomfort, heartburn, and occasionally regurgitation. Rarely they can cause gastrointestinal bleeding when the tumor erodes through the mucosa. Apart from the nonspecific and ill localized symptoms associated with esophageal leiomyomas, no physical findings are present. There appears to be no consistent pattern of symptoms according to the anatomical location of the tumor. In the rare case of a giant leiomyoma of the esophagus, patients report persistent cough. Large esophageal leiomyomas usually grow outward, so dysphagia need not be present and does not reflect the size of such tumor. Many of these tumors are discovered incidentally during endoscopic procedures or radiological tests. With the increasing use of endoscopy and radiological investigation, the number of cases diagnosed is increasing.
