A maternal-fetal medicine specialist generally performs chorionic villus sampling. Some pregnant patients who are candidates for CVS may present for care to a general obstetrician, family medicine, or internal medicine provider. Given the specific time frame in which a CVS can be performed, early referral to MFM is a key factor in ensuring patients have access to the procedure. Genetic counselors are an additional resource for families, helping them understand risks and options for prenatal testing. Clear and efficient communication between maternal-fetal Medicine specialists and the referring provider is crucial to ensure timely discussion of results and outline further recommendations for pregnancy management.
