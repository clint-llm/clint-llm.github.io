One goal of SBLE is to improve patient outcomes, and HFS is an effective strategy for teaching all levels of learners, a range of skills that will realize this goal.

Multidisciplinary or IPE simulations afford participants opportunities to navigate group dynamics, such as hierarchy and authority gradients, and their effect on teamwork.

Conducting in situ HFS activities in the clinical environment allows for system-level evaluation and improvement. Allowing participants to be directly involved in the discovery and addressing of issues can facilitate organizational change. It is also possible for educators to purposefully add mistakes to the simulation activity, providing opportunities to assess adherence to safety protocols and their effectiveness.
