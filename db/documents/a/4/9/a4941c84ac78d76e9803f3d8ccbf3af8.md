As patients can present with a wide variety of clinical features, it is crucial to consider alternative diagnoses like infectious etiologies, autoimmune and vascular disorders, adverse effects from chemoradiation, paraneoplastic syndromes, and toxic-metabolic encephalopathy (especially in a sick patient). The list may include but is not limited to the following:

- Brain abscess

- Brain metastasis

- Chemical meningitis due to intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy

- Cord compression

- Meningitis and encephalitis

- Sarcoidosis

- Steroid myopathy

- Stroke

- Toxic metabolic encephalopathy
