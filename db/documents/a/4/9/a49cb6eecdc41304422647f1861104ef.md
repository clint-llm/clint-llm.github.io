Because the US is highly operator-dependent, the exam should be performed by a sonographer, vascular technologist, or physician who is appropriately credentialed and accredited. The physician interpreting the US should meet the training guidelines following the accreditation policies for their specialty (i.e., radiology or vascular surgery). Additionally, the performing and interpreting provider should be familiar with: imaging physics, US artifacts, limitations of this modality, expected anatomy, and common pathologies associated with diseases involving the peripheral venous system.
