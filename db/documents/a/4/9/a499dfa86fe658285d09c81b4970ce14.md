Diabetes can lead to serious complications if they are not identified and managed adequately. Diabetic ulcers are a common complication of uncontrolled diabetes. The frequency of these complications can be lowered by controlling blood glucose, self-examination of feet, and regular check-ups by doctors.

The following are some risk factors associated with diabetic foot ulcers:-

- Abnormality of foot anatomy(e.g Charcot arthropathy)

- Poor blood circulation(e.g weak pulse, cold skin, or blue skin)

- Abnormality of peripheral sensations(e.g inability to sense pain in diabetic neuropathy)

- Smoking can reduce circulation to the feet.

Different measures can be taken to reduce the risk of foot problems. In general, keeping blood glucose in the target range reduces all kinds of diabetic complications. This involves making a healthy diet and lifestyle changes. Avoiding activities associated with foot injuries and avoiding smoking can be helpful. Caring for nails and trimming them straight across to avoid skin injury. Washing feet and choosing socks and shoes wisely. Regular foot exams to avoid unnoticed injuries.
