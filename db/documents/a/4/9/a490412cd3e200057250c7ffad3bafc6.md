NAC exerts its therapeutic effect in APAP overdose through several mechanisms. APAP metabolism in therapeutic dosing primarily occurs through glucuronidation and sulfation(>90%), with less than 5% being oxidized by CYP450 isoform (predominately CYP2E1) to produce a toxic metabolite called N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which is the precursor to cellular injury. Glutathione in the liver can normally detoxify these minuscule quantities of NAPQI and prevent tissue damage. In APAP overdose, glucuronidation and sulfation pathways are saturated, and the CYP450 pathway takes more significance, producing more toxic metabolites that deplete the glutathione reserves, leading to their accumulation and hence tissue injury by binding to cellular macromolecules.

NAC repletes glutathione reserves by providing cysteine, which is an essential precursor in glutathione production. NAC by itself also binds to the toxic metabolites and scavenges free radicals. It also increases oxygen delivery to tissues, increases mitochondrial ATP production, and alters the microvascular tone to increase the blood flow and oxygen delivery to the liver and other vital organs.

In COPD, cystic fibrosis, and other lung conditions, nebulized NAC has mucolytic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Studies are ongoing to understand its therapeutic efficacy, ideal dose ranges, and most effective mode of drug delivery for these indications.
