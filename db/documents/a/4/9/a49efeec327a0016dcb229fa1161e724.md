The tendon is derived from the ectoderm and mesoderm. Progenitor cells of the tendon (tenocytes) originate from the ventral and lateral ectodermal areas. In animal models, in the cranial and limb regions, the tendon is formed in the absence of the muscle. The axial tendons, on the contrary, require the presence ofÂ the muscle to induce the movement of the progenitor cells of the tendon in response to fibroblast growth factor. Tendon development is a slow process compared to other tissues, such as muscle and cartilage.
