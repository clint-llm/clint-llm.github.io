Thyroid adenomas usually present as solitary thyroid nodules and are more common in female patients. In two autopsy series, the incidence of thyroid adenomas was 3% and 4.3%, respectively. The incidence of thyroid adenomas used to be higher in the past, especially in iodine-deficient areas (endemic goiter). However, in recent years, their incidence has been reported at much lower levels due to the use of iodine-enriched salt.
