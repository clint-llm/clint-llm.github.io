No specific patient preparation is needed for this procedure. However, while inserting a central line, a local anesthetic may be needed. For this purpose, 2% lidocaine injection is used routinely. In pediatric patients, sedation with opioids and benzodiazepines may be considered for pain and anxiety control.

The patient is positioned supine for plasmapheresis; however, the position, especially of the neck, may be altered according to the location of central venous access to maintain adequate blood flow throughout the procedure.

A close watch on patient vitals is recommended throughout the procedure to assess for volume depletion, hypocalcemia, and complications of fresh frozen plasma transfusion.
