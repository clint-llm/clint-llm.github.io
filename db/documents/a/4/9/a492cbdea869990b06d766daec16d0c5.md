A blood sample is collected from the vein using aseptic techniques and observing universal precautions. Serum alpha-fetoprotein levels are measured either as part of a maternal triple or quadruple screening test or for other diagnostic purposes in non-pregnant female or male patients.

Specimens derived from sera are stable at room temperature or at 4 C for at least one week and for several months at −20 C. The type of centrifugation and non-stable refrigeration frost-free cycles can affect AFP levels.

Amniocentesis is needed to assay alpha-fetoprotein levels in the amniotic fluid. A diagnostic amniocentesis involves using an ultrasound-guided, hollow needle through the maternal anterior abdominal wall into the amniotic cavity to draw out amniotic fluid for AFP immunoassay.
