The most important labeled indications of enalapril are heart failure and chronic hypertension. Clinicians give enalapril for both symptomatic and asymptomatic congestive heart failure to decrease mortality and morbidity.

Off-labeled indications for adults are ST-elevated myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevated acute coronary syndrome, stable coronary artery disease, post-transplant erythrocytosis, and proteinuric chronic kidney disease. Enalapril also prevents diabetic nephropathy in normotensive patients.
