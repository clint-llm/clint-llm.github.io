Medial medullary syndrome is most commonly caused by atherothrombotic occlusion of the paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery, the vertebral artery, or the basilar artery. Common risk factors are dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking. Other risk factors are atrial fibrillation, atrial septal defect, patent foramen ovale, migraine, and Takayasu arteritis. Dissection of the vertebral artery can also cause medial medullary syndrome, especially among young patients.
