Bone can get infected via the hematogenous route of infection through bacteremic seeding of bone from a distant source of infection, contiguous spread from surrounding tissue and joints, or direct inoculation of bone from trauma or surgery.

In patients with diabetes, osteomyelitis usually results from compromised blood supply to the lower extremities, which contributes to impaired local immunity and skin healing, promoting the spread of infection. Sensory neuropathy in the setting of diabetes mellitus predisposes to the formation of skin ulceration at pressure and trauma points, complicating matters even worse.

Contiguous osteomyelitis frequently develops in debilitated patients who are wheelchair or bedbound and are predisposed to pressure-related skin ulcerations, especially in the sacrum, buttock, hips, and heel. These ulcers are typically colonized by polymicrobial flora from the skin and gastrointestinal tract such that soft tissue infection can quickly spread to the underlying bone.
