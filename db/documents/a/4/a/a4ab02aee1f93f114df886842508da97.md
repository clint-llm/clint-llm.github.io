Flibanserin use is contraindicated in combination with alcohol or strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and patients with hepatic impairment due to the increased risk of hypotension and syncope.

Medications that are not contraindicated but should be used cautiously in combination with flibanserin include strong CYP2C19 inhibitors, other CNS depressants, weak CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP3A4 inducers, and digoxin.
