Oral cancers often present on the lateral portion of the tongue, and depending on the spread of cancer and its invasion of the surrounding tongue muscles, the surgical procedure differs. This can range from a mucosectomy in precancerous or superficial suspicious lesions to a total glossectomy in those with massive infiltrating lesionsâ€”the more invasive the surgery, the increased likelihood that the tongue muscles will be affected.

The removal of extrinsic and intrinsic tongue muscles will inhibit their proper functioning. Consequently, this condition makes it difficult for patients who require more invasive surgery to perform the functions that require these muscles. This includes swallowing, speech.
