Recovery following a temporoparietal fascia flap transfer depends on the complexity of the original problem for which the reconstruction was performed. Local wound care is critical to ensure a healthy and clean surgical environment. Suction drains (if placed) can be removed when output has appropriately decreased (e.g., less than 30 mL over 24 hours). The patient should avoid rigorous activity for ten days following surgery to allow adequate wound healing and minimize edema, ecchymosis, and bleeding. After discharge, the patient is typically followed regularly for several weeks to months to ensure proper healing.
