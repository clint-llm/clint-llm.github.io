A thorough patient history and physical examination should be performed. Assessment of the patient’s Fitzpatrick skin type is particularly important in order to assess the risk of complications and to determine the potential efficacy of laser treatment as well as the optimal manner in which to deliver the laser energy. Patients with higher Fitzpatrick class skin types may benefit from a regimen combining hydroquinone and glycolic acid in order to reduce the likelihood of dyspigmentation. Clinicians should counsel patients at the pre-procedure visit regarding expected results as well as pre-procedure and post-procedure care. Patients should also be provided with details of all complications that may potentially result from treatment.

When skin resurfacing is planned in the perioral region, prophylactic antiviral medications should be prescribed to begin the day before or the morning of the procedure in order to reduce or eliminate the risk of post-procedure herpetic outbreaks, which may be severe and result in significant scarring. An example regimen is valacyclovir 500 mg PO BID for 14 days.
