Patients with mild to moderate symptoms usually respond well to nutritional therapy.

A recent retrospective observational study of patients with post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia reported on outcomes of patients who had failed nutritional therapy. It defined the efficacy of medication as “greater than fifty percent reduction of hypoglycemic symptoms and as a combination of no or almost no hypoglycemic events.” In this study, overall reported medication efficacy ranged from 45 to 80%. Approximately 20% of the patients were referred for surgical treatment due to the failure of conservative measures. About 63% of the patients who underwent surgery reported complete resolution of the symptoms, about 16% reported 50 to 100% resolution of the symptoms, and no improvement was reported in 21%. Different types of surgeries had different efficacies.
