Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disease involving surfactant accumulation within the alveoli resulting from decreased clearance, rather than increased production. This condition can be congenital, secondary, or autoimmune. Autoimmune PAP is the most common pathophysiologic mechanism accounting for 90 percent of documented cases. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and complications of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and addresses the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. 
- Describe the presenting features of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. 
- Describe the evaluation of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. 
- Describe how enhanced coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid recognition of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and subsequently improve the evaluation, enhancing detection of pathology and allowing for treatment when indicated.
