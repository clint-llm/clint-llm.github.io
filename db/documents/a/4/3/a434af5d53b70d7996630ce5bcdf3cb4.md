The Bekhterev-Jacobsohn reflex is best performed with the patient sitting or lying in the supine position with both arms extended and relaxed. The patient needs to be relaxed without tension in his or her arms or wrists with the fingers extended. The practitioner stands on the side of the patient being tested and allows the patient’s arm to rest on the hand of the examiner so that the thumb is positioned on the outer side (or palm facing upward). The practitioner then taps on the lower end of the radius near the wrist. The examiner can tap the radius with his or her hand or finger or can use a reflex hammer that is held in the opposite hand. A positive (or abnormal) reflex is abduction of the wrist and definite flexion of the fingers, specifically focused on the distal interphalangeal joints. A negative (or normal) reflex is when the fingers remain extended without any flexion or movement of the fingers or wrist. The reflex can be completed as many times as needed to evaluate the response in the fingers or wrist.
