Embryologic development of the visual pathway occurs in an anterior-to-posterior manner. The inner and outer layers of the optic cup are derived from the neuroectoderm. Around 3Â to 4 weeks gestation, RPE cells begin to form on the outer layer of the optic cup.

Myelination of retinal ganglion cells proceeds in a central-to-peripheral manner. Myelination begins at five months gestation in the LGN, proceeding to the optic tract at six months, optic chiasm at 6 to 7 months, and the optic nerve at eight months.
