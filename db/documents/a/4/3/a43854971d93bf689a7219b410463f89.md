The prognosis and mortality are directly related to the extent of the injury, with the rate of mortality for grades I through IV at 4%, 10%, 18%, and 40%, respectively. Any degree of PIVH predisposes to later neurocognitive developments, with rates of cerebral palsy for grades I through IV at 8%, 11%, 19%, and 50%. Infants less than 27 weeks with a grade I or II PIVH are not associated with developmental delay.

Preterm infants with severe PIVH are at increased risk for cerebral palsy, especially those whose weight is below 1000 grams.

The neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants with IVH vary based on the parenchymal injury. EPIPAGE study demonstrated a relationship between IVH and adverse neurological outcomes.
