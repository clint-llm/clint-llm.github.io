Electrocardiogram machines are designed to record changes in electrical activity by drawing a trace on a moving electrocardiograph paper. The electrocardiograph moves at a speed of 25 mm/sec. Time is plotted on the x-axis and voltage on the y-axis. On the x-axis, 1 second is divided into five large squares, each representing 0.2 sec. Each large square is further divided into five small squares of 0.04 sec each. The ECG machine is calibrated in such a way that an increase of voltage by one mVolt should move the stylus by 1 cm.

The conventional 12-lead ECG consisting of six limbs and six precordial leads is organized into ten wires.

- V1 is placed to the right of the sternal border, and V2 is situated to the left of the sternal edge.

- V4 is placed at the level of the fifth intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line. V4 should be placed before V3. V3 is placed between V2 and V4.

- V5 is placed directly between V4 and V6.

- V6 is placed at the level of the fifth intercostal space in the mid-axillary line.

- V4 through V6 should line up horizontally along with the fifth intercostal space.
