Though UGH syndrome may be managed conservatively, surgery with explantation of the implants is usually curative. Surgery, however, may not guarantee the resolution of UGH syndrome. Rigid anterior chamber intraocular lenses were used around in the 1950s. Bullous keratopathy, cystoid macular edema, and inflammation were very common at that time. Today, the use of polymethyl methacrylate lenses, acrylic, and silicone lenses with better designs and quality have reduced the complications. In a large series of 71 patients with UGH syndrome, the patients treated surgically achieved better final visual acuity and lower IOP, while the conservatively treated patients did not experience improved visual acuity or reduced IOP.
