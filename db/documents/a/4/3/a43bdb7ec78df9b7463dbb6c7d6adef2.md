The nerves that cross the elbow joint predominately innervate structures of the forearm and hand. One of the major nerves responsible for acting on the elbow joint is the musculocutaneous nerve.  This nerve never crosses the elbow joint itself, but rather innervates both the biceps brachii, the muscle that accounts for the majority of supination as well as some elbow flexion, and the brachialis muscle, which is responsible for elbow flexion.

The radial nerve starts medially in the proximal humerus, then spirals posteriorly and laterally into the spiral groove.  The radial nerve crosses the elbow joint as it courses laterally and enters the groove for the radial nerve in the distal humerus.  The radial nerve innervates five muscles that affect the elbow joint including the brachialis (lateral portion), the anconeus, the supinator muscle, brachioradialis, and triceps brachii.

The ulnar nerve stays in the medial arm and travels from the anterior compartment to the posterior compartment where it enters into the cubital tunnel and the groove for the ulnar nerve.  The ulnar nerve innervates muscles in the forearm and hand.

The median nerve traverses the elbow joint anteriorly and continues distally to innervate the muscles in the forearm and hand.

Also spanning the elbow joint is the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve and the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve derived from the musculocutaneous and radial nerves respectively.  These two nerves supply sensory information for the skin of the forearm.
