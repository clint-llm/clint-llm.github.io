Invasive mechanical ventilation is an intervention that is frequently used in acutely ill patients requiring either respiratory support or airway protection. The ventilator allows gas exchange to be maintained while other treatments are given to improve the clinical condition. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, management, and possible complications of invasive mechanical ventilation and highlights the importance of the interprofessional team in managing the care of patients requiring ventilatory support.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the function of the most commonly used mechanical ventilation settings.
- Outline the management of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.
- Describe the issues of concern in regards to mechanical ventilation.
- Review how the interprofessional team plays a key role in the management of mechanically ventilated patients.
