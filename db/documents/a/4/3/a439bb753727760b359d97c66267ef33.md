Before surgery, the physical examination is crucial to assess any prior hypertrophic, hyper/hypopigmented scars, or any keloids and appropriately caution the patient. Additionally, a manual pinch test at the donor site will confirm the ability to close the donor site primarily. If needed pre-operatively, vessel position and patency can be confirmed with a handheld doppler. As is the case with any surgical intervention, it is crucial to have an informed discussion with the patient pre-operatively in which all the risks, benefits, and alternatives are discussed regarding axial flaps. When discussing with elderly patients, they should be cautioned that the flap is at a greater risk of necrosis as dermal blood vessels tend to collapse, become disorganized or absent with age.
