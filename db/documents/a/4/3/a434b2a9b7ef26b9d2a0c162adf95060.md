Myasthenia gravis, similar to other autoimmune disorders, occurs in genetically susceptible individuals. Precipitating factors include conditions like infections, immunization, surgeries, and drugs.

The commonly implicated proteins in the NMJ against which autoantibodies are produced include the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (n-AChR's), muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), and lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LPR4). Agrin–LRP4–MuSK protein complex is essential for the formation and maintenance of NMJ, including the distribution and clustering of the AChR.

**Myasthenia Gravis Classification**

Depending on the type of clinical features and the type of antibodies involved, MG can be classified into various subgroups. Each group responds differently to treatment and hence carries a prognostic value:

- Early-onset MG: Age at onset less than 50 years with thymic hyperplasia

- Late-onset MG: Age at onset greater than 50 years with thymic atrophy

- Thymoma-associated MG

- MG with anti-MuSK antibodies

- Ocular MG: Symptoms only from periocular muscles

- MG with no detectable AChR and MuSK antibodies
