The minimal diagnostic criteria for HFM requires either 1) Ipsilateral mandible AND auricle defects or 2) Asymmetric mandible OR auricle defects with the involvement of 2 or more indirectly associated anomalies OR a positive familial history of HFM.

The posteroanterior cephalogram is the gold standard for assessing facial asymmetry. Measurements such as the midline deviation of maxilla and mandible, ramus height, and occlusal cant are taken for surgical planning.

Many patients with HFM have airway and feeding difficulties due to underdevelopment of the pharynx, larynx, esophagus, mandible, and mastication muscles.

Additional screenings include an audiogram to assess for hearing loss, perceptual speech analysis for speech development, and psychosocial assessment. Cervical spine radiographs for vertebral defects and renal ultrasound for noncraniofacial malformations should also be performed.
