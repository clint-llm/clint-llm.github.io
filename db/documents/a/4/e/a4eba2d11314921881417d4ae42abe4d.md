Sentinel node biopsy is not indicated in patients with bulky axillary disease or with large tumors of the breast, where extensive axillary involvement is suspected. Some evidence exists that preoperative lymph node core needle biopsy can be offered to patients ahead of surgery. If that is positive, their likelihood of needing completion axillary dissection is higher due to increased nodal burden.
