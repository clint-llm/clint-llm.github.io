Early or subclinical vitamin B6 deficiency may have vague or fleeting symptoms; however, new-onset sensory polyneuropathy, altered mental status, dermatitis in adults, or seizures in infancy should raise clinical suspicion of a clinically significant B6 deficiency. Testing for vitamin B6 can be difficult in real-time in many clinical scenarios. Direct biomarkers B6 vitamers in serum, plasma, erythrocyte, and urine are used. Serum measurement of the active vitamin Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) form is available in some clinical settings. However, the assay is not widely available or timely. A clinical alternative is an indirect measurement technique of vitamin B6, which includes measuring urinary excretion of xanthurenic acid (an amino acid catabolite of tryptophan) following a measured bolus of tryptophan. Increased levels of xanthurenic acid may indicate inadequate active B6 for the formation of the amino acid tryptophan.

Erythrocyte transaminase activity, with and without PLP added, has been used as a functional test of pyridoxine status and maybe a more accurate reflection of vitamin B6 status in critically ill patients.
