Sporothrix schenckii, S. schenckii, is a dimorphic fungus that can cause Sporotrichosis. S. schenckii exists in either a hyphal form at temperatures less than 37 degrees Celsius or as a budding yeast at 37 degrees Celsius or greater. This characteristic morphology is important in identifying the conversion from mold to yeast. There are different strains of S. schenckii, with S. schenckii complex being most commonly found in America, Asia, and Africa. S. brasilienis has been found in Brazil and is known to be transmitted from infected cats. S. Mexicana and S. globose have also been identified throughout the world.

Sporotrichosis caused by S. schenckii occurs by inoculation of soil, plants, and organic matter contaminated with the fungus. Sporotrichosis typically presents as papules or pustules that form ulcerated nodules involving local lymphatics. Sporotrichosis is classified into cutaneous, pulmonary, and disseminated, with cutaneous the most common form of the disease. Risk factors which increase the risk of disseminated disease include patients who are immunocompromised and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alcohol use disorder, and diabetes mellitus. General prevention is to wear gloves and long sleeves when handling soil. The gold standard for sporotrichosis diagnosis is fungal culture. First-line treatment is itraconazole.
