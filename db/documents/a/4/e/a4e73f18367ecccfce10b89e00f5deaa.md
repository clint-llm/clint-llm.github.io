During the development of the arterial system in the lower extremity, lumbar intersegmental arteries join to form the central or axial artery. This artery later anastomoses with the terminal branch of the abdominal aorta, known as the common iliac artery. As the limb bud lengthens, the axial artery becomes the sciatic artery in the thigh. The femoral artery then branches off the external iliac artery and joins the sciatic artery. The proximal part of the sciatic artery then regresses, and primitive middle and distal segments continue as the popliteal and peroneal arteries. On reaching the distal border of the popliteus muscle, branching off the popliteal artery, the anterior tibial artery arises passing ventrally between the tibia and fibula becoming the DPA.
