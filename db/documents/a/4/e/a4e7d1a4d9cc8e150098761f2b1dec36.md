The intercostal nerves are part of the somatic nervous system, aiding in the contraction of muscles and the return of sensory information from the skin and parietal pleura. The intercostal nerves arise from the anterior rami of the thoracic spinal nerves from T1 to T11 and are situated between adjacent ribs. The anterior division of the twelfth thoracic nerve is not technically an intercostal nerve as it sits below the ribs to enter the abdominal wall; this nerve is instead referred to as the subcostal nerve. Some techniques utilize the blockage of these nerves for analgesia and also the pathology of these nerves giving rise to neuralgia. It is crucial for providers to be comfortable with the anatomy and physiology of the intercostal nerves to accurately diagnose and treat intercostal nerve pain and pathology.
