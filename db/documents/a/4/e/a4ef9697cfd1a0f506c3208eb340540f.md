Drugs can be damaging to the esophageal wall by having a direct toxic effect on the esophageal mucosa. They may produce a caustic effect by creating an acidic or alkaline environment. Drug-induced esophagitis can be transitory or self-limiting, or it may be persistent drug injury, which can even lead to the formation of strictures. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of esophagitis, drug-induced, and highlights the role of the healthcare team in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology/mechanisms of drug-induced esophagitis.
- Review the evaluation of drug-induced esophagitis.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for drug-induced esophagitis.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to address drug-induced esophagitis and improve outcomes.
