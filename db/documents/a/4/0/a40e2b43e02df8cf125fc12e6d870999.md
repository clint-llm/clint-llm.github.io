Breast ptosis is commonly associated with aging, macromastia, weight loss, pregnancy, and hormonal changes, although it can present in patients of all ages and breast sizes. The natural history of breast ptosis begins with the skin envelope stretch, ductal structures, and supporting ligaments. The breast parenchymal volume enlarges, rendering the supporting structures ineffective and causing skin redundancy. Ptosis also occurs when parenchymal volume decreases and skin redundancy ensues. The ptosis grading is based on the degree of inferior breast displacement, and various corrective techniques can be chosen according to the different types of ptosis.
