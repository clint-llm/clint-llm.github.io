The repeated friction and pressure of the skin overlying the bony prominences leads to a hyperkeratotic thickness resulting in corn formation. This corn is a protective body reaction that produces an excess of the horny epithelial layer to prevent skin ulceration. This explains the preferential location of corns next to the condyles of the metatarsals and phalanges and the occurrence of corns in patients with a foot deformity.
