Melanoma is a malignant tumor produced from malignant transformation of melanocytes. This can be sporadic or arise from a preexisting premalignant lesion. Due to the fact that melanocytes are of neural crest origin, melanomas can arise in other locations where neural crest cells are present, including the brain and gastrointestinal tract. Approximately 10 to 25% of melanomas are found in the head and neck region. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and causes of melanoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the different types of melanoma.
- Describe the pathophysiology of melanoma.
- Summarize the treatment options for melanoma.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by melanoma.
