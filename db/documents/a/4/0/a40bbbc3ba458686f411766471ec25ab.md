Before the surgical excision of mucoceles or ranulas, it is mandatory to consult with a radiologist to help in defining the boundaries and extension of the lesion. This would prove to be of paramount significance for the surgeon in terms of a better outcome of the surgery by avoiding severe complications.

Consultation with the anesthesiologist becomes necessary when the ranula is large enough to cause respiratory compromise.
