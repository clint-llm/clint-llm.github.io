Both critical illness neuropathy and myopathy may clinically present with difficulty weaning off a ventilator or, if extubated, the patient may complain of profound weakness and flaccid limbs.

Weaning complications are due to the involvement of the phrenic nerve affecting the diaphragm, and other accessory respiratory muscles may also be affected.[
