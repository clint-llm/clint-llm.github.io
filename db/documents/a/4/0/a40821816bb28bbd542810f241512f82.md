**Nephrotoxicity**

Particular caution should be considered while giving bisphosphonates to patients with pre-existing renal impairment.

Amongst the available bisphosphonates, zoledronic acid carries the highest risk of causing renal failure.

Nephrotoxicity from pamidronate, however, presents clinically as nephrotic syndrome.

Prevention and early detection of renal failure are key in the management of bisphosphonate-related nephrotoxicity. Preventative measures include pre-infusion serum creatinine checks, adequate hydration, avoidance of simultaneous use of nephrotoxic medications, and dose adjustments in patients with mild renal insufficiency.

Once nephrotoxicity occurs, the first step in management is the discontinuation of the bisphosphonate. Management is mostly supportive, as no specific treatment has shown benefit.

**Atrial Fibrillation**

An association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and bisphosphonate use has been proposed. Large clinical trials, such as the Fracture Intervention Trial and the HORIZON Pivotal Fracture Trial, have reported an increased risk of developing AF (1.3% risk in the zoledronic group versus 0.5% in the placebo group). This was followed, however, by several observational studies that found no association. In conclusion, the retrospective trials investigating the link found the evidence to be neither positive nor completely ruled out. It should be noted that bisphosphonates are usually given to elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities, including AF. Further trials couldÂ clarify this association.
