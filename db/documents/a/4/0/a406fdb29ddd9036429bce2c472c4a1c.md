Clonidine is prescribed by various clinicians, including primary care providers, cardiologists, psychiatrists, and internists; this can also include NPs and PAs. Besides hypertension, clonidine has multiple off-label uses, such as managing withdrawal symptoms from opioids, benzodiazepines, and alcohol, analgesia, and treatment of anxiety, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

While the drug is relatively safe, it is essential to discuss any potential contraindications and adverse effects with the pharmacist. The drug is also known to cause physical and psychological dependence.

This interprofessional approach to medication therapy that includes the coordinated efforts of physicians (MDs and DOs), mid-level practitioners (PAs and NPs), nurses, and pharmacists will optimize clinical results with clonidine while reducing potential adverse events. [Level 5]
