Myopic foveoschisis is a relatively rare entity that manifests in patients with pathological myopia. The schisis, or break, in the layers of the retina, occurs because of the increase in the size of the eyeball and a consequent stretching in the layers of the choroid and the retina. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of myopic foveoschisis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of myopic foveoschisis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of myopic foveoschisis.
- Identify the management consideration for patients with myopic foveoschisis.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration amongst an interprofessional team to improve communication and enhance the care of patients with myopic foveoschisis.
