Melanoacanthoma is considered by many investigators to be a rare variant of seborrheic keratosis. Indeed, nearly all of the published literature on melanoacanthoma is included in this paper, and the total number of cases is only 140. Therefore, to attempt to establish the incidence of this pigmented lesion, studies evaluating the number of melanoacanthomas compared to either other specimens evaluated or other variants of seborrheic keratoses diagnosed have to be used. However, based on variance observed in these studies, the incidence of melanoacanthoma can not be definitively established since it ranges from 1 in 100,000 pathology specimens to between approximately 1% to 38% of seborrheic keratoses.

Prince et al. described 5 patients with melanoacanthoma. They considered the lesion to be rare since 500,000 consecutive skin biopsy specimens were required to diagnose the 5 cases. Hence, their observed incidence of melanoacanthoma was 1 case per 100,000 specimens.

Mishima and Pincus, in their seminal paper introducing the term melanoacanthoma, reported 13 patients. They commented that these cases were derived from more than 400 pigmented skin tumors; they had not included nevi in the group of 400 lesions. Hence, their incidence of melanoacanthoma, with regards to other pigmented lesions, was only 3% (13 of 400).

Roh et al., in 2016, cited two previous studies from the Korean literature and added their retrospective investigation regarding the incidence of melanoacanthoma. One of the earlier studies, by Ahn et al., observed only one melanoacanthoma in the 127 seborrheic keratoses they reviewed for 6 years, a 0.8% incidence. Similarly, the other prior investigation by Lee et al. also noted a low incidence (1%) of melanoacanthoma; only one lesion was found in the 101 seborrheic keratoses they studied. However, Roh et al. found a much higher incidence (9.2%) of melanoacanthoma; they observed 19 lesions in the 206 seborrheic keratoses they reviewed.

A group of Spanish researchers also discovered much higher incidences of melanoacanthoma in their serial studies. Initially, in 1969, they reported their evaluation of the number of dendritic melanocytes in the basal and suprabasal layers of seborrheic keratoses; they found that 38% of the seborrheic keratoses (8 of 21 lesions) demonstrated features consistent with melanoacanthoma.

Melanoacanthoma is a lesion that typically appears in older individuals without a predilection for either gender. Retrospective studies and several case reports of patients with melanoacanthoma have been published. To get a better understanding of the epidemiology of this lesion, the individual study results shall be combined with the information pooled from the individual reports to allow for the salient features of melanoacanthoma to be discerned.

Gender has been provided for 52 melanoacanthoma patients. This includes 28 men and 24 women. Hence, the ratio of men to women is 1.2 to 1.

The specific ages of the patients at the diagnosis of melanoacanthoma were provided for 20 men and 20 women. The men ranged in age from 40 years to 85 years; the median age and the mean age of diagnosis were both 63 years. The age range was wider in women, yet the median and mean age of diagnosis were younger. The women ranged in age from 27 years to 84 years; however, the median age of diagnosis was 59 years, and the mean age was nearly a decade younger at 55 years.

In summary, melanoacanthoma usually presents when patients enter their seventh decade. When the onset age for the men and the women were considered together, the diagnosis age ranged from 27 years to 85 years. The age at diagnosis had a median of 61 years and a mean of 60 years.

Melanoacanthoma occurs worldwide. Patient reports originate from many countries including Belgium,

The patient’s race or nationality was described for 43 individuals. Melanoacanthoma has been most often described in Whites: 18 patients (42%).
