Lymph nodes do not contain their nervous supply; however, they are often near many different nerves. For example, the axillary lymph nodes areÂ situated near the cords and branches of the brachial plexus, which innervate the muscles of the upper limb. Anatomically, the brachial plexus divisions become cords at the mid-clavicle, while the branches typically originate at the level of the pectoralis minor muscle.
