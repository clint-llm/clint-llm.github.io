Patients with both inherited and acquired EV present with identical lesions, characterized by verruca plana-like sometimes scaly, often flat, lesions and papules usually on the trunk, neck or face, or appearing similar to pityriasis versicolor lesions. These lesions appear in multiple places, and in the case of inherited EV, may begin to appear as early as infancy and continue throughout the patient's life. They will usually appear on skin areas exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. A family history of EV would be quite helpful in the diagnosis. For acquired EV, history of HIV or immunosuppression medical therapy would be vital to diagnosis.
