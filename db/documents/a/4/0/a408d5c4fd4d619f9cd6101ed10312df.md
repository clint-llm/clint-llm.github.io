Interprofessional relation between obstetricians and neonatologists is critical in maternal and fetal management. Early recognition of the disease and appropriate management may reduce maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Prevention guidelines should be given to mothers by their obstetrician. Radiologists can identify defects in the pregnancy and report to the parents so that they can make informed choices. Neonatologists can easily identify the defects in the child and counsel parents.  Intradisciplinary communication is paramount as a large number of consultations may be necessary and coordinated communication within the healthcare team, and with parents will be necessary.

Evidence levels exist at many levels.  The evaluation and treatment of toxoplasmosis, syphilis, CMV, and HSV are all supported by large randomized clinical trials with clear cut results.  There are also many cohort and case-control studies and historical cohort or case-control studies that support the information given in this paper.
