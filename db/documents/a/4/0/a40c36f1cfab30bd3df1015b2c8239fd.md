Treatment of monoarticular arthritis depends on the etiology and severity of the condition.  Generally, pain control and reducing damage to the joint are the primary goals of the treatment.  Appropriate antimicrobial therapy may be administered in case of septic arthritis to prevent the spread of infection to the surrounding tissues. Intra-articular or systemic steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs may be used to suppress the immune system in crystal-induced arthritis, urate-lowering or uricosuric drugs are used to prevent future recurrence of the disease.
