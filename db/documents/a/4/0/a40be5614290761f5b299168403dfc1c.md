Chikungunya fever is a virus transmitted to people by mosquitoes found mainly in tropical and sub-tropical environments. Originating from Asia, this disease has caused serious outbreaks in the Western Hemisphere since 2013. The most common symptoms of this disease are high fevers and joint pain, although headaches, muscle pains, and rash may also occur. Risk factors for the disease consist of travel to affected areas or anywhere with mosquitoes and mosquito bites. Treatment consists of rest, adequate hydration, and pain relief with acetaminophen. Prevention is key and is based on protection from mosquito bites with clothing, DEET, and mosquito nets. Given the risk of co-infection with other viruses from the mosquito bite, individuals with these symptoms must seek medical care immediately.
