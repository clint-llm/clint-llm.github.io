When the amount of serum prolactin exceeds the upper limit, we call it hyperprolactinemia. The common causes of hyperprolactinemia can be physiological, pathological, or drug-induced. Patients with hyperprolactinemia may remain asymptomatic or can present with signs and symptoms of hypogonadism and galactorrhea. This activity reviews the cause and presentation of hyperprolactinemia and stresses the importance of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of hyperprolactinemia.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with hyperprolactinemia.
- Summarize the treatment of hyperprolactinemia.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by hyperprolactinemia.
