Data has been extracted to determine the species-specific envenomation rates and the severity of the funnel-web spider bites and to determine both the efficacy and the adverse events related to the antivenom. The dataÂ gathered revealed that there were 198 potential funnel-web spider bites identified. Of those, 138 were confirmed as a funnel-web spider, and 77 of those cases produced severe envenomation. All of the species related to the severe envenomations were attributed to species restricted to New South Wales and Southern Queensland. The antivenom was used in 75 patients, including 22 children, with a complete response in 97% of the positively identified cases.
