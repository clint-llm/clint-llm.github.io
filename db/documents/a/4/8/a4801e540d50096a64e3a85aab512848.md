Prisms are an effective way to relieve diplopia and improve vergence facilities. But some patients may experience side effects with prism glasses themselves.

- Headache

- Eyestrain

- Nausea/vomiting

- Double vision

- Confusion

- Deterioration of vision

Reasons for the discomfort experienced with prism correction glasses:

- Misalignment of lenses- There can be errors in the initial alignment of the axis or the optical center while fitting the prisms. Sometimes, they can get misaligned due to the regular use of prism correction glasses.

- Incorrect or expired prescription: A wrong or expired prescription for prism correction can lead to discomfort. It is essential to give the patient an adequate adaptation time in the clinic before providing the final prescription.
