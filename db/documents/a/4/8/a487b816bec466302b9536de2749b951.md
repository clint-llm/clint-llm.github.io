Monteggia fractures most commonly result from a direct blow to the forearm with the elbow extended and forearm in hyperpronation. The energy from the ulnar fracture gets transmitted along the interosseous membrane leading to rupture of the proximal quadrate and annular ligaments, disrupting the radiocapitellar joint. In conjunction with the bimodal distribution, diaphyseal forearm fractures in young males are commonly due to high-energy trauma, for example, falls from height, sports injuries, motor vehicle accidents, and fractures in elderly females are due to low-energy trauma such as a ground level fall.
