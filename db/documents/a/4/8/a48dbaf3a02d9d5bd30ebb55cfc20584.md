Leptospirosis typically occurs in a temperate climate, during the late summer or early fall in Western countries, and during the rainy season in the tropics. The incidence in the tropics is almost 10 times that of more temperate climates. It tends to be an unreported disease because its symptoms mimic many other disease processes; however, the World Health Organization has estimated that there are 873,000 cases annually with over 40,000 deaths.

In the United States, there are 100 to 200 identified cases annually, and most are documented in Hawaii. However, when testing people in urban centers such as Detroit, many tested positive for past infection!
