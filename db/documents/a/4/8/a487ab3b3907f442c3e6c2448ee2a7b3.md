Gutgesell et al. conducted histopathological examination among patients with MGD and found obstructed and dilated ducts, enlarged acini with cystic degeneration, increased inflammatory cells, and abnormal keratinization. Additional findings reported were squamous metaplasia and granulation tissue formation.

In another study by Obata et al., similar findings were reported from an autopsy of 83 patients. The changes reported were cystic dilatation of ducts and acini, thickening of basement membrane along with acini atrophy, granuloma formation, and lipogranulomatous inflammation.
