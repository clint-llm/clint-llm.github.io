Tachyarrhythmias are produced by one of the three mechanisms; reentry, enhanced automaticity, or triggered activity.

The common reentrant arrhythmias include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, other pathway-mediated tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia. In atrial fibrillation, multiple reentry circuits are found in the left atrium and pulmonary veins, while typical atrial flutter is characterized by a macro reentry circuit in the right atrium.

The clinical symptoms and signs of different reentry arrhythmias are variable, and the clinical course and outcomes depend on the cardiac status. Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia is the most benign reentrant arrhythmia, while scar-related ventricular tachycardia is a life-threatening tachyarrhythmia.
