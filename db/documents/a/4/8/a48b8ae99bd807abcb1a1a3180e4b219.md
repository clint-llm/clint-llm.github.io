Patients often have complex medical and neuro disabilities, and an interprofessional team approach is essential. Coordinating care is most appropriately done within this team. Endocrine abnormalities accompany many midline malformations that can be present in encephaloceles; thus, endocrinological evaluation is necessary. Morbidity and mortality have greatly improved with the use of brain MRI, better neurosurgical techniques, and a dedicated neonatal intensive care. The neuroradiologist provides the interpretation of studies to determine the cause of the defect and associated anomalies. Additional studies needed can be recommended before surgery.

While a primary clinician is almost always involved in the care of patients with an encephalocele, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that includes an obstetrician, neurosurgeon, neurologist, intensivist, craniofacial specialist, and plastic surgeon. The integrated care pathway, combined with an evidence-based approach, will provide the patient's best outcomes.
