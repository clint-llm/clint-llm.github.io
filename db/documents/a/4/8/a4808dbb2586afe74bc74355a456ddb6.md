MNTI was thought to be a congenital neoplasm of melanocytes. However, this theory was rejected because neuroblast-like cells were reported histologically, which is not consistent with this description. Another theory states that this neoplasm could arise from retina stem cells. Still, this theory does not agree with the location of these lesions since retinal development is completed before the jaw, so this theory is not acceptable either. An odontogenic origin does not explain the lesions in non-head regions. The last and the most acceptable theory proposed is that this neoplasm originates from the neural crest. Immunohistochemical and ultramicroscopic findings (see below) support this theory and make it the only logicallyÂ justifiable one.
