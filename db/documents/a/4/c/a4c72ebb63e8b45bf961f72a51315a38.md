Approximately half of the patients with CML are asymptomatic and are diagnosed on routine complete blood count. Most patients are in the chronic phase of CML. CML, in the chronic phase, most often presents with symptoms related to anemia and splenomegaly. Symptomatic anemia includes symptoms such as fatigue and malaise. Splenomegaly may cause a mass effect resulting in early satiety, left upper quadrant fullness, or pain. CML may also cause thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction resulting in bleeding, thrombocytosis resulting in thrombosis or priapism, basophilia resulting in histamine release, and upper gastrointestinal ulcers. As CML progresses into the accelerated phase or blast phase, symptoms such as headaches, bone pain, fever, joint pain, bleeding, infections, and lymphadenopathy become more common.

The physical exam should include assessing the spleen size by palpation, measured in centimeters below the costal margin.
