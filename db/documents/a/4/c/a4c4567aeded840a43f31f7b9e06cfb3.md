Informed consent should be obtained. Every part of the exam should be explained prior to it being done.

The patient should be undressed from the waist down and covered with a sheet to maintain modesty. The patient should be uncovered for only as much time as is necessary for the exam. Until the patient is properly positioned, she should remain draped.

Instruct the patient to lie on her back on the bed in the dorsal lithotomy position. This is achieved by placing her feet in the foot supports and scooting herself down in the bed until her thighs are roughly perpendicular to the ground or further bent toward the abdomen. The patient’s buttocks should be at the edge of the bed or slightly farther to provide for better mobility of the speculum and better visualization.  If a table with foot supports is unavailable, the pelvic exam can be done by placing the patient’s hips on top of a padded flipped washbasin or bedpan with the patient’s legs bent toward her chest or placed in frog-leg position with the bottoms of her feet together.
