While the lumbrical muscles have shown use in protecting the median nerve from further injury, several reports have shown that aberrant lumbrical anatomy can cause damage to the nerve.

As previously discussed, the first two lumbricals are typically innervated by the median nerve. As such, any insult to the median nerve, including penetrating trauma, compression injury, brachial plexus injury, or infection may result in weakness or atrophy of the lateral two lumbricals. Additionally, any injury to the ulnar nerve can manifest as weakness or even atrophy of the medial lumbrical muscles. Entrapment of the ulnar nerve ranks asis the second most common compression neuropathy patients present with, and it is typically caused by nerve root impingement, brachial plexus compression, or nerve entrapment at the elbow, forearm, or wrist.

For clinicians to assess lumbrical muscle strength, with the palm supine, the patient is instructed to flex the metacarpophalangeal joints while keeping the interphalangeal joints extended. The clinician then applies a counterforce along the palmar surface of the proximal phalanx of digits 2-5 individually. Resistance may also be applied separately on the dorsal surface of the middle and distal phalanges of digits 2–5 to test extension of the interphalangeal joints while maintaining flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints.
