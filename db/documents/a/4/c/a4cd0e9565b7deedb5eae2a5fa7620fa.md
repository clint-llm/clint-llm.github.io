Both the high-pressure environment as well as the hyperoxygenation that is associated with hyperbaric oxygen treatments (HBOT) have numerous consequences on the human cardiovascular system. Knowing these physiological changes plays an important role in how HBOT is utilized in patient care. This activity reviews the cardiovascular effects of hyperbaric oxygen and discusses the role of the interprofessional team in monitoring for untoward side effects of patients receiving hyperbaric oxygen.

**Objectives:**
- Review the effects of HBOT on cerebral blood flow.
- Describe the effect of HBOT on the heart rate.
- Outline the clinical significance and concerns regarding use of HBO therapy on patients with heart conditions.
- Summarize cardiovascular effects of hyperbaric oxygen and describe the role of the interprofessional team in monitoring for untoward side effects of patients receiving hyperbaric oxygen.
