The classic presentation of HaNDL syndrome is as follows:

- Headache (unilateral or global), mostly throbbing in nature, and moderate to severe in severity. The duration of the headache is usually one hour to one week but typically lasts for a few hours. Although headache can be the first sign, it usually follows neurologic symptoms by 15 to 60 minutes. Headache can be associated with nausea, vomiting, and photophobia.

- Fever with leukocytosis (rarely).

- Neurological findings are, in descending order of presentation; (i) sensory disorder;(ii) aphasia;(iii) motor disorders. Neurologic symptoms usually last from a few minutes to 2 to 3 days but typically resolves within 2 hours. The sensory symptoms in HaNDL syndrome-presents as numbness usually starting from hand and progress to the arm, face, and tongue with trunk and legs are rarely affected. Patients also rarely experience acute confusion characterized by a change in consciousness and agitation. This syndrome that usually last weeks to months (usually 2 to 3 weeks), separated by asymptomatic periods or just headache during which the neurological exam is normal. The neurologic deficits are often different from one episode to the next due to the involvement of varying cortical regions. The literature more frequently reports left hemispheric involvement with right-sided neurological deficits.

- Visual symptoms.

- Rarely ophthalmologic complications like blindness, photophobia, and double vision.

- Raised intracranial pressure.
