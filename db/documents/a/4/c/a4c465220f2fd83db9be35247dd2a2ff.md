Actinic prurigo does not resolve with time and is marked by frequent relapses. For most patients with actinic prurigo, the outcomes are poor. The condition is associated with frequent relapses, especially during the warmer months of the year. The condition rarely spontaneously resolves and is chronic. The overall quality of life is poor.

The specialty-trained nurse can help educate the patient on avoiding unprotected sun exposure, understanding the UV index, and the proper use of commercially available sunscreens. The nurse can help educate the patient on the importance of compliance with treatment and UV protection as even going out during the day can cause a relapse of the condition within minutes. The clinical pharmacist plays a critical role in educating the patient on potential complications and adverse reactions from therapy, especially with high potency treatments such as systemic immunosuppressants. The pharmacist can also assist the clinicians by reviewing medications prescribed and evaluating for any potential drug-drug interactions. The patient must also receive education regarding the proper use of appropriate sunscreens, as most commercially available sunscreens are not recommended. Only mineral sunscreens can be used. An integrated interprofessional care team can help provide multifaceted education required by the patient to ensure optimal outcomes. [Level 5]

Actinic prurigo is labile, and even minor exposure to the sun can lead to an outbreak.
