**Operating Room Setup**

The VATS approach requires an operating room setup that allows the thoracic surgeon the potential to convert to an open thoracotomyÂ if necessary. Standard operating room setup for a VATS includes 1 monitor set up on each side of the operating table. There may be an additional screen present in the room for academic purposes and for viewing by other staff in the room.

Usually, the surgeon and the assisting surgeon stand on the anterior aspect of the patient. The anesthesiologist is positioned at the head end of the table. The scrub nurse stands opposite the assistant surgeon across the table. Monitors positioned on both sides of the table allow visualization of the surgery to all people present in the operating room.
