Improving simulation curriculum design to maximize experiential learning has been shown to have clinical benefits, including improved patient safety. For example, simulation-based education has been demonstrated to lower catheter-related bloodstream infections.

For this reason, many organizations use extensive simulation instruction as part of the onboarding process to ensure that every member of the team, including residents, fellows, attendings, and nurses, have an adequate skill level for various critical and high-risk procedures.

Many other examples of successful simulation training for procedures exist, showing the efficacy of this educational modality. Paracentesis procedure simulation training, coupled with pre-simulation didactics, was found to increase competence and confidence in doing the procedure.

Furthermore, other industries, such as aviation, adopted advanced CRM programs, and as a result, had improved safety outcomes. Similar initiatives can be used in healthcare to improve patient safety.

Finally, simulation is an interactive and engaging tool to improve clinical knowledge and confidence, which, in turn, can improve patient safety and outcomes.
