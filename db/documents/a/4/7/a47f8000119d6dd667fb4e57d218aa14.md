Enchondromatosis possesses associations with somatic mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) and 2 (IDH2) genes. The mutations are rare and often sporadic. Isocitrate dehydrogenase is an enzymatic component of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle functioning to convert isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate.

Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 cause malfunction of this enzyme resulting in increased levels of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG.) D-2-HG competitively inhibits alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes. DNA hypermethylation and histone modification ensue, affecting differentiation.
