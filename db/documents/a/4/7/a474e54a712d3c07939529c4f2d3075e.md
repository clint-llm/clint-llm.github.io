The incidence of a corneal foreign body varies based on the text, but a Swedish study revealed the incidence of eye injuries was 8.1 per 1000, with 40% composed of corneal or conjunctival foreign bodies. The majority of these occur at work while performing high-risk activities, as mentioned previously. Noncompliance with well-fitting eye protection was common. In fact, during the 1991 Gulf War, data from one army field hospital showed 14% of the injuries seen were due to ocular trauma. Of these, 17% were corneal foreign bodies, and only 3% of the injured patients were wearing their provided protective goggles.
