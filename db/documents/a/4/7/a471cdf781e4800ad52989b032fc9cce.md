Nasotracheal intubation is commonly performed by anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists. The technique requires in-depth knowledge of upper airway anatomy. NTI is a useful technique for intubation when the oral cavity is not available. Patients must be closely monitored during the procedure; auscultation of the lungs and end-tidal PCO2 confirmation are essential to ensure that the tube is in the trachea. Unlike oral ETTs, nasotracheal tubes can be dislodged easily. Therefore, the patient's head must be stable throughout the duration of the intubation, particularly during head and neck surgery.
