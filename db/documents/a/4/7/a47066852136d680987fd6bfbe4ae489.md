The pathophysiology of depressive cognitive disorders is originated from the underlying neuropsychiatric disorder. Due to the overlapping signs and symptoms of depression and dementia, it becomes difficult to discern the exact pathology of cognitive impairment. Numerous cognitive deficits are found in late-onset depression. Among those, memory impairment (anterograde and retrograde) is extensively analyzed for the evaluation of cognitive distinctions in depressive disorder and dementia. Major depressive disorder depicts a multitude of deficits in the spheres of episodic memory, including explicit vocal and visual memory domains. The implicit memory functions are preserved. This memory impairment is secondary to the temporal lobe abnormality seen in a depressive disorder. Circadian rhythm disruption seen in depression has been theorized to contribute to cognitive decline.

Patients with neurodegenerative dementia exhibit a considerably more fast rate of forgetting as differed to depressed and normal people who forget data at a similar rate. Depressed individuals with memory impairment also tend to show less random variation in their responses. A clear-cut ‘unified theory’ for the cognitive impairment in depression has not been formulated, but research points to an encoding problem seen in these patients. A depressive disorder is associated with negative automatic thought (NAT) and rumination, which encroach into the consciousness affecting cognition.
