Biotin deficiency occurs in severely malnourished children in the developed world, thus creating a global public health problem. Biotinidase screening should be part of the workup of infants or children showing clinical features of the disease; it is a routine part of neonatal screening in many countries.

Biotin supplements are readily available in the market. It is routinely given as a nutritional supplement to treat hair loss and brittle nails. Evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of biotin supplements in splitting brittle nails (onychoschizia, onychoschisis). However, not much evidence favors biotin supplementation in hair loss unless it is due to hereditary abnormalities of biotin metabolism or acquired biotin deficiency.

The primary care clinicians need to follow these patients, as it often takes months to reverse the symptoms. For patients who remain compliant with treatment, the outcomes are good.
