Arterial lines placement is for real-time monitoring of blood pressures and arterial blood sampling in critically ill patients or those undergoing complex procedures and surgeries. Many health professionals perform the procedure, and increased use of ultrasound has reduced its difficulty. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications of radial artery cannulation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients who need arterial lines.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the technique of cannulating the radial artery.
- Review the indications for radial artery cannulation.
- Summarize the complications of radial artery cannulation.
- Outline the importance of collaboration among the interprofessional team to ensure safe cannulation of the radial artery and improving patient outcomes.
