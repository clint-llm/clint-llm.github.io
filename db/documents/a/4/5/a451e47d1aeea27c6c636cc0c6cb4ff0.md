The exact incidence of malignant hyperthermia is unknown. Studies demonstrate that malignant hyperthermia occurs in about 1 in 100,000 adults and 1 in 30,000 in children. The incidence of malignant hyperthermia varies based upon geographic region. There are concentrations of malignant hyperthermia susceptible families present in Wisconsin and the upper Midwest. The mortality rate is 3% to 5%, even when properly treated.

Other disorders are also associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. These include central core disease (a rare, non-progressive myopathy characterized by hypotonia and weakness of proximal muscles) and King-Denborough syndrome (rare myotonia associated with multiple distinct physical features).

Early researchers described rare episodes of stress-induced "awake malignant hyperthermia." Later, Tobin described one of the most convincing cases of fatal, exercise-induced malignant hyperthermia in a 13-year-old boy in whom the causative RYR1 mutation was present and was later found to be present in his family members.

Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility has also been described in other species, particularly in swine, where much of the early research into the disease and its treatment originated.
