On evaluation, most cases can be diagnosed and treated clinically without the need for further testing. Most cases of ischial bursitis are self-limiting and will resolve with time. Blood work should is only necessary if an infection or autoimmune condition is suspected. In the case of bursitis, lab values will most likely be within the normal range. If other conditions are suspected, such as a septic joint, this may indicate joint aspiration and the initiation of antibiotic treatment. MRI is sensitive for bursitis but is expensive and unnecessary most of the time when diagnosing and treating ischial bursitis. This test is only necessary if there are other possible differentials, such as tumors. Ultrasound, similarly, is unnecessary performing unless aspiration, then it is useful to guide the procedure, ensuring aspiration occurs in the appropriate location.
