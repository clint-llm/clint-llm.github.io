Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is a chronic blistering disease with aÂ disease course characterized by periods of exacerbations and remissions. Prognosis depends on the severity at the time of diagnosis and response to treatment. A retrospective analysis by Kim et al. showed a median time to remission of 9 months after treatment with immunosuppressive agents. Complete remission at 1 year was achieved in 33% of patients and 45% by 6 years.
