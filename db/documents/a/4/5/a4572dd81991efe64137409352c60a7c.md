Traumatic mechanisms, surgical site infections, poor nutrition, comorbidities (i.e., diabetes, chronic steroid use), and prolonged critical care course all increase the risk of fascial dehiscence. Fascial dehiscence places patients at risk of hernias and their associated short- and long-term complications, including obstruction and strangulation. Additionally, progression to evisceration represents a true surgical emergency.
