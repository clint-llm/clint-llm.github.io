RPR card tests are non-treponemal flocculation assays that work by detecting reagin antibodies in plasma and serum.Â RPR antigen mixture is prepared with cholesterol, nonspecific cardiolipin, and lecithin. A 0.05 mL drop of serum is placed on a circle within a testing card for each assay. The serum is spread throughout the circle. One drop of prepared antigen suspension is then added to each specimen. The testing cards are rotated in a humidified chamber at 100 rpm for 8 minutes. The cards are then rotated by hand and read under a light source macroscopically. If IgM or IgG antibodies to lipoidal antigens are present, agglutination is visualized on the card.
