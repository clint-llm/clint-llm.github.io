Female urinary retention is either acute or chronic and can be categorized according to the International Continence Society as:

- Complete (full retention) or partial (high post-void residuals)

- Acute or chronic

- Symptomatic or asymptomatic

- Mechanism (obstructive or non-obstructive)

- Bladder pressure: high or low

Female urinary retention is caused by one of four general etiologies: neurological, obstructive, pharmacological, and psychogenic.

A number of etiologies exist for this condition.

- Acute vulvovaginitis

- Anesthesia (general or regional)

- Bladder neck stenosis

- Bladder radiation

- Brain tumor, infection, trauma, or stroke

- Cauda equina syndrome

- Cerebral palsy

- Cervical cancer

- Constipation

- Cystocele

- Cystotomy not recognized during surgery

- Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia

- Diabetes

- Fibroids

- Fowler's syndrome

- Frailty

- Genital herpes

- Heavy metal poisoning

- Iatrogenic nerve injury during pelvic surgery

- Joint replacement surgery

- Meatal stenosis

- Meningomyelocele

- Multiple sclerosis

- Neurologic injury during surgery

- Obstruction from a vaginal hematoma, packing, sling procedures, urethral foreign body, urinary calculi, pelvic organ prolapse, failure of pelvic floor relaxation, etc.

- Older age

- Parkinson disease

- Pelvic injury, trauma, or malignancy

- Pelvic organ prolapse

- Pessary: poorly fitting or out of position

- Pharmacological from long-term use of antihistamines, anticholinergics, overactive bladder medications, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, antispasmodics, antipsychotics, SSRIs, alpha-adrenergic agonists, etc.

- Polypharmacy

- Rectocele

- Spina bifida

- Spinal cord injury or infection

- Surgery, especially incontinence procedures such as pubovaginal slings

- Urethral cancer

- Urethral diverticula or thrombosed caruncle

- Urethral injury or scarring

- Urethral swelling from infection

- Vaginal childbirth; especially if instruments were required

- Vaginal lichen planus

**Aging**affects detrusor contraction strength, bladder sensation, and urinary flow rate.

**Bladder outlet obstruction**in women can be caused by pubovaginal sling surgery or pelvic organ prolapse.

While constipation is clearly a cause of incomplete bladder emptying in children, its role in adults is less clear except for fecal impactions. Urethral lesions such as strictures, diverticula, and caruncles can also cause a bladder outlet obstruction. Strictures are usually the result of infections or prior urological procedures such as urethral dilations. It is estimated that urethral strictures may occur in 4% to 13% of women with urinary retention due to bladder outlet obstruction.

**Detrusor underactivity**is defined as a contraction of reduced strength and/or duration, which results in a failure to empty the bladder adequately within a reasonable period. It generally requires urodynamic testing to make a confirmed diagnosis. The most common causes include pelvic neuropathy, central nervous system disorders, bladder muscle dysfunction, aging, neurological diseases, and medication effects.

**Diabetic women**are far more likely to have higher post-void residual urine volumes than non-diabetic females due to both motor and sensory neurogenic changes, as more than fifty percent of women with longstanding diabetes will develop peripheral neuropathy.

**Fowler's syndrome**is a rare clinical problem that causes urinary retention in young women. First described in 1988, the syndrome usually occurs after menarche in the 2nd to 3rd decades, and there is often a triggering event such as a surgical procedure or an acute illness.

Fowler's syndromeÂ should be suspected in all younger women with non-neurogenic, non-obstructive urinary retention unrelated to surgery, trauma, or childbirth.

Fowler's syndrome is characterized by the following characteristics:

- Younger women in 2nd and 3rd decades of life

- Not associated with pelvic surgery or childbirth

- There may have a triggering event such as a surgical procedure or an acute illness

- Often associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (in 40% of cases) and opioid use

- Urinary retention or high post-void residual urine volumes, typically at least 1,000 mL at some point

- Increased bladder capacity

- Decreased bladder sensation

- Markedly reduced bladder contractions and detrusor voiding pressures

- High urethral sphincter closing pressure and muscle tone (usually detectable by urethral sphincter EMG)

- Increased sphincteric volume on transvaginal ultrasound

- Intermittent catheterization is often painful, especially on withdrawal of the catheter

**Functional**bladder outlet obstruction would involve any abnormal contraction or failure of relaxation of the urethral sphincter during voiding. This would include detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, dysfunctional voiding, Fowler's syndrome, or primary bladder neck obstruction. Dysfunctional voiding is defined as a variable, intermittent, or fluctuating urinary flow rate in neurologically intact individuals due to involuntary spasmodic contractions of the urethral sphincter. Unlike detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, there is no underlying neurogenic disorder. Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia is caused by the contraction of the urethral sphincter and/or the periurethral striated muscles during bladder emptying. It is due to a disruption of the neural connections between the pontine micturition center and the caudal spinal cord. The specific diagnosis usually requires urodynamics with electromyography and/or video urodynamics.
