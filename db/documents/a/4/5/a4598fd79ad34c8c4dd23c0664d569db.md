The vasculature of the foot is composed of arteries that originate from the anterior and posterior tibial arteries, the terminal branches of the popliteal artery.

This article will review both dorsal and plantar foot vasculature in detail, discuss its embryonic origin, and touch on its relevance to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and the clinical physical exam. The intrinsic foot muscles supplied by these arteries will be briefly discussed as well.
