While nitrous oxide inactivates methionine synthase, intraoperative use results in a transient metabolic abnormality that soon reverses upon replacing the degrading enzyme.

When nitrous oxide is used recurrently (during occupational exposure or as a drug of abuse), it may lead to megaloblastic anemia with neurologic dysfunction. This situation also may occur in patients with an unrecognized cobalamin deficiency (vegans, pernicious anemia, hereditary disorders of cobalamin, and folate metabolism).Â Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (SACD) and death is reported with repeated exposure in a case of a rare congenital 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency.
