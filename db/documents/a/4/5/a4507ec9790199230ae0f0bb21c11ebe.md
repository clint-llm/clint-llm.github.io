The main indications of peripheral arterial duplex imaging include:

- Detection of stenosis or occlusion of peripheral arteries in symptomatic patients with suspicious evidence related to PAD, including exertional leg pain, diagnosis of claudication, absent distal pulses, dependent rubor, and nonhealing ulcer.

- Monitoring areas of previous open vascular procedures, including sites of previous bypass surgery, and providing the appropriate prediction of graft thrombosis.

- Monitoring sites of previous percutaneous and endovascular interventions like angioplasty, thrombolysis/thrombectomy, and stent placements.

- Follow-up for progression of the previously documented disease, such as stenosis in an artery that had undergone intervention, atherosclerosis, or other occlusive disorders.

- Evaluation of vascular and perivascular pathologies like aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms, arteriovenous fistula, and vascular malformations

- Mapping arteries before surgical intervention and providing anatomic and physiologic data to plan the optimal surgical and endovascular intervention.

- Evaluation of arterial integrity in trauma.

- Providing a grading scale for vascular trauma

- Initial evaluation of the nonatherosclerotic diseases that affect the peripheral arteries, including popliteal entrapment syndrome, external iliac artery endofibrosis, lower-extremity inflammatory vasculitides, and dissection.

- A diagnostic and therapeutic measure of the peripheral arterial embolization in the upper extremity
