The armamentarium (comprising equipment and different parts of an implant) used for the surgical placement of a dental implant is as follows:

- Disposable syringes

- Disposable surgical blades

- Towel clips

- Periosteal elevator

- Dental implant surgical kit (containing different drills)

- Physiodispenser with the surgical handpiece

- Dental implant

- Cover screw

- Healing abutment

- Needle holder

- Toothed tissue holding forceps

- Scissors, surgical sutures (in flap surgery)

- Soft tissue punch (for flapless surgeries)

Types of implants and implant materials

- Endosteal

- Subperiosteal

- Transosteal

Endosteal implants pierce only one cortical plate of maxilla and mandible. The most frequently used endosteal implant is root form implant. The subperiosteal implant has an implant substructure and superstructure where custom cast frame is placed directly beneath the periosteum. Transosteal implant crosses through both cortical plates.

Implants can be divided into three materials:

- Metals

- Ceramics

- Polymers

There are three biologic responses when implants are rooted in the host tissue:

- Biotorerant: surrounded by fibrous tissue, e.g., stainless steel

- Bioinert: direct rigid attachment, e.g., titanium and its alloys

- Bioactive: allows the formation of bone on their surface, e.g., hydroxyapatite
