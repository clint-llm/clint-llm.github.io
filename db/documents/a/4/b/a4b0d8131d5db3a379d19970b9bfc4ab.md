**Labs**

Laboratory workup can include CBC, BMP, and CRP to assist with preoperative planning or rule out infection, but otherwise do not assist in diagnosing a distal ulna fracture.

**Radiograph**

The gold standard for diagnosing distal forearm fractures is plain film.

**Computed Tomography (CT)**

Use CT for preoperative planning, suspected occult fractures, comminution, and intraarticular fractures. Unique applications of CT for distal ulna fractures include DRUJ instability, TFCC or intraosseous membrane injury, ulnar head fractures, and isolated intraarticular ulna fractures.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**

MRI is the most accurate noninvasive modality for assessing if a TFCC or DRUJ injury is present (arthroscopy is the gold standard for TFCC and DRUJ injuries).

**Ultrasound**

Useful for fracture identification in the emergency department setting. Without radiation risk, it is becoming popular for rapid fracture identification and an alternative for patients susceptible to radiation exposure, such as children and pregnant women. It also has shown promise in identifying ligamentous injuries. A meta-analysis of 16 studies including over 1,200 patients exhibited high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing distal forearm fractures. The main disadvantage is that it is more operator-dependent than other modalities.
