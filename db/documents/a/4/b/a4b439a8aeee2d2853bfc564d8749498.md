Bony defects are most often caused by trauma, tumor, infection, or congenital anomaly, and these can lead to poor quality of life and occasionally amputation. Despite the development of newer techniques like bridging endoprostheses and distraction osteogenesis, non-vascularized bone grafts are still used for the management of nonunions and defects to promote healing. Bone grafts have been used in reconstructive surgery for a century and recent advances in microvascular techniques have made free fibula flap transfer a viable option for reconstruction of long bony defects.

In 1975, Taylor et al harvested and transferred the first free fibula through a posterior approach, and the technique was further improved by Gilbert, who described the lateral approach, which was later further developed by Chuang et al, who popularized the osteomyocutaneous fibular flap.

There are many ways of employing fibular bone for reconstruction: cancellous and cortical autografts, bone allografts, endoprosthetic replacement, vascularized bone grafts, fibular osteocutaneous flaps, and fibular osteomuscular flaps.
