The clinical presentation of disc battery ingestion can vary based on the timing of ingestion, type of battery, and its location in the body.  The vast majority of patients presenting with known or suspected button battery ingestion are asymptomatic. The most common acute symptoms are nonspecific and include nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, irritability, and abdominal pain but are only present in 10% to 20% of patients.

No physical examination findings are specific for acute disk battery ingestion. Batteries in the nasal cavity may be visualized directly, but findings in patients who have batteries in the esophagus or distal structures are typically unremarkable.  With a delay in presentation, examination findings may vary greatly and depend on the location of the injury.
