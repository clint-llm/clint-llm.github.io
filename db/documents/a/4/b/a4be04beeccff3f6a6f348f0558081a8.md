Due to the embarrassing nature of this disorder, medical professionals need to coordinate care and communicate effectively with one another. Primary care providers (PCP) need to help identify patients who are potentially suffering from Peyronie disease. The sensitive issue requires sensitivity by the PCP. Often, males will not readily bring up this issue with their provider.

PCPs must be able to have an open and non-judgemental discussion with their patient's regarding their sexual activity and satisfaction with their sexual ability, which will often be the first checkpoint when it may be discovered that a patient has an issue such as PD. From that point on, PCPs need to understand that penile curvature or plaques are treatable problems, and the affected patients should be referred to a urologist for further management. At that point, the urologist can offer a variety of solutions to the problem, and the patient's care can take the next step forward. At the heart of the issue will be the ability to identify the patient's having the problem and get them to be seen by the proper medical professional. This will, for the most part, fall to the care of the patient's primary care provider.
