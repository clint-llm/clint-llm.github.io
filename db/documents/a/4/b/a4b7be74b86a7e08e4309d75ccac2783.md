The best way to manage venous air embolism is to prevent it in the first place. Some preventive measures include the following:

- Avoid hyperventilating patients in the upright or seated position

- Modify the position during surgery so that the head is lower than the legs. This creates positive pressure in the sigmoid and transverse sinuses.

- If the patient has a patent foramen ovale, avoid seated positions for surgery.

- Limit the amount of positive pressure during mechanical ventilation

- Avoid inserting central lines in hypovolemic patients

- Always ensure that the hub of the catheters is closed

- Check connections to central lines frequently

- Tell the patient not to take a deep breathe when inserting a central line
