Retinopathy refers to pathological alterations to the retina resulting from a variety of causes, including environmental conditions and genetic factors. As the tissue with the highest oxygen consumption and the highest content of polyunsaturated fatty acid, the retina is especially susceptible damage from oxidative stress. In mammals, the retinal and choroidal circulatory systems provide oxygen and nutrients to the retina, and most major causes of retinopathy involve damage to these systems. This activity explains when retinopathy should be considered on a differential diagnosis and reviews the proper evaluation and management of this condition. This activity stresses the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiologic basis of retinopathy.
- Review the complications of untreated retinopathy. 
- Outline the treatment strategies for retinopathy. 
- Describe how enhanced coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid detection of retinopathy and subsequently enhance the detection of pathology and allow for treatment when indicated.
