SBP can occur in adults and children. In children, it most commonly occurs in neonates and those around five years of age. It is most commonÂ in patients with cirrhosis. However, it can occur as a complication of any disease that results in the accumulation of ascitic fluid, such as liver disease, Budd-Chiari syndrome, congestive heart failure, systemic lupus erythematosus, renal failure, or cancers, and has a poor prognosis. Approximately 10 to 25% of patients with ascites will develop SBP, and the condition is associated with a 20% in-hospital rate of mortality.

Patients with a prior incidence of SBP are more likely to encounter a subsequent infection with a drug-resistant organism. Additionally, the risk of developing SBP increases with age, the use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), and when undergoing SBP prophylaxis, such as selective intestinal decontamination.
