Mesenteric ischemia is a manifestation of peripheral vascular disease in which the blood supply fails to meet the metabolic demands of visceral organs. Acutely, it is a surgical emergency resulting in severe abdominal pain classically described as "pain out of proportion to physical examination." However, chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) often presents with vague abdominal pain that may be difficult to differentiate from other, more common causes of abdominal pain. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of chronic mesenteric ischemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of chronic mesenteric ischemia.
- Review the pathophysiology of chronic mesenteric ischemia.
- Explain the treatment and management options available for chronic mesenteric ischemia.
- Summarize the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of chronic mesenteric ischemia and improve outcomes.
