As mentioned earlier, patients who develop GI toxicity with a combination of 5-FU and folinic acid therapy should no longer receive such treatment until symptoms have resolved.

Intrathecal administration and hypersensitivity to folinic acid or its components are contraindications to its administration.

Caution is necessary for patients receiving folinic acid therapy for the treatment of megaloblastic anemia, particularly in the presence of concurrent vitamin B12 deficiency or pernicious anemia. In such cases, neurologic manifestations may progress and get masked by hematologic remission.
