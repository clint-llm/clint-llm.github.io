The purpose of vasodilation is to increase blood flow to the tissues in the body. In response to a need for oxygen or nutrients, tissues can release endogenous vasodilators. The result is a decrease in vascular resistance and an increase in capillary perfusion. A common example of this vasodilation response occurs during exercise. When exercising, the oxygen consumption by skeletal muscles rapidly increases, and it is necessary to, therefore, increase the oxygen supply.
