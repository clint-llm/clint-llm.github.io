The progression of peliosis hepatis is still largely uncertain. Researchers have not observed any apparent patterns of disease progression. However, often patients found to have the condition will remain asymptomatic for the remainder of their life, whereas others may develop complications known to be associated with portal hypertension. Very seldom, patients can develop life-threatening complications related to high rates of mortality, including intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
