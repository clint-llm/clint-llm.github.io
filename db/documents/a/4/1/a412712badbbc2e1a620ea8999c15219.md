The blood supply to the nasal cavity comes from branches of the internal and external carotid arteries. The primary source is the sphenopalatine artery, a branch of the internal maxillary artery, which is itself a terminal branch of the external carotid artery. A 2016 cadaveric study demonstrated more specifically that the superior turbinate is perfused predominantly by the posterior septal artery, a branch of the sphenopalatine artery, while the inferior and middle turbinates appear to be fed by branches of the posterior lateral nasal artery, also from the sphenopalatine artery, which enters these turbinates posteriorly.

Venous drainage of the turbinates follows arterial pathways back to the facial vein anteriorly, the cavernous sinus superiorly, and the pterygoid plexus posteriorly. The facial vein and cavernous sinus drain into the internal jugular vein, while the pterygoid plexus drains predominantly into the external jugular vein, although some of its blood flows into the cavernous sinus and internal jugular vein via communicating branches as well. Located on the lateral nasal wall at the posterior aspect of the inferior turbinate is Woodruff's plexus, a submucosal network of veins that is often injured during turbinoplasty and represents the primary cause of posterior epistaxis, which accounts for 5 to 10% of cases of nasal bleeding.
