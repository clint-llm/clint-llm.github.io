Adamantinoma is ideally managed by an interprofessional team that consists of orthopedists, radiologists, surgical oncologists, oncologists, and pathologists, as well as specialty trained nurses and pharmacists. Correlation between gross, radiographic, and microscopic features of the lesion is crucial to establish the definitive diagnosis of adamantinoma. Despite its rarity, it is essential to recognize this bone tumor since adequate treatment in early stages results in a better prognosis. Postoperatively, patients require long-term follow-up due to the possibility of tumor recurrence and distant metastases. Patients and families require ongoing coordinated education by the clinician and specialty-trained oncology nurse. They should be taught to recognize the signs and symptoms of recurrence or complications. The nurse should assist in coordinating follow-up care and be available for questions. For the best outcomes, a coordination interprofessional open communication approach will lead to the best. [Level 5]
