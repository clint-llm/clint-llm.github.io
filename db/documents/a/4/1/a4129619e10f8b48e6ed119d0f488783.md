The treatment of vestibular neuritis usually consists of acute symptomatic treatment with medications such as antiemetics (promethazine, metoclopramide), antihistamines (diphenhydramine, meclizine), and benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam). Following the acute phase, other therapies, such as vestibular rehabilitation, are often recommendations.

In the past, the use of corticosteroids has been a therapeutic option, but their efficacy remains controversial. This therapy was studied in a 2011 Cochrane review, which found insufficient evidence to recommend their use in those with acute vestibular dysfunction.

The viral etiology hypothesis has led to the theoretical benefit from antiviral medications; however, the use of valacyclovir either alone or combined with a glucocorticoid has not been shown to be effective.
