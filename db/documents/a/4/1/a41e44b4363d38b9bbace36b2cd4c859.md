The styloid process originates as a part of Reichert's cartilage, which forms from the second pharyngeal arch during embryological development

The styloid process undergoes endochondral ossification that begins at the final stages of pregnancy and is carried on over the first 8 years of life. However, the pattern of ossification and time to completely ossify has been shown to vary greatly.
