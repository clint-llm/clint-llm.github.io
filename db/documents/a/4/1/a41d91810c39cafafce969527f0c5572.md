Hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors of infancy that may involve either the skin or viscera, including the liver. Understanding these lesions has advanced rapidly in the last several years, resolving previous wide variability in nomenclature and description. This article will focus on two distinct types of hemangioma: infantile hemangioma (IH) including infantile hepatic hemangioma (IHH) and congenital hemangioma (CH). They are notable for their varying clinical course. IH grows rapidly after birth then involutes slowly; whereas, CH is fully formed at birth and then involutes in early infancy.
