Addison disease is a relatively rare condition, which can have devastating consequences if not promptly recognized and appropriately treated. Often the insidious nature of the disease results in a delay in diagnosis in patients who are not recognized until an acute adrenal crisis develops. Improving inter-professional team members' awareness of this condition will improve outcomes for patients who have Addison disease. This activity describes the etiology, epidemiology, presentation, evaluation, and treatment of Addison's disease. It highlights the importance of the inter-professional team in recognizing and managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of Addison disease.
- Review when Addison disease should be included in the differential diagnosis.
