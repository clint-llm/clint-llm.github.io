The mortality from distributive shock varies on the cause and can range from 20-80%. Early recognition is the key to improved survival. Higher mortality rates are linked to:

- Positive blood cultures

- Advanced age

- Elevated serum lactate or failure to clear lactate when labs are repeated

- Infection due to pseudomonas aeruginosa

- Alcohol use

- Immunocompromised state

- Poor functional status prior to the event
