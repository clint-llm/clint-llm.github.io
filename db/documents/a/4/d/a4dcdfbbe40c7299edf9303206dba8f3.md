As mentioned previously, there is a large MDT involved in the care of patients undergoing bariatric surgery. This MDT is comprised of but is not limited to; surgeons, junior doctors, anesthetists, obesity medicine specialists, family Doctors, endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, diabetologists, nutritionists, dieticians, nurses, and physiotherapists, each with their own specialist areas of care and responsibility.

Achieving the best patient and team outcomes demands collaborative, cohesive, and efficient work between members of the MDT. Bariatric surgery is influenced by the key pillars of medical ethics; beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and autonomy. At the center of the MDT is the patient, and their safety is always at the forefront of the care provided. An MDTÂ that utilizes their individual skills and communicates effectively whilst working under the guidance of these ethical principles will have enhanced outcomes.
