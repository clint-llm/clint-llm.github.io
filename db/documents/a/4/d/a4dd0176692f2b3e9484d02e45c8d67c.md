When the electroencephalogram is performed in an outpatient setting, clear instructions are provided to the patients prior to their EEG appointment. They are recommended not to use conditioners or other substances that might affect the quality of the recording (electrode impedance). The scalp is usually cleaned well to obtain proper recording with low impedance.
