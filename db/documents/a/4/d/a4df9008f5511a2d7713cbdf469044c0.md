From a surgical perspective, it is paramount to encourage and educate patients on the benefits and risks of surgery, including the possibility of an ileus. Prevention of ileus is the responsibility of both the patient and healthcare providers, including, nurses, pharmacologists, and physical/occupational therapists. Encouraging ambulation, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols, and educating the patient on their importance and benefits should improve patient understanding and compliance.
