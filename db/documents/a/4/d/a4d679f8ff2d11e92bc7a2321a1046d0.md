Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is an iatrogenic myopathy caused by chronic high to moderate systemic corticosteroid use. This is a common condition that must be differentiated from other iatrogenic and organic causes of myopathy. Diagnosis is based on a high degree of clinical suspicion in patients on chronic steroids; prompt initiation of treatment in the form of corticosteroid withdrawal, if possible, should be initiated to avoid the morbidity associated with the condition. This activity reviews the characteristics, evaluation, and management of corticosteroid-induced myopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the epidemiology of corticosteroid-induced myopathy.
- Explain the pathophysiology of corticosteroid-induced myopathy.
- Describe the evaluation of corticosteroid-induced myopathy.
- Identify opportunities for improving care coordination within the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by corticosteroid-induced myopathy.
