High suspicion for Wernicke’s encephalopathy is key to improving patient prognosis. Classically, the thinking was that once Korsakoff syndrome has set in, amnesia was generally irreversible. As noted above, more recent research has shown promise in memory rehabilitation including memory compensation techniques and error-less learning strategies.

Regarding neuroimaging, associations with cortical lesions have shown to correlate with a worse prognosis.
