The serum is the specimen of choice. Consider all plasma or serum specimens potentially positive for infectious agents, including HIV and the hepatitis B virus. All specimens should be handled with standard precautions and sent to the lab immediately for processing. Separated serum or plasma should not remain at +15 C to +30 C longer than 8 hours. If assays are not completed within 8 hours, serum or plasma should be stored at +2 C to +8 C. If assays are not completed within 48 hours, or the separated sample is to be stored beyond 48 hours, samples should be frozen at –15 C to –20 C. Frozen samples should be thawed only once. Analyte deterioration may occur in samples that are repeatedly frozen and thawed.
