The dorsal nerve of the penis is composed of multiple different collections of axons along the dorsal aspect of the erect penis. They traverse the dorsum of the penis deep to Buck's fascia and superior to the cavernous bodies.

The initial cluster consists of fibers parallel to the shaft of the penis that moves distally and ends at the glans of the penis. An additional group of fibers branches from the main body towards the lateral aspects of the penis.

The dorsal nerve bundles continue straight into the glans penis to form midline branches, and ventrolateral branches arise from the lateral bundles. The distal branches of the terminating nerves travel toward the meatus of the urethra.
