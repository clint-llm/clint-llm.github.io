The differential diagnosis for distal clavicular osteolysis includes AC joint arthritis, subacromial bursitis, superior labral (SLAP) tears, and other musculoskeletal causes of superior shoulder pain.

These additional causes are difficult to differentiate based solely on a physical exam, so imaging is often pursued based on most likely diagnoses. Non-musculoskeletal etiologies also warrant consideration, such as hyperparathyroidism, gout, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple myeloma, infection, and Gorham disease. Complete cervical spine and neurovascular evaluations are essential if referred pain is suspected.

Most comorbid medical conditions are ruled out through a good physical exam, given the younger demographic of DCO. Consider laboratory and imaging studies based on a patient's risk factors for specific medical illness, such as a family history of autoimmune disease or additional symptoms pointing towards a medical diagnosis.
