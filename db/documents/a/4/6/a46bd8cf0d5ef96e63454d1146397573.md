Sickle cell anemia is the most severe form of sickle cell disease and is the homozygous state for hemoglobin S. Sickle cell anemia is prevalent in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of India. It is common in geographical areas where malaria is widespread. Hemoglobin in most individuals is present in soluble form. However,Â in sickle cell disease, hemoglobin precipitates as insoluble crystals, leading to an abnormal shape and size of RBCs and subsequent phagocytosis of the affected corpuscles.
