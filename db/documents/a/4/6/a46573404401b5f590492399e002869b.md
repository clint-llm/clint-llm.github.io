Multiple myeloma is relatively uncommon and only represents about 1.8% of all new cancer cases diagnosed in the United States each year. It occurs predominantly in the geriatric population with a median age at diagnosis of about 70 years and is slightly more commonly seen in males than females (1.4:1). There seems to be an increased incidence in African American and black populations by as much as two-fold compared to Whites.
