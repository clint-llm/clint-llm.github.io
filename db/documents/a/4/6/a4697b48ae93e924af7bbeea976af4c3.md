Overall, a ureteral injury is rare. The most commonÂ cause is iatrogenic trauma during open surgery, laparoscopic, or endoscopic procedures. Penetrating trauma accounts for most non-iatrogenic ureteral injuries. Ureteral injuries are often subtle, and clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for them. An unrecognized or mismanaged ureteral injury can lead to significant complications, including urinoma, abscess, ureteral stricture, and potential loss of ipsilateral kidney or even death.
