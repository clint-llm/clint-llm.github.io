The EMS team requires a chain of command with known protocols in place. Briefing and debriefing allow for improvement from lessons learned from previous operations.Â Teams should be assessed physically and mentally prior to and after operations. The team is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain. Access to current data in resuscitation through ATLS, ACLS, BCLS, and PALS is necessary. Follow-on training for CBRN+ET is required and necessary. Annual training to keep skillsets sharpened must be addressed. Increased preparatory training will improve success while decreasing complications of operations.
