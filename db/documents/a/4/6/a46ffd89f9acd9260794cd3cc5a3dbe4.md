Dantrolene is available as an intravenous injection and an oral capsule. The choice of the method of administration is dependent on the intended use of the medication.**Treatment of malignant hyperthermia:**When symptoms of malignant hyperthermia present, 2.5 mg/kg dantrolene via intravenous push should be administered immediately. If the signs and symptoms of malignant hyperthermia persist, additional intravenous boluses of 1 to 2.5 mg/kg are indicated to a maximum cumulative dose of 10 mg/kg. Following the successful treatment of the initial reaction, 1 mg/kg of IV dantrolene should be provided every 6 hours for 24 hours since the last observed symptom of malignant hyperthermia to prevent a recurrence.

**Prophylaxis of malignant hyperthermia:**2.5 mg/kg intravenously over one minute, approximately 75 minutes before surgery. Repeat doses can be given during anesthesia and surgery in prolonged cases. Although this is an approved indication for using dantrolene, it is unnecessary if patients avoid triggering agents when they are susceptible to malignant hyperthermia. The recommended weight-based dose is the same for adults and children.**Chronic Muscle spasticity:**Generally, dosing is 100 mg orally three or four times daily. Start oral dantrolene at 25 mg daily for seven days is the initial dosing, and the dose should be titrated to the maximum individual effect. Doses are typically increased by 25 mg at a time and require monitoring for seven days before further advancement. The maximum dose is 400 mg/day. For children 5 years of age and older, the dose is 6 to 8 daily, divided into three or four doses; start at 0.5 mg/kg/dose orally each day for seven days and increase to 0.5 mg/kg/dose orally three times a day for seven days, then 1 mg/kg/dose three times daily for seven days, and then 2 mg/kg/dose orally three times daily. The maximum dose is 100 mg orally four times daily, but clinicians need to use the lowest effective dose.

It is important to note that multiple formulations exist for IV dantrolene. The classic preparation is a lyophilized powder in 20 mg vials that needs reconstitution in approximately 60 ml of sterile water before administration. These vials also contain 3 gm of mannitol each. Given the known difficulty in mixing the solution, it is essential to call for additional help to assist with the medication preparation as the provider continues to monitor and provide resuscitative measures. A new formulation is supplied in 250 mg vials and only requires 5ml of sterile water for reconstitution. Because of the hyper-concentration of this form of dantrolene, blood concentrations rise at a much faster rate, presumably leading to more rapid onset and effect.
