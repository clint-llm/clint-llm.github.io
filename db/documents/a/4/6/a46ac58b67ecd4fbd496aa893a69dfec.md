The effectiveness of BLT primarily stems from an in-tune palpatory sense on the part of the provider. Since this is developed through hands-on practice, it is important that as a provider, one continues to hone these skills through repetition, as this will result in the highest likelihood of correctly diagnosing and treating patients with this particular modality. Practitioners are encouraged to attend workshops and meetings where they can further develop not only their palpatory skills with BLT but also many other treatment modalities within osteopathic manipulative medicine. Proper application of this technique can be very beneficial to nearly all patients as it is a gentle and very tolerable approach for even the most vulnerable patient populations. Further research into the efficacy of BLT in the treatment of ligamentous somatic dysfunctions could shed light on novel uses for this effective modality in the field of osteopathic manipulative treatment.
