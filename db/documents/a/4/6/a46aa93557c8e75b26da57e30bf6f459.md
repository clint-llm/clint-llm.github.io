Patients often will not present with symptoms suggestive of a chronic inflammatory process. Many patients will not have had previous episodes of acute pancreatitis or had previous episodes which occurred months to years before. Symptoms are usually increasing abdominal girth with mild abdominal discomfort. Weight loss may also occur due to loss of appetite despite fluid retention in the abdomen. Patients with concurrent pancreatic effusion will complain of a cough, chest pain, and increased dyspnea on exertion. A physical exam will often reveal a large volume of ascites with little to no abdominal tenderness. In some patients, erythematous lesions may exist on the extremities as a result of metastatic fat necrosis.
