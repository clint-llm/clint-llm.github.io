Scarlet fever is a disease of childhood due to ease of transmission in the classrooms and nurseries. It is most commonly associated with bacterial pharyngitis caused by GAS or strep throat. Wounds and burns infected with GAS also can cause scarlet fever. It has been reported that strep throat is responsible for 15 to 30% of all pharyngitis in children aged 5 to 15 years old. In adults, the rate is 5 to 15%.  Non-school-aged children in contact with school-aged children in the same household are also at risk. There is no gender preference for scarlet fever.

Multiple studies have reported the emergence of scarlet fever coinciding with the initiation of the school year and the colder temperatures as winter approaches. A decrease in the rate of infection can be attributed to times when school is not in session during the spring and warming temperatures. The difference in rates between children and adults is likely due to the presence or absence of immunity. The prevalence is higher in undeveloped countries. This is probably due to the more likely presence of crowded living quarters. An article on the epidemiology of scarlet fever in Hong Kong reported an increase in the incidence of disease from 3.3/10,000 to 18.1/10,000. Similar increases have been reported in Great Britain. The increase has not been explained, but resistant strains of GAS are suspected.
