There are no contraindications for parotidectomy as long as the patient is medically fit for general anesthesia. While there are reports of this procedure being performed under local anesthesia, this is very unusual and not routinely recommended. In certain cases, intubation might be challenging, for example, a tumor extending to the deep lobe/the parapharyngeal space or an extensive lesion invading the temporomandibular joint leading to trismus. In such situations, awake nasal fiberoptic intubation or a tracheostomy is necessary to secure the airway.

In certain conditions, parotidectomy might not be the optimal management. While most neoplasms are managed surgically, not all parotid masses are truly neoplastic. A patient with HIV and parotid swelling is more like to have intraparotid lymphoepithelial cysts and should have a detailed imaging and/or cytologic workup. Surgery is a last resort for this entity given the bilateral and progressive nature of the disease, and the higher risk of facial nerve injury. A more appropriate option in this scenario will be one of the following: observation, repeat aspiration, antiretroviral medication, sclerosing therapy, or radiation therapy.
