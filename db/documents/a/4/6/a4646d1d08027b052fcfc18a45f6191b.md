The majority of the hypothalamic dysfunction syndromes affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Hypothalamic releasing hormones produced at the hypothalamus descend the tuberoinfundibular tract and are transported through the hypophyseal portal system to the adenohypophysis. The adenohypophysis produces specific hormones that are released into the systemic circulation for their effect on the target organs. Many disorders produce hypothalamic hyposecretion, which will cause pituitary hyposecretion. When a hypothalamic inhibitory hormone is altered, then pituitary hypersecretion will occur with its clinical manifestations.

Neurosecretory hypothalamic hormones are produced and packed in the magnocellular cells of the hypothalamus, whose axons project to the neurohypophysis transporting the hormones. The neurohypophysis stores them in the herring bodies, and when needed, they are released into the neurohypophyseal capillaries, which then carry the hormones into the systemic circulation. Disorders affecting the hypothalamus will affect two neurohormones, vasopressin and oxytocin. These hormones will affect the reabsorption of water by the distal tubules of the kidney, the uterine contractions during labor, milk ejection reflex, and sexual response.
