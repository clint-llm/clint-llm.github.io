Clindamycin is contraindicated in patients with a history of pseudomembranous colitis or ulcerative colitis. Care is also necessary for antibiotic use as bacterial and fungal superinfections may occur. It is also contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to clindamycin, lincomycin, or any of their components. Special care must also be taken in patients with atopic dermatitis as colonization is more prevalent in this patient population. The pathogenicity of skin infections is higher in this population; this is important for future infections as antibiotic resistance is a problematic complication.
