Prognosis, as with most malignancies, is primarily determined by the clinical stage of the disease. Epithelioid sarcoma prognosis is most closely associated with tumor size, vascular invasion, resectability, and metastases.

Gender, age of diagnosis, site, tumor size, and microscopic findings affect prognosis. Female patients have better outcomes. Distal lesions have been shown to have better outcomes compared to proximal. Presentation at an earlier age has better outcomes. Tumors more than 2 cm in diameter have been correlated with worse outcomes, as do tumors with necrosis and vascular invasion. Mitotic index is a prognostic factor.
