The triceps' primary function is extending the forearm at the elbow joint, which opposes the action of the flexors such as the biceps brachii. At rest, with the arm slightly bent with flexion, the biceps brachii overpowers the triceps brachii. Along with extending the forearm at the elbow joint, the triceps can also stabilize the elbow joint when the forearm and hand are doing fine movements such as writing.

The triceps brachii is located in the dorsal compartment of the arm. The lateral intermuscular septum separates the dorsal part of the arm from the ventral aspect, which is where the flexors of the arm are (biceps, brachialis, and brachioradialis).

**Long head**—The origin of the long head is the infra-glenoid tubercle of the scapula. Because it attaches to the scapula, the long head not only extends the elbow but will also have a small action on the glenohumeral or shoulder joint. With the arm adducted, the triceps muscle acts to hold the head of the humerus in the glenoid cavity. This action helps prevent any displacement of the humerus. The long head also assists with the extension and adduction of the arm at the shoulder joint. The lateral head is also active during the forearm extension at the elbow joint when the forearm is supinated or pronated.

**Medial head**—The origin of the medial head is at the dorsal humerus, inferior to the radial groove and connecting to the intermuscular septum. The medial head does not attach to the scapula and therefore has no action on the glenohumeral joint, whether with stabilization or movement. However, the medial head is active during the forearm extension at the elbow joint when the forearm is supinated or pronated.

**Lateral head**—The lateral head originates at the dorsal humerus as well, but unlike the medial head, it is superior to the radial groove, where it fuses to the lateral intermuscular septum. This head is considered to be the strongest head of the three. It is active during the extension of the forearm at the elbow joint when the forearm is supinated or pronated.
