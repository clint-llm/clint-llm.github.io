Treatment depends on the underlying etiology. For an overuse enthesopathy, the mainstay of treatment is ice, rest, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 7-10 days.

Skilled physical therapy has been shown to improve pain, increase function, and increase active range of motion in a broad range of pathologies, which include shoulder, hip, elbow, and Achilles enthesopathy.

Although routinely used in clinical practice, glucocorticoid injections are somewhat controversial. There is no clear evidence to support their use.

Topical nitrates are theorized to increase neovascularization, fibroblast activity, and promote collagen synthesis. Studies show promising results with topical glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) as being a good adjunct therapy for chronic tendinopathies such as wrist extensors, Achilles, patellar tendon, and rotator cuff. GTN comes in a patch form with dosages ranging from .72mg/day â€“ 5mg/day for tendinopathies.

PRP is proposed to have its effect via directly introducing a concentrate of growth factors, as well as establishing a rich microenvironment that recruits additional cells and growth factors to promote healing. Although still being researched, promising studies have shown that PRP may help in multiple enthesopathies such as gluteal tendinopathy and elbow tendinopathies.

For calcific enthesopathies, a technique called barbotage can be used. Under direct visualization via ultrasound or fluoroscopy, a calcific lesion is repeatedly injected and aspirated, typically with saline. This has been shown to be effective in lateral epicondylopathy and rotator cuff calcific tendonitis.

Enthesopathies caused by diffuse inflammatory diseases can be treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine. Additionally, biologics such as rituximab, etanercept, and infliximab may be used to specifically act on inflammatory markers to help reduce the overall burden of disease.
