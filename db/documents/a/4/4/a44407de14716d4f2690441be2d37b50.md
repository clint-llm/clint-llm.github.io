Stress fractures occur when bone, typically in the lower extremities, is subjected to repeated mechanical stress that results in microscopic fractures. They often occur when the frequency or degree of physical activity is significantly increased; therefore, stress fractures are commonly seen among military recruits, athletes, and runners. Stress fractures can be classified as fatigue reaction stress fractures or insufficiency reaction stress fractures. Fatigue reaction stress fractures result from repetitive and excessive strain placed on structurally normal bone, specifically loading, exceeding the process of remodeling. Whereas insufficiency reaction stress fracture occurs when normal stress and straining are applied to a bone where bone formation is impaired. This activity describes the pathophysiology of stress fractures and emphasizes the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of stress-related bone injuries.
- Describe the morbidity of stress fractures.
- Summarize the treatment of stress fractures.
- Explain the details of a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by stress fractures.
