The organ system manifestations of Hashimoto thyroiditis are varied due to the nature of the disease. Initially, patients may have bouts of hyperthyroid symptoms, as the initial destruction of thyroid cells may lead to the increased release of thyroid hormone into the bloodstream. Eventually, when enough destruction has been caused by the antibody response, patients exhibit symptoms of hypothyroidism. These symptoms are insidious and variable and may affect almost any organ system in the body.

The classic skin characteristic associated with hypothyroidism is myxedema, which refers to the edema-like skin condition caused by increased glycosaminoglycan deposition. This, however, is uncommon and only occurs in severe cases. Skin can be scaly and dry, especially on the extensor surfaces, palms, and soles. Histologic examination reveals epidermal thinning. Increased dermal mucopolysaccharides cause water retention and, in turn, pale-colored skin.

The rate of hair growth slows, and hair can be dry, coarse, dull, and brittle. Diffuse or partial alopecia is not uncommon.

Decreased thyroid function can increase peripheral vascular resistance by as much as 50% to 60% and reduce cardiac output by as much as 30% to 50%. Bradycardia may result from a loss of chronotropic action of thyroid hormone directly on the sinoatrial cells. However, most patients have a few symptoms directly attributable to the cardiovascular system.

Fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and exercise intolerance are likely associated with a combination of limited pulmonary and cardiac reserve in addition to decreased muscle strength or increased muscle fatigue. Hypothyroid rats have been shown to have decreased endurance. Biochemical changes in this population have shown decreased muscle oxidation of pyruvate and palmitate, increased utilization of glycogen stores, and diminished fatty acid mobilization. Muscle weakness and myopathy are important features.

The presentation may also be subclinical. Early symptoms may include constipation, fatigue, dry skin, and weight gain. More advanced symptoms may include: cold intolerance, decreased sweating, nerve deafness, peripheral neuropathy, decreased energy, depression, dementia, memory loss, muscle cramps, joint pain, hair loss, apnea, menorrhagia, and pressure symptoms in the neck from goiter enlargement such as voice hoarseness.

Physical findings may include:

- Cold and dry skin

- Facial edema particularly periorbital, as well as nonpitting edema involving the hands and feet

- Brittle nails

- Bradycardia

- The delayed relaxation phase of tendon reflexes

- Elevated blood pressure

- Slow speech

- Ataxia

- Macroglossia

Furthermore, patients can have an accumulation of fluid in the pleural and pericardial cavities rarely. Myxoedema coma is the most severe clinical presentation and has to be managed as an endocrine emergency within patient care.
