Alfentanil is contraindicated in patients who have a history of hypersensitivity to alfentanil (e.g., anaphylaxis) or any component of the formulation. It is also contraindicated in those who have shown hypersensitivity to other similar opioid-class medications.

There has been evidence that alfentanil can increase the risk of seizures in those with a history of seizures and can increase the duration of seizures. In such patients, electroencephalogram monitoring may be necessary if another analgesic is unable to be used, but a history of seizures is not necessarily a contraindication to alfentanil.

Outside of the United States, specifically in Canada, contraindications to alfentanil include suspected abdomen surgery, mild pain that is manageable with other pain medications, acute/severe bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive airway, acute respiratory depression, status asthmaticus, hypercapnia, cor pulmonale, acute alcoholism, convulsive disorders, delirium tremens, severe CNS depression, increased intracranial or cerebrospinal pressure and head injury, or using monoamine-oxidase inhibitors, e.g., phenelzine concurrently or within 14 days of use, as well as women or who are nursing or pregnant, and during labor/delivery.
