The following are etiologies that may contribute to preterm labor: stress, infection, placental abruption, placenta previa, substance use, history of preterm birth or abortion, inadequate prenatal care, smoking, maternal age <18 or >40, poor nutrition, low body mass index, fetal anomaly, fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios, polyhydramnios, vaginal bleeding, premature preterm rupture of membranes (PPROM), and environmental factors. This list is not comprehensive, and various other factors contribute to preterm labor. However, it encompasses the most common reasons patients present in clinical settings.

It is important to familiarize oneself with PPROM as it affects about 3% of all pregnancies in the United States. Membrane rupture can be physiologic or pathologic. The intra-amniotic infection has been most commonly associated with PPROM, especially at earlier gestational ages. Other causes contributing to PPROM include short cervical length, second and third trimester bleeding, low BMI, low socioeconomic status, cigarettes, and illicit drug use. Typically, about half of mothers with PPROM deliver within a week of ROM.

The main concern with PPROM is prematurity. The most common complication of preterm birth is respiratory distress. However, one must consider sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis. PPROM with intrauterine inflammation can lead to neurodevelopmental impairment, and early gestational age at membrane rupture has an association with an increased risk of neonatal white matter damage. Infection and umbilical cord accidents contribute to 1-2% risk of antenatal fetal demise after preterm PROM.
