Patients usually present with fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Diarrhea can be bloody in severe cases. Patients may also have abdominal distension and paralytic ileus. In patients with severe neutropenia, fever sometimes is absent. The abdominal pain can be diffuse or localized, typically occurring in the right lower quadrant. A rigid abdomen may indicate bowel perforation. Also, mucositis can be visible in oral or anal mucosa, which would support the diagnosis of NEC.
