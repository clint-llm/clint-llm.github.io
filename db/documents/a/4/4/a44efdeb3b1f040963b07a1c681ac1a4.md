To help prevent getting an electrical burn at home, the following precautions should be taken:

- Put child-safety covers on all electrical outlets.

- Keep electrical cords out of the reach of children.

- Follow the directions when using electrical appliances.

- Avoid using electrical appliances in the shower or bath.

- Turn off the circuit breaker when you are working with electricity.

Prior to discharge, patients should be educated on potential sources of household and workplace exposures and risks, in addition to any potential long-term effects of their electrical injuries (e.g., neurological, psychological, or physical), and scheduled follow-up as needed.
