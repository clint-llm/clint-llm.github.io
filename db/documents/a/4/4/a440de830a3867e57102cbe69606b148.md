Specimen requirements vary between the various commercially-available osmometers and are included in the respective machine's instruction manual and laboratory protocols for specimen preparation. Acceptable specimens, in general, include serum, heparinized plasma, tears, sweat, and urine.

The stability of different samples varies, though some general guidelines are as follows:

- Unspun serum/plasma (room temperature or refrigerated at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius): 3 hours

- Separated serum/plasma (room temperature or refrigerated at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius): 48 hours

- Urine (room temperature): 24 hours

- Urine (refrigerated or frozen): 7 days

The general procedure for osmometry starts with using a properly calibrated osmometer. A full calibration of osmometers is required at least every six months. It may also be necessary following a part replacement or service of the instrument or if the quality control (QC) reading is repeatedly out of range. For quality control, it is required that the laboratories run two controls at two different concentrations daily or with each batch of samples. Acceptable controls are generally within +/- 2 standard deviations from the mean. The institution's quality control policy and protocol and the instrument user manual should be followed to ensure accurate sample analysis.
