Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is the gold standard in detecting Lambl excrescences, however, due to advancement in ultrasound technology the sensitivity of TTE has also increased significantly. Alternatively, when TEE is not feasible, a high-resolution CT scan can be done. TEE detects these valvular growths and also determines its attachment to the valves, its location in relation to other cardiac structures, and its mobility. Although an echocardiogram provides vivid details about the radiological morphology, a definitive diagnosis is still done through microscopic histopathological evaluation of the valvular strands when possible.

Echocardiographically, Lambl excrescences appear as thin, hypermobile, filiform strands on the valvular cuspsâ€™ line of closure. In the short-axis view, linear strands can be seen projecting from the ventricular aspect of the aortic valve cusp tips. In the long-axis view, these are seen in rows on all three aortic valve leaflets.
