In addition to the benign lesions above, other etiologies can present as lacrimal gland fossa lesions. Two major categories for these other causes are inflammatory lesions and malignant tumors. Altogether, inflammatory lesions make up the most common cause of lacrimal gland enlargement.

**Inflammatory Lesions**

- idiopathic orbital inflammation (IOI) (also known as orbital pseudotumor) and nonspecific orbital inflammation (NSOI)

- IgG-4 related disease

- sarcoidosis

- granulomatosis with polyangiitis

- dacryoadenitis

- Sjogren syndrome

- thyroid eye disease (TED)

**Malignant Tumors**

- adenoid cystic carcinoma

- lymphoma

- ductal adenocarcinoma

- metastasis

**Lesions Found Near the Superolateral Orbit Often Confused for Lacrimal Gland Tumors**

- Epidermoid or dermoid cyst, commonly found at the frontozygomatic suture and may have an intraorbital component

- Prolapsed orbital fat, causing fullness of the lateral upper lid or a mass in the superotemporal fornix

- Dermatolipoma, commonly seen under the superotemporal conjunctiva

- The prolapsed lacrimal gland, giving the appearance that it has been displaced by a mass

Lacrimal gland enlargement can also be seen in amyloidosis. Though rare, amyloid deposition in orbit, including the lacrimal gland, is usually due to a localized disease process rather than associated with systemic amyloidosis.
