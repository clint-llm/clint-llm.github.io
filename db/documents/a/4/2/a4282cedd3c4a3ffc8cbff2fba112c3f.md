Fuchs uveitis syndrome is a unique pathology with many theorized pathophysiological mechanisms. It is a chronic anterior uveitis that is primarily unilateral but can be bilateral. FUS is associated with the presence of oligoclonal rubella antibodies in the aqueous humor. Even though the etiology is unclear, the prognosis in patients diagnosed with the pathology is good when secondary complications of cataract and glaucoma are treated. Management of FUS primarily consists of managing secondary complications of cataracts and glaucoma that occur during the disease. Physicians should be able to diagnose patients with this pathology through history and physical examination. FUS may be misdiagnosed due to its similarity to other inflammatory conditions or uveitides.
