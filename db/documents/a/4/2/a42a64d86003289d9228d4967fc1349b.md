The interprofessional approach is mandatory in the management of patients. Germinoma is a rare pediatric CNS tumor, but it is highly curable. Recent advances in the treatment modalities have shifted the level of care from increasing survival to improving quality of life. Longterm management is critical involving multidisciplinary teamwork requiring oncologists, pediatricians, neurosurgeons, endocrinologists, radiologists, pathologists, and nursing professionals. Patients may require lifelong hormonal therapy. Psychosocial support is also an essential component for a better outcome.
