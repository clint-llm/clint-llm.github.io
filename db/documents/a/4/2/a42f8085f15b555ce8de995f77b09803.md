Vaccines and prophylactic antibiotics are used as preventive measures against serious complications. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely suggested for all patients with FH, and local microorganism resistance should be taken into consideration. However, it is suggested that patients be on lifelong penicillin V 500 mg twice daily or amoxicillin 500 mg once daily. Erythromycin 250 mg twice a day should be used in penicillin-allergic patients. Antimalarials should be given to patients traveling to malaria-endemic areas. Asplenic patients should also receive the pneumococcal vaccine, the H. influenza type-B conjugate vaccine as well as the meningococcal C-conjugate vaccine. Annual influenza immunization should also be provided.

Studies have shown a significant reduction in the percentage of serious infection in patients after immunization with pneumococcal vaccines. The commonly used pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine requires the presence of IgM memory B cells and is therefore ineffective in asplenic subjects. In functionally asplenic patients, the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is more effective, because it employs a T-cell-dependent mechanism, and should be the preferred vaccine in these situations. Vaccines are thought to be better when the spleen is intact. Hence, the vaccine should be given 2 weeks prior to surgery in patients undergoing splenectomy.
