There is no effective therapy for Jessner lymphocytic infiltration of the skin (JLIS). Current treatment involves mainly topical steroids such as hydrocortisone, triamcinolone, betamethasone, and prednisone, or antimalarials like hydroxychloroquine.

First-line therapy is topical and intralesional steroids. In cases in which photosensitivity is relevant, antimalarials are more effective.

Cosmetic camouflage, photoprotection, and excision of small lesions can eliminate or mask the appearance of the disease.  Other less common treatment options include laser therapy, photodynamic therapy, and cryotherapy.
