The prognosis for migratory thrombophlebitis depends on the cause. For malignancies, the prognosis is poor. For benign disorders, the prognosis is good, but residual post-phlebitic syndrome is an issue. Patients will require compression stockings for life to prevent the postphlebitic syndrome. Those who have a blood clot will need anticoagulation therapy for 3 to 9 months.Â  For those who do not seek treatment, pulmonary embolism can prove to be fatal.
