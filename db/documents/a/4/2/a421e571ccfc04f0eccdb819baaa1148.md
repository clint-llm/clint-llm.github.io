Idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage is a rare condition that affects the lower respiratory tract. It can be divided into two clinical entities depending on whether the pathophysiology and presentation are acute or chronic. Acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage usually presents as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), while the more insidious or chronic pulmonary hemorrhage often presents as idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) following repeated alveolar bleeding. The terms idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage, idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage are often used interchangeably.

Historically, idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage was first described by Virchow in 1864 as "brown lung induration." Ceelen in 1931 gave a more detailed description of the condition after autopsies revealed large amounts of hemosiderin in 2 children, while Waldenstrom, in 1944, made the first antemortem diagnosis.

Pulmonary hemorrhage is the extravasation of blood into the alveoli, that is, bleeding into the lower respiratory tract. It can be severe and life-threatening.

The clinical spectrum of IPH ranges from asymptomatic cases to life-threatening acute respiratory failure.
