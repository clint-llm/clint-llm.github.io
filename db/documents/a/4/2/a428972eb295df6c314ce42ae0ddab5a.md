This article is an analysis of the fundamental biochemistry involved in the coagulation cascade, specifically clotting factors and their biochemical interactions and roles among cell membranes, platelets, as proteases, and as cofactors. Other components involved in the process of clot formation will be referenced, but the focus will be on clotting factors. The coagulation cascade is a well-studied and pertinent topic that is crucial for health professionals to understand. Although this article does not cover the coagulation cascade and its role in hemostasis as a simple chain of events, a brief overview will be included. A thorough examination of these biochemical interactions will illuminate the underlying intricacies of the coagulation cascade that enable a cohesive process to function seamlessly.
