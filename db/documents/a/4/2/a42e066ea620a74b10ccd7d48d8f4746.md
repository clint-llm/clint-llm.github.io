There is little doubt that educating farmers, herders, and any other at-risk occupation on proper glove-wearing and hand-washing techniques are essential. Seminars for recognizing/diagnosing infected livestock and proper vaccination protocol / inducting herd immunity is also a great starting point.

However, many skeptical populaces would bring fair resistance to any money and or effort at all allocated to preventing a self-limited infection that holds minimal morbidity for the large majority of affected individuals, and few would be so inclined to disagree.

Genuine deterrence is in funding and development towards research and understanding the zoonotic viral host-switch phenomenon, their virulence, and transmissibility. The sheer danger posed, of which our current comprehension of is so grossly inadequate, is simply terrifying.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has no doubt served as a rude awakening to this fact. Orfviridae shares extensive genetic similarity to the now extinct smallpox, a virus claimed to have taken more lives than every infectious etiology put together; what little genetic drift or shift it would take fill that haunting niche left by variola is a true uncertainty.
