Often the etiology of a patient's kidney stone is unknown. Unless a patient passes a stone, is able to retrieve the stone, and sends it for analysis, the components of the stone usually remain unknown. In the past, there have been many theories as to what increases a patient's risk to form a stone. It used to be thought that dietary calcium contributed to the formation of renal calculi; however,  studies now prove this to be untrue.

Studies show the relative risk is lower with higher dietary calcium intake compared to lower dietary calcium intake. Another etiology of renal calculi in a minority of patients have inherited forms such as cystine based stones.
