The management of hypokalemiamultidiciplinary because it can happen to any patient on any medical floor or even outpatients.  The overarching goals of therapy for hypokalemia are to prevent or treat life-threatening complications, replace the potassium deficit, and to diagnose and correct the underlying cause. Therapeutic urgency depends on the severity of hypokalemia, the existence of comorbid conditions and the rate of decline of serum potassium levels. Elucidating the cause of hypokalemia and understanding whether it is secondary to transcellular shifts or a potassium deficit is also essential. Regardless, potassium replacement is indicated in most cases of hypokalemia, especially in those related to renal or GI losses. The presence of concomitant hypomagnesemia should also be investigated and corrected if present. In the presence of hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia can be refractory to potassium replacement alone. The majority of patients who are treated for hypokalemia have a good outcome but those who remain untreated are at a risk for arrhythmias which may be fatal.
