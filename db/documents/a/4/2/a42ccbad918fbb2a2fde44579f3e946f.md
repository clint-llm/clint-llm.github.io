Appendicitis is inflammation of the vermiform appendix. This is a small, finger-like, hollow organ located at the tip of the cecum portion of the large intestines, usually in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. However, it can be located in almost any area of the abdomen, depending on if there were any abnormal developmental issues or if there are any other concomitant conditions such as pregnancy or prior surgeries.  Because the appendix has a small lumen, it is prone to obstruction by fecalith (which is a stone-like substance made from hardened feces) and can subsequently become inflamed and then infected. Appendicitis is one of the most common causes of acute abdominal surgery and typically occurs between ages 5 and 45, but can occur at any age, with men having a slightly higher risk. Appendicitis is most often a disease of acute presentation, usually within 24 hours, but it can also present as a more chronic condition. If there has been a perforation with a contained abscess, then the presenting symptoms can have a slower and less painful onset. The exact function of the appendix has been a debated topic. Today it is accepted that this organ may have an immunoprotective function and acts as a lymphoid organ, especially in the younger person. Other theories contend that the appendix acts as a storage vessel for "good" colonic bacteria. Still, others argue that it is a mear developmental remnant and has no real function.
