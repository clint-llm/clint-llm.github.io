Airway patency and adequate respiratory effort are both essential for normal oxygenation and ventilation within the body so that normal physiological processes can proceed without metabolic derangement. This is even more important in patients with acute illness or injury, giving rise to increased metabolic demand. Accordingly, safe and effective airway management is a core skill for clinicians involved in prehospital emergency medical services (EMS).

The variable and hazardous nature of the prehospital environment introduces a number of unique complexities that are not seen in hospital-based emergency care, such as poor patient positioning, limited backup, a restricted choice of equipment, and low ambient light. These may result in a patient’s airway being “situationally difficult” to manage, obliging the EMS clinician to use modified techniques and decision-making processes. This article focuses on some specific examples of technical and non-technical challenges that may be encountered and presents general principles for prehospital management of the airway under adverse conditions.
