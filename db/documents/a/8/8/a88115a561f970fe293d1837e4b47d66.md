Piriformis syndrome occurs due to sciatic nerve entrapment at the level of the ischial tuberosity. While there are multiple factors that may contribute to piriformis syndrome, the clinical presentation is fairly consistent. Patients often report pain in the gluteal region that is characterized as shooting, burning, or aching down the back of the leg. In addition, numbness in the buttocks and tingling sensations along the distribution of the sciatic nerve is not uncommon.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the differential diagnosis of gluteal pain that radiates down the back of the leg. 
- Review the evaluation of piriformis syndrome.
- Describe how to manage a patient with piriformis syndrome.
- Summarize how an optimally functioning interprofessional team would coordinate care to enhance outcomes for patients with piriformis syndrome.
