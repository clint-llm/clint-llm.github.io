The evolution of electrocardiograms from a string galvanometer to the modern-day advanced computerized machine has led to its use as a diagnostic and screening tool, making it the gold standard for diagnosing various cardiac diseases.

Owing to its widespread use in the field of medicine, the ECG has several indications listed below:

- Symptoms are the foremost indication of the ECG, including palpitation, dizziness, cyanosis, chest pain, syncope, seizure, and poisoning

- Symptoms or signs associated with heart disease include tachycardia, bradycardia, and clinical conditions including hypothermia, murmur, shock, hypotension, and hypertension

- To detect myocardial injury, ischemia, and the presence of prior infarction

- Rheumatic heart disease

- ECG changes in cases like drowning and electrocution are very valuable in determining necessary interventions

- Detecting pacemaker or defibrillator device malfunction, evaluating their programming and function, verifying the analysis of arrhythmias, and monitoring for delivery of the appropriate electrical pacing in patients with defibrillators and pacemakers

- Evaluation of metabolic disorders

- Helpful for the assessment of blunt cardiac trauma

- Cardiopulmonary resuscitation

- Valuable aid in the study and differential diagnosis of congenital heart diseases

- Electrolyte imbalance and rhythm disorders

- To monitor the pharmacotherapeutic effects and adverse effects of drug therapy

- Perioperative anesthesia monitoring, such as preoperative assessment and intraoperative and postoperative monitoring

- Screening tool in a sports physical exam to rule outÂ cardiomyopathy
