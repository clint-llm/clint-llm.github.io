Research done on mice and rats shows that vestibular afferents and central neurons have some functionality very early in life. This research suggests that neural network connections between vestibular afferents, central neurons, oculomotor neurons, and extraocular eye muscles are initiated and set up to some extent by birth. Much of this maturation process was shown to be dependent on the growth of the animal and its vestibular organs. Although the development and maturation of the VOR did not seem to be influenced by the presence or absence of visual inputs initially, this was noted to be crucial for the fine-tuning and enhancement of the VOR.
