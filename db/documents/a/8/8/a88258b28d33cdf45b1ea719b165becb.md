Key Learning Points:

- The frontalis muscle is actually part of the occipitofrontalis muscle, which is two muscle bellies connected by the galea aponeurotic.

- Part of the venous drainage from the forehead enters the cavernous sinus.

- The frontalis muscle is responsible for elevating the eyebrows, while the corrugator supercilii, orbicularis oculi, and procerus play a role in its depression.

- The function of the forehead is often spared in middle cerebral artery strokes.

- To avoid injury to the sensory and motor nerves to the frontalis muscle, dissection planes should be subcutaneous, subperiosteal or subgaleal.

- The medial branches of the supraorbital nerve are superficial, and the lateral branches are deep.

- The variations in the horizontal extent of the frontalis muscle must be appreciated as these variations may have a bearing on the extent of brow ptosis.

- The surface and applied anatomy of the forehead and the extent of the frontalis muscle must be appreciated when performing surgery in this region or injecting toxins. (**Fig 5)**
