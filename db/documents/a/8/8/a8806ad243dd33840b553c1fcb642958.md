The best labor management requires a coordinated interprofessional effort between trained obstetric nurses, midwives, and physician providers. Labor is a dynamic process and the decision of the care team may change depending on the maternal and fetal factors. Since there is always a gray zone in treatment options, it is mandatory to include the patients in their treatment planning. Psychological and emotional support should also be provided, as these women with labor abnormalities are more likely to be diagnosed with post-partum blues. Team management may lower the average cesarean section rates and improve outcomesÂ of labor overall. [Level V]
