Signs and symptoms of neonatal sepsis can range from nonspecific or vague symptoms to hemodynamic collapse. Early symptoms may include irritability, lethargy, or poor feeding. Others may quickly develop respiratory distress, fever, hypothermia or hypotension with poor perfusion and shock. Sometimes the diagnosis may only be suspected on the basis of laboratory findings, which may reveal hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, acidosis, or hyperbilirubinemia. A high index of suspicion is, therefore, necessary for timely diagnosis. Therefore, physicians must be aware of any factors that may increase an infant’s risk of developing sepsis.  Prematurity and very low birth weights are also important risk factors to consider. Maternal factors that put neonates at risk of early-onset sepsis include GBS status, the presence of chorioamnionitis, infant prematurity, or prolonged rupture of membranes
