The exact cause of analgesic/NSAID-induced nephropathy has not been clearly established. Still, the evidence from different case studies and randomized controlled trials appear to associate it with hypotensive effects induced by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins have vasodilatory effects, improving renal blood flow. Inhibition of this pathway may have a direct cause in analgesia-induced nephropathy. Inhibition of prostaglandin can lead to a high metabolite concentration in the medullary region, causing papillary necrosis, chronic interstitial nephritis, and chronic tubular interstitial nephritis.

Histological evidence of papillary necrosis is a feature in practically all cases of analgesic-induced nephropathy.
