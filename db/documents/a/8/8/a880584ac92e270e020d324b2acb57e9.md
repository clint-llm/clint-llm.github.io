Each phenotype of retinal dystrophy is often confused with other genetic or acquired disorders. Misdiagnosis is common and must be avoided as it has a great bearing on genetic and prognostic counseling. Acquired causes can be treated in many cases; therefore timely diagnosis is a must.

Retinitis pigmentosa must be differentiated from other acquired conditions causing retinal pigmentation such as rubella retinopathy, syphilis, autoimmune paraneoplastic retinopathy, and drug toxicities. Quinine overdose can cause sudden loss of vision and manifest with optic disc pallor and vessel attenuation. It can be misdiagnosed as the sine pigmento stage of RP. ERG in quinine overdose has a negative configuration, affecting b wave more than a wave.

Advanced cases of choroideremia, Stargardt macular dystrophy, cone-rod dystrophy are usually misdiagnosed as retinitis pigmentosa. Retinitis punctata albescens and fundus albipunctatus have overlapping fundus images. Patients with fundus albipunctatus are usually asymptomatic and fundus findings are incidental. Rarely they may complain of night blindness early in childhood without progression.Â Electrophysiological characteristics of most diseases can help narrow the diagnosis in case of phenotypically similar conditions.
