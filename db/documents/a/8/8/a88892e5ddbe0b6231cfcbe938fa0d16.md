According to the American College of Cardiology, beta-1 blockers should not be prescribed to patients with a recent or current history of fluid retention without concurrent diuretic use. Beta-1 blockers are contraindicated in patients with complete heart block and should be used with great caution in patients with second-degree heart block. Beta-1 blockers generally are contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe asthma and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Controversy exists over the safety of beta-1 blocker use in persons with mild to moderate asthma. Studies examining the efficacy of beta-1 blocker use in patients with concurrent mild to moderate asthma showed little to no adverse outcomes compared to those who did not have underlying asthma, but they generally are not used due to the potential risks.
