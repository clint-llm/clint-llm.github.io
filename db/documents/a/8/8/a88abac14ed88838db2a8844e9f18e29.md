The mainstay of primary carnitine deficiency involves lifelong treatment with a high dose of oral L-carnitine (100 to 200 mg/kg daily dose in 3 divided doses).

Maintenance therapy with L-carnitine can improve plasma levels, and the dose is titrated based on the plasma levels and also on the response.

Acute episodes of hypoglycemia in children with PCD are promptly treated with intravenous 10% dextrose and treatment of accompanying metabolic abnormalities (e.g., acid-base abnormalities), along with immediate carnitine supplementation.
