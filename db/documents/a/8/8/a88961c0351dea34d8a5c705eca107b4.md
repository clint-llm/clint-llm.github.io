Nasal polyps are classified into three groups: localized, diffuse, and systemic. Localized nasal polyps are typically reactive from either inflammatory processes or neoplastic processes. Diffuse nasal polyposis is often seen in patients with CRSwNP. CRSwNP has multiple etiologies. In the western hemisphere, nasal polyps are mostly the result of T-helper 2 (Th2) cell-driven eosinophilia, immunoglobulin-E (IgE) inflammation, with elevated interleukin-5 (IL-5), often associated with environmental and/or seasonal allergic triggers.  Patients with cystic fibrosis tend to have neutrophil-driven inflammation within their polyps, and can often have severe nasal polyposis without a distinct allergic trigger, though the clinical examination can be very similar. Cystic fibrosis should be in the differential of the young patient (pre-teen, teen, and young adults) with refractory nasal polyposis, particularly in patients of European ancestry. Prompt diagnosis is essential, as there are systemic and genetic/familial implications of a cystic fibrosis diagnosis. Additional proposed theories include a fungi-driven inflammatory process, as well as a massive inflammatory response triggered by exotoxins from Staphylococcus aureus infections. Finally, systemic nasal polyposis refers to patients suffering from systemic diseases with nasal manifestations. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome, and cystic fibrosis (CF) fall into this category.
