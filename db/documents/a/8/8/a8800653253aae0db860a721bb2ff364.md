**Nurses should assist the family by:**

- Acknowledging their feelings. Donâ€™t pretend you understand as the family will appreciate your honesty about how devastating their loss can be.

- Ask questions about their loved one or ask them to tell you a little about their loved one.

- Ask them how you can help and what they may need. Most of the time they will not know but this gives the family the option to open up to you.

- Ask if you can help them connect with those who will provide support.

- Ask if they want to speak with the clinicians and arrange for a time for the family to speak with them.

- Ask if they would like to speak to a pastor or social worker.

- Ask if they would like to be with the deceased and say their goodbyes and do your best to make this time comfortable.

- Ask if they would like thumbprints, handprints, or hair locks.

- Ask if they have any questions about arrangements with the funeral home.

- Ask if they have any other questions.

Acknowledge that you may not know what to say. Families understand that you can't fix the situation. Give the family as much attention as they need but provide private time if needed. Remember to give them additional contacts after they have left the hospital as many are overwhelmed and may not have questions for several hours to days later. Don't be judgemental, remember that different religions and families have a variety of views on death and they may be very different from your own personal views.
