Complications that may arise during a thymectomy include:

- Bleeding and damage to surrounding structures. Bleeding can be from small thymic veins or larger vessels such as the innominate vein. Injury to Keynes's great vein, the largest thymic vein originating from the left brachiocephalic vein, can cause massive bleeding. This may require conversion from minimally-invasive to an open median sternotomy approach.

- Pneumothorax or persistent air leak may be appreciated during the postoperative period, requiring prolonged tube thoracostomy.

- Chylothorax is another complication that can arise due to damage to underlying lymphatic tissue, especially along the thymus' poles.

- Thymectomy may not completely resolve the patientâ€™s symptoms, or a thymoma recurrence could occur if incomplete resection is performed.

- Pericardial injury, injury to the heart, or the phrenic nerve.

- The phrenic nerves are also closely invested with the thymus and can be injured during dissection. This could lead to dysfunction of the diaphragm postoperatively.

- Incomplete thymectomy for myasthenia gravis.
