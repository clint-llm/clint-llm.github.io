The process of biochemical synthesis of a peptide from its primary amino acid primary structure to a final protein structure is a fundamental biological process. This section will provide an overview of the mechanisms involved in synthesizing a peptide sequence and highlight key cellular locations and specific enzymes.

Biologically active peptides, including neurotransmitters and hormones and, are created from and RNA template, transcribed from DNA.

The steps of translation subdivide into initiation, elongation, and termination.

With expansion and addition of additional amino acids, a polypeptide is then created and destined to become the major macromolecule constituent of cells, protein. Post-translationally modification of peptides such as methylation, phosphorylation, acetylation can also alter the rates of peptide synthesis.

As a growing peptide forms, it is then cleaved from its signal sequence, forming a large preprohormone, which is then cleaved further into a prohormone. As a prohormone, it is packaged into vesicles and sent to the Golgi apparatus for further processing and to be proteolytically cleaved into their final form. The final peptide is packaged into secretory vesicles and sent into the cytoplasm and then leave the cell via exocytosis when they receive a stimulus.

The established method in a laboratory setting for the production of the synthetic peptide is known as solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS).
