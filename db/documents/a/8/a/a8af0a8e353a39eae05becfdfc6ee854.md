The tongue is a muscular organ formed by a complex arrangement of intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. Generally, the intrinsic muscles change the shape of the tongue, and the extrinsic muscles are in charge of moving it in different directions.

The tongue is principally involved in digestion, taste perception, and speech but also plays an important role in breathing.
