Shoulder impingement syndrome is a painful condition of the upper extremity resulting from a structural narrowing of the subacromial space. It is primarily diagnosed by history and physical examination. The mainstay of treatment involves identification early before the onset of degenerative changes, physical therapy exercises to strengthen the shoulder girdle, and pharmacologic interventions to decrease inflammation. This activity describes the evaluation and management of shoulder impingement syndrome and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of shoulder impingement syndrome.
- Outline the evaluation of shoulder impingement syndrome.
- Review the management options available for shoulder impingement syndrome.
- Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the care patients with shoulder impingement syndrome and improve outcomes.
