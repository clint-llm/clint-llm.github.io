There are no symptoms that are specific to struvite stones. Patients commonly show general signs and symptoms of renal calculi like flank pain, dysuria, and hematuria, apart from urinary tract infections like fever and chills. Urinary pH will be persistently elevated (>7.2). Some patients can present with chronic pyelonephritis when an infected stone causes focal areas of renal parenchymal scarring.

Chronic flank pain and relapsing urinary tract infections (recurrent infections with the same organism) suggest the presence of a staghorn struvite stone. Patients may also be totally asymptomatic even when the stones involve the entire renal pelvis. Advanced cases in individuals with large struvite stones may demonstrate general symptoms such as fatigue, lethargy, malaise, intermittent fevers, loss of appetite, and weight loss.

Staghorn stones, even very large ones, do not typically cause the very severe type of renal colic that is commonly associated with classic acute ureteral obstruction from urinary calculi. This is because large staghorn stones may not cause acute urinary tract obstruction with ureteral and renal capsular stretching from dilation and hydronephrosis typical of most other symptomatic calculi.
