Tarsal tunnel syndrome is divided into intrinsic and extrinsic etiologies.

- Extrinsic causes include poorly fitting shoes, trauma, anatomic-biomechanical abnormalities (tarsal coalition, valgus or varus hindfoot), post-surgical scarring, systemic diseases, generalized lower extremity edema, systemic inflammatory arthropathies, diabetes, and post-surgical scarring.

- Intrinsic causes include tendinopathy, tenosynovitis, perineural fibrosis, osteophytes, hypertrophic retinaculum, and space-occupying or mass effect lesions (enlarged or varicose veins, ganglion cyst, lipoma, neoplasm, and neuroma). Arterial insufficiency can lead to nerve ischemia.

The mechanism of impingement can be identified in approximately 80% of cases.
