It is essential to understand the significance of the epigastric arteries. Preservation of the artery while performing common laparoscopic procedures is vital to avoid bleeding risks and complications that accompany such interventions, and for its potential future use in procedures that a patient might have, such as a TRAM flap. In someone who is not heavily dependent on blood supply provided by anastomosis of the epigastric arteries as is the case in congenital anomalies such as coarctation of the aorta, the epigastric arteries can be extremely versatile and useful for current and possible future flap and graft procedures.
