Phenothiazines are a class of first-generation heterocyclic anti-psychotic medications, which display antagonistic activity towards dopamine receptors and recently have been shown to have potential anti-neoplastic properties. This activity illustrates the indications, action, and contraindications for phenothiazine as a valuable agent in treating and managing severe mental disorders such as schizophrenia, cancer, and other manifestations of psychosis. Also, this activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors such as pharmacodynamics and relevant interactions pertinent for members of the interprofessional healthcare team charged with the care of patients with schizophrenia and other related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of phenothiazines.
- Describe the potential adverse events associated with phenothiazine therapy.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with phenothiazine toxicity.
- Explain the significance of enhancing care coordination between interprofessional healthcare workers as it directly pertains to improving care delivery to patients suffering from phenothiazine toxicity.
