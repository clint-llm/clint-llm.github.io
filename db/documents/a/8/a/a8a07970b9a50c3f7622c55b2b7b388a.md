Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease in the elderly. Symptomatic severe AS has a high mortality rate if left untreated. Surgical aortic valve replacement or Transaortic valvular replacement can be done with either a mechanical valve or a bio-prosthetic valve. This activity reviews indications, limitations, and techniques of mechanical aortic valve replacement and highlights the role of the interprofessional team, including nurses, general physicians, cardiologists, and interventional cardiologists, in shared decision making along with patients' preference and medical condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of aortic valve replacement.
- Describe the preparation necessary for during and after aortic valve replacement.
- Discuss the complications of aortic valve replacement.
