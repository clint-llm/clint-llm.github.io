Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for a majority of anterior mediastinal masses, including thymomas, thymic carcinomas, thymic carcinoids, mediastinal goiters, and parathyroid adenomas. In cases of thymomas, adjunctive chemotherapy and radiation are options for locally invasive or metastatic disease, and inoperable tumors.

Teratomas are usually benign; therefore, resection is indicated when the lesions become symptomatic. Seminomas are generally responsive to radiation therapy, but chemotherapy and surgical resection may also be indicated depending on the disease extent. Non-seminomatous germ cell tumors receive a standard chemotherapy regimen of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin. Patients with residual tumor following chemotherapy may undergo surgical resection.

The direction of treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma depends on the stage of the disease. For disease in stages I and II, the standard treatment involves field radiation and combination chemotherapy with epirubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and prednisone. Stage III and IV Hodgkin lymphoma primarily receive treatment with only chemotherapy. The standard of care regimen known as ABVD consists of doxorubicin (adriamycin), bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine.

The treatment of mediastinal non-Hodgkin lymphoma is typically non-surgical. Due to its propensity to involve the bone marrow and its high relapse rate, the treatment of lymphoblastic non-Hodgkin lymphoma consists of intensive chemotherapy with a maintenance phase chemotherapy. Additionally, patients with lymphoblastic non-Hodgkin lymphoma typically receive intrathecal chemotherapy and brain irradiation to prevent central nervous system relapse.
