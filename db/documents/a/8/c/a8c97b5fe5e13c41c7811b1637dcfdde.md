Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome (WPW) is considered to be a congenital abnormality that involves the presence of abnormal electrical conductive circuits between the atria and ventricles. The disorder includes accessory electrical pathways that bypass the AV node. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of WPW by an interprofessional healthcare team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Wolff Parkinson White syndrome.
- Outline the evaluation of Wolff Parkinson White syndrome.
- Review the management options available for Wolff Parkinson White syndrome.
- Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and improve patient outcomes in patients with Wolff Parkinson White syndrome.
