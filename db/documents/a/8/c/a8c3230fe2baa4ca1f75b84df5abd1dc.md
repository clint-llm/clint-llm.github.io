Etiologies of neurapraxia are multiple.

- Bone fractures.

- Supracondylar fractures of the humerus, the incidence of 6-19%, the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve, and ulnar nerve.

- Improper positioning during anesthesia can affect ulnar, brachial, radial, common peroneal, sciatic, peroneal, great auricular nerves.

- Transpsoas lumbar interbody fusion, obturator, or femoral neuropathy in 2.6%. Decreased quadriceps and iliopsoas strength.

- Shoulder joint replacement, affecting the lateral cord of the brachial plexus, with the incidence of 20.9%. Caused by direct injury or excessive traction to the nerves during glenoid exposure.

- Shoulder dislocation affecting the brachial plexus having an incidence of 5-55%.

- ACDF: Intraoperative injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve by compression or traction.

- Thyroidectomy: Intraoperative injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve in 1.5% of the patients producing hoarseness immediately after surgery due to unilateral vocal cord paralysis.

- High impact sports causing brachial plexus neurapraxia, or "burners" and "stingers."

- Biceps tendon repair affects the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve.

- Postpartum.

- Regional anesthesia produces injury in 1-2% of the patients.

- During airway manipulation, damage to the lingual and greater palatine nerves.

- Park bench position affects the ulnar nerve, axillary nerve, and brachial plexus.

- Anterior cruciate ligament repair can cause injury to the superficial peroneal nerve.

Transient neurological deficits can occur following interscalene brachial plexus block, axillary brachial plexus blocks, and femoral nerve blocks with an incidence of 2.84%, 1.48%, and 0.34%, respectively. Permanent neurological deficits will occur in only 0.04/1000 blocks.

Incorrect or careless patient positioning during anesthesia is an avoidable complication.

High-velocity trauma, lacerations, and penetrating injury usually produce axonotmesis or neurotmesis.
