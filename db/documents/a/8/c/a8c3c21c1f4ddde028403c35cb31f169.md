Anomalies of the extensor pollicis longus can be organized by utilizing the Turker Classification

1a:

- The patient has an extra muscle, with its tendon running through the fourth dorsal compartment, and joins the extensor pollicis longus tendon at the first metacarpal mid-shaft but attaches separately from the EPL at the base of the distal phalanx of the first digit.

1b:

- Patients have an extra muscle, with its tendon running along with the extensor pollicis longus in the third dorsal compartment, but attaches separately from the EPL at the base of the distal phalanx of the first digit.

1c:

- The patient has an extra muscle, with its tendon going through the fourth dorsal compartment, and then turns obliquely and runs parallel to the extensor pollicis longus, then attaches to the distal EPL tendon.

1d:

- Patients have an extra muscle, with its tendon runs within the fourth dorsal compartment, then turns in an oblique manner, crosses over the extensor carpi radialis tendons, then over the EPL, and attaches to the proximal phalanx of the first digit.

1e:

- Patients have an extra muscle named the extensor pollicis and indicis communis, which originates on the ulna between the extensor pollicis longus and extensor indicis. The muscle splits two separate slips, one which courses alongside the EPL on the thumb and one which courses alongside the extensor indicis on the index finger. The slip that runs along with the EPL on the thumb inserts at the same location on the distal phalanx as the EPL.

1f:

- The patient has one extensor pollicis longus muscle belly, and it gives rise to two separate slips of the EPL tendon, the radial slip, and the ulnar slip. The radial slip passes between the first and second extensor compartment, and the ulnar slip passes over the extensor retinaculum, and they are combined back together by the metacarpophalangeal joint and then continue towards the distal phalanx.

1g:

- Patients have an extensor pollicis longus muscle belly, which gives rise to two separate slips of the EPL tendon, which run within the third extensor compartment.

A study discovered a cadaver with a unilateral, duplicated tendon of the EPL, which had its own muscle belly. In that case, the EPL is bifurcated into two tendons by the extensor carpi radialis longus tendon, with one tendon running along the normal course of the EPL and inserting at the same location as it and the other tendon (along with its small muscle belly) running along the extensor indicis pathway, inserting at the same location. The muscle belly for the duplicated EPL tendon originated from the normal EPL muscle belly and interosseous membrane. While this may appear to be a Turker Type 1e EPL anomaly, since the duplicated tendon had its own muscle belly within the third extensor compartment, it does not fit in the 1e classification since that’s only an anomaly of the number of tendons, not the number of muscle bellies.

It has been described in the case of an asymptomatic patient with hypoplasia of the thumb musculature that the extensor pollicis longus may run through the third extensor compartment, then attach to the radial aspect of the proximal phalanx of the first digit. This arrangement may occur as an adaptive response to compensate for missing abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis muscles and preserve thumb extension and abduction.

There has also been a case report about a patient with a fused muscle belly of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis, which are separated into their respective tendons. Additionally, the EPL went under the extensor retinaculum and went into the first extensor compartment, and attached to the patient’s extensor pollicis brevis.

Finally, a case of the EPL running through the second extensor compartment has also been reported, with the third extensor compartment not containing any tendinous structures. However, the exact insertion of the EPL running through the secondary extensor compartment did not get identified.

Overall, it is important to be aware of the rare yet significant variations of the EPL, as it will help surgeons and clinicians confidently and precisely treat patients with wrist and hand pathologies.
