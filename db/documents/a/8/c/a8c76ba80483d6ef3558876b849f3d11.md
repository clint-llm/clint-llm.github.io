One of the challenges of OASIS is inter-rater reliability. Scores can be discordant due to the subjective nature of the evaluator's evaluation, interpretation, and experience. Inconsistent results reflect in the Medicare Prospective Pay System reimbursement.

Brown et al. studied the detection of depression among HHC patients, and the primary outcome of the study suggested that depression is underdiagnosed among the elderly at HHC.

There have been several versions of OASIS implemented since 1991. The OASIS-D is the current one effective January 1, 2019. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services delayed the implementation of OASIS-E, originally scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. OASIS-E will delay until January 1 of the year that will be at least one full calendar year after the end of the pandemic. The updated version will include new standardized patient assessment data elements evaluating pain, comprehension, cognition, delirium, continence, self-care, mobility, and falls.
