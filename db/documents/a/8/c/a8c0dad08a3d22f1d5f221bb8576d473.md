Most patients do not have clinically significant bleeding problems and are discovered incidentally. These patients require no specific treatment. In rare cases of severe bleeding, platelet transfusions may be necessary. Prophylactic preoperative platelet transfusion may be warranted, and a hematologist should be consulted before surgery. Preoperative Desmopressin can be administered in patients requiring craniotomy in order to avoid any bleeding complications or platelet transfusion.
