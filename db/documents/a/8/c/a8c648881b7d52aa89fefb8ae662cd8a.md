On a molecular level, pseudogenes have associations with several roles. Numerous studies have revealed that specific genes and their associated pseudogenes display regulatory roles in the cell. Some pseudogenes have exhibited antisense RNA properties, siRNA properties, and even an ability to affect mRNA stability. Through these molecular functions, pseudogene transcripts can modulate the number of parental copy transcripts expressed.
