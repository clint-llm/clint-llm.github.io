The primary proponent to whether acupuncture should or should not be recommended is the desired to pursue acupuncture therapy from the patient.  The first rule of medicine is not to harm.  Acupuncture or sham acupuncture makes patients feel better.  There is a psychological component to therapy.  However, like many medications and treatment modalities, their effectiveness can be directly correlated to the physician or healthcare provider endorsing the treatment.  If the provider is seeing a patient with chronic low back pain and is hopeful that acupuncture could help with their pain, the patient is more likely to believe acupuncture will help with her pain.  In comparison, if a provider approaches the patient by saying acupuncture does not work, then the patient may not think it works nearly as well.

Given the ideology underlying acupuncture, almost every medical condition has been treated with this modality in the East. Even in western medicine, acupuncture has been attempted and studied in a variety of diseases and disorders, ranging from seasonal allergic rhinitis to fibromyalgia.

Most commonly, acupuncture has been indicated for pain, chronic and acute; and for nausea and vomiting, both postoperative, peripartum, and chemotherapy-induced.
