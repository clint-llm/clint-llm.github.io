Scarpa’s fascia is found predominantly in the lower abdomen with well-developed fibers that course along the lateral aspect of the abdomen just superficial to the rectus sheath. Compared to the lateral aspect, the fascia is not as well developed along the midline of the abdomen. Scarpa’s fascia was previously believed to be restricted to the lower abdomen and perineum. As per recent radiological findings, the fascia extends over the entire torso.
