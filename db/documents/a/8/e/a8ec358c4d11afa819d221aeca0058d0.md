Sarcocystosis caused by Sarcocystis species can occur in two forms in humans, the intestinal and the muscular type. Humans can be either definitive or intermediate hosts. Sarcocystis hominis (in cattle) and Sarcocystis suihominis (in pigs) use humans as definitive hosts and are known to cause intestinal Sarcocystosis. The definite host in some non-human species like Sarcocystis nesbitti is presumed to be reptiles, and humans acquire by ingestion of sporocysts through contaminated food and water. Undocumented species where humans can serve as a definitive host may be possible with the meat of domesticated animals, birds, wild animals, and birds being eaten across the world.
