There are currently no recommended guidelines or unifying protocols available regarding the management of Heyde syndrome. Therefore, the direction of the management of this condition should be according to guidelines related to aortic stenosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and AVWS.

**The Role of Aortic Valve Replacement**

Recommendation by expert consensus advises that aortic valve replacement be considered the first-line treatment in the management of Heyde syndrome.

**Management of Gastrointestinal Bleeding**

The workup and management of suspected gastrointestinal hemorrhage are the same for patients with Heyde syndrome as in other gastrointestinal conditions. Initial evaluation and assessment should seek to rule out the presence of immediate, life-threatening bleeding, which may include hemodynamic instability or evidence of shock. If evidence of life-threatening bleeding is present, resuscitative measures should occur first before proceeding to any procedural interventions. Once the patient is hemodynamically stable, the clinician should consider endoscopic intervention to search for a bleeding source. In Heyde syndrome, most sources of gastrointestinal bleeding arise from angiodysplasias in the small bowel; as such, upper and lower endoscopic evaluations may not locate a bleeding source. Advanced image acquisition methods such as push enteroscopy or video capsule endoscopy may be necessary in such cases. Identification of a bleeding source should be a priority, as it helps to rule out other significant causes of bleeding and contributes to the triad of disorders when classifying Heyde syndrome.

**The Role of VWF Replacement Therapies**

Therapeutic options typically employed for the treatment of hereditary von Willebrand disease – such as VWF or factor VIII replacement, octreotide, and desmopressin – are of little benefit or often altogether ineffective in the management of Heyde syndrome.

**Recommended Approach**

In patients who present with suspected or confirmed Heyde syndrome, consultation with a gastroenterologist and cardiologist for consideration of aortic valve replacement is the recommended therapeutic course. In hemodynamically unstable patients, normal resuscitative measures should take place before any intervention, including endoscopy or aortic valve replacement. In addition, anemia should be corrected with blood transfusion, as indicated by current guidelines.
