Orthostatic syncope is transient loss of consciousness due to reduced blood flow to the cerebrum that can be associated with symptoms like dizziness, diaphoresis, nausea or blurred vision. Neurally mediated (neurogenic) and non-neurally mediated causes can lead to syncope. Orthostatic vitals including blood pressure and heart rate is important in the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of orthostatic hypotension.
- Explain the physical examination findings associated with orthostatic hypotension.
- Outline the pharmacological and non pharmacological management of orthostatic hypotension.
- Summarize how an interprofessional team can evaluate and treat orthostatic syncope.
