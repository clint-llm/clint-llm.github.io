Prognosis of this disease is good if detected in early phases of bone loss, which can improve with early initiation of treatment with bisphosphonates. However, if detected after hip fracture, the mortality rate increases significantly by 10 to 15 percent, especially in women aged 80 years or older. Because of high disease prevalence, we need to implement early recognition of this condition with proper efforts for prevention and treatment. The commonest fractures are the hip, followed by vertebral fractures.

The incidence of fractures worldwide is, 80% of the forearm, 75% of humerus, 70% of hip, and 58% of spinal fractures. Hip fractures can be debilitating and associated with chronic pain, disability, reduced mobility, and impaired independence as a result of the same with poor quality of life.

Compared with hip fractures, vertebral fractures are associated with an eight-fold increase with age-related mortality. It can lead to intense back pain with chronicity, a decrease in height, deformity, kyphosis, and even reduced lung function as a result of the same. The presence of vertebral fractures increases the risk of further vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. Women having sustained a vertebral fracture are at risk of additional fracture in 1 to 2 years.
