The nerves of the forearm are complex due to the various nerve branches and the muscles that reside in the upper extremities. The forearm is composed of the radius bone laterally and the ulna bone medially. The four main joints of the forearm are the humeroulnar, humeroradial, and proximal and distal radioulnar joints.
