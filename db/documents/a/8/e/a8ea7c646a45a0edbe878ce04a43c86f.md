Shoulder dislocations are best managed by an interprofessional team that also includes therapists and orthopedic nurses. When evaluating patients with shoulder dislocations, clinicians need to be aware of the potential of associated neurovascular injury. Carefully examine the patient for neurovascular compromise. Axillary nerve injury is the most common. The axillary nerve innervates deltoid and teres minor and provides sensation to lateral shoulder. Axillary nerve compromise presents in over 40% of dislocations, but usually, resolves with reduction. Although dislocation is often obvious, pre-reduction imaging for associated fractures can be useful and should be done when trauma is known. Clinically important fractures occur in about 25% of dislocations.

Conservative treatment does yield good outcomes but recurrences are known to occur in about 1-5% of patients.
