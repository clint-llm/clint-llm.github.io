Despite the availability of newer mood stabilizers, lithium continues to be a first-line treatment for bipolar disorder. It is often underutilized because of the potential for side effects, and perhaps because it is an older drug.

This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients who are undergoing, or who may undergo lithium therapy.
