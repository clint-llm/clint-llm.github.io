- Colestipol should not be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.

- Colestipol is contraindicated in patients undergoing therapy with mycophenolic acid. As colestipol binds to bile acids, it reduces the absorption of mycophenolic acid and may reduce its efficacy.

- Colestipol has been shown to cause elevated triglyceride levels. A study by Lyons et al. demonstrated an 8.9% rise in triglyceride levels in patients treated with colestipol.

- Colestipol is a bile acid sequestrant. It is a large anion exchange resin and may bind numerous molecules in the intestine. Of note, colestipol may bind to free triiodothyronine (T3), resulting in increased fecal excretion of T3 and reduced enterohepatic circulation.

- Colestipol should be avoided for use in patients with disorders that cause decreased intestinal motility, in patients with a recent history of abdominal surgery, and patients with a history of recent episodes of intestinal obstruction.

- Colestipol is contraindicated in patients with complete biliary obstruction.
