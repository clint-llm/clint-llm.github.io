The most severe complications related to rib fractures are the flail chest and damage to the underlying structures. Solid organ injuries associated with rib fractures include liver injuries and splenic injuries. Typically, the higher the rib fracture is within the thoracic cage, the more likely it is to cause a liver or splenic injury.****
