Imaging and lab work may aid in the diagnosis of some enteroviruses. Respiratory disease may present with an abnormal chest x-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head or spinal cord may be indicated in cases of altered mental status or paralysis. Nasal, oropharyngeal, and rectal swabs may be sent for viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and lumbar puncture may be indicated based on clinical suspicion for CNS involvement.

An electrocardiogram should be performed on patients with chest pain or suspicion for myopericarditis. Clinical discernment must guide the collection of other serological studies, including kidney and liver function, complete blood count, and cardiac biomarkers.

Asymptomatic viral presence in test samples has been documented in varying frequencies. Based on the clinical concern, providers should attempt to rule out other forms of infection/co-infection by bacteria, fungi, and other viruses.
