Anemia is generally defined as hemoglobin of less than 13.0 g/dL in men and less than 12.0 g/dL in premenopausal women.

The disorder starts to develop when the glomerular filtration rate drops below 60 mg/ml. The anemia is rare when the GFR exceeds 80 mL/min/1.73 m2. However, as the GFR worsens, the anemia gets more severe.

Anemia is one of the common associations of CKD responsible for poor outcomes. The current management options for anemia in CKD are controversial, with some clinical trials indicating raised morbidity and mortality associated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. One hundred seventy years ago, anemia was linked to CKD for the first time by Richard Bright.
