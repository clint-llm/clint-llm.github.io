The membrane of red blood cells (RBCs) can undergo a variety of changes leading to morphologic alterations in these cells. When viewed under a freshly prepared peripheral blood smear (PBS), acanthocytes appear as cells with a few spicules of different sizes, projecting from the surface of the RBC membrane at irregular intervals. They result from alterations in membrane lipids and proteins and occur in patients with severe liver dysfunction, neuroacanthocytosis, abetalipoproteinemia, malnutrition, hypothyroidism, post-splenectomy, etc.
