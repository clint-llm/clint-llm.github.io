- Current studies propose a combination of factors leading pathophysiological mechanisms. Injury-thrombus-infection theory and injury of endothelium with thrombotic vegetation following by bacterial adhesion are the generally accepted ideas for neurological complications in infectious endocarditis. Maiija H et al. reported that major cerebral embolisms account for 42% of neurologic episodes; 10% are cerebral hemorrhage, which is most likely due to anticoagulant therapy in patients with valvular diseases, septic arteritis, secondary hemorrhagic transformation of infarction or mycotic aneurysm rupture.

- Several studies reported neurological events in cancer patients with NBTE; emboli travel to the central nervous system resulted in cerebral infarction or transient ischemic attack even though the most common sites of embolization are the spleen, kidney,Â and extremities.
