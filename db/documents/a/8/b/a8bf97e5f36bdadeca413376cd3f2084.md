Patients with apraxia can have significant issues with performing learned skills which affect their independence and ADLs. Appropriate safety precautions must beÂ implemented with objects and activities in their surrounding that can cause potential injury. Patients may require skilled nursing care if the inability to perform specific learned skills is debilitating. The eventual prognosis varies with patients and their etiological disease.
