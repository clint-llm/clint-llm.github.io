Providers across all specialties need to familiarize themselves with the effects of cannabis use. It is increasingly becoming ubiquitous in our society. The evidence supporting the use of marijuana for specific conditions is limited and most often derived from pharmaceutical preparations of isolated THC. Researchers struggle to gain funding for these studies given that it is a schedule I controlled substance with the Food and Drug Administration. Providers should know that providing permission to access medical marijuana for a given symptom does not restrict that patient to its limited usage. The dispensary’s employees can influence the strain, dosing, formulation, and indications used based on an opinion. Also, it should be stressed that continuous and/or heavy use of cannabis can increase the risk of intoxication or withdrawal, requiring medical attention, and long-term complications, which may be irreversible.

Despite its more benign nature compared to an opiate, benzodiazepine, and alcohol use, it is still a substance with a potential for ill health effects and marked impairment on social and occupational functioning. With the expansion of evidence-based uses, it is important to separate the abuse of marijuana from use with thorough history taking. Differences in state regulations governing medical indications for cannabis should be considered. And providers should not forget that medical marijuana is a not product of the tightly regulated and scientifically back pharmaceutical industry - it is a product produced by growing operations without similar oversight and indicated for conditions mostly not based on rigorous medical or scientific evidence required for products they prescribe, as opposed to a permitted use.
