Radiation is defined as the transmission or emission of energy through space or objects. Radiation can be further divided between ionizing and non-ionizing. Nuclear materials give off ionizing radiation and are measured in sieverts (Sv). The prolonged or significant exposure to such ionizing radiation can result in acute radiation syndrome (ARS). It is defined by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements as “the acute radiation syndrome is a broad term used to describe a range of signs and symptoms that reflect severe damage to specific organ systems and that can lead to death within hours or up to several months after exposure.” The proper care of acute radiation syndrome requires planning at the governmental, local and medical level to ensure the proper treatment and use of limited resources.
