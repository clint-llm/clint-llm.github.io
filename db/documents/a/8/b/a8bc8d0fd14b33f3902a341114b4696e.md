Before the eighth week of gestation, the left and right cardinal veins develop in the neck.  At the eighth week of gestation, these cardinal veins form a large anastomosis, which will eventually form into the left brachiocephalic venous trunk. The left and right cardinal veins subsequently develop into the internal jugular veins.  Around this same period of gestation, the external jugular veins form from the anterior veins of the mandibular region.
