Selegiline, a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, is FDA-approved as an adjunct treatment in the management of patients with Parkinson disease and as a treatment for a major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. Selegiline is also used off-label for early Parkinson disease and the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of selegiline, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating indicated disorders as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of selegiline.
- Summarize the approved and off-label indications for using selegiline.
- Review the potential adverse effects and drug-drug interactions of selegiline.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who can benefit from therapy with selegiline.
