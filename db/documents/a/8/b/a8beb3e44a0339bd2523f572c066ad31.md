If performing a transabdominal study, the patient should be asked to have a full bladder if possible as fluid-filled structures enhance the resolution of deeper structures on ultrasound as it aids in examining the uterus, placenta, and amniotic fluid.

If a transvaginal ultrasound is deemed necessary, the patient should be asked to empty their bladder. Given the proximity of the intracavitary probe to the cervix, an empty bladder provides increased visualization of structures and improves patient comfort during the study.
