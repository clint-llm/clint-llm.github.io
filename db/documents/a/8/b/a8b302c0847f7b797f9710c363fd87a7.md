The key to improved outcomes is patient education. The earlier one seeks medical help, the better the outcomes, and thus patients should seek help in the presence of:

- Fever

- Abdominal or chest pain

- Persistent headache

At the same time, patients should avoid the following:

- Tobacco

- Alcohol

- Illicit drugs like cocaine

- Seeking care from multiple healthcare institutions

Patients should be urged to:

- keep hydrated

- Eat a healthy diet

- get immunized

- Take hydroxyurea as prescribed

- Follow up with a clinician
