After trying innumerable variations, we have developed a technique that maximizes reliable double J stent placement while allowing for easy reversibility and guaranteed ureteral access. It also facilitates optimal stent positioning and renal pelvis stent coiling to minimize migration and patient discomfort.

**Recommended Technique**

**Determine the Optimal Stent Length**

Measure the ureteral length from the urinary meatus to the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) either by a retrograde pyelogram (then subtract 10% due to radiologic magnification) or (preferred) determined directly with a marked ureteral catheter. This is done by placing the catheter tip at the UPJ and then cystoscopically checking the markings at the ureteral meatus.  A small amount of diluted contrast can be injected through the ureteral catheter to help identify the UPJ.  Double J stents only come in even lengths, so if the ureteral length measurement is an odd number of centimeters, choose the double J length that is 1 cm shorter. Note that the stent length does not include the curls at either end. As a general rule, the average ureter takes a 26 cm length stent.

**Select the Optimal Stent Diameter and Stiffness**

After establishing the ureteral length, the next issue is a decision on the width and rigidity (compressibility) of the stent. Softer stents may be more comfortable for the patient, but stiffer ones are likely to be more reliable and crush-resistant. With larger stones and tighter spaces, go with firmer material and a smaller diameter stent. Also, use a firmer catheter material when dealing with tortuous ureters and malignancies.  For ureteral strictures or severely infected kidneys, use larger diameter stents. Consider a metallic stent for malignancy or if the stent will be required permanently.

**Guide Wire Placement (Routine)**

With the double J stent selected, the next step is placing the guidewire. The guidewire can be inserted directly into the ureteral orifice, or it can be placed through a 5 or 6 French open-ended ureteral catheter. It should be advanced until the floppy tip coils in the renal pelvis as determined fluoroscopically.

**Guide Wire Placement (Difficult)**

Guidewire placement is not usually a problem, but it can sometimes be challenging; especially when dealing with impacted stones, strictures, cancers, and tortuous ureters. First, try a different wire. We typically start with a hydrophilic stiff shaft straight tip but recommend an angled tip wire under challenging situations. The stiffer shaft wire helps straighten tortuous ureters, and it seems to be easier to advance with less bowing. In some cases, we may pass two wires to help straighten an unusually tortuous ureter. This can be quickly done with a dual lumen ureteral catheter.

When the guidewire does not advance easily, use a 5 French open-ended catheter to provide stability and prevent any bowing of the wire. Place the open-ended catheter within 1 cm of the obstruction and then gently try advancing the wire through the catheter while twisting the wire slightly right and left. Use fluoroscopy for guidance and a torque vise or similar device to better handle, twist, and advance the guidewire.

The obstruction only has to be successfully traversed once to provide proximal access. If the only partial passage is achieved, advance the open-ended catheter gently and carefully over the guidewire as much as possible, and then repeat the guide wire advancement technique described above. For even more excellent stability and support, a dual lumen catheter can be substituted for the standard open-ended catheter.

A combination of lidocaine jelly and contrast can be advantageous in these situations. Inject a small amount through the open-ended catheter to help with visualization and reduce ureteral spasm. Use of a smaller syringe (3 or 5 mL) is recommended for this retrograde injection due to the high viscosity of the mixture.

**Use Retrograde Pyelography**

With the guidewire in place, advance the open-ended catheter to the UPJ and measure the ureteral length. The guidewire can be safely removed to do a retrograde as long as the tip of the open-ended catheter is beyond any stricture or blockage. A few milliliters of diluted contrast can be injected to help identify the UPJ. After measuring the ureteral length, replace the guidewire, and remove the ureteral catheter. If the ureter is particularly tortuous, consider using a second guidewire to help straighten it. If the ureter is significantly narrowed or tight, ureteral dilation with either a Nottingham dilator, tapered ureteral catheter, or balloon dilator may be needed. In these situations, consider using a smaller diameter double J stent immediately, then replacing it with a wider one later after a reasonable period of passive dilation from the original stent.

We like to position the fluoroscope so that the center of the renal pelvis is in the exact middle of the radiologic viewing field so that even if the injected contrast has dissipated or drained away, there is still an indicator for the precise location of the center of the renal pelvis.

**Keep the Guide Wire Moist**

Start at the most distal end of the guidewire and wipe just the tip with a wet sponge from proximal to distal. This avoids having the guidewire accidentally perforate the sponge and getting caught. Then wipe the rest of the guidewire from distal to proximal to prevent accidental extraction or movement of the guidewire. We keep a wet sponge handy on the patient’s knee and another on the side of the water basin to help keep these hydrophilic supplies moist and wet whenever they are used or manipulated.

**Load the Stent**

Loading the proximal end of the double J stent, the end without the safety thread, over the distal tip of the guidewire can sometimes be tricky. Use the supplied plastic outer sheath, if available, as an aid to straighten out the curve of the stent. Adjust the plastic sheath so that the proximal tip of the stent is just inside the sheath, about 1 cm from the tip.

Make sure the double J and guidewire are both very moist if using hydrophilic materials; otherwise, it can be challenging to advance the stent over the guidewire. Most hydrophilic guidewires and stents dry out very quickly and then become sticky.

Advance the guidewire into the stent. Place one hand on the distal end of the plastic outer sheath and pinch the stent and plastic sheath together. This extra stability facilitates the passage of the guidewire through the stent as otherwise, the guidewire may push the stent out the back of the plastic sheath. Once the guidewire is through the proximal coiled end of the stent, slide the sheath outwards to straighten out the distal coil and push the guide wire all the way through. Remove the plastic outer sheath once the guidewire has passed through the entire stent and is visible at the distal end.  Do not remove the thread yet.

**Place the Double J Stent**

Push the stent into the cystoscope until you can see the proximal end of the stent enter the distal ureter. Then have the pusher placed over the guidewire and use it to slide the stent over the guidewire into the ureter and up into the renal pelvis. Now pull the guidewire back slightly so that the tip of the wire is just below the curl of the proximal end of the stent. Hold the pusher, guidewire, and the safety thread from the stent together as a single unit and gently move it a few centimeters in and out of the ureter as previously described. This will allow the soft, proximal end of the stent to curl up in the renal pelvis naturally.  By holding the stent, pusher, and thread together, the entire process can be easily reversed just by pushing the guidewire back into the renal pelvis allowing for stent repositioning or even complete removal while leaving the guidewire in place for ureteral access.

**Remove the Dangler/Safety Thread**

When completely satisfied with the proximal renal curl of the stent and its distal (bladder) placement, with the black mark from the stent visible at the ureteral orifice, cut one end of the dangler/safety thread close to the cystoscope nipple and altogether remove the thread. Make sure the knot is distal to the point where the thread is cut. Removal of the thread with the guidewire and pusher still in place stabilizes the double J and minimizes the chances of inadvertently moving or extracting the stent. The thread can optionally be left in place and secured at the end of the case to the inner thigh or dorsum of the penis. This is recommended only when the expected need for the stent is one week or less as it is prone to accidental early dislodgement or removal by the patient.  Do Not Remove the Dangler/Safety Thread Until Completely Satisfied With the Proximal Stent Tip Coiling in the Renal Pelvis as Well as the Distal Stent Position!

**Guide Wire Removal**

Immediately after the thread is removed, pull the guidewire entirely out. (Up to this point, the guidewire has been in place just below the proximal coiled stent tip, stabilizing the position of the stent, so it does not move or get pulled out accidentally.) To safely remove the pusher, first advance the pusher in a few centimeters until the distal stent tip has been pushed out of the cystoscope sheath and the end of the stent is visible completely inside the bladder. Now it is safe to remove the pusher.  If the coiling is not optimal in the bladder, a biopsy forceps or grasper can be used to adjust it through the cystoscope.

Review the final position of the double J stent fluoroscopically and cystoscopically to ensure optimal placement and positioning. Finally, empty the bladder and remove the cystoscope.

**Change or Remove the Stent Appropriately**

Double J stents will tend to develop stone material on their surfaces, particularly in the renal pelvis and the bladder, which can make standard cystoscopic stent removal extremely difficult or even impossible. For this reason, stents typically need to be changed regularly or removed. It is the surgeon's responsibility to keep track of the stents and make sure his patients do not fail to have them changed or withdrawn at the appropriate time. In pregnancy, changing stents every 4 to 6 weeks is recommended due to rapid encrustation. Most standard stents can remain for 3 to 6 months, but this time will vary according to the patient's urinary chemistry and stone-producing propensity. Every commercially available stent will have a maximum recommended indwelling time, which should be followed.

**Side Effects from Double J Stents**

Stent discomfort can be minimized with alpha-blockers like tamsulosin and alfuzosin. Additionally, the use of such agents pre-operatively has been shown to be helpful in reducing post-operative stent-related irritative bladder symptoms.

Stents will need to be changed more often in pregnant ladies than in other patients, even those with previous nephrolithiasis. Consider a percutaneous nephrostomy as an alternative.

Some degree of hematuria is not uncommon with stents; especially in patients on anticoagulants. This is typically only an issue if the hematuria is excessive. It is essential to inform patients that they may have hematuria with stents to avoid undue anxiety.

Remember that once a double J stent has been placed, it is the responsibility of the surgeon to make sure that it is removed appropriately and at the right time. When stents are inadvertently left in place for months, or even years longer than intended, they inevitably become calcified and may also move or migrate out of position. It is the surgeon's responsibility to make sure the stent is removed in a timely fashion and not forgotten.
