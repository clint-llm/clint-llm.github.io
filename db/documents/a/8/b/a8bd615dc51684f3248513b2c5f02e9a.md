**Anatomy**

The teres minor arises from the posterior surface of the scapula, directly adjacent to the upper part of its lateral border. The upper fibers of the muscle culminate in a tendon that inserts onto the greater tubercle of the humerus—the tendon blends into the capsule of the shoulder joint. The lower fibers of the muscle insert directly into the humerus, just below the greater tubercle.

The teres minor lies inferior to the infraspinatus and superior to the teres major; all three muscles have a similar oblique orientation. In anatomical position, the long head of the triceps brachii muscle is oriented perpendicular to the teres minor and inferior to it. The teres minor is deep to the deltoid muscle.

**Function**

As a rotator cuff muscle, the teres minor stabilizes the ball-and-socket glenohumeral joint by helping hold the humeral head (ball) into the shallow glenoid cavity of the scapula (socket). The teres minor also laterally or externally rotates the arm at the shoulder joint. As a lateral rotator, the teres minor is an antagonist muscle to medial rotation; therefore, the teres minor is especially critical in stabilizing the shoulder during medial rotation to prevent anterior dislocation of the humerus.
