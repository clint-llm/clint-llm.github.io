Saphenous vein cutdown requires a skilled operator with knowledge of vascular anatomy. Often this procedure is performed in the trauma bay where a team of ER physicians, trauma surgeons, and nurses work collaboratively to resuscitate the acutely ill patient. There are no published RCTs that confirm or refute the positive influence of a coordinated health care team on the success of the vein cutdown technique.
