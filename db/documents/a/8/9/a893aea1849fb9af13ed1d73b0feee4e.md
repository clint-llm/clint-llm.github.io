The gastrocnemius is the major muscle of the posterior calf and acts as the primary power generator for running and jumping movements. It consists of fast and slow-twitch muscle fibers. Deep to the gastrocnemius lies the soleus, which contains mostly slow-twitch muscle fibers responsible for maintaining strength and endurance for extended plantarflexion. The plantaris muscle lying between the two heads of gastrocnemius, possess minimal functional capacity but possibly assist with plantar flexion and knee flexion. The popliteus muscle functions to internally rotate the tibia against the femur and inhibit tibia external rotation.

Contact movements that involve a sudden eccentric force can result in gastrocnemius rupture, as occurs during rapid push off or jumping movements when the ankle’s position changes rapidly from a plantarflexed to a dorsiflexed position. This mechanism often happens in tennis players and is termed “tennis leg” in which rapid change of direction, such as when returning a shot, can result in a medial gastrocnemius injury.
