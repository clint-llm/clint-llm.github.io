The gluteal region plays a pivotal role in the stability of the lower limb and pelvis and contains various key neurovascular structures. The musculature is formed principally by the three gluteal muscles: Maximus, medius, and minimus. The Gluteus medius and minimus work together as hip abductors and are vital to normal locomotion.
