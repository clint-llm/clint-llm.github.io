The thoracic cavity encloses and protects the body’s vital organs. There are twelve sets of rib pairs that make up the thoracic cavity. Anteriorly, ribs attach to the sternum, costal cartilage of an adjacent rib, or have no attachment and are known as floating ribs.

Bony rib anatomy consists of the anterior portion for attachment to the hyaline cartilage or sternum and the posterior portion for articulation with the spinal column.

Muscular attachments to the ribs include the scalenes, internal intercostals, external intercostals, and the diaphragm.(nuchal) or cephalad and down (caudal) or caudad. Ribs 1 to 4 on their anterior articulations move up and down. Ribs 5 to 10 are called bucket handle ribs because the shaft of the rib body on the lateral aspect of the chest wall moves up and down.

Each rib has muscular attachments to facilitate inhalation and exhalation.

The diaphragm moves in inspiration and expiration by expanding and re-doming as the diaphragm contracts and relaxes.
