This article summarises the basics of Hyperphosphatemia, including its pathophysiology, evaluation, and management. Though this condition is seen more often in renal failure patients, several other non-renal conditions can also manifest with hyperphosphatemia. For complete management of hyperphosphatemia, it is essential to have an understanding of various regulatory mechanisms that affect phosphate levels.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of hyperphosphatemia.
- Summarize the evaluation of hyperphosphatemia.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for hyperphosphatemia.
- Describe the differential diagnosis of hyperphosphatemia.
