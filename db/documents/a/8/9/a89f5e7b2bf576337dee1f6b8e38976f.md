The most common aggravating activities in distal clavicular osteolysis are bench pressing, overhead lifting, and overhead athletic movements such as volleyball, basketball, tennis, and swimming.

These movements cause frequent traction and compression loading of the AC joint, which leads to the repetitive microtrauma pattern implicated in DCO. One of the most associated causes of DCO is the bench press, specifically high-intensity bench press, defined as a one-rep maximum of more than 1.5 times the individual's body weight.
