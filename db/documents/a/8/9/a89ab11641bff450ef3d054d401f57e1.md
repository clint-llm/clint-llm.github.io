The proximal attachment of the gluteus minimus is on the external surface of the ilium. This attachment lies between the anterior and inferior gluteal lines. The anterior gluteal line begins near the iliac crest taking a curved path posteriorly and inferiorly towards the greater sciatic notch. The inferior gluteal line follows a similar path but is shorter and less curved. The gluteus minimus is fan-shaped and is attached distally to the femur at the anterior border of the greater trochanter.

The gluteus minimus is predominantly a hip stabilizer. Its main action is to abduct the hip. It starts to work when the individual is standing on one limb and works in conjunction with the gluteus medius and tensor fascia lata.
