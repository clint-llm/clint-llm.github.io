Patients with a frozen shoulder may present to their primary caregiver (MD, DO, NP, or PA). If needed, an orthopedic referral may be appropriate. Specialty care nurses assist with evaluation and patient education. It is important to know that a frozen shoulder is a self-limiting condition and, if diagnosed early, has a favorable outcome. Physical therapy must be a crucial part of treatment to achieve satisfactory outcomes. All these caregivers must engage in open communication and maintain accurate patient records; reaching out to other team members if they note any changes in the patient's condition warrant additional intervention.
