# Continuing Education Activity

Lupus erythematosus is a multisystem disorder that predominately affects the skin. There are several types of cutaneous lupus. The most common types are acute cutaneous lupus (ACLE), subacute cutaneous lupus (SCLE), and discoid lupus (DLE). Dr. James Gilliam described the most commonly used classification of cutaneous lesions in lupus erythematosus. Gilliam segregated skin lesions into those that are specific and those that are not specifically based upon whether an interface dermatitis was seen on histopathologic examination. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of discoid lupus, its presentation, and management by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe how genetic and environmental factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of DLE.
- Review the categorization of the lesions associated with DLE.
- Summarize how topical and intralesional corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, oral antimalarials, and corticosteroid-sparing immunomodulatory agents are used for treating DLE lesions.
- Explain how monitoring adverse effects of the medications by all interprofessional team members is crucial for a patient's comprehensive recovery.

# Introduction

Lupus erythematosus is a multisystem disorder that predominantly affects the skin. There are several types of cutaneous lupus. The most common types are acute cutaneous lupus (ACLE), subacute cutaneous lupus (SCLE), and discoid lupus (DLE). Dr. James Gilliam described the most commonly used classification of cutaneous lesions in lupus erythematosus. Gilliam segregated skin lesions into those that are specific and those that are not specifically based upon whether an interface dermatitis was seen on histopathologic examination. Within the category of specific cutaneous lesions, he subdivided these into acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and chronic cutaneous erythematosus.

The most common subset of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus is DLE. These patients may or may not report photosensitivity, but lesions are frequently photo distributed and tend to have secondary atrophy or scarring. Most patients with DLE do not have significant systemic disease. DLE can also occur as a manifestation of SLE in approximately 20% of patients. Other less common forms of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus include hypertrophic lupus erythematosus, tumid lupus erythematosus, lupus erythematosus panniculitis (LEP or lupus profundus), chilblain LE, oral DLE, as well as DLE lesions on the palms and/or soles.

# Etiology

Lupus erythematosus is an inflammatory, connective-tissue disease of generalized autoimmunity characterized by pathogenic autoantibodies and immune complexes, attributed to a loss of immune tolerance. For discoid lupus erythematosus without associated SLE (CDLE), the evidence does not show whether circulating inflammatory cells and autoantibodies are involved in the pathogenesis, but it is evident that the cutaneous inflammatory infiltrates are dominated by Th1, but not Th17, cells in contrast to systemic lupus erythematosus.

# Epidemiology

Lupus can occur in all age groups, but DLE occurs more frequently in women in their fourth and fifth decades of life. Twenty-five percent of patients with SLE may develop typical discoid lesions at some point during their illness, and 1% to 5% of patients with discoid lupus may develop SLE.

Ethnicity is also a major risk factor for developing LE, and its effect in some populations is almost as strong as that of gender. SLE prevalence is four-fold higher in African-American women than White-race American women (4 in 1000 versus 1 in 1000). In addition, African-Americans tend to develop the disease at an earlier age and have a higher mortality rate.

# Pathophysiology

The pathogenesis of cutaneous lupus erythematosus is multifactorial, with an interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Some contributing environmental factors include ultraviolet radiation (UVR), medications, cigarette smoking, and possibly, viruses. The interaction between these multiple factors triggers an inflammatory cascade of cytokine, chemokine, and inflammatory cell responses. Genes previously associated with SLE are TYK2, IRF5, and CTLA4 and confer an increased risk of developing DLE.

An analysis of 405 patients by Bockle et al. found that smoking is highly associated with discoid lupus erythematosus. Bockle et al. hypothesized that smoking might play a pathogenic role in cutaneous lupus erythematosus variants (DLE, tumid lupus) by inducing apoptosis, stimulating T-cell proliferation, and increasing photosensitivity. Another explanation might be that smoking provokes DNA damage, resulting in the formation of DNA adducts and the production of ds-DNA antibodies. Keratinocytes may also participate in lupus skin damage by increasing the apoptotic rate and the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-alpha and IL-6 for SLE and IFN-lambda for DLE.

# Histopathology

The findings of histopathologic examination in cutaneous lupus vary based on the subtype. Overlap can be seen in the histologic findings among the various clinical phenotypes, particularly ACLE, SCLE, and discoid lesions. In cutaneous LE, basal cell damage (also referred to as vacuolar degeneration, hydropic change, or interface dermatitis) and lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrates are commonly seen. In discoid lupus lesions, periadnexal inflammation, follicular plugging, and hyperkeratosis are primarily seen in addition to the interface dermatitis.

Examination of the skin for deposits of immunoreactants is called direct immunofluorescence (DIF). DIF of lesional skin can be useful in establishing a diagnosis of cutaneous LE in cases where routine histopathology is equivocal. DIF does not replace routine histologic staining as the method of choice for establishing a diagnosis. In active lesions of DLE, DIF of lesional skin is positive in the majority of cases. The most characteristic DIF finding in cutaneous LE is antibody deposition at the dermal-epidermal junction and around hair follicles. These deposits are typically granular, and they are composed primarily of IgG and/or IgM.

The lupus band test (LBT) is a diagnostic procedure used to detect deposits of immunoglobulins and complement components along the dermo-epidermal junction in patients with lupus erythematosus (LE). LBT can help distinguish systemic lupus erythematosus from chronic lupus erythematosus because, in SLE patients, the LBT is frequently positive in both uninvolved and involved skin, whereas in CLE patients, only the involved skin is positive.

# History and Physical

DLE is the most common form of chronic cutaneous erythematosus and can occur as localized form (80%) with lesions on the face, ears, and scalp or as disseminated DLE (20%) with lesions above and below the neck. The disseminated form of DLE, especially when involving the trunk, is associated with an increased risk of progression to SLE up to 28%.

It is unusual for discoid lesions to present below the neck without lesions also being present above the neck. Occasionally, discoid lesions develop on mucosal surfaces, including the lips, nasal mucosa, conjunctivae, and genital mucosa.

The first morphological sign of DLE is a well-defined, annular erythematous patch or plaque of varying size followed by follicular hyperkeratosis, which is adherent to the skin. By removing the adherent scale, follicle-sized keratotic spikes similar to carpet tacks can be seen (“carpet tack sign”).

Patients who present with discoid lesions may have associated arthralgias, but, over time, only approximately 10% to 20% of these patients eventually meet the classification criteria for SLE. Hyperkeratotic plaques that are verrucous are noted in hypertrophic DLE, a rare entity of DLE.

# Evaluation

In the evaluation of DLE, the dermatologist should take a directed history, perform a cutaneous examination looking for signs of possible systemic disease. The diagnosis of DLE is made based on clinical features, but histology may be required to confirm the diagnosis.

Autoantibodies to SSA/Ro, SSB/La, U1RNP, histones, and ssDNA, are common in patients with SLE, but they are not disease-specific. There are no other specific autoantibodies to differentiate the subtypes of CLE that are routinely used in practice. One further possible target of auto-antibodies is annexin 1, which has been suggested to play an important role in preventing autoimmune diseases. A recent study found a significantly higher level of anti-annexin 1 antibodies in DLE patients, suggesting that anti-annexin 1 antibodies might be a new diagnostic marker for DLE. Anti-annexin 1 antibodies level in the serum did not correlate with DLE activity.

# Treatment / Management

Early treatment of discoid lupus lesions may lead to the total clearing of skin lesions, but treatment failure results in permanent scarring. Hair loss, depressed scars, and pigmentary changes are often disfiguring, particularly in darker-skinned people. Some general measures, such as sun avoidance, avoidance of photosensitizing medications, and liberal application of sunscreen are encouraged because cutaneous lesions are known to be exacerbated by sunlight.

Current first-line treatment for DLE consists of photoprotection in conjunction with topical or intralesional corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors.

Acute exacerbations of DLE are treated with the application of a super high or high potency topical corticosteroid.

Antimalarials are immunotherapeutic and are considered first-line systemic therapy for CLE. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine with or without quinacrine are currently utilized in the treatment of DLE. HCQ is preferred over chloroquine due to the lower risk of side effects, specifically retinal toxicity. Quinacrine is known to cause hematological abnormalities. Hydroxychloroquine is usually started at 200 mg/day and increased to 200 mg two times a day in 1 to 2 weeks if there are no side effects. The maximum dose of hydroxychloroquine should not exceed 5 mg/kg of real body weight per day, given its association with retinal toxicity.

Other treatment modalities, such as retinoids, vitamin A analogs with anti-keratinizing and anti-inflammatory effects, are sometimes used in CLE, but documentation in the literature is limited. Topical retinoids such as tretinoin 0.05% cream or tazarotene 0.05% gel are utilized to treat hypertrophic DLE.

Methotrexate at a dose range of 10 to 25 mg/week is utilized for DLE lesions. Clinical improvement is noted within 2 to 4 weeks of use, with the resolution of the lesions in about 6 to 8 weeks.

Thalidomide, a potent teratogen, has been used in the treatment of DLE. An early report of its use in treating DLE of 60 individuals treated with 50 to 100 mg per day found complete or marked regression in 54 individuals (90%) with disease relapse in 71% of individuals with medication discontinuation.

# Differential Diagnosis

Differential diagnoses of DLE include granuloma faciale, tinea faciei, cutaneous tuberculosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, lymphoproliferative disorders, and sarcoidosis. DLE-induced scarring alopecia can be confused with lichen planopilaris, tinea capitis, and central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia. Hypertrophic DLE may be confused with keratoacanthoma, squamous cell cancer, hypertrophic lichen planus, and prurigo nodularis.

# Prognosis

DLE lesions heal with scarring, atrophy, and dyspigmentation, causing more morbidity than mortality. Psychological functioning is affected by DLE lesions.

# Complications

DLE and progression to SLE are associated with complications like

- Cicatricial alopecia

- Pancytopenia

- Thromboembolism

- Arthritis

- Myositis

- Hypertension

- Renal failure

- Neuropsychiatric manifestations like seizures, depression

- Pleuropericarditis

- Pancreatitis, mesenteric vasculitis

- Optic neuritis

- Therapy-related adverse effects

- Vitamin D deficiency

Periodic surveillance of DLE lesions and therapy-related side effects is crucial to avoid complications and promote clinical resolution.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients should be educated about photoprotection and the possibility of developing skin lesions up to 3 weeks after sun exposure.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Lupus is best managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare workers because the disorder can affect almost every organ in the body. Besides physicians, the role of the nurse, pharmacist, therapist, social worker, and mental health counselor is vital. The key is to stress the importance of medication compliance. Patients should be educated about the importance of seeking help early when symptoms arise. At the first sign of renal dysfunction, medical help should be sought. Once renal failure is established, the only treatment is transplantation or dialysis. Patients should be told to avoid sunlight, stop smoking, eat healthily and remain active. Women of childbearing age should consult with an obstetrician before getting pregnant. Finally, joining a support group and/or following up with a mental health counselor is highly recommended.

**Outcomes**

Discoid lupus is an unpredictable and highly variable disorder. While the condition is benign, it can cause devastating complications, often leading to high morbidity and a poor quality of life. The disorder frequently waxes and wanes. The outcome is much improved for patients with only skin and musculoskeletal involvement. The outcomes are worst for patients with CNS and renal involvement. Today, with treatment, there is an 80% survival at ten years, but failure to comply with treatment can lead to early death. At some point in time, the majority of lupus patients will develop hypertension, lipid disorders, diabetes, infections, osteoporosis, and malignancies like lymphomas and liver cancer.
