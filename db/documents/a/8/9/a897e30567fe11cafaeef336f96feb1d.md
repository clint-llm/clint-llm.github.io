Rapid diagnosis is paramount to the improvement of healthcare team outcomes for patients with acute aortic syndrome. This is due to the high mortality rate, which worsens the longer the patient does not receive the appropriate treatment. For these patients, the emergency department team is vital in this process, and the faster diagnosis and referral can be made to a specialist, the greater the chance of survival will be.

The patient journey for these patients needs to be streamlined from triage nurse to emergency doctor to vascular surgeon, cardiothoracic surgeon, or medical team. The initial investigations will include vital signs, physical examination, and labs. Imaging will be dependent on whether the patient is hemodynamically stable enough for this to be appropriate or whether urgent surgical management is required.

A way to improve outcomes for patients with AAS is by consolidating interprofessional expertise in aortic centers, which have been shown to improve the mortality of this particular patient group.
