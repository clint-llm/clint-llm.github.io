Chronic pain conditions, including low back pain, neck pain, and neuropathic pain states like chronic regional pain syndrome, causalgia, and diabetic neuropathy, afflict a large group of the population. They pose a substantial economic burden on society. Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) offers a relatively safe and effective treatment modality in the treatment of such chronic pain conditions. This activity describes the importance of peripheral nerve stimulators and highlights the role of the interprofessional team, including the pain physician, anesthesiologist, and primary care physician, in evaluating and treating chronic pain patients who undergo peripheral nerve stimulators.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for peripheral nerve stimulator and when it is most beneficial. 
- Summarize the risks associated with peripheral nerve stimulator placement. 
- Review the most common adverse events associated with peripheral nerve stimulator placement.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance chronic pain patient care with peripheral nerve stimulator placement.
