The postoperative care in patients who undergo surgical intervention should focus on alignment, any unexpected gross misalignment, conjunctival opposition. Patients with exotropia might occasionally complain of double vision in the immediate postoperative period, which needs to be carefully observed with close follow-up. For most patients, diplopia should settle down within six weeks.

If persistent, temporary use of prism glasses or occlusion glasses should be advised. Most surgeons prefer using short-term topical steroids and antibiotics, with or without oral analgesics, on a case-to-case basis. Younger children can be advised infusion dosage of analgesics if needed. Follow-up visits should focus on assessing the alignment of eyes, ocular motility, and correction of any underlying refractive errors. Patients might need to be maintained on orthoptic exercises to prevent recurrence of exodeviations.
