Endometrial receptivity describes the intricate process undertaken by the uterine lining to prepare for the implantation of an embryo. While embryo development and endometrial preparation are concurrent yet independent processes, their synchronization is critical to the success of embryo apposition, adhesion, invasion, and further ongoing pregnancy.

Many molecular pathways involve hormones, adhesion molecules, cytokines, and growth factors acting in concert to create a synchronous window of implantation. When synchrony is lost or receptivity is not achieved, the consequence is early pregnancy loss or infertility.
