Patients must be educated about the importance of blood glucose management to avoid complications associated with DM. Stress must be given on lifestyle management, including diet control and physical exercise. Self-monitoring of blood glucose is an important means for patients to take responsibility for their diabetes management. Regular estimation of glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and lipid levels is necessary.

Healthcare professionals should educate patients about the symptoms of hypoglycemia (such as tachycardia, sweating, confusion) and required action (ingestion of 15 to 20 gm of carbohydrate).

Patients should be motivated to stop smoking. Emphasis is required on regular eye check-ups and foot care.
