**Greater Occipital Nerve**

As stated previously, for the GON, the region where it traverses between the atlas and the axis, the area where it courses between the obliquus capitis inferior and semispinalis capitis, or the area where it perforates the semispinalis capitis and the trapezius are potential areas of GON irritation and entrapment and could likely lead to occipital neuralgia.

In another study by Tubbs et al., among samples from 12 adult cadavers, the GON perforated the trapezius in 16.7% of cases and the aponeurosis in 83.3% of cases. In another study by Junewicz et al., among 272 patients who had GON decompression surgery, the GON was discovered to perforate the semispinalis in all patients bilaterally.

**Lesser Occipital Nerve**

Concerning the LON, it was mainly found to be at the posterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. However, reports exist showing some anatomic variations of the LON. For instance, Madhavi et al. reported a case of bilateral triplication of the LON in an adult cadaver.
