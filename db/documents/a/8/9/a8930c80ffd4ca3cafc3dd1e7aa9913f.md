Patients presenting with signs and symptoms of arteriovenous fistulas require an interprofessional approach to the workup. As with any condition, this starts with a thorough history and physical exam. Involving the appropriate surgical team early in the process can help direct the evaluation such that imaging obtained can be used in surgical planning. Early warnings to trauma patients with injuries to the extremities, particularly involving an arterial or venous injury, should help to prevent late presentations of high-flow AVFs. Surgeons, interventionalist, and intensivists should be aware of arteriovenous fistulas as a potential complication of bedside procedures for venous access and biopsies.
