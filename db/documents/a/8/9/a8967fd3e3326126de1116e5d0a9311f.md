Obtaining medication abroad: While many drugs used in malaria prophylaxis are obtainable abroad, travelers should understand that the quality of these products is uncertain. Often they are also found in combination products with medications that may not be advisable.Â Finally, patients should typically begin their chemoprophylaxis regimen before travel. Patients should be discouraged from obtaining malaria prophylaxis while traveling abroad.

Changing prophylaxis regimens: If a patient cannot tolerate the side effects of an antimalarial drug, it is essential to consider the different parts of the lifecycle that each drug acts upon to ensure the best coverage. References such as those in the CDC Yellow Book can suggest the best regimen, taking into account the current medication, when the patient will depart a malarial zone, and other important factors.
