Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the mandible is a severe iatrogenic disease of devitalized bone caused by radiation therapy of oral and oropharyngeal cancers. It is a state of injured bone tissue with inadequate healing or remodeling response of at least three to six months. The wound can result from radiotherapy combined with mechanical insult or radiotherapy exposure alone. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and complications of mandibular osteoradionecrosis and underscores the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology and pathophysiology of mandibular osteoradionecrosis.
- Review the examination process for evaluation of a patient with mandible osteoradionecrosis, including indicated diagnostic imaging.
- Summarize the preventative strategies for and treatment of mandibular osteoradionecrosis.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by osteoradionecrosis of the mandible.
