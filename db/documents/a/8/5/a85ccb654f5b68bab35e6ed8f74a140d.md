Mallory-Weiss syndrome is one of the common causes of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and is characterized by the presence of longitudinal superficial mucosal lacerations (Mallory-Weiss tears). These tears occur primarily at the gastroesophageal junction and may extend proximally to involve the lower to mid-esophagus or distally to involve the proximal portion of the stomach. This activity reviews the etiology, pathogenesis, evaluation, and management of Mallory-Weiss syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Mallory-Weiss syndrome.
- Describe exam findings consistent with Mallory-Weiss syndrome.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for Mallory-Weiss syndrome.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes for patients affected by Mallory-Weiss syndrome.
