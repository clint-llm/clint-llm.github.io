The American Burn Association's criteria can help differentiate burns as minor, moderate, or severe based on the extent of skin injured, the depth of the burns, age of the patient (<10 or >50 y/o),  associated medical conditions, associated injuries such as smoke inhalation or other trauma, or burns involving particular areas of the body such as the hands, feet, face, ears, nose, or genitalia (See also Burns, Evaluation and Management for more details regarding determining depth and extent of burns).

Burn size quantification is essential when making decisions about treatment and admission, and the rule of nines is often used.

For adults:

- 9% of the total body surface area to the head and neck

- 9% to each upper extremity

- 18% to the anterior and posterior trunk

- 18% to each lower extremity

- 1% to the perineum

The patient's palm represents about 1% of the total body surface area. Also, burn injury can subdivide into partial and full-thickness injury.

**Major Burn Injury**

- More than 25% of total body surface area in adults or 20% in children

- Full-thickness burn involving more than 10% of TBSA

- There is burn to the face, perineum, or extremities

- There is significant cosmetic impairment

- These injuries are best managed in a burn center

**Moderate Burn Injury**

- Partial-thickness burn between 15 to 20% TBSA in adults, 10 to 15% in children   or a full-thickness burn involving 2 to 10% TBSA

- Minimal threat to face and perineum

- The risk of cosmetic impairment is not severe

- These patients need admission but do not always require a referral to a burn center.

**Minor Burn Injury**

- Burns that involves less than 15% of TBSA in adults and less than 10% in children

- No threat of functional or cosmetic loss

- Face and perineum not involved

- These burns receive outpatient management.
