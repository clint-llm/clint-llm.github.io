In patients with a history of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), exogenous estrogen administration can lead to cholestasis. Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives should be avoided in these patients if possible or should be used in the smallest possible dose. Due to the high risk of recurrence of this disease, patients should be monitored cautiously with subsequent pregnancies.
