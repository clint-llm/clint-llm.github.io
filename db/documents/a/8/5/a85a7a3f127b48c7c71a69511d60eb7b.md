The sternohyoid muscle may vary in size, length, and thickness in different individuals. The origins and attachments of the sternohyoid may also vary slightly. In some cases, the sternohyoid was found to be one muscle instead of a paired muscle. The sternohyoid muscle has also been found to originate from the omohyoid muscle's tendon instead of the sternum. Interestingly, some individuals completely lack the presence of the sternohyoid muscle.
