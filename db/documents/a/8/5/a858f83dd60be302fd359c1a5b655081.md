Surgical treatment is indicated for symptomatic discoid meniscus that is causing pain and/or mechanical symptoms. Most commonly, symptomatic discoid menisci are treated with arthroscopic saucerization/partial meniscectomy, which is a procedure that reshapes the meniscus to a more anatomic crescent morphology to enhance its function.

If a discoid meniscus is incidentally diagnosed in the absence of symptoms, no formal surgical treatment is required, and the patient may be observed.

It is well documented that the lateral meniscus has roughly twice the amount of excursion in comparison to the medial meniscus.

Postoperatively, weight-bearing is at the discretion of the surgeon. Physical therapy is frequently prescribed for muscle strengthening, increasing range of motion, edema control, balance, and coordination.
