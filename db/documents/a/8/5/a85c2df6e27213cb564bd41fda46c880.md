S. aureus is the most common pathogen cultured in osteomyelitis.

Osteomyelitis is classified according to the **Cierny-Mader Classification:**

- Stage 1: Medullary osteomyelitis (confined to the medullary cavity of the bone)

- Stage 2: Superficial cortical bone infection (most often results from direct inoculation or contiguous wound infection)

- Stage 3: Localized osteomyelitis (usually involves both cortical and medullary bone)

- Stage 4: Diffuse osteomyelitis (involves the entire thickness of the bone and results in structural instability, such as with an infected nonunion fracture)
