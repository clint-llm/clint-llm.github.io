Aortic stenosis is a potentially serious condition affecting blood flow from the heart to the rest of the body. Calcification and atherosclerosis of the valve is the most common cause of aortic stenosis.

Mechanical and bioprosthetic valves are the most commonly used valves. Indications for different types of valves vary based on multiple factors. The choice of a prosthetic heart valve and the type of surgical approach should be based on shared decision-making between interprofessional teams, including cardiologists and surgeons. The factors such as long-term anticoagulation, the potential need for reoperation in the future, and the patient’s preference should be considered in the choice of prosthesis.  The Interprofessional team should also consider the patient’s age, medical comorbidities, valve durability, risk of thromboembolic and bleeding complication, and risk of mortality.
