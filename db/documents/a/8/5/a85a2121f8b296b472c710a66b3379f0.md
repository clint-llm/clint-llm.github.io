Chloroprocaine is an ester class local anesthetic and is indicated for neuraxial anesthesia (caudal, epidural, and spinal) and peripheral nerve blocks and obstetric anesthesia (pudendal and paracervical blocks). Due to its short duration, it has been used in test doses to evaluate the function of peripheral nerve and epidural catheters. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of chloroprocaine, pertinent for interprofessional team members where patient care requires local anesthesia that would be met using chloroprocaine.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the approved and off-label indications for chloroprocaine.
- Summarize the mechanism of action of chloroprocaine.
- Outline the necessary monitoring of chloroprocaine.
- Describe the importance of interprofessional team members to improve patient outcomes in patients receiving chloroprocaine for local anesthesia.
