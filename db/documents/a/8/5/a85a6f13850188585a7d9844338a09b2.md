Arterial catheter access is obtained, and arteriography is performed to document the arterial supply to the single or multiple tumors.

- Arteries that pose a high risk for enabling non-target embolization are occluded, usually with coils.

- A catheter with an outer diameter of about 1 mm called a microcatheter is usually needed to reach inside the liver to the artery or arteries feeding the tumor.

- When the catheter or microcatheter is placed as close to the location that is thought to result in successful embolization of the artery or arteries feeding the tumor, then the embolization particles, contrast, and chemotherapy are administered until stasis of arterial flow is seen during fluoroscopy.

- Follow-up arteriography is performed to document persistence or absence of flow to the region of interest.

- The maximum of chemotherapy administered (for example, 75 mg doxorubicin) is precalculated based on whether there is the tumor in 1 lobe or 2 lobes of the liver.
