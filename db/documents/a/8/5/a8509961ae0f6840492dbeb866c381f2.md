Lateral epicondylitis is a clinical diagnosis, and imaging is often not necessary. A provider may consider obtaining an elbow radiographic series (anteroposterior and lateral) if other injuries or conditions are suspected by history and/or physical exam. Other conditions warranting potential imaging workup include evaluating concomitant degenerative joint changes, fractures, tumors, or bursitis. If the patient is not responding to nonoperative management modalities, the provider may consider ordering an MRI or ultrasound to evaluate for tears, stress fractures, or osteochondral defects.
