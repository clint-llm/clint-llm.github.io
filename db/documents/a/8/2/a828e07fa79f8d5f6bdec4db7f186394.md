The diagnosis and management of urea cycle disorders is complex and best done with an interprofessional team that includes a geneticist, pathologist, pediatrician, nephrologist, internist, biochemist and dialysis nurse/nurse practitioner. Treatment for UCDs, or any IEM, should be done in consultation with an appropriate genetics/metabolic expert. For neonates with hyperammonemia, the immediate treatment goal is a rapid lowering of ammonia and reducing dietary protein intake. Hemodialysis is very effective at reducing plasma ammonia and should immediately be initiated if elevated hyperammonemia is observed. Ammonia scavenger medications such as an IV nitrogen binding agent are also useful. These agents act by removing glycine and glutamate from plasma thereby their reducing contribution to ammonia formation.

The prognosis for most of these infants is guarded.
