The extensor carpi ulnaris is an essential muscle in the activity of the wrist and forearm that contributes not only to the extension and adduction of the wrist but also to its medial stability. It is most commonly injured in athletes subject to forceful wrist movements. Repetitive flexion and extension of the wrist can lead to tenosynovitis due to the irritation of the tendon and the sheath that holds it in place. Overuse can also lead to tendinopathy of the muscle's tendon, in which there can be thickening and painful stiffness of the tendon with minimal structural damage. Continued excessive stress on the tendon can cause structural damage, which can lead to a partial tear.

**Testing the Function of Extensor Carpi Ulnaris Muscle**

For testing the extensor carpi ulnaris muscle's function or instability, ask the patient to pronate the forearm and extend the fingers. Place your hand along the medial border of the hand to provide resistance against the movement. The extended wrist is then adducted against resistance. The muscle can be seen and felt in the proximal part of the forearm, and its tendon can be palpated proximal to the head of the ulna if the muscle is acting normally.
