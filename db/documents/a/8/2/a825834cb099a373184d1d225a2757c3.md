The most common use of PCO2 is the monitoring of respiratory and acid-base status in patients while receiving mechanical ventilation. Respiratory care practitioners carry out the measurements of PCO2 and the adjustments to ventilation on the machine itself. While there are many protocols in ventilator management, they do share a commonality in that the respiratory care practitioner, nursing, and the other members of the medical team should analyze the patient's overall ventilation and acid-base status as a collective group.
