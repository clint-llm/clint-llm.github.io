Ziconotide is a newer, intrathecal analgesic medication used for the treatment of chronic pain. Its FDA indication is for treating chronic severe pain in patients intolerant or refractory to systemic analgesics or intrathecal morphine. Ziconotide can only be administered intrathecally as it does not cross the blood-brain barrier well.Â It shows efficacy in treating intractable, severe, chronic pain secondary to cancer and non-malignant pain.
