Two main functions of the urinary bladder are urine storage and emptying. The specialized histology of the urinary bladder allows coordinated contraction and relaxation to facilitate its physiological function. The highly specific tissue architecture, particularly the lining of the urothelium, is closely linked to pathological conditions in the urinary bladder. Benign and malignant neoplasms of the urinary bladder, including von Brunn’s nests and urothelial carcinoma, are among the frequently diagnosed histological pathologies of the genitourinary tract, imposing a significant diagnostic challenge to clinicians.
