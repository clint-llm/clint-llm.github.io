The investigation of autoimmune neutropenia and chronic idiopathic neutropenia includes immunoglobulins, complement system, inflammatory markers, and phagocytes functions. For the diagnosis of AIN, the detection of antineutrophil antibodies is important, but because the detection of antineutrophil autoantibodies is difficult, a combination of immunofluorescence and agglutination test for screening is used.

**Quantitative Serum Immunoglobulins**

- IgG

- IgM

- IgA

- IgE

**Phagocytic Function**

Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test (before and after stimulation with endotoxin)

- Unstimulated

- Stimulated

Neutrophil mobility

- In medium alone

- In the presence of chemoattractant

- In vivo and in vitro chemotaxis of granulocytes

**Blood Lymphocyte Subpopulations**

- Total lymphocyte count

- T lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, and CD8)

- B lymphocytes (CD19 and CD20)

- CD4/CD8 ratio

**Lymphocyte Stimulation Assays**

- Phorbol ester and ionophore

- Phytohemagglutinin

- Antiserum to CD3

- Chemotaxis of human lymphocytes

**Complement System Evaluation**

Measurement of individuals components by immunoprecipitation tests, ELISA, or Western blotting

- C3 serum levels

- C4 serum levels

- C1 inhibitor serum levels

Hemolytic assays

- CH50

- CH100

Complement system functional studies

- Classical pathway assay (using IgM on a microtiter plate)

- Alternative pathway assay (using LPS on a microtiter plate)

- Mannose pathway assay (using mannose on a microtiter plate)

**Antibody Activity**

- Test for heterophile antibody

- Anti-streptolysin O titer

- Immunodiagnosis of infectious diseases (HIV, hepatitis B, and C, HTLV and dengue)

- Serum protein electrophoresis

**Other Investigations of an Immunodeficiency Disorder**

- Complete blood cell count

- Bone marrow biopsy

- Blood chemistry

- Histopathological studies

- Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)

- Tumoral markers

- Levels of cytokines

- Chest X-ray

- Diagnostic ultrasound

- Liver function test
