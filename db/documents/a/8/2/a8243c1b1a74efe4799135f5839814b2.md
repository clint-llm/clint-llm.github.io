These patients typically present with a short and externally rotated lower extremity. Past medical and social history should be obtained to optimize perioperative management and to prepare for postoperative rehabilitative care. It is important to evaluate the skin (open versus closed fracture) and the neurovascular status. Evaluation of a range of motion is typically not possibleÂ due to pain. Basic lab studies such as complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation studies should be obtained to recognize abnormalities that may need time to correct prior to surgical stabilization. Early involvement of an interprofessional team including anesthesia and internal medicine or geriatrics is ideal to medically optimize surgical candidates for operative repair.
