Histologically, the mucosal layer of the colon in a patient with ulcerative colitis includesÂ infiltrates of varying density and composition, depending on the stage of the disease. These infiltrates primarily consist of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and granulocytes, with the latter being more prominent during acute flares of the disease. Additionally, goblet cell depletion, ulcerations, and alterations in mucosal crypts are sometimes apparent. These findings might also be present on histological evaluation of the distal ileum, even though ulcerative colitis is a disease confined to the colon. This is backwash ileitis.
