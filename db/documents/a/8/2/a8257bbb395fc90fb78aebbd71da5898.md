The terms pericarditis refers to inflammation of the pericardium and myocarditis. Both can occur together in clinical practice,Â and hence the term myopericarditis is used.

Sometimes myopericarditis is used interchangeably with perimyocarditis. Myopericarditis is used when there are primarily pericarditis symptoms with evidence of the involvement of the myocardium as evidenced by cardiac biomarker elevation or imaging studies revealing normal wall motion.
