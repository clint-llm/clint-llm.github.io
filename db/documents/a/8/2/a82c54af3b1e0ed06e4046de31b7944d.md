Cardiac cirrhosis is the consequence of the hemodynamic rearrangements caused by heart failure. Right-sided heart dysfunction can be due to left-sided heart failure, valvular diseases (tricuspid regurgitation, mitral stenosis), or decreases in relaxation or filling of the right-sided heart as in the setting of constrictive pericarditis. It produces an increase in the preload and back pressure to the hepatic system producing hepatic congestion. Prolonged hepatic congestion eventually leads to liver cirrhosis.
