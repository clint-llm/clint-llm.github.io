**Trigeminal Nerve Divisions**

The sensory aspect of CN V provides the primary innervation to the brainstem, skin of the face, paranasal sinuses, cornea, facial and masticatory muscles, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), most of the dura mater and cerebral arteries. The brachial motor nerves of CN V innervate the masticatory muscles (including the masseter, lateral and medial pterygoids, and the temporalis), the mylohyoid, tensor veli palatini, and the tensor tympani. The CN V further divides into three main branches: the ophthalmic branch (V1), the maxillary branch (V2), and the mandibular branch (V3). Although there are no innate parasympathetic nerve fibers within CN V, the main branches are associated with several parasympathetic ganglia throughout the course of innervation.

The ophthalmic branch of CN V additionally divides into three terminal branches: the frontal, lacrimal, and nasociliary. These terminal branches innervate the frontonasal prominence derivatives and mucous membranes of the cornea, dorsum of the nose, forehead, and scalp, the frontal and ethmoid sinus, and the upper eyelid along with its conjunctiva. The lacrimal gland receives innervation from the lacrimal branch of CN V as well as parasympathetic innervation from the postganglionic fibers from the pterygopalatine ganglion derived from CN VII.

The maxillary branch of CN V is additionally divided into fourteen terminal branches innervating the mucous membranes and sinuses of derivatives of the maxillary prominence of the first pharyngeal arch. These structures include the superior palate, upper lip, upper molar, and associated gingiva, nasal cavity and lateral nose, lower eyelid and its conjunctiva, and the maxillary sinus. Similar to the ophthalmic branch, the postganglionic fibers from the pterygopalatine ganglion of CN VII join with V2 to supply parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal gland. The nasal glands also receive parasympathetic innervation from fibers that travel alongside the nasopalatine and greater palatine nerve branches of V2.

The mandibular branch of CN V is further subdivides into four terminal branches within the infra-temporal fossa: alveolar, auriculotemporal, buccal, and lingual nerves. These nerves supply sensory innervation to the external ear, chin, lower lip, anterior two-thirds of the tongue, lower molars, and associated gingiva, and the mucous membranes of the floor of the oral cavity. The mandibular branch is the only branch of the CN V with motor innervation, as well. The supplied structures include the muscles of mastication (medial and lateral pterygoids, masseter, temporalis), tensor veli palatini, tensor tympani, and the suprahyoid muscles. The submandibular and sublingual glands receive parasympathetic innervation via the post-ganglionic nerve fibers from CN VII that travel along with the lingual nerve. The parotid gland also receives parasympathetic innervation via fibers of CN IX that travel parallel to the auriculotemporal branch of V3.
