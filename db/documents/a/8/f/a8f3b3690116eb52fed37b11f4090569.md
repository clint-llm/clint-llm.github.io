The pathogenesis of Lyme disease involves the Ixodes tick feeding on an infected animal reservoir. The Borrelia spirochetes replicate, and some penetrate out of the tickâ€™s midgut and migrate to the salivary glands.

In ACA, there is a chronic T-cell mediated immune reaction against Borrelia with the presence of CD3+ and CD4+ cells in the dermal infiltrate.Borrelia bind to extracellular matrix proteins, including glycosaminoglycan-binding protein, fibronectin-binding protein, and decorin proteoglycan.Borrelia also have a high affinity for collagen fibers, which has been demonstrated on electron microscopy.
