Thalassemia presentation varies widely depending on the type and severity. A complete history and physical examination can give several clues that are sometimes not obvious to the patient themselves. The following findings can be noted:

**Skin**

Skin can show pallor due to anemia and jaundice due to hyperbilirubinemia resulting from intravascular hemolysis. Patients usually report fatigue due to anemia as the first presenting symptom. Extremities examination can show ulcerations. Chronic iron deposition due to multiple transfusions can result in bronze skin.

**Musculoskeletal**

Extramedullary expansion of hematopoiesis results in deformed facial and other skeletal bones and an appearance known as chipmunk face.

**Cardiac**

Iron deposition in cardiac myocytes due to chronic transfusions can disrupt the cardiac rhythm, and the result is various arrhythmias. Due to chronic anemia, overt heart failure can also result.

**Abdominal**

Chronic hyperbilirubinemia can lead to precipitation of bilirubin gall stones and manifest as typical colicky pain of cholelithiasis. Hepatosplenomegaly can result from chronic iron deposition and also from extramedullary hematopoiesis in these organs. Splenic infarcts or autophagy result from chronic hemolysis due to poorly regulated hematopoiesis.

**Hepatic**

Hepatic involvement is a common finding in thalassemias, particularly due to the chronic need for transfusions. Chronic liver failure or cirrhosis can result from chronic iron deposition or transfusion-related viral hepatitis.

**Slow Growth Rates**

Anemia can inhibit a child's growth rate, and thalassemia can cause a delay in puberty. Particular attention should focus on the child's growth and development according to age.

**Endocrinopathies**

Iron overload can lead to its deposition in various organ systems of the body and resultant decreased functioning of the respective systems. The deposition of iron in the pancreas can lead to diabetes mellitus; in the thyroid or parathyroid glands can lead to hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism, respectively. The deposition in joints leads to chronic arthropathies. In the brain, iron prefers to accumulate in the substantia nigra and manifests as early-onset Parkinson's disease and various other physiatry problems. These symptoms fall in the vast kingdom of hemochromatosis.
