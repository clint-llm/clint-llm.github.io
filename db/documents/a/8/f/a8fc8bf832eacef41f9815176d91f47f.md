Survival in inherited bone marrow failure syndromes depends largely on the age at the time of transplant, disease severity, and response to initial therapy. Ten-year survival rates for HSCT are 83%, 73%, 68%, and 51% in the first, second, third, and fifth decades, respectively. Three-year survival in Fanconi anemia is 85% with sibling-matched donors and 50% with unmatched donors using fludarabine nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens. Survival to 40 years in Blackfan-Diamond anemia patients approaches 100% patients in remission following steroids, 75% in remission with ongoing steroid use, and 50% with residual disease despite steroid use. Their 3-year survival is 80% with sibling-matched donors and 20 to 30% with unrelated matched donors.

Because HSCT only treats marrow disease, patients with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes are still susceptible to early-onset SCC. Secondary malignancies and complications from pancytopenia (hemorrhage and infections) are the most common causes of death in this population.
