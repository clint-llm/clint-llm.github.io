Pneumocystis jirovecii adheres to the surface epithelium of type 1 alveolar cells, which stimulates cytokines, chemokines, and cellular infiltrate in the lungs to eradicate the infection. In immunocompetent hosts, this results in a mild inflammatory response with minimal damage to the lung. However, patients with a diminished immune response due to lack or incomplete function of certain immune system components develop hyperinflammatory responses that cause direct damage to the lung.
