Other conditions may mimic septic thrombophlebitis. In patients with cancer, it is often difficult to distinguish STP from the common deep venous thrombosis (DVT) that cancer patients experience due to hypercoagulation. Cancer patients are often bacteremic from other sources due to their severe immunocompromise, and there is no good way to differentiate the septic patient, who has an indwelling catheter with a thrombus, from the septic patient who has septic thrombophlebitis. Some have looked at the role ofÂ  fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and found it to be specific for the diagnosis of STP in this population of patients with concurrent malignancy.

Cerebral venous thrombosis can be mimicked by pre septal cellulitis or orbital cellulitis or by ophthalmologic migraines, which can present with 3rd nerve palsy, decreased vision, eye pain, ophthalmoplegia, and proptosis.
