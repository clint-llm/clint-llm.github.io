In this disease process, the etiologies, as mentioned above, can cause stasis in a segment of the proximal small intestine. This dysfunction impairs peristaltic motility and impedes luminal flow. Throughout digestion, food is diverted around the stagnant length of the bowel, suitably referred to as the “blind loop.” Naturally, particulate builds up, serving as a focal point for bacterial proliferation.

The consensus of current literature points to Bacteroides, E. coli, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus as the implicating species in BLS.Bacteroides) directly injure the alimentary tract through released toxins or harmful by-products of microbial metabolism.E. coli, Streptococcus) remove the available supply of vitamin B12 from the lumen for use during replication.

In addition to restricting the absorption of B12, microbial overgrowth also impairs fat absorption. Under normal conditions, conjugated bile salts are transported into the duodenum to solubilize dietary lipids. As food passes through the gut, the intestinal flora deconjugates a small percentage of bile salts/acids, which exit the body through the stool. However, in stagnant conditions, the population of bacteria drastically increases. Accordingly, more bacteria (notoriously anaerobes) yield a larger number of unconjugated bile salts/acids, manifesting as steatorrhea and fat-soluble deficiencies.
