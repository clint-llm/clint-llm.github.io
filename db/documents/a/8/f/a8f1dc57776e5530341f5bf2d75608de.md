Fluticasone is a corticosteroid given via oral, nasal, or topical routes. The route of administration depends on the patientâ€™s diagnosis. Oral fluticasone is FDA-approved to treat asthma and has an off-label use for chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and eosinophilic esophagitis. Inhaled steroids slightly improve lung function and improve COPD symptoms but do not affect the rate of lung function decline.

In 2016 fluticasone received FDA approval as an over-the-counter medication as a 50 mcg spray hay fever and upper respiratory allergy symptoms in adults and children over four years of age.
