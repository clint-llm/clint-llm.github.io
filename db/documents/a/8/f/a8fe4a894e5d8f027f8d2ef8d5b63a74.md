The clinician should attempt a closed reduction of any associated elbow dislocation as early as possible. Open reduction may be necessary in the event of entrapped bony fragments or soft tissues within the joint.

Non-operative treatment of isolated coronoid process fractures should include brief immobilization and early range of motion to deter stiffness. Favorable results have occurred with conservative treatment in some patients. Indications include a perfectly concentric ulnohumeral joint, absence of a significantly associated radial head fractures, and a coronoid fracture involving less than 50% of the coronoid height.

Stability of the elbow, not the size of the coronoid fragment, is the main consideration for surgical fixation. Small fragments, however, such as Regan and Morrey type I fractures are more likely to result in stable elbows and be amenable to conservative treatment. Indications for operative management include coronoid fractures associated with unstable elbows.Â  Fixation strategies and surgical approaches vary depending on the characteristics of the fracture as well as associated injuries.

In terms of internal fixation, once these fractures are visualized and reduced, there are again multiple considerations. Lasso suture fixation of the coronoid via a trans-osseous tunnel drilled posterior to anterior through the proximal ulna has been shown to restore stability of the coronoid.
