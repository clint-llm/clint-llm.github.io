The prognosis of patients with contact dermatitis depends on the cause and lifestyle. Isolated cases usually resolve if the offending agent exposure is discontinued. Those who do not remain compliant and continue to wear jewelry with metal or are exposed to plants because of lifestyle generally tend to have a chronic course. Relapses are very common. In healthcare, latex allergy is a very common form of contact dermatitis and can have an impact on clinical practice. Cases of anaphylaxis are reported all the time.
