Prognosis is poor with N-ALD and most of the other forms of X-ALD. Treatment is usually limited to symptomatic supportive management. Replacement therapy for patients with Addison disease and HCT for asymptomatic patients ( identified by newborn screen or incidental imaging) or have mild symptoms may be effective in selected cases. Severe disabilities and death are the expected outcomes on the majority of patients with N-ALD or X-ALD.
