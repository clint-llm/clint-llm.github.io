Atezolizumab is FDA-approved for intravenous use only. It is available in two different concentrated strength solutions of 840 mg/14 mL (60 mg/mL) and 1200 mg/20 mL (60 mg/mL) in a single-dose vial. Atezolizumab is recommended to be administered as an IV infusion after dilution with 0.9 % sodium chloride injection. The infusion's initial rate should be over 60 minutes, and if well tolerated, subsequent doses can be administered over 30 minutes. Patients should be closely monitored for infusion-related reactions, based on the severity of which the infusion rate must be interrupted temporarily, or the infusion rate must be slowed or permanently discontinued.

Dosing is generally 1200 mg IV every three weeks for most indicated cancers (unresectable or metastatic melanoma dosing is 840 mg IV every two weeks); depending on the diagnosis and institution, dosing can vary from this standard regiment. The clinician should always consult the drug package insert and institutional protocols before designing a dosing regimen for any patient.
