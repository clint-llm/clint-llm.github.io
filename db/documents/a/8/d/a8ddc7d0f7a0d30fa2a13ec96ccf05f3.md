In general, in between cervical vertebrae, there lies an intervertebral disc that is not present between C1 and C2 of the atlantoaxial joint. Additionally, a bifid spinous process is only consistently seen in C2-C4. The literature accounts for roughly 0.3% of the population possess a bifid spinous process as low as C7. These are examples of normal physiologic variation. However, the odontoid process and even the transverse ligament can potentially undergo incomplete formation leading to an anatomical variant and potential harmful predisposition to instability and injury.

**Os odontoideum -**a controversial congenital or traumatic variation of the dens where the superior margin of a hypoplastic den contains an ossific density. It is usually seen in the early development of the spine as in children and can be classified as orthotopic or dystopic.

**Persistent ossiculum terminal -**this congenital malformation refers to the secondary ossification centers that fail to fuse on the superior edge of the dens. This malformation is most of the time stable but can be found incidentally.Â Ossification variation describes any arrest or partial interruption of bony ossification that may pose an obstacle to the anatomical structure and physiologic functional capabilities of the atlantoaxial joint. These disruptions can lead to significant cervical vertebrae anomalies due to growth plate dysfunction.
