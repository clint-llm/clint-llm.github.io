Most adverse effects from phytonadione occur with IV, SQ, and IM administration

- Anaphylactoid reactions

- Dyspnea

- Chest tightness

- Injection site reaction

In a retrospective cohort study by Shields et al. published in 2001, they evaluated the efficacy and safety of IV phytonadione. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were those who had received IV phytonadione between September 1, 1994, and March 31, 1996, and were taking warfarin for two weeks or longer. Patients were excluded if they were currently bleeding or received concomitant factor replacement therapy. Out of the 105 patients assessed, 29 patients received a second dose. The researchers found adverse reactions in only two patients. Both patients experienced dyspnea and chest tightness that resolved by stopping the infusion.

Phytonadione (vitamin K1) has a black box warning due to severe anaphylaxis when given IV that may cause shock, respiratory arrest, and cardiac arrest.
