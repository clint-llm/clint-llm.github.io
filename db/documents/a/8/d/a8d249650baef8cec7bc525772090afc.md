The mechanisms of cancer-associated thrombosis are diverse. Tissue factor produced by malignant cells appears to trigger the coagulation cascade leading to the formation of Factor Xa, while some cancer cells can produce cancer procoagulant that acts directly on Factor Xa. In addition to the potential procoagulant effect of cancer cells, anti-cancer therapy has shown to be an additional cause of cancer-associated thrombosis. Different chemotherapeutic agents, including methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and lenalidomide, have been found to increase the risk of VTE and mortality significantly. Other causes include venous stasis due to compression of blood vessels by tumor or prolonged immobility in critically ill cancer patients.
