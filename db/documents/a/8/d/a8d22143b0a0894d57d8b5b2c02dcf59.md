Consultations are not necessary unless the cyst is large and in an unusual location such as the mouth or face. In those circumstances, specialist consultation may be warranted. Adults with epidermoid cysts in rare locations such as the fingers and toes, history of multiple lipomas, and a family history of colon cancer should raise the suspicion of Gardner syndrome with an appropriate specialist referral.
