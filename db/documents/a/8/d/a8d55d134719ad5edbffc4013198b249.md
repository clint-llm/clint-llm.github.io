- **Serum Lactic Acid:**Lactic acid levels increase when oxygen demand exceeds oxygen supply/delivery, such as in anemia, heart failure, severe infection (sepsis), and shock. Lactic acid measurements are useful for diagnosing and directing the management of such conditions.

- **Anaerobic Exercise:**During periods of high-intensity exercise in which oxygen demand exceeds oxygen supply, muscles rely on anaerobic glycolysis for ATP production. Although oxidative phosphorylation produces approximately 15 times more ATP than glycolysis, glycolysis occurs at a rate approximately 100 times faster.

- **The Warburg Effect****:**One hallmark of cancer is the shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism seen within tumor cells, referred to as the Warburg Effect. As tumors grow, they expand beyond the capabilities of local blood supply. To combat the inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation, cancerous cells shift away from oxidative metabolism and instead rely heavily on anaerobic glycolysis.

- **Fibromyalgia:**Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain condition characterized by diffuse tender points on the body in the absence of abnormal diagnostic testing. Some studies have revealed an increase in pyruvate and lactate production in individuals with fibromyalgia compared to healthy controls, as well as a decrease in ATP production. Subjects with fibromyalgia also expressedlactate dehydrogenase in lower concentrations.
