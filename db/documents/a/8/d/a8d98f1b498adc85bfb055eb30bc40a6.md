The liver arises as a part of the foregut. It stems from endodermal cells and starts as the hepatic diverticulum around the fourth week of development. It forms within the peritoneum and is anchored to the abdominal wall by the falciform ligament which arises from the ventral mesentery. The umbilical vein passes through the falciform ligament on its way from the umbilical cord to the liver.

The diverticulum is believed to be induced by a combination of several pathways, mainly the Wnt/B-catenin pathway and fibroblast growth factors (FGF), which are secreted by fetal cardiac cells, which is induced by the MAPK pathway.

The portal vein, which arises from umbilical and vitelline veins is the central vessel in which the hepatic cords form around. This helps explain why the portal vein is the primary blood supply for the liver as opposed to the hepatic artery. The hepatic artery develops with the biliary tract and continues to develop post-birth.
