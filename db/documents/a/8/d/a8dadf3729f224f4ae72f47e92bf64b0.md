Seborrheic dermatitis (SD) is a common inflammatory skin disease presenting with a papulosquamous morphology in areas rich in sebaceous glands, particularly the scalp, face, and body folds. The infantile (ISD) and adult (ASD) variants reflect the condition’s bimodal occurrence.

Infants are not usually troubled by seborrheic dermatitis, but it may cause significant parental anxiety, often appearing as firm, greasy scales on the crown and frontal regions of the scalp. It occurs in the first three months of life and is mild,self-limiting, and resolving spontaneously in most cases by the first year of life.ASD, on the other hand, is characterized by a relapsing and remitting pattern of disease and is ranked third behind atopic and contact dermatitis for its potential to impair the quality of life.
