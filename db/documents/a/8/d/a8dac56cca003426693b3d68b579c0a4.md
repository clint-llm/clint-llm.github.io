Arterial catheterization is an invasive procedure that requires careful planning to minimize the risk of complications. Therefore, before initiating the procedure, the team is encouraged to use a checklist to review the necessary equipment and perform a "time out" procedure to verify the identity of the patient and the site of catheterization.

The proper aseptic preparatory technique includes hand washing, donning sterile gloves, cleansing the insertion area with chlorhexidine, and applying a sterile covering of the insertion site with a bio-occlusive tape. Once these tasks are completed, the puncture site may be determined by palpation, doppler auditory assistance, or ultrasound guidance.
