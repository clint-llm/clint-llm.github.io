This disease cannot be completely cured. Supportive treatment of Fabry disease is to replace the deficient enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (alpha or beta) as soon the diagnosis is made, regardless of the presence or absence of clinical manifestations in affected males and patients on renal replacement therapy. Female carriers and affected males with decreased levels of Alpha-Gal A should get enzyme replacement only in the presence of kidney, heart, or neurological features. Patients on long-term dialysis should also receive enzyme replacement therapy. Hypertension in these patients should be managed with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker.

Either enzyme alpha or beta replacement infusions should be given every two weeks according to body weight calculations. Precautions should be taken considering infusion-related reactions. Slow infusion over one to two hours, along with prior administration of antipyretics, should be considered.

Fabry disease patients with end-stage renal disease can be safely considered for renal transplantation with the continued enzyme replacementÂ post-transplant.
