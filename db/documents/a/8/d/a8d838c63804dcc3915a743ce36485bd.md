Hydralazine is a direct vasodilator used orally to treat essential hypertension, among other diseases, and intravenously to rapidly reduce blood pressure in hypertensive urgency or emergency. Per JNC 8 guidelines, it is not a first-line agent for the treatment of essential hypertension. This is due to hydralazineâ€™s stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, among several other adverse effects that make the current newer first-line agents more efficacious. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, administration, contraindications, and adverse effects of hydralazine.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for initiating hydralazine therapy.
- Summarize the theorized mechanism of action of hydralazine.
- Discuss the parameters of hydralazine administration.
- Outline how an interprofessional team can coordinate the use and monitoring of hydralazine to obtain the best patient outcomes.
