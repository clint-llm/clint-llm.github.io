Studies have shown tympanoplasty to be successful in over 93% of patients (in patients undergoing primary tympanoplasty using temporalis fascia graft).

One large case series analyzing over 1000 patients undergoing cartilage tympanoplasty reported recurrence of TM perforation in 3.6% to 4.2% of patients (patients with cholesteatoma and high-risk perforations respectively) and conductive hearing loss requiring revision in 1.9% (high-risk perforations with/without patients with cholesteatoma) to 11% of patients (patients undergoing TM repair to improve hearing).

There are important neural structures that cross the middle ear, namely the facial nerve and chorda tympani. The facial nerve runs within the temporal bone and continues along the posterior wall of the tympanic cavity, superior to the oval window.Â Iatrogenic injury to the facial nerve is fortunately low due to the extensive training of otology surgeons performing tympanoplasty. The chorda tympani will always be confronted during middle ear surgery, and in CSOM with cholesteatoma, it may have to be sacrificed in order to get full disease clearance.
