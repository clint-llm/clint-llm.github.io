Numerous conditions can present with similar symptomatology asÂ carcinomatous meningitis and should be taken into consideration whenever patients present with indistinguishable signs and symptoms.

- Intraparenchymal primary brain lesions or metastasis can present with similar symptoms. Calvarial and dura matter involvement should be ruled out. Leptomeningeal metastasis can present separately or co-exist with the involvement of these regions.

- Chronic or recurrent meningitis caused by a variety of bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal organisms can also resemble CM. Autoimmune and drug-induced causes of meningitis should also be considered.

- Paraneoplastic syndromes, including Lambert Eaton syndrome, Myasthenic crises, cerebellar degeneration, encephalomyelitis, neuropathies, and limbic encephalitis, can mimic CM and are associated with advanced-stage disease.
