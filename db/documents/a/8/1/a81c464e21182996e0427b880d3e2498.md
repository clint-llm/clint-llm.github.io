Patient education is very vital in the management of bullous systemic lupus erythematosus. For a few, this may present as the first manifestation of SLE, which is a chronic, autoimmune condition with several multiorgan involvements. Educate these patients on the early signs and symptoms of organ involvement, photoprotection with sunscreen, and the need for medication adherence.

BSLE poses significant stress related to discomfort, aesthetics, and concern of skin complications. Support groups and behavioral therapy may be needed in such cases.
