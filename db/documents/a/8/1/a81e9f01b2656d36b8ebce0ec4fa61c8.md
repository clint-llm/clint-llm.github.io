Frequent monitoring of blood levels of midazolam and its metabolites is a requirement during the treatment of midazolam overdose. Levels of midazolam and its metabolites can are measurable in blood, plasma, and serum. Monitoring is essential for elderly individuals and individuals with liver and kidney disease. The elimination of both the drug and its metabolite decreases with renal insufficiency. Monitoring is also necessary for drug interactions with erythromycin, clarithromycin, diltiazem, sertraline, protease inhibitors, rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, opioids, antipsychotics, and alcohol. Induction and inhibition of CYP450 3A4 play a role in decreased and increased drug levels in the circulation. Grapefruit juice reduces the activity of the CYP 450 enzyme and increases the level of the drug. St. John's wortÂ induces the enzyme and reduces the blood level of midazolam.
