Periodic paralysis is a group of inherited diseases that present as episodic muscle weakness and paralysis. Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis (HYPP,Â HyperKPP) is a rare condition that begins in childhood and can continue until middle adulthood or may even last into late adulthood. It presents as muscle weakness, ranging from mild weakness to paralysis. During these episodes, it is common to have higher than normal blood levels of potassium.

The condition is caused by a mutation in the SCN4A gene that codes for voltage-gated sodium channel Na1.4. Several diagnostic modalities exist in assisting diagnosis, such as genetic testing, although they are not always definitive. Treatment for HYPP is both proactive and reactive, with avoidance of triggers being the mainstay of therapy. It is important to diagnosis this condition quickly and accurately as long-term complications, including weakness and fatigue, can lead to a decrease in the quality of life.
