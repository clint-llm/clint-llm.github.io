Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity have correlations with the use of vancomycin.

Although there are numerous case reports of acute renal failure attributed to vancomycin use, there is currently limited data suggesting a direct causal relationship. The proposed mechanism of nephrotoxicity is renal tubular ischemia due to the oxidative effect of vancomycin on cells of the proximal renal tubule. Common risk factors for nephrotoxicity include preexisting renal impairment, concurrent use of nephrotoxic medications, advanced age, and dehydration. Although vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity is commonly reversible, it can be challenging to differentiate it from acute interstitial nephritis and worsening renal function due to uncontrolled infection. Vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity is identifiable by increases in serum creatinine in the absence of a causative explanation. Dosing vancomycin based on estimated creatinine clearance is a commonly used technique to prevent nephrotoxicity. Patients who experience signs of acute renal failure precipitated by vancomycin use should promptly discontinue their therapy. It is also important to note that there are reports of cases of nephrotoxicity with both oral and intravenous vancomycin use. Cases of nephrotoxicity associated with oral vancomycin have typically been in patients over 65.

Ototoxicity is a rare complication associated with vancomycin monotherapy. It is common in patients receiving excessive vancomycin doses, concurrent ototoxic medications (e.g., aminoglycosides, loop diuretics, antineoplastic agents), and those with underlying hearing loss conditions. Treatment should stop if patients experience signs of cytotoxicity, such as tinnitus, loss of hearing, and unbalanced movements. It merits noting that vancomycin-induced ototoxicity may be irreversible in some cases. Auditory function testing may be beneficial to identify early symptoms.
