The subclavian arteries are protected by the skin, the clavicle, the superficial fascia, platysma, the supraclavicular nerves, and deep cervical fascia. Subclavian injuries from trauma are rarely reported in the pediatric population due to the increased elasticity of the chest wall and vessels. However, the presence of a scapular fracture in a pediatric patient should raise the suspicion of a subclavian artery injury.

The embryologic origin of the right subclavian artery is from the right fourth aortic arch, the right dorsal aorta, and the right 7th intersegmental arteries. The right subclavian artery arises from the innominate artery typically above the sternoclavicular joint, where it branches into the right subclavian artery and the carotid artery. Common anatomic variations include the artery arises below the sternoclavicular joint and the right subclavian artery arising directly from the aorta.

The left subclavian artery has a different anatomic pattern, which influences the surgical approach. The embryologic origin of the left subclavian artery is the left seventh intersegmental artery. It arises directly from the arch of the aorta, and it typically does not traverse above the clavicle into the neck as the right subclavian artery does. The first part of the artery lies deep, and it is difficult to access surgically. The third portion of the left subclavian artery is lateral to the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
