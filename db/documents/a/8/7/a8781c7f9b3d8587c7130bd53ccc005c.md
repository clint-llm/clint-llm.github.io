Patients with SCA present with acute and chronic complications.

**Management of Acute Complications**

**Pain management**is a critical part of SCA. It is challenging for clinicians to accurately assess patients' needs, especially if they meet them for the first time. Patients with SCA often suffer from the stigma of requiring high doses of opioids for pain control, which leads to them being labeled as 'opioid abusers,' 'manipulators,' or even' drug seekers.'

- Analgesic administration starts simultaneous with evaluating the cause, ideally within 30 minutes of triage and 60 minutes of registration.

- Develop individualized pain management plans - this should be made available to the emergency room and should be implemented each time the patient presents with VOC and pain.

- NSAIDs are used in patients with mild to moderate pain who report prior episodes of relief with NSAIDs

- Opioids:

- Any patient presenting with severe pain- preferably used parenteral opioids. An intravenous route is preferred; however, if access is difficult, use the subcutaneous route.
- The dose of parenteral opioids is calculated based on the total dose of short-acting oral opioids taken at home.
- Pain should be reassessed every 15 to 30 minutes, and readminister opioids if needed. The escalation of opioids is done in 25% increments.
- Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is preferred. If an "on-demand" setting is used in PCA, then continue long-acting analgesia.
- When pain control is achieved, "wean off" parenteral opioids before converting to oral medications.
- Calculate the inpatient analgesic requirement at discharge and adjust home doses of short and long-acting opioids accordingly.

- Meperidine is not used in managing VOC-related pain unless this is the only medication that controls the pain.

- Antihistamines only help in controlling opioid-related itching. When required, use oral formulations only—readminister every 4 to 6 hours as needed.

- Supportive measures should be instituted along with pain management

- Incentive spirometry
- Intravenous hydration
- Supplemental oxygen is needed only if saturation drops below 95% on the room air.

**Management of Chronic Pain**

Chronic pain management in SCA patients focuses on the safe and adequate use of pain medications, particularly opioids. A comprehensive assessment of the patient's ailment, the kind and doses of pain medicine required to control pain, and the functional outcomes of using these medications are made at each encounter. The process involves collaboration with multiple specialties, like psychiatry, social work, etc., to administer the right pain medicine in the proper doses.

The strategy adopted in the clinic to prescribe pain medicine involves:

- One person must be assigned to prescribe long-term opioids. They should document all encounters extensively involving the physical exam, lab work, etc.

- Assess each patient for non-SCA-related pain and treat/refer to the appropriate specialty for managing this pain.

- Limit prescribing pain medicines without meeting the patient- every patient must be physically assessed every 2 to 3 months or sooner.

- Develop an individualized pain management plan for each patient, reassess this plan annually, and modify it accordingly.

- Encourage patients to explore alternative methods of controlling pain, like direct massage, self-hypnosis, and music therapy.

**Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS):**It is an emergency regardless of the sickle cell disease phenotype. It can lead to respiratory failure and death if not managed as an emergency.

- All patients must be hospitalized-

- Upon admission, start treatment with antibiotics, including coverage for atypical bacteria.

- Supplemental oxygen is provided to those with oxygen saturation of less than 95% at room air.

- "Early" administration of simple blood transfusion is recommended for hypoxic patients. However, exchange transfusion is recommended at the earliest opportunity.

- Close monitoring for worsening respiratory status, increasing oxygen requirement, worsening anemia, and bronchospasm (use of beta-adrenergic dilators is encouraged in asthmatics) must be done. Intensive care units must be on standby to receive such patients who experience worsening respiratory status.

- Closely monitor predictors of severity- increasing respiratory rate, worsening hypoxia, decreasing hemoglobin or platelet count, multilobar involvement on chest X-ray, and developing neurological complications.

- Incentive spirometry and hydration (intravenous or oral) must always be encouraged.

- ACS is a strong indicator for initiating disease-modifying therapy (hydroxyurea, etc.) or starting the patient on a chronic blood transfusion program.

**Sequestration Crises**

- Intravenous fluids for hydration, pain control, and simple/exchange blood transfusion are central to managing sequestration crises.

- Never correct anemia completely- when the crises resolve, and the organs shrink, the sequestered blood re-enters the circulation, leading to increased hematocrit and viscosity, increasing the risk of thrombotic and ischemic events.

- Splenectomy is recommended for patients with life-threatening episode splenic sequestration crises or with recurrent splenic sequestration. It is also offered to those who have baseline hypersplenism.

- Instruct patients and parents in monitoring the size of the liver and spleen regularly.

**Acute Stroke:**Urgent neurology and transfusion medicine consultation are needed to provide optimal care and prevent long-term damage.

- Simple or exchange blood transfusion emergently.

- Start a program of chronic exchanges or blood transfusion.

- Where blood transfusion cannot be used (iron overload, excessive alloantibodies) or is unavailable, start on long-term disease-modifying therapy. SWiTCH trial demonstrated that chronic transfusions are a better way to manage patients with stroke.

**Aplastic Crises:**Parvovirus infections cause a transient drop in hemoglobin. Humoral immunity develops within 7 to 10 days that stays for life. The patient is extremely susceptible to developing ACS or stroke during the acute period. Initiate exchange/simple transfusion to bring Hb to a safe level, not necessarily to normal/baseline level.

**Infections presenting with fever:**Oral empiric antibiotics are given promptly while evaluating the reason for the fever. For ill-appearing patients, admit them and administer intravenous antibiotics.

**Priapism:**Early recognition is the key to management. Delayed management can lead to impotence. Urologists need to be involved early on in the care of such patients.

- Conservative measures include using analgesics, hydration, and sedation - which usually leads to detumescence and retains potency. Most experts would call for upfront urologic management rather than losing time trying conservative measures.

- Urologists can perform penile aspiration or irrigation of corpora cavernosa with alpha-adrenergic drugs.

- Blood transfusion/ exchange transfusion is not useful - few authors have reported neurological complications with the use of blood transfusion (ASPEN syndrome). Hence it is best to avoid blood transfusion.

**Acute ocular Complications:**All ocular complications must be managed in consultation with ophthalmologists and hematologists to prevent vision loss.

- Hyphema- Anterior chamber paracentesis or surgical intervention to manage the thrombus must be done promptly.

- Reducing intraocular pressure helps prevent CRAO and other compression issues.

- Infections are managed with prompt administration of antibiotics.

- Corticosteroids are used to relieve excessive pressure in patients with OCS.

**Chronic Complications**

**Avascular Necrosis:**About 40 to 80% of cases of hip joint AVN are bilateral; therefore, both joints should be investigated simultaneously. Pain management and physical therapy are to be initiated as early as possible. Advanced cases may require hip arthroplasty.

**Leg Ulcer:**Conservative measures involve wound care, wet-to-dry dressings, and pain control. Hydroxyurea is avoided in patients with open leg ulcers, as it may prevent healing. Frequent evaluation for the stage of healing or lack of infection, osteomyelitis must be done. Local and systemic antibiotics are used for infected ulcers.

**Pulmonary Hypertension:**Patients with higher TRV are referred to pulmonologists for management. Small studies have shown increased mortality with sildenafil.

**Renal Complications:**Refer SCA patients with micro- or microalbuminuria to nephrologists for detailed workup and consideration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-inhibitor). Follow patients closely who have modest elevation in creatinine (>0.7 mg/dL in children, >1.0 mg/dL in adults), and refer to a nephrologist at the earliest sign of worsening creatinine.

**Ophthalmologic Complications:**Refer SCA patients regularly for ophthalmologic evaluation, especially if they complain of slow vision changes. Direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and fluorescein angiography are used to evaluate SCA patients. Laser photocoagulation therapy is used to manage proliferative sickle retinopathy. A vitrectomy or retinal repair may be needed in the rare event of vitreal hemorrhage or retinal detachment.

**Iron Overload**

Unlike hemochromatosis, phlebotomy is not an option in patients with SCA. Preventing iron overload with good transfusion practices is the best way to deal with iron overload. Patients with SCA need not follow the rule of having hemoglobin close to 7gm/dL. Packed RBC transfusion should be restricted to the management of symptoms. Choosing exchange transfusion over simple transfusion also helps to reduce/prevent iron overload.

Indications to start iron chelation therapy

- A liver iron concentration (LIC) greater than 3 mg iron (Fe)/gm dry weight

- Cardiac T2* < 20 milliseconds

- Serum ferritin greater than 1000 on two different occasions 15 days apart

- Populations that should be considered for iron overload therapy

- Age greater than two years
- Expected survival beyond one year
- Number of transfusion of Packed RBC in 1 year- > 10 in pediatric patients OR > 20 in adults.

Goals of therapy

- Serum ferritin < 1000 mcg/L,

- LIC <7mg Fe/gm dry weight

- Cardiac T2* > 20 milliseconds

When do patients need modification of treatment?

- Treatment needs to be intensified if LIC > 15 mg Fe/gm dry weight and deescalated when LIC < 3 mg Fe/gm dry weight.

- Treatment needs to be intensified if serum ferritin > 2500 IU/L and deescalated when serum ferritin < 300 IU/L

- Treatment needs to be intensified when cardiac MRI shows T2* < 15 milliseconds or when cardiac symptoms occur (like heart failure, arrhythmias)

Iron Chelators

- Deferasirox:

- Disperse tab formulation: Initial dose: 10mg/kg/day. Maximum dose: 20mg/kg/day
- Tablet or granule formulation: Initial dose: 7mg/kg/day. Maximum dose: 14mg/kg/day
- It does not interfere with the pharmacodynamics of hydroxyurea; hence it can be used simultaneously.
- Adverse effects- gastrointestinal intolerance, dose-dependent rise in serum creatinine, liver dysfunction.

- Deferoxamine injection:

- Daily subcutaneous infusions via portable infusion pump given over 8 to 24 hours; 1 to 2 gm/day 
- It can be given as a daily IV infusion also. 40 to 50 mg/kg/day (max dose 60 mg/kg/day) over 8 to 12 hours (max rate 15 mg/kg/hour) 
- IM route is acceptable for children but not preferred for adults. 0.5 to 1mg/day
- Adverse effects- Injection site reactions, cardiovascular shock (if administered too fast), blood dyscrasias, growth retardation.

- Deferiprone (Approved for thalassemia only); oral drug NOT approved for SCA by US FDA.

- Adverse effects - agranulocytosis, hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal symptoms, and arthralgia.

**Blood transfusion:**Blood transfusions form an integral part of the management of SCA. The goal of transfusion is to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood and reduce the HbS component. A blood transfusion (simple or exchange) is given to keep the HbS level below 30% (STOP 1 and 2 trials).

**What types of blood transfusion are used in SCA?**

- Simple transfusion: Transfusion of matched packed red blood cells (PRBC)

- Exchange transfusion: Transfusion of PRBC while removing blood from the patient at the same time.

**Who should receive blood transfusions?**

- Pregnant females have high maternal-fetal morbidity if Hb is below 7 gm/dL.

- Hb < 7gm/dL or drop of >2 gm/dL from baseline- consider simple or exchange transfusion. 
- Twin pregnancy- consider prophylactic exchange transfusion

- Preoperative transfusion for medium-risk surgery (cholecystectomy, joint replacement)- transfuse to maintain Hb above 10gm/dL

- Hb less than 9 gm/dL- Simple transfusion
- Hb more than 9gm/dL- Partial exchange transfusion

**What kind of transfusion practice should be followed?**

- Exchange transfusion

- Severe ACS - oxygen saturation less than 90% even when started on supplemental oxygen. 
- Multiorgan Failure
- Acute ischemic stroke

- Simple transfusion

- Splenic sequestration - never corrects the anemia completely.
- Acute anemia

**Complications from Chronic Transfusions**

- Alloimmunization- increases the risk of transfusion reactions, especially delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions.

- Iron overload

- Transmission of blood-borne diseases like hepatitis B, C, and HIV; extremely low risk due to intensive screening of donors and blood products.
