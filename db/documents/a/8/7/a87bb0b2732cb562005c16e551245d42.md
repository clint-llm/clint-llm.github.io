The most common presentation of statin overdose is muscle toxicity. In case of severe muscle symptoms or rhabdomyolysis, statins therapy should stop immediately, and patients require symptomatic care. This care includes adequate fluid resuscitation, monitoring urine output, and correcting electrolyte imbalances, especially hyperkalemia. There is no antidote available for statin overdose. After the recovery from an overdose, patients should restart on low-dose statins.
