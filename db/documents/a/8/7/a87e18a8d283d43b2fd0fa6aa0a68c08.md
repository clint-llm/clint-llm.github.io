Papules, pustules with the absence of true comedones, are present mainly over trunk and back. Rarely nodulocystic lesions can be seen. Unlike acne, these lesions may occur in other parts of the body besides the face. When the cause is due to a drug eruption, the patient will usually state that the lesions disappearÂ once they discontinue the medication.
