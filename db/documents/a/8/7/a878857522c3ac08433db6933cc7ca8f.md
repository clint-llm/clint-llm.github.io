Erythromycin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to this drug. In addition, as erythromycin may cause serious rashes in a small number of patients, anyone who has experienced similar symptoms in the past should avoid future use of the drug. Due to the increased risk of myopathy, do not use erythromycin with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (simvastatin or lovastatin).

Patients with a prolonged QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG) should not use erythromycin. A normal QTc interval would be less than 440 ms in males and less than 460 ms in females. Anyone using a medication that prolongs the QT interval should be very cautious and monitor if adding erythromycin. Similarly, patients with long QT syndrome (LQTS) should not use erythromycin. Patients who have had a past medical history of episodes of torsades de pointes should avoid QT-prolonging drugs such as erythromycin. Erythromycin is contraindicated in patients taking terfenadine, astemizole, or cisapride.
