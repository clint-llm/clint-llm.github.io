The human body attempts to maintain homeostasis. When a substance is removed from the body, the residual counter-regulatory mechanisms produce unopposed effects, and withdrawal symptoms occur.

**Alcohol**Alcohol intoxication and withdrawal are complex. Most effects can be explained by the interaction of alcohol with neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (NMDA),**Opioids**

In opioid or benzodiazepine addiction, chronic stimulation of specific receptors for these drugs suppresses endogenous production of neurotransmitters, endorphins or GABA. Removal of the exogenous drug allows unopposed counter-regulatory effects. When the exogenous drug is removed, inadequate production of endogenous transmitters and unopposed stimulation by counter-regulatory transmitters results in withdrawal symptoms. The time it takesÂ to restore homeostasis by the synthesis of endogenous transmitters determines the onset of withdrawal symptoms.
