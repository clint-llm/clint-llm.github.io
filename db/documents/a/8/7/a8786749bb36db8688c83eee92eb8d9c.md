Treatment and disposition of stable thyrotoxicosis can be managed in an outpatient setting with a primary care physician or with an endocrinologist.

If the patient presents in an acute thyroid storm, they will need admission to the hospital requiring close monitoring in an intensive care unit with an interdisciplinary care team including critical care attendings, nurses, PT/OT if needed, and pharmacists. As this condition is usually triggered by undiagnosed or excess thyroid hormone in the setting of an acute triggering event, other specialists need to be consulted as needed to help address the underlying cause of what precipitated the thyroid storm.
