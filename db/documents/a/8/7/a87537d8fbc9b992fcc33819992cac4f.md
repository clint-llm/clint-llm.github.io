The prognosis of AIN depends on the etiology and age at presentation. Primary AIN in the pediatric population is suggested by recurrent infections, which are usually benign and can be treated with antimicrobial agents and if severe with G-CSF and bone marrow transplant in cases such as CGD and LAD.

Secondary AIN in the adult population is associated with decreased immunity and infections, which can be treated with antimicrobial agents, immunosuppressants, biological agents, and in severe cases, plasmapheresis. AIN and CIN, as a result of chemotherapy or drugs, resolve immediately after cessation of the treatment. While certain etiologies present with less severe mucosal infections, severe congenital conditions result in death at a young age. LAD can present with death in the first year of life, or patients with less severe LAD can live till the third decade with recurrent infections and can be managed with hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
