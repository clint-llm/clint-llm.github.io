When treated, FES is a manageable condition with minimal risk of complications and reduction of symptomatic complaints for patients. Untreated FES in patients may result in sight-threatening conditions, including dry eye and other ocular surface diseases. Patients with concomitant OSA and FES have seen improvement in both OSA symptoms and symptoms and FES and other dry eye conditions. Some studies have demonstrated full resolution of FES in patients who strictly adhered to CPAP therapy.

Not all patients may be responsive to conservative management of FES and will require corrective surgery.
