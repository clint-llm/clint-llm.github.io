The elimination half-life of sumatriptan is 1 to 4 hours, and the therapeutic plasma drug concentrations range from 0.013 to 0.095 mg/L. Sumatriptan daily doses in adults should not exceed 300 mg orally, 40 mg intranasally, 12 mg parenterally, and 13 mg transdermally (two patches). The risk of serotonin syndrome increases if patients use drugs that increase serotonin (e.g., ecstasy, St. Johns wort, paroxetine, fluoxetine, venlafaxine, duloxetine). Explain to patients to watch for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome if those medicines are added or increased in dose.
