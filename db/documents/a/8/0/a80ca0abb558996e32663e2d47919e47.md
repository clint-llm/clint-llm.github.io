Androgen sensitivity and stimulation have been suggested as one of the main factors involved in the pathogenesis of Becker nevus. The onset of the lesions during adolescence, male preponderance, associated features like hypertrichosis and acneiform lesions, have all beenÂ linked to the role of androgens in the pathophysiology. Some studies have reported an increased amount of androgen receptors in the lesional skin. Post-zygotic mutations in beta-actin have been reported in association with both Becker nevus and Becker nevus syndrome.
