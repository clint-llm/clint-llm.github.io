Based on Doppler studies, the earliest signs of failed placentation are likely not to be detected until at least after 12 weeks gestation, which correlates with a prospective cohort study that demonstrated screening placental function in high-risk pregnancies in the second versus first trimester was a better predictor for adverse perinatal outcomes.

When discussing placental insufficiency, there are going to be at least two teams, if not more, contributing to the care of the patients, as one team will be responsible for monitoring the mother and the fetus prenatally, and another team that will care for the neonate post-natally. Managing both mother and an IUGR-baby requires an interdisciplinary team composed of Ob/Gynâ€™s, neonatal intensivists, both Ob and NICU nurses, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, pulmonologists, and sometimes other specialties including surgery, infectious disease, or genetics.

For the IUGR neonate, they often develop chronic lung disease secondary to their prematurity and may require multiple medications as well as home oxygen management, or they may develop multiple infections including necrotizing enterocolitis or late-onset sepsis, all of which requires coordination between the above-mentioned teams to provide improved outcomes for the patient. At times, depending on the outcome of the pregnancy, it will be important to involve an ethics committee or a palliative care team. Often it is easier for the families if family meetings can be organized where at least one member from each specialty team is present, as this improves communication between all teams and affords families the chance to ask their questions from all the specialists at once.
