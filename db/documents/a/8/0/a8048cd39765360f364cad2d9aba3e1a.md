As per the manufacturer's prescribing label, due to the increased bleeding risk, patients should be closely monitored for GI bleeding; the recommendation is to obtain aÂ complete blood count (CBC) at baseline and periodically after that. Since this medication primarily undergoes hepatic metabolism, liver function tests should be checked at baseline and regularly monitored, especially in patients with liver compromise. Renal function assessment is necessary via creatinine and urine output before administering this medication and followed closely, given that ketorolac is excreted renally and can cause renal damage.
