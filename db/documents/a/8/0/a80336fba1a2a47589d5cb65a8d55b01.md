Documented hypersensitivity to sucralfate is an absolute contraindication as it can cause an anaphylactic reaction. Some of the relative contraindications include end-stage renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia, impaired swallowing/gag reflex. Sucralfate was an FDA category B medication under the prior pregnancy classification system, and its safety in pregnancy, during breastfeeding, and in infants is not established. The drug may also be used during breastfeeding, although no human data is available.

Sucralfate may also decrease the absorption or delay the onset of action of several drugs; some medications that are so affected include:

- Naproxen (delayed onset of action)

- Potassium phosphate

- Leveoketoconazole

- Deferasirox

- Baloxavir

Sucralfate may also affect other medications, so a complete medication reconciliation should be performed prior to initiating therapy.
