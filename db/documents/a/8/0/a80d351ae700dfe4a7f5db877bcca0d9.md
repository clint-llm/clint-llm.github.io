The pectoral muscles are the group of skeletal muscles that connect the upper extremities to the anterior and lateral thoracic walls. Juxtaposed with the regional fascia, these muscles are responsible for moving the upper extremities in a wide range of motion. These include but are not limited to flexion, adduction, and internal rotation of the humerus, stabilization of the scapula, as well as elevating and depressing the bones of the thorax. The primary muscles involved in these actions include the pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, serratus anterior, and subclavius.
