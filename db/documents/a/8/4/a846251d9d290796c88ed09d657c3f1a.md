Muscle aerobic activity improves the function of the popliteal artery: its endothelium, its ramifications, its elasticity, and its ability to transport oxygen and nutrients useful to the target tissues.

The popliteal artery provides blood supply to theÂ soleus, gastrocnemius, plantaris, and distal portions of the hamstring muscles.
