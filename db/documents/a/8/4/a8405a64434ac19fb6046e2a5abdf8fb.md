The pancreas is a retroperitoneal organ and located within the C-loop of the duodenum. It is divided into the head, uncinate process, neck, body, and tail. The head and the uncinate process are supplied by superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries, which are branches from the gastroduodenal artery and middle colic artery. The neck, body, and tail of the pancreas receive blood supply from the splenic artery through the dorsal pancreatic artery, greater pancreatic artery, and transverse pancreatic artery. The head of the pancreas is primarily drained by the four pancreaticoduodenal veins, whereas they drain into the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) or portal vein (PV). The neck, body, and tail of the pancreas have venous drainage into the splenic vein. The main duct of the pancreas (Wirsung) begins in the tail, runs the entire length of the pancreas, and opens into the second part of the duodenum together with the bile duct on the major duodenal papilla.

There are several critical anatomical considerations in pancreatic surgery. The pancreas shares the same blood supply with the C-loop of the duodenum, necessitating the removal of the C-loop of the duodenum together with the pancreas.  The uncinate process which arises from the lower part of the head of the pancreas extends superiorly and posteriorly behind the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) is recognized as essential surgical anatomy.

Variation in vascular anatomy in this region is uncommon compared to biliary variation; however, there is some relevant variation that needs to be borne in mind. Replaced right hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery occurs around 12% of the population.

The neck of the pancreas lies behind the portal vein confluence and is also the origin of the superior mesenteric artery(SMA). SMV located to the right of SMA; thus, SMV is the first vascular structure that one will encounter in the duodenal curvature.  In the Cattell-Braasch maneuver, where the right-sided viscera is rotated to the left, the critical structure is inferior vena cava(IVC) and abdominal aorta. The left renal vein crossing across the aorta to drain into IVC is a crucial anatomical observation. The tortuous splenic artery runs along the superior border of the pancreas. The splenic vein runs posteriorly to the body of the pancreas.
