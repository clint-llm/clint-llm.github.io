Additional advanced imaging studies have not shown proven benefits for evaluating pituitary lesions. For example, pituitary lesions are often discovered incidentally on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) studies, but there is poor characterization since gamma camera resolution is more than 1 cm. FDG-PET is also limited since the brain uses glucose as its primary metabolite, which offers no distinction between tumor hypermetabolism and normal brain metabolism.

Radionuclide cisternography is a method that may be useful in the detection of occult cerebrospinal fluid leaks. In this technique, a radionuclide is injected into the CSF via lumbar puncture and then later imaged via a gamma camera. CSF leak is confirmed if scintigraphy demonstrates the accumulation of radioisotope in the region of the presumed leak. For patients with sellar lesions or chronic intracranial hypertension, expansion of the sella and thinning of the posterior wall of the sphenoid sinuses may result in eventual breakdown and herniation. Similar processes can occur through the ethmoid sinuses and cribriform plate. Typically, patients receive high-resolution skull base CT imaging for evaluation of bony abnormalities in patients with CSF leaks or presumed skull base lesions. However, if CT imaging is unrevealing, radionuclide cisternography may prove to be a useful ancillary study.
