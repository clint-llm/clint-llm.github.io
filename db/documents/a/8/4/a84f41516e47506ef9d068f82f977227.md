A thorough history can point practitioners in the right direction when evaluating a patient with ankle instability or pain. A history of recurrent or recent ankle sprains can raise a red flag to guide a physician for a more in-depth examination of the ankle and its stability. Patients will often report repeated episodes of the ankle “giving way” on uneven terrain or a feeling of looseness and may be especially mindful of specific activities in which they are aware they may have the potential for injuries. Pain itself can also be a complaint, though generally not the chief complaint.

Physical of examination of the foot and ankle when approaching ankle instability should always include assessment of alignment, as individual factors such as cavus or varus may predispose patient to recurrent instability. Hypermobility should also be a consideration when initially evaluating patients as laxity may predispose to further injury. The range of motion and strength are also crucial to a full examination, especially when compared to the contralateral extremity. Stress examinations including the talar tilt and anterior drawer test individually evaluate the lateral ankle ligaments. The Anterior drawer should be performed with the foot in 20 plantarflexion, and then compared to the contralateral extremity. A shift during the anterior drawer test of more than 8mm is considered pathological. The talar tilt examination assesses CFL integrity, and a value of greater than 10 degrees or more than 5 degrees compared to the contralateral side is considered pathological when viewed on a radiograph. Physiological talar tilt can range from 5 to 23 degrees.
