Ocular involvement in paraneoplastic pemphigus is common and thus should be closely monitored. Early ophthalmology referral is key to prevent vision loss and blindness. Ocular therapy may include the use of topical corticosteroid drops, artificial tears, and 10% N-acetylcysteine, and sometimes requires surgical intervention in cases of extensive scarring.

Bronchiolitis obliterans, presenting with a dry cough, dyspnea, and hypoxemia, affects an estimated 30% to 90% of PNP patients.

Epidermal erosions and blister rupture may cause significant fluid, protein, and electrolyte losses resulting in dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Breaching and subsequent loss of the skin barrier also predispose patients to infection and sepsis, compounded by the effect of immunosuppressive therapies used to treat PNP and the underlying malignancy. Mucosal lesions are often resistant and persistent even after intensive treatment.

Dehydration and malnutrition secondary to painful oropharyngeal erosions may occur. Thus a nasogastric tube may be required in some patients.
