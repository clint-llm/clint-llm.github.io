The NMDA receptor has anÂ integral role in synaptic plasticity and can delicately control ion permeability into the cell. Therefore, it is not surprising that it is virtually ubiquitous throughout the central nervous system. For example, roughly 80% of cortical neurons feature NMDA receptors. They preferentially express on pyramidal neurons. Curiously, they are also present on astrocytes, glial cells traditionally thought to support neurons.

NMDA receptors exist within the peripheral nervous system.
