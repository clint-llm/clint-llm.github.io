The family history of glaucoma and consanguineous marriage between parents is mandatory and should never be missed.

The clinical examination must include the following:

- Fixation of light – The patient’s ability to fixate and follow light should be tested with each eye separately. There may be exotropia due to poor fixation and nystagmus in long-standing cases.

- Sclera – might give bluish discoloration because of high myopia, scleral thinning, and exposure of underlying uveal tissue.

- Cornea – Corneal examination might reveal signs of corneal enlargement, also called buphthalmos. Normal corneal size from birth to up to 6 months should be between 9.5 to 11.5 mm. A size of more than 12 mm should raise the suspicion of glaucoma. A corneal diameter of more than 13 mm in any child thereafter is also an indicator of corneal enlargement. The slit-lamp examination might reveal tears and breaks in the Descemet’s membrane called Haab’s striae (horizontal or oblique tears in the Descemet membrane). Another important finding is corneal edema. This usually starts as epithelial edema and then gradually involves the deeper layers of the cornea, occasionally causing permanent opacities impairing vision profoundly.

- Anterior chamber- The anterior chamber is usually deep.

- Iris – should be looked for iridodonesis, ectropion uvea, hypoplasia, or any atrophic patches.

- Pupil - May be oval, dilated, and ischemic.

- Lens – the clinician should look for lenticular opacities or any subluxation of the lens due to excessive stretching of zonules.

- Optic disc- this typically shows reversible cupping in the early stages. Later stages may present with an enlarged cup disc ratio or even atrophy.

- Intraocular pressure – IOP is usually raised at presentation and can be measured using a pneumotonmeter in the outpatient department.
