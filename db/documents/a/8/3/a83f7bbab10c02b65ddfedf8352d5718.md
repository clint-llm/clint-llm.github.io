In addition to the abovementioned disorders, platelet membrane receptors are also the target of numerous pharmacologic agents. ADP receptor inhibitors, such as clopidogrel or ticagrelor, irreversibly block P2Y12 receptors, preventing the ADP-induced expression of GPIIb/IIIa. Furthermore, drugs such as abciximab and eptifibatide bind to and block GPIIb/IIIa receptors. Thus, both drug classes inhibit platelet aggregation and are used clinically in acute coronary syndrome. Total platelet count requires monitored with the use of these drugs to avoid the risk of bleeding.

Aspirin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug commonly used to treat fever and pain, has also been prescribed to lower the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in patients with known cardiovascular disease. Aspirin’s role in decreasing mortality after MI and preventing future events is due to its irreversible inhibition of both cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 enzymes, known for producing prostanoids such as TXA2. Thus, aspirin effectively acts as an antithrombotic medication by inhibiting platelet aggregation even at low doses. As expected, bleeding time increases in patients who consume aspirin, and the drug’s irreversible effect persists until the body produces new platelets.
