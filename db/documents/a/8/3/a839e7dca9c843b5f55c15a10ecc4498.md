Iatrogenic trauma during open surgery, laparoscopy, or endoscopic procedures is the most common cause of ureteral injury. Suture ligation of the ureter, sharp incision and transection, avulsion, devascularization, and heat energies can cause ureteral damage. Most iatrogenic ureteral injuries involve the pelvic ureter.

Ureteral trauma is very rare and is thought to comprise less than 1% of blunt and penetrating genitourinary trauma. It is most common with gunshot wounds, with the proximal ureter is most commonly involved.

Ureteral injuries can be classified based on location:

- Ureteropelvic junction (UPJ)

- Abdominal ureter (UPJ to iliac vessels)

- Pelvic ureter (inferior to iliac vessels)

Ureteral injuries can be classified based on when the diagnosis is made:

- Immediate diagnosis (diagnosed shortly after injury)

- Delayed diagnosis (diagnosed long after surgery)

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) classifies ureteral injuries as follows:

- Grade I – hematoma; contusion or hematoma without devascularization

- Grade II – laceration; less than 50% transection

- Grade III – laceration; 50% or greater transection

- Grade IV – laceration; complete transection with less than 2 cm of devascularization

- Grade V – laceration; avulsion with greater than 2 cm of devascularization
