Luspatercept is a medication used to manage and treat anemia in myelodysplastic syndromes, primary myelofibrosis, and beta-thalassemia. It is a recombinant fusion protein that binds transforming growth factor-beta ligands to reduce SMAD2 and SMAD3 signaling. This activity describes the indications, actions, and contraindications for luspatercept as a valuable agent in the management when applicable for interprofessional team members.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the indications for luspatercept in the management of anemia due to myelodysplastic syndromes, primary myelofibrosis, and beta-thalassemia. 
- Review the importance of luspatercept in reducing requirements for blood transfusions and iron overload and the risk factors for using blood transfusions and iron overload. 
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with anemia due to lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, beta-thalassemia, and primary myelofibrosis with blood transfusions.
- Identify the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients with anemia due to myelodysplastic syndrome, primary myelofibrosis, and beta-thalassemia patients who are undergoing blood transfusions.
