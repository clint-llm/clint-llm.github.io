Jessner lymphocytic infiltration of the skin (JLIS) used to represent a CD8+ polyclonal reactive skin disorder. The pathophysiology is yet unknown; however, the most popular theory involves plasmacytoid dendritic cell-directed migration of lymphocytes leading to an inappropriate accumulation of CD8+ T lymphocytes in the dermis. The etiology of the presence of clusters of plasmacytoid dendritic cells in the affected perivascular and periadnexal regions is yet unknown.
