Clinicians usually prescribe trihexyphenidyl for specific indications such as drug-induced parkinsonism. As discussed above, neurologists, psychiatrists, and movement disorder specialists play an important role in managing patients who require trihexyphenidyl therapy. Pharmacists should perform medication reconciliation and inform the clinicians in case of interactions. Nursing should monitor for compliance, signs of misuse, and clinical improvement over a period of time. Clinicians(MD, DO, PA, NP) play an important role in prescribing trihexyphenidyl and restrict its usage for only essential conditions. As the misuse of trihexyphenidyl is increasing, prescription drug monitoring programs(PDMP) can be really helpful.

In light of the recent systematic review, concomitant drug misuse is common with trihexyphenidyl; medical toxicologists should be consulted. Due to the potential toxicity of trihexyphenidyl, its dosing and management require an interprofessional healthcare team consisting of the clinician, nurse, and pharmacist monitoring the patient for complications and communicating any concerns to the healthcare team. This interprofessional approach will drive better outcomes while limiting the potential for drug misuse or adverse events. A respective study suggests that direct care of patients under medical toxicologist supervision is associated with significant reductions in length of hospital stay, costs, and mortality in patients hospitalized with a drug overdose.
