Genetic alterations in tubular carcinoma are uncommon. They mainly include chromosomes 16q (loss) (78 to 86%) and 1q (gain) (50 to 62%), and they often occur concomitantly.

Other alterations include loss of 8p, 3p (FHIT gene locus) and 16p gain and 11q (ATM gene locus). Gene expression profiling studies have proven that tubular carcinoma belongs to the “luminal A” molecular class of breast cancer.

Studies analyzing morphologic features of tumors arising in carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and non-BRCA1/2 families have not reported a frequent association of tubular carcinoma in these subsets of patients.
