The normal values of thyroid uptake of radiotracer are 3 to 16% at 6 hours and 8 to 25% at 24 hours. These values may change according to laboratory standard techniques or patient dietary habits.

The thyroid gland can uptake more or less than normal. More than normal uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid gland indicates hyperactive thyroid and less than normal uptake infers hypoactive thyroid gland, or interference with the uptake (see list of potential conditions described below).

- Following are some of the causes of increased uptake of radiotracer:

1) Hyperthyroidism due to Graves, multinodular goiter or thyroid adenoma

2) Goiter

3) Early-stage of Hashimoto thyroiditis

4) Iodine deficiency

5) The recovery phase from subacute, silent, or postpartum thyroiditis

6) Pregnancy

7) Lithium carbonate therapy

8) Withdrawl of antithyroid medication

9) Rebound after the suppression of thyrotropin

10) Congenital defects of thyroid hormone synthesis

- Some of the causes of decreased uptake of radiotracer are as follows:

1) Primary hypothyroidism

2) Central hypothyroidism

3) Destructive thyroiditis

- Subacute thyroiditis

- Silent thyroiditis

- Postpartum thyroiditis

4) Excess iodine

5) Dietary supplements

6) Radiological contrast

7) Medications

- Amiodarone

- Antithyroid drugs

- Perchlorate

- Thiocyanate

- Sulphonamides

- Sulphonylurea

- High-dose glucocorticosteroids

- Topical iodine

8) Post-thyroidectomy

9) External neck radiation
