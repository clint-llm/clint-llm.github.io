A cardiac team made up of interventional cardiologists, cath lab technicians, nurse practitioners/provider assistants, and cardiac catheterization laboratory are necessary to allow for the best possible outcomes for patients undergoing orbital atherectomy (OA). Cardiac catheterization technicians and nurses need to be available for patient check-in and laboratory testing, intra-procedure vitals monitoring, and post-procedure to evaluate the patient for any new symptoms, evidence of hemodynamic instability, or procedural complications.

During OA, the procedure is performed by an interventional cardiologist using a single-operator technique.
