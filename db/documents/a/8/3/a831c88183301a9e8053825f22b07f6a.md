Multi-disciplinary and interprofessional rounds are when medical and other health providers collaborate to enhance patients' healthcare outcomes. Clinicians may review the significance of the hepatic function test panel in correlation with each patient's medical history and physical examination to detect any drug-induced hepatic injury early and build a differential diagnosis. Changes in the patient's patterns of ALT and AST over time or other liver function tests may necessitate a referral to gastroenterologists for consultation. Clinical pharmacists can also advise about potential contraindications or hepatotoxic medication interactions. The charge nurse of each floor can communicate updates on a patient's response to treatment, other recent laboratory orders, and current disposition. A multi-disciplinary approach can ensure a higher quality of care for each patient and enhance outcomes.
