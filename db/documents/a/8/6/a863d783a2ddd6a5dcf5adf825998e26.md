Manual palpation of a bony prominence over the sagittal suture will aid in the initial diagnosis. The radiological finding of the absence of the sagittal suture or a bony ridge across part of the suture confirms the diagnosis.

Ultrasonography can be used to detect the fused suture and avoid radiation to the patient.

Plain skull X-rays can also show the fused suture; however, the study of choice is the head computed tomographic (CT) scan with 3D reconstruction.

In patients with rare skeletal metabolic disorders and suspected craniosynostosis, it is essential to screen them at the time of diagnosis and follow-up.
