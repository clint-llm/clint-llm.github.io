Refraction testing is used to detect changes in the various components of the eye that can contribute to an impaired focusing of light on the retina. It is helpful in the evaluation of nyctalopia as nearsightedness, or myopia is a common cause. Refraction testing involves a visual acuity test that most commonly consists of determining the smallest letters read by a patient on a standardized Snellen chart held twenty feet away. This process is done on each eye, individually and together. Refraction test using a phoropter allows for manual refraction determination utilizing a series of lens powers and patientâ€™s experience of comparative clarity. Autorefractors and aberrometers are other commonly used equipment to test for refractive error.

The slit-lamp is another piece of equipment widely used to evaluate the eye. A slit lamp is a binocular microscope used to examine structures of the eye under high magnification, often used to detect cataracts, a cause of nyctalopia.

Blood testing of vitamin A (retinol) and glucose levels are other initial evaluations of rod function and retinal vasculature function, respectively.
