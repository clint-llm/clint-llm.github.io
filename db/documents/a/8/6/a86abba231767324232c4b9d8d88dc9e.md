Colesevelam is a novel drug created to help patients lower their LDL cholesterol levels. Its primary mechanism of action is to create nonabsorbable complexes when exposed to bile acids in the GI tract. It forms these complexes due to its numerous hydrophobic side chains, which enhance the binding of bile acids.

The main mechanism through which colesevelam reduces plasma glucose levels is not entirely understood. In animal studies, researchers have observed colesevelam increasing the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1, GLP-1, and other incretins. Mice models show that this occurs through the activation of TGR5 secondary to the binding of bile acids in the GI tract. Once GLP1 and other incretins are activated, overall hepatic glycogenolysis becomes suppressed. This suppression occurs because patients with type 2 diabetes have increased hepatic glucose production, contributing to elevated fasting serum glucose levels. By decreasing hepatic glycogenolysis, one can expect a reduction in serum glucose levels.
