The prognosis depends on the causative organism, depth and extent of the infection, development of complications, and timing of treatment initiation. Some patients can be cured microbiologically by topical antifungals alone, but in some patients, therapeutic keratoplasty may be needed. The Descemet membrane, an interior basement membrane near the aqueous humor, is usually impermeable to bacteria but can be breached by fungal hyphae, leading to endophthalmitis; endophthalmitis is a rare consequence of fungal keratitis that has a poor prognosis. About 30% of fungal infections fail to respond to drug therapy and/or result in corneal perforation. Successful healing of FK usually results in central corneal scarring and opacification which may require penetrating or lamellar keratoplasty for the restoration of visual acuity.
