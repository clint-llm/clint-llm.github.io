- Trigeminal neuralgia is the most common type of craniofacial neuropathic pain.

- The majority of cases are idiopathic.

- The most common artery reported to be involved in neurovascular compression in trigeminal neuralgia is the superior cerebellar artery.

- Trigeminal neuralgia is primarily unilateral.

- The distribution of TN pain is usually in one or more of the territories of the three divisions: ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3). V2 is the most frequent territory involved.

- The diagnosis is made clinically.

- Medical therapy with carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine is the first-line therapy.

- If drug treatment fails or is not tolerated, surgical options may be offered.

- Microvascular decompression has been widely accepted as the gold standard surgical procedure for treating this disease.
