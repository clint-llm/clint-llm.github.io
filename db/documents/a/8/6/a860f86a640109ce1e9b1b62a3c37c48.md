Open communication between theÂ interprofessional team is critical to managing this condition. The patient may first be seen by a trauma service, emergency medicine clinician, or even a primary clinician. Involving the appropriate specialists to ensure thrombus resolution and prevent kidney injury will improve patient outcomes. This is a disorder that is unlikely to be successfully managed by any one single provider, and using a team approach is critical from early on. Many of those diagnosed with renal artery thrombosis will continue to experience clinical deterioration should appropriate therapy not be started promptly.
