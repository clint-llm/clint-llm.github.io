Skin biopsy of a nevus anemicus lesion will show normal findings includingÂ an uninvolved epidermis with normal melanocyte number and distribution. There have been reports of nonspecific findings such as a mononuclear cell perivascular infiltrate in the dermis. Although biopsy of nevus anemicus lesions in nondiagnostic, it may be helpful in ruling out other lesions on the leukoderma differential diagnosis. Note that vitiligo shows absent melanocytes and melanin granules in well-established lesions, while the border of expanding lesions shows a decreased number of melanocytes and melanin.
