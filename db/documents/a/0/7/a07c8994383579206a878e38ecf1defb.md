The condition's evolution is unpredictable. The disease may have a monocyclic, polycyclic, or chronic course. The prognosis has significantly improved over recent years with the emergence of new therapeutic options. Early treatment and close monitoring may lead to better control of the disease. However, developing countries still have a high mortality rate.

Before the advent of corticosteroids, one-third of patients spontaneously improved, one-third had a chronic, lingering course, and one-third died from the disease.

JDM is usually not associated with the development of malignancies, unlike the adult form.
