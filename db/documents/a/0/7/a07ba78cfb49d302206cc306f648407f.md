The technique of dispensing prisms depends on the disparity of single binocular vision. It is advisable to prescribe the smallest amount of relieving prism that neutralizes the distinction. The prism base should be oriented based on the deviation being corrected. The bottom of the prism is placed in the direction opposite to the deviation.

There are essential guidelines that need to be followed when considering the prescription of prism glasses to a patient. A few of the important ones include:

- Split the amount of correction equally between two eyes

- The base of the prism should be oriented opposite to the direction of the deviation of the eye

- Prisms of the range varying from 0.5D to 10D can be advised in patients with phoria.

- Both vertical or horizontal prisms can be prescribed individually or in combination in an oblique axis.

- Prisms of up to 6D can be tolerated in one eye and half in the other eye.

- Prisms can be prescribed in the form of glass prisms or Fresnel prisms stuck onto the glasses.
