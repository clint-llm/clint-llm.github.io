Clinical severity of patients with congenital lobar emphysema defines the treatment of choice. Apart from a few asymptomatic patients, almost half of the patients show symptoms within the first month of birth. Patients with mild or moderate symptoms could be treated conservatively. In case of severe symptoms, lobectomy is the gold standard for the treatment. However, the conservative treatment seems to be increasing as a result of antenatal diagnosis and intrauterine regression.
