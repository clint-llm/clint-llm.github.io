It is ideal to use USG for peripheral nerve blocks, to visualize nerves, and monitor drug spread. An in-plane approach should be used whenever possible to visualize the entire length of the needle, including the tip. For plane blocks, normal saline can confirm the correct plane and hydro-dissect the plane before injecting the medication.

A loss of resistance (LOR) technique is used to locate the epidural space. The ligaments offer resistance to the injection of Normal Saline, which is suddenly lost as the needle tip enters the epidural space. Saline is preferred to air for loss of resistance because of the risk of air embolus when air is used.

Caudal is performed in the lateral position. The sacral hiatus is bound on both sides by the sacral cornua. It forms the apex of an equilateral triangle formed by the posterior superior iliac spine. It is covered by the sacrococcygeal membrane, which offers a feeling of a ‘pop’ as the needle is inserted at a 45-degree angle to the skin. The anatomical differences should be taken into account during caudal for infants. 0.5 mL/kg of LA volume is required for sacral coverage, 1 mL/kg for lumbar, lower thoracic coverage, 1.25 mL/kg for mid-thoracic coverage.

Ideal body weight is used for the calculation of the maximal allowable dose of local anesthetic. This is 3mg/kg for bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine, 5 mg/kg for lidocaine without epinephrine, and 7 mg/kg for lidocaine with epinephrine for bolus dosing. Toxicities of different local anesthetic drugs are additive. If a maximal dose of one LA has already been used, a different LA should not be used. Infants less than 6 months require at least a 30% reduction in the maximal doses due to increased free fractions and decreased elimination. An epidural infusion dose of 0.4 to 0.5 mg/kg/hr is used for bupivacaine (0.25%), levobupivacaine (0.25%) and ropivacaine (0.2%); this is reduced to 0.25 mg/kg/hr for infants less than 6 months. Chloroprocaine (2%) is a rapid, short-acting ester LA used in infants at a dose of 8 to 10 mg/kg/hr. It is rapidly metabolized and eliminated by plasma esterases.

The initial manifestations of LA systemic toxicity (LAST) are usually neurological, potentially ranging from tremors, twitching, or seizures. This is usually followed by cardiovascular manifestations, namely, high degree block, QRS widening, ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation, and cardiac arrest. In children, the neurological manifestations can be masked by the GA, and cardiac manifestations are noticed first or in conjunction with neurological signs. Management follows advanced life support to ensure oxygenation, ventilation, and cardiovascular support.

Additive medications are used to prolong the duration of analgesia for single injection central neuraxial and peripheral blocks.
