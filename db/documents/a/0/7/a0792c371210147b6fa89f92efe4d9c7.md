Knee extensor injuries relate to the damage of structures that support the extensor mechanism of the knee joint. When damaged, these injuries may cause debilitating pain and swelling, loss of ability to straight leg raise and limited knee extension. Some patients may describe a 'pop' sensation in the knee joint before the injury. Complications of these injuries can lead to loss of motion, knee stiffness, and osteoarthritis. It is, therefore, important to treat these injuries early. Depending on the severity, they may warrant surgical management. Patients will benefit from an interprofessional healthcare team, including primary physicians, surgeons, sports medicine, nurses, and physical therapists, to return to normal activity. Rehabilitation and orthopedic nurses provide education, monitor patient progress, and keep the team apprised of patient response to treatment. [Level 5]
