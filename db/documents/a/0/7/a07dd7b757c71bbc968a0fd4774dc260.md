Postmenopausal bleeding, as such, is not a staged condition. However, endometrial cancer, which is one cause of postmenopausal bleeding, does have staging criteria. Endometrial cancer is staged as follows:

Stage I: The tumor is limited to the uterine corpus

- IA = No myometrial invasion, or invasion into less than have of myometrial thickness

- IB = Invasion into half or more of the myometrium

Stage II: The tumor invades the cervical stroma but does not extend beyond the uterus

Stage III: The tumor has spread locally or regionally

- IIIA = Invades serosa or adnexa

- IIIB = Involves vagina or parametria

- IIIC = Has metastasized to lymph nodes

- IIIC1 = Pelvic lymph nodes
- IIIC2 = Para-aortic nodes (pelvic nodes involved or not)

Stage IV: The tumor has invaded the bladder, bowel, or has spread distantly

- IVA = Invades bladder or mucosa of the bowel

- IVB = Distant spread (intra-abdominal metastases, inguinal lymph nodes)
