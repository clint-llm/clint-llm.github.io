**Post-Stroke Sensory Retraining**

Studies have suggested a degree of sensorimotor neuronal recovery following strokes, particularly for proprioception and stereognosis. It has also been recognized that sensorimotor deficits contribute to interference with activities of daily living and return to functional status in patients recovering from a stroke. That said, there is significant variability in the standardized outcomes that physicians, physical therapists, and occupational therapists use to monitor stroke patient recovery status. Also, the rehabilitation community lacks consensus about the physical therapy protocol, which optimizes sensorimotor recovery. The American Stroke Association guidelines indicate that the use of somatosensory retraining to improve sensory discrimination can be an option for stroke survivors who demonstrate sensory deficits. [Level 2] For these reasons, it may benefit patients if physicians and physical/occupational therapy staff coordinate to construct a regimen that includes sensory retraining to improve the performance of activities of daily living in stroke survivors.
