Oral mucosal grafts are a physiological substitute for reconstructing the posterior lamella in patients with posterior lamella shortening. In patients with Steven Johnson's syndrome, ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, and chemical injury with severe posterior lamella shortening and symblepharon formation, the oral mucosal grafts have been shown to provide good results in the various studies.

In a study done by Iyer et al., in 54 eyes of 31 patients, with Steven-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and lid margin keratinization, mucous membrane graft with keratinized lid margin excision was performed.Â 92.6% of patients had a stable ocular surface, reduced conjunctival hyperemia, and improved visual acuity over 6 months of follow-up.

Lee et al. used mucous membrane graft and hard palate mucosal grafts to reconstruct the contracted socket in 13 patients. They found that all the patients after surgery were able to wear the artificial eye, though 5 of their patients required repeat surgeries.

Besides ocular surface reconstruction, mucous membrane grafts have also been used as a conjunctival substitute in patients with recalcitrant leaking trabeculectomy bleb.

An interprofessional team approach (including specialists, clinicians, surgical nurses, and surgical assistants) to performing mucous membrane grafts will yield the best patient results. [Level 5]
