Renal osteodystrophy itself is a complication of end-stage renal disease. Once osteodystrophy sets in, patients will present most commonly with fractures due to excessive action of PTH or due to inadequate mineralization of bone seen in adynamic bone disease. Bone pain is a common symptom, too, along with skeletal deformities and growth retardation in children.

The pathophysiology of previously reported cases of carpal tunnel syndrome in patients of renal osteodystrophy undergoing dialysis has been under debate. The nerve dysfunction seen in carpal tunnel syndrome does not seem to have a clear association with underlying osteodystrophy.

Studies have also suggested that patients who suffer from renal osteodystrophyÂ and had an initial fragility fracture have a higher probability of suffering from cardiovascular events and metastatic calcification.

Other complications like septic arthritis, tendon ruptures, and osteonecrosis may also be seen.
