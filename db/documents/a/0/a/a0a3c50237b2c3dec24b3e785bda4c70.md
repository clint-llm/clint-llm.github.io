The acromioclavicular (AC) joint articulates the lateral end of the clavicle with the acromion as it projects anteriorly off the scapula. The AC joint provides stability and motion to the shoulder complex. It is a commonly injured shoulder joint, ranging from sprains to frank tears, occasionally requiring surgery.
