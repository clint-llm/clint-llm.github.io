**Hysterosalpingogram**

Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is performed by instilling an iodinated radiopaque dye, usually a water-soluble dye, into the endometrial canal.**Hysterosonogram**

This modality is similar to an HSG except that an ultrasound probe is introduced into the cervix after filling the uterine cavity with saline; this is helpful when an endometrial biopsy is negative. Images of the endometrial canal are obtained to evaluate for lesions such as polyp and fibroids. Submucosal fibroids can be differentiated from polyps as they are covered by a layer of endometrium, which can be visualized on ultrasound.
