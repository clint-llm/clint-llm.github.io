The Sphincter of Oddi has three main functions: regulation of bile flow into the duodenum, prevention of reflux into the bile or pancreatic duct, and promotion of gallbladder filling in between digestive cycles. The basal pressure of the sphincter is 10 mmHg with an intermittent phasic increase in tone 2 to 6 times per min of 50 to 140 mmHg. Cholecystokinin (CCK) has been demonstrated to relax basal tone and inhibit phasic contractions. Cholecystokinin is released from enteroendocrine cells in response to a meal, exerting direct hormonal effects on the sphincter. Other gastrointestinal peptides have varying influence on the sphincter; these include gastrin, secretin, motilin, and octreotide. Additionally, there is extrinsic control of the sphincter via parasympathetic innervation. This vagal innervation is mostly excitatory.

As referenced above, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction commonly presents with recurrent biliary colic type abdominal complaints. Both stenosis and/or dyskinesia of the sphincter can result in the hallmark constellation of symptoms seen in this disease. It is theorized that trauma from stone passage can result in sphincter stenosis. While congenital syndromes and motility disorders may serve as the nidus for dyskinetic sphincter function, all of these can result in a pathologic process that falls under the umbrella of SOD.
