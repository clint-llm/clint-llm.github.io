Parents with a history of a child with endocardial fibroelastosis should undergo prenatal assessment in subsequent pregnancies. Mothers with Sjögren syndrome should also remain cautious regarding the possibility of this entity in a child, so screening with anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies is warranted. Parents should be educated regarding the high morbidity and mortality of the condition. Genetic counseling should also be provided.
