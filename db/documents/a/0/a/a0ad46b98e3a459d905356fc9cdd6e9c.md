Around day 24 of embryological life, the internal carotid artery is the first artery to form from the combination of the three branchial arch arteries and the distal segments of the paired dorsal aortae. At around 28 days, the internal carotid artery branches off into the anterior and posterior divisions. The anterior division gives off primitive arteries that supply the olfactory and optic regions. The anterior division later gives rise to the anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, and anterior choroidal artery. The posterior division gives rise to the posterior cerebral artery and posterior choroidal artery.

The internal carotid artery provides blood to the primitive brain. As the occipital portion, brain stem, and cerebellum grow, the internal carotid artery becomes insufficient, which triggers the development of the posterior circulation.
