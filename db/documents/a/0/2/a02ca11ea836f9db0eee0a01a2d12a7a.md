ECV can be attempted with malpresentationÂ of the fetus such as breech, transverse and oblique presentations. Complete breech occurs when the fetus has the buttocks as the presenting part and the knees are flexed with the feet near the buttocks. Frank breech occurs when the buttocks are the presenting part, and the legs are extending with the feet near the fetal head. Incomplete breech involves one bent leg and one extended leg. Transverse presentations occur when the long axis of the fetus is at a right angle to the mother with the fetal head to one side of the maternal abdomen and the back noted to be either be up or down in relation to the rest of the fetal body. Oblique presentation is when the long axis of the fetus is at a 45-degree angle to the mother, with the fetal head usually in the right or left lower quadrants.
