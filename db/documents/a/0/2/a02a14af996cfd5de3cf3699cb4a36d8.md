The gas laws are a group of physical laws modeling the behavior of gases developed from experimental observations from the 17th century onwards. While many of these laws apply to ‘ideal’ gases in closed systems at standard temperature and pressure (STP), their principles can still be useful in understanding and altering a significant number of physicochemical processes of the body as well as the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., inhaled anesthetics).

This argument, which combines physics, medicine, physiology, and biology, starts from the assumption that pressure, volume, and temperature are interconnected variables. Indeed, each gas law holds one constant and observes the variation in the other two.

In this article, the gas laws will first be described, then applied to clinical situations with worked examples to demonstrate the importance of appreciating how changing temperature, volume, or pressure can affect the body.
