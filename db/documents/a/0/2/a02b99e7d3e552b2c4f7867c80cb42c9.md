Patients with Alzheimer disease often receive treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that mitigate symptoms by hindering ACh turnover. In effect, lingering levels of ACh help recalibrate the neurotransmitter to appropriate and adequate levels.

Despite the apparent benefit of AChE inhibitors for the management of Alzheimer disease, recent studies have stated that the application of such inhibitors fails to address the pathology in its entirety. Nordberg et al. have found that some AChE inhibitors, such as donepezil or galantamine, show increased levels of AChE in CSF.
