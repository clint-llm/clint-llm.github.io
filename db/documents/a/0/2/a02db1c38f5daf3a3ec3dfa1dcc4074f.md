**Head and Neck Points**

In melanoma of the head and neck, a thorough examination is warranted as several important considerations are different from management elsewhere. Head and neck melanoma have a worse prognosis than other sites; location of the lesion has a significant impact on prognosis. Scalp location has the worst prognosis, followed by ear, cheek, and neck, all in respected order. Additionally, management and resection take place at different levels.

**Lymph Nodes**

A thorough examination of lymph nodes at all levels of the neck should be emphasized. Additionally, the parotid gland should be examined, as there are parotid lymph nodes where the head drains. Parotid gland examination is particularly important for lesions on the anterior scalp, temple, and cheek. For lesions located on the posterior scalp and retroauricular, occipital lymph nodes should be examined thoroughly.

**General Melanoma Physical Examination Information**

When considering melanoma in physical examination, patients may have a new lesion or existing mole with changing characteristics. However, amelanotic melanoma will not have typical dark pigment from melanin. Amelanotic melanoma may be pink, red, purple, or normal skin color. The characteristics of melanoma are commonly known by the acronym ABCDE and include the following:

A: Asymmetry

B: Irregular border

C: Color variations, especially red, white, and blue tones in a brown or black lesion

D: Diameter greater than 6 mm

E: Evolution of the mole(s) has become the most important factor to consider when it comes to diagnosing a melanoma if a mole has recently changed in color and/or size or if there any signs of regression.

Physical examination for aggressive/advanced disease should be considered, including ulceration, nodularity, and satellite lesions.
