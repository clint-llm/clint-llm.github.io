The diagnosis of Wyburn-Mason syndrome is made on clinical examination. Retinal arteriovenous malformations are usually diagnosed by ophthalmoscopy although fluorescein angiography may be required to demonstrate smaller lesions. Most arteriovenous malformations do not leak on angiography. Ultrasound and optical coherence tomography (OCT) can also confirm the diagnosis and be used to follow changes in the nerve fiber layer, macula, and retina over time. OCT is very useful for the diagnosis of associated macular edema and serous retinal detachment. Exophthalmometry is needed for the grading of proptosis if proptosis is present. Intracranial arteriovenous malformations can be diagnosed with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or cerebral arteriography. Catheter angiography can demonstrate the size, location, and characteristics of the feeding arteries and draining veins and is felt to be the best method to analyze the exact angioarchitecture of the lesion. Lesions have been reported in the skin but are very uncommon. CNS vascular lesions are typically on the same side as the involved eye. Central nervous system vascular lesions often involve the midbrain.
