Imaging is typically not needed for diagnosing a gastrocnemius injury, but ultrasound may be helpful toÂ calculate the severity of the injury and to monitor recovery. Ultrasound may show muscle fiber disruption at the musculotendinous junction with a hematoma or fluid collection. A fluid collection appears black and can be present between the soleus and the medial head of the gastrocnemius. The fluid may grow in the first week after the initial injury, and ultrasound can be repeated at subsequent follow-up visits after an injury to assess healing and if swelling is not resolving as expected.

MRI is the gold standard for establishing the soft tissue injuries but is only required if the diagnosis of a gastrocnemius rupture is uncertain.
