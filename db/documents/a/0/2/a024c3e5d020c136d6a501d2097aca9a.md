Trichotillomania is part of OCD and is thought to be largely related to anxiety disorders. There have been twin studies that have demonstrated genetic anomalies associated with trichotillomania and other OCD-related disorders.

The more recent focus has been on the grey and white matter tracts. One study found the reduced integrity of the white matter within the anterior cingulate, pre-supplementary motor area, and the right and left temporal cortex in people with a diagnosis of TTM.

Studies focusing on neurochemistry have shown a relationship with the serotonin 2A receptor.

Other factors in the etiology are neuropsychology and the cognitive components. Many patients with trichotillomania report that there was a stressful situation that occurred before the hair-pulling behavior. Others describe boredom before hair-pulling.
