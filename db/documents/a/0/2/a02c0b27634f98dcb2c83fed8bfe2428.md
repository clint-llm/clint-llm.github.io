Adequate lighting is essential for optimal visualization, as well. This results in a successful and precise procedure technique with little discomfort to the patient.

No specific patient preparation is required, although some surgeons may recommend an enema prior to the procedure. Most cases do not require any preoperative intravenous antibiotics.

The patient can be placed in the prone jackknife, lithotomy, or lateral decubitus position. This will be determined by surgeon preference, patient body habitus, and patient comorbidities. A morbidly obese patient may not tolerate the jackknife position and may require the lithotomy position.
