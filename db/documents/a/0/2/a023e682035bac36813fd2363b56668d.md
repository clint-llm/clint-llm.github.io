Although the exact etiology and pathomechanism of phantosmia are unknown, phantosmia has been described in a myriad of conditions, including, but not limited to, traumatic head injury, upper respiratory tract infections, aging, temporal lobe seizures, sinusitis, brain tumors, certain medications, systemic diseases such as hypothyroidism, and certain neurocognitive disorders such as Parkinson disease.

However, most often, phantosmia is idiopathic.

As described earlier, integration and interpretation of odorants occur in regions of the brain, including the thalamus, hypothalamus, and dorsolateral frontal cortex. Abnormalities in any of these regions may alter olfaction. Sensorineural dysfunction of the olfactory neuroepithelium has been implicated in phantosmia, as has been described by the association with an upper respiratory infection, including COVID-19.

The prevailing peripheral phantosmia pathomechanism includes an insult to the neuroepithelium, followed by spurious reinnervation and resultant erroneous olfactory transmission.
