Treatment options of the univentricular variants depend on the time of discovery, prognosis, and goals of care. Prognosis must be discussed in depth before proceeding with treatment, as an intervention may be futile in some instances.

Univentricular heart syndrome medical management is targeted to the underlying pathology. Supplemental oxygen will help alleviate hypoxemia, and acid-base or metabolic disturbances should have correctable factors mended.

Catheter-based management is also based on underlying etiology, time of discovery, and prognosis. When discovered in utero, catheter-based structural interventions and valvuloplasty can mitigate sequala by correcting anomalies during the developmental process.

Surgical intervention can also correct any of the abovementioned anatomical variations, though technique varies by condition. The Fontan procedure, a popular choice for intervention, works by delivering blood to the lungs utilizing central venous pressure, and reduced intrathoracic pressure.

In patients with severe disease, palliative surgery may be the best option and is typically preferred over choosing strict comfort measures.
