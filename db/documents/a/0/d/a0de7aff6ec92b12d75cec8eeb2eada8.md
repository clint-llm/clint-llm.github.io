Men are reported to be affected with synovial chondromatosis up to four times more commonly than women. The knee is the most common joint affected. Typically affects diarthrodial, weight-bearing joints of individuals 30-60 years of age. The following joints are affected in descending order of frequency: knee (70%), hip (20%), shoulder, elbow, ankle, and wrist.

A rare occurrence is an extra-articular presentation of synovial-chondral lesions. This occurs in synovial lined bursal tissue or tenosynovium, where the typical chondral loose bodies form. These are referred to as tenosynovial chondromatosis or bursal chondromatosis. Synovial chondromatosis occurs most commonly in the fifth decade of life; it is rarely present before age 20 and is very rare in children. Reference to both the primary form (no evidence of concurrent joint pathology) and secondary form (occurring in the setting of joint degeneration) is made in the literature. The secondary form occurs more commonly and usually in older individuals. However, both primary and secondary forms are uncommon arthropathy.
