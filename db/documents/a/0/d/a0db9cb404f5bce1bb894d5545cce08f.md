The patients will eventually start to develop left to right shunt irrespective of the type of defect, although the magnitude of the shunting depends on the type of defect. In complete AV canal defects, blood from the left to right flows through interatrial, interventricular, and AV valves, while in a partial defect, blood flows through the ostium primum. These individuals develop heart failure symptoms even before the age of one if it is not corrected. Due to the increased flow to the right heart, the pulmonary vasculature develops pulmonary hypertension. There is a slight symptomatic improvement during the initial phase of this change, which is one of the poor prognostic factors as it may lead to Eisenmenger syndrome. There is a significant regurgitation of blood in the heart chambers due to incompetent AV valves. Most of the regurgitation happens from ventricles to the atrium of the same side, although some occur from LV to RA through the cleft in the anterior mitral leaflet. This can lead to atrial dilatation or ventricular hypertrophy, depending on the defect, which can accelerate the development of congestive heart failure in children.
