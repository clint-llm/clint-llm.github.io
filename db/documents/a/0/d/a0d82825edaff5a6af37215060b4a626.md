The incidence of gastric cancer correlates with socioeconomic status and is clearly dependent on environmental/geographical factors. The management of gastric cancer patients requires the medical expertise of an interprofessional team in addition to aÂ supportive team (nutritionist, social worker, nurses, geneticists, and palliative care providers). Members and patients should discuss the controversy surrounding the benefit of perioperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone or combined with competing standards of care before choosing the best operation for gastric cancer and extension lymph node dissection. HER2 testing is recommended in all advanced unresectable and metastatic disease, and if HER2-overexpressing, trastuzumab should be added to a fluoropyrimidine/platinum combination chemotherapy (triplets reserved for selected patients) regimens over single-agent therapy. The VEGFR antibody ramucirumab has the best efficacy in the second-line as single or combined with paclitaxel. Novel target therapies are under investigation; noticeable, the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab has shown promising results obtaining FDA-accelerated approval for advanced or metastatic cancer patients whose tumors express with PD-L1, MSI, or dMMR. Future enrollment in clinical trials is encouraged. [Level 5]
