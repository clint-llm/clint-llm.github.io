Nalbuphine is FDA indicated for moderate to severe pain in which an opioid agent is required when other alternative treatments have been insufficient. Non-FDA approved uses of nalbuphine do exist, such as treatment of labor pain, opioid-induced urinary retention, opioid-induced respiratory depression, and pruritus associated with neuraxial opioid use. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of nalbuphine, so providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes when pain relief is needed.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action nalbuphine.
- Outline the approved and off-label indications for using nalbuphine.
- Review the potential adverse effect profile of nalbuphine.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients who can benefit from therapy with nalbuphine.
