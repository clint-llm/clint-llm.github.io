An interprofessional approach to Rolandic seizures is recommended.

Rolandic epilepsy is a relatively common diagnosis but the condition is benign. Because of its diverse presentation, healthcare workers including nurses need to be aware of the possible signs and symptoms. By far, the majority of children require no treatment, and the disorder gradually disappears in 2 to 4 years. The few patients with recurrent seizures may require treatment with a single anti-epileptic drug. The pharmacist should educate the patient and family about the benign nature of the disorder. In addition, if drug treatment is undertaken, the family/patient must be educated about the need for compliance and watching for side effects. Patients should be informed that the drug should not be abruptly discontinued nor the dose changed without first speaking to the neurologist. The outcomes for most patients with rolandic epilepsy is excellent.
