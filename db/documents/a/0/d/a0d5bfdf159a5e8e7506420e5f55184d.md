A head computed tomogram (CT) allows for a quick examination, although fine-slice MR of the brain with contrast is the gold standard for neuroimaging in cases of suspected brain metastases. MR allows for a determination of the number and anatomical location of tumors and the degree of associated edema. Basic laboratory assessment including complete blood count, metabolic panel, and liver function test should be performed.
