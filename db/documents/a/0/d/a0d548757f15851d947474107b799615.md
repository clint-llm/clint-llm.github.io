Expected immediate nursing outcomes for patients experiencing hypoglycemia should include monitoring and maintaining blood glucose levels within normal limits and resolution of hypoglycemic signs and symptoms. For patients who experienced neurological changes or loss of consciousness, the nurse should expect the patient to regain consciousness with no deficits, such as paresthesia or aphasia. This includes the resolution of behavioral changes, confusion, and seizures that sometimes mimic stroke.

Expected long term outcomes for the patient should consist of:Â regular monitoring of glucose levels, maintaining normal glucose levels, maintaining normal hemoglobin A1c levels, adherence to medications, diet, and medical appointments, evidence of the patient's ability to recognize the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, self-management of hypoglycemia, and understanding of when and what information to report to the provider.
