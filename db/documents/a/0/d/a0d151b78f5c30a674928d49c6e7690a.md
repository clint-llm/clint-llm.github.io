The prognosis of chorea depends on the cause. The majority of patients with Huntington chorea have a poor prognosis and will die prematurely. The same applies to patients with neuroacanthocytosis. When the involuntary movements are severe, this may result in localized trauma or rhabdomyolysis.

In patients with neuroacanthocytosis and those who develop tongue dystonia, swallowing may be affected, resulting in loss of body weight, recurrent episodes of aspiration pneumonia, and even death.
