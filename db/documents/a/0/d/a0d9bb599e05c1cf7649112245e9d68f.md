Dyspnea on exertion, lethargy, and fatigue are the initial symptoms due to the inability to maintain cardiac output, especially during exercise. Exertional dyspnea progresses to dyspnea at rest as the disease advances.

Orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea can be seen in Group 2 PH patients. Patients can also complain of a nonproductive cough, hemoptysis, hoarseness. Exertional anginal pain, syncope, and peripheral edema can occur due to right ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure as the disease progresses.

The severity is based on New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification.

Signs include a loud second heart sound pulmonary component, which is the initial physical finding, followed by tricuspid regurgitation murmur, jugular venous distention, hepatomegaly, and edema of lower extremities.
