**PRENATAL**

Ultrasound

The presence of anencephaly can be detected as early as the first trimester through fetal ultrasound. However, since some organ systems are still developing through the first trimester, screening for structural abnormalities is used to be delayed until the second trimester. Ultrasound remains the gold standard for diagnostic imaging in pregnant women due to its increased efficacy from technological advances and its safety for the fetus.

Alpha-fetoprotein

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a protein normally found in human serum. During pregnancy, AFP concentrations rise quickly, reaching peak levels at the end of the first trimester. After the first trimester, AFP is continuously synthesized, but its presence becomes diluted due to increases in fetal blood volume.

**POSTNATAL**

In the postnatal period, diagnosis is by physical examination. All of the following criteria are required for a positive diagnosis

- No calvarium present

- Absence of scalp

- External presence of a hemorrhagic, fibrous mass or tissue

- Lack of cerebral hemispheres
