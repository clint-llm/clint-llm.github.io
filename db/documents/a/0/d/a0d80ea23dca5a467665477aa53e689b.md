There are no specific contraindications to volar splinting.

Specific instances such as burns, open or contaminated wounds, or unstable fracture patterns may warrant special consideration. In situations where the limb is tense and edematous, monitoring for compartment syndrome and rapid extension of inflamed or infected soft tissues may make splinting less desirable.
