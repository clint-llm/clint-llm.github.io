The patients are at high risk of infection due to altered immune systems and high rates of secondary cancers especially lymphomas. Hypercalcemia and lytic bone lesions are involved in acute T-cell lymphoma/leukemia. Bony destruction is also seen in Extranodal Nk/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type. Visceral involvement of skin, GI tract, lungs, and adrenals are seen. Large cell transformation, which means more aggressive transformation is seen in CTCL. Precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma can cause superior vena cava syndrome, tracheal obstruction, pleural/pericardial effusion. Ulceration of the lesion can be seen in MF.
