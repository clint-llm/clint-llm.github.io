In most cases, drug-induced liver injury may cause mild to moderate elevation of liver tests, but in rare cases, it can lead to fatal outcomes.

- Alanine transferase greater than or equal to 5 ULN

- Alkaline Phosphatase greater than or equal to 2 ULN, especially in patients with elevated 5'-nucleotidase or GGT, and without bone-diseases-related ALP elevation

- Alanine transferase greater than or equal to 3 ULN and total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 ULN

This recommendation was given to avoid unnecessary drug withdrawals. But it is difficult to confidently ascribe at times whether it is drug-induced liver injury or aggravation of a pre-existing liver injury.
