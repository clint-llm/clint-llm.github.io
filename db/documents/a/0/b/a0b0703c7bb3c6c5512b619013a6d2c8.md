Duloxetine hydrochloride is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), first patented in 1990 and marketed in the United States in 2004. It is FDA-approved for use in the treatment of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, fibromyalgia, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Off-label (non-FDA approved) use for duloxetine includes chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and stress urinary incontinence in both men and women.

In addition to its general SNRI properties, duloxetine also increases dopamine levels, specifically in the prefrontal cortex. Due to the involvement of the prefrontal cortex in depression, the actions of duloxetine in this region also contribute to its efficacy in the treatment of depression. However, the mechanism of action does not involve the inhibition of dopamine transporters.
