Opioid receptor antagonists block one or more of the opioid receptors in the central or peripheral nervous system. Stimulation of central mu receptors causes respiratory depression, analgesia, and euphoria.

- Naloxone comes in intravenous, intramuscular, and intranasal formulations and is FDA-approved for the use in an opioid overdose and the reversal of respiratory depression associated with opioid use.

- Naltrexone is available in both oral and long-acting injectable formulations and is FDA-approved for the treatment of opiate and alcohol use disorder (mainly Maintenance treatment).

- A precipitated withdrawal from opiates, whether caused by naloxone in the pre-hospital or emergency department setting or by naloxone or naltrexone during a medically supervised management of opioid withdrawal, can lead to hospital admission or even require intensive care.

- Some studies have shown a dose-dependent relative risk reduction on the amount of naloxone distributed in the community, whether by prescription or community dispensaries, versus opioid-related overdose mortality.
