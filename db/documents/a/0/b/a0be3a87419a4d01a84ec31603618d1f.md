Hypertension has effects on multiple systems, and it is important to have care coordination between the physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, ophthalmologist, nephrologist, and cardiologist to ensure early detection and control of hypertension and improve patient outcomes. Patients with hypertension need to be informed that they should follow up regularly with an ophthalmologist for a complete eye assessment. In addition, patients need to be educated about the importance of compliance with antihypertensive medications.

**Outcomes**

In most patients, hypertensive retinopathy does not cause vision loss as long as the hypertension is treated. However, if the blood pressure remains untreated, it can lead to vision loss within a short period of time. The cause of the vision loss is either due to retinal pigmentary changes or secondary to optic atrophy, neither of which is reversible.
