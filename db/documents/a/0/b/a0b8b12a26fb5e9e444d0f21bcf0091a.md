At the time of writing the initial article on April 4, 2020, there were 1,272,953 confirmed cases and 69,428 deaths due to COVID-19 worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), with 79,332 new cases confirmed in the previous 24 hours. At the time, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported 337,278 cases and 9,637 deaths in the United States to that date. On April 16, 2021, just over a year since our initial review, the number of deaths worldwide has crossed the 3 million mark. The severity of the pandemic is emphasized by noting the rate of deaths: it took 8.5 months after the first fatality in China to mark the loss of the first 1 million lives, 3.5 months to reach 2 million, and 3 months for the loss to cross 3 million lives.

As of December 23, 2021, there have been 51,574,787 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 809,300 deaths in the United States. Globally, there have been over 276 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5,374,744 deaths reported to the WHO. As of December 23, 2021, a total of 8,649,057,088 vaccine doses have been administered worldwide. The United States has had the most infections to date, followed by India, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Russia, Turkey, and France.

Viral mutations leading to variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been found around the world: the B.1.1.7 in the United Kingdom in early 2020, the B.1.526 in the United States in November 2020, the B.1.525 in the United Kingdom and Nigeria in December 2020, and the B.1.351 in South Africa in late 2020. The Delta variant B.1.617.2 was initially identified in India in December 2020 and rapidly spread through over 60 countries due to a 40-60% increase in transmissibility, becoming the dominant strain globally by August 2021.

Early studies postulated that ocular manifestations of COVID-19 were rare overall. Only 9 (0.8%) out of 1,099 patients from 552 hospitals across 30 provinces in China were reported to have "conjunctival congestion" from December 2019 through January 2020.

A case series reported ocular symptoms in 12 (31.6%) of 38 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Hubei province, China.

Out of 30 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 tested by Xia et al., one patient had conjunctivitis and was also the sole patient in the study to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 in ocular secretions by a conjunctival swab. This patient did not have a severe fever or respiratory symptoms at the time of testing.
