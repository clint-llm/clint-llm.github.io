**Tips for Implementing Teledebriefing**

**Required Equipment**

Teledebriefing can be accomplished cost-effectively and straightforwardly using basic equipment and an Internet connection.

Telesimulation allows learners to benefit from the simulation in large part by overcoming time, distance, and limited human resource barriers. Teledebriefing is one process in telesimulation that allows learners to benefit and gain knowledge and skills from subject matter experts/educators that are not on-site. Teledebriefing also allows subject matter experts the ability to share their expertise and provide value to the community without having to travel extended distances or take the additional time to be physically present at the site of instruction; this can be particularly beneficial for those educators who travel nationally and internationally to provide educational content to learners.

**Debriefing Techniques**

Teledebriefing is a process in which learners participating in a simulation scenario undergo debriefing with a facilitator located at an off-site location. There is a myriad of specific debriefing techniques that utilizable with teledebriefing. For example, the Plus/Delta technique of debriefing focuses on learner self-assessment. The debriefer will ask open-ended questions such as "What went well?" (plus) and "What could be changed?" (delta), to identify issues that may have occurred during the case to improve future performance. This technique may also be useful in the debriefing of systems-focused simulations (e.g., in-situ code blue team simulation).

Rapid Cycle Deliberate Practice (RCDP) is a technique of debriefing that has demonstrated effectiveness in simulation scenarios designed to teach procedures such as airway management, technical skills, and adherence to resuscitation guidelines. It differs from traditional post-scenario debriefing by moving the debriefing to occur within the scenario itself. In RCDP, the scenario gets paused if participants perform an action incorrectly, and they receive immediate feedback and correction by a facilitator. The case then "rewinds," and the participants are allowed to practice the action again, this time doing it the "right way." Upon the mastering of a skill, the scenarios progress in difficulty, built on previously mastered skills.

Advocacy inquiry is a technique where the facilitator first advocates his/her observation of an action or behavior and then inquires about the participant's frame of mind relative to the action.

The GAS (Gather Analyze Summarize) conversation structure is yet another debriefing method that is also commonly used in medical simulation.
