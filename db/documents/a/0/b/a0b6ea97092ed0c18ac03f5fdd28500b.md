Managing APAP overdose with NAC requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that includes the emergency physician, medical toxicologist, internist/hospitalist, nurses, pharmacists, and laboratory technologists. The decision to start NAC is usually made in the emergency department by the emergency physician in conjunction with the medical toxicologist. The preparation of NAC including calculating the dose of NAC required and the nature and quantity of the diluent should include consultation with a clinical pharmacist. The initial dose of NAC started in the ED/ICU, or floor requires close monitoring especially if given intravenously, to permit assessment for an anaphylactoid reaction which may require prompt intervention.

In patients with self-injurious APAP ingestions, once the patient has completed the course of NAC and is considered medically stable, consult with a mental health counselor or psychiatrist to assess the risk of further self-harm and the potential need for psychiatric admission.
