The spectrum of injury in blunt trauma is diverse as multiple structures within the thorax may sustain damage simultaneously. Injury can result from direct trauma to the thorax, rapid acceleration or deceleration, crush, or blasts. A patient's external appearance may be deceiving. Injuries to chest wall structures, particularly the ribs, are frequent in blunt trauma and are readily diagnosed clinically or radiographically. Life-threatening injuries may be present with no obvious external signs of significant trauma, and these patients must be approached with a high index of suspicion. High-speed MVCs, lack of a seatbelt, extensive vehicle damage or steering wheel deformity, concomitant head, abdominal, or major bony injuries, and chest wall bruising are all factors associated with a higher risk of underlying thoracic injury. Penetrating trauma, by definition, results in a violation of the chest wall. The damage sustained to intrathoracic structures is based on the trajectory of the penetrating object. Hemodynamic instability suggests cardiac tamponade, great vessel injury with massive hemothorax, or tension pneumothorax. In stable patients, hemothorax and pneumothorax are common injuries and should rapidly be diagnosed. Further workup should be performed in stable patients if there is suspicion for underlying esophageal or tracheobronchial injury, particularly when wounds are present within the anatomic borders of the "cardiac box."
