When hemolytic transfusion reactions occur, it indicates a systemic failure in the hospital. In most cases, this is a clerical error. The entire process of transfusion has to be reviewed and all the personnel involved including nurses, physicians, and laboratory personnel need to be educated on the protocol for blood transfusion. No matter how urgent, no blood product should be transfused until the label, patient name, blood type, and patient ABO group has been verified. Nurses should be extra vigilant when transfusing blood because they are the terminal gatekeepers.
