Zone 1 fractures are tuberosity avulsion fractures, also called pseudo-Jones fractures, and occur when the hindfoot gets forced into inversion during plantarflexion.

- Zone 2 injuries have the name Jones fractures. These acute injuries may occur with a significant adduction force to the foot with a lifted heel.

- Zone 3 injuries are chronic injuries of repetitive microtrauma, causing increasing pain with activity over months. There is an increased risk of nonunion with these fractures.

- The dancer's fracture, or long spiral fracture of the distal metatarsal, is typically caused by the dancer rolling over their foot while in the demi-pointe position or sustained while landing a jump.
