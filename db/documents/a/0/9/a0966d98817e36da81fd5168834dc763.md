Disruption of the cervical medullary junction secondary to occipital-cervical instability may result in the inability of voluntary respiration or even complete motor and sensory loss for segments located caudal to the injury

Similarly, hemisection injuries of the cervical spine, specifically those located rostral to C3 to C5, have been shown to significantly decrease tidal volume with reflexive increased breathing frequency, secondary to ipsilateral hemidiaphragm paralysis.
