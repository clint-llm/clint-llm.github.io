Pediatric pneumonia is often undertreated or missed, leading to high morbidity and mortality. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team to improve outcomes. The majority of patients are managed by the pediatrician, nurse practitioner, or primary care provider.Â  Patient and caregiver education is vital. Parents need to be told to avoid smoking, and the importance of handwashing cannot be overstated. In addition, all clinicians looking after children should emphasize vaccination against pneumococcus and influenza.

Healthcare professionals, including physicians, nurses, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, ideally work together in close environments for optimum patient care. When caring for children with pneumonia, pharmacists can be of significant help with geographic resistance patterns for better treatment outcomes with selected antibiotic choices.

Caregivers should be educated about signs of respiratory difficulty and when to seek medical assistance. Only through a team approach can pneumonia in children be treated promptly with minimal morbidity.
