Acute bronchitis is one of the common presentations in any healthcare setting. It is estimated thatÂ every year, 5% of the general population reports an episode of acute bronchitis, accounting for more than 10 million office visits yearly.

Factors like a history of smoking, living in a polluted place, crowding, and a history of asthma, are all risk factors for acute bronchitis. In some people, acute bronchitis can be triggered by particular allergens like pollens, perfume, and vapors.

When the infection is bacterial, the isolated pathogens are usually the same as those responsible for community-acquired pneumonia, for example, Streptococcus
pneumonia and Staphylococcus
aureus.
