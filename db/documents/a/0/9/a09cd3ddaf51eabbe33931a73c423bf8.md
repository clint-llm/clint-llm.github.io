Atrioventricular dissociation is a cardiac conduction defect where the atria and ventricles beat independently of each other. It can occur due to various pathological conditions, and a detailed ECG review is required to confirm the source. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of AV dissociation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of atrioventricular dissociation.
- Identify the classic ECG findings of atrioventricular dissociation which include the occurrence of P waves marching through QRS complexes, fusion beats, and capture beats.
- Outline the need for permanent pacemaker placement due to complete heart block.
- Review care coordination between specialists, nurses, and pharmacists and how it decreases incidences of drug-drug interactions, ensures the efficacy of medications, and helps the prompt treatment of atrioventricular dissociation, improving patient outcomes.
