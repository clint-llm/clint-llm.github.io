Transabdominal ultrasound’s main role in acute pancreatitis is to identify gallstones and/or choledocholithiasis. Otherwise, ultrasound has limited use in significant measure due to difficult visualization of the pancreas, often due to overlying bowel gas.

On the other hand, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) may be useful in the setting of chronic pancreatitis evaluation.

Pancreatic lipomatosis, in the setting of cystic fibrosis, classically shows increased pancreatic echogenicity on ultrasonography.  The characteristic lobular architecture of the pancreas may also appear diminished.

Transabdominal ultrasound is not an uncommon initial imaging modality for a patient with jaundice, epigastric pain, and/or weight loss, as ultrasound is highly sensitive for detecting obstruction of the biliary tract and resultant dilation. If these symptoms are due to a pancreatic carcinoma, the mass usually appears as an ill-defined and hypoechoic, hypovascular structure with or without ductal dilation.

Ultrasound’s place in the evaluation of pancreatic NETs is uncertain.  However, these well-circumscribed, hypoechoic, and hypervascular lesions can sometimes be seen on ultrasound, even if their morphology is nonspecific. EUS can be helpful in the setting of both exocrine and endocrine tumors, as biopsy via FNA can be performed during the ultrasound.
