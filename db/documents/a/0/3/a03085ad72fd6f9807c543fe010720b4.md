The prognosis of Retinal traction detachment depends upon a number of systemic and ocular factors. Systemic factors include control of DM, renal parameters, HTN, and sickle cell hemoglobinopathy.

Instrumentation gauge, surgical time, methods of membranectomy, tamponade agent, and the experience of the operating surgeon are the surgical variables with the potential to affect postoperative outcomes.

A study on the influence of demographic patterns on outcomes of RTDs reported that blacks lost vision postoperatively, while whites and Asians gained vision. This may be due to the presence of more extensive vitreoretinal adhesions in RTDs in people of African descendants.

Diabetic TRDs are the late stage of diabetic retinopathy, and patients should be explained about the advanced situation of the disease and grave visual prognosis. The goal of surgery is the anatomical attachment of the retina and to maintain the vision or to prevent further visual decline.

The causes of poor visual outcomes include chronically neglected and advanced disease, longer duration and increased height of macular detachment, optic atrophy, ischemic optic neuropathy, macular thinning, macular hole, macular ischemia, persistent SRF, outer retinal, and photoreceptor damage, and global retinal ischemia.
