Managed care was introduced with the idea to decrease the overspending on patient care and oversupply healthcare services.

Like any other industry, the health care industry has commercialized over the decades; thus, the cost-cutting has met with continued backlash. This has given rise to the managed competition, which offers the consumer full responsibility to choose the premium costs, overall health care coverage and adjust the care plan based on personal risk. This has helped create an incentive for the physicians to provide better care with controlled costs.
