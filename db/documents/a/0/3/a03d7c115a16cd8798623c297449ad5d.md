Only trained doctors, physical therapists, occupational therapists, or other personnel with prior training should perform evaluations using goniometers.

The skilled person must know how to:

- Position and stabilize the joint correctly.

- Move a body part through its appropriate range of motion (ROM).

- Determine the joint's end of the range of motion and end-feel.

- Palpate the appropriate bony landmarks.

- Align the goniometer with the landmarks.

- Read the measuring instrument properly.

- Record measurements correctly.
