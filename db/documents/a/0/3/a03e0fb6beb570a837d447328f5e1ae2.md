Psoas syndrome is more commonly seen in athletes but can occur in the general population as well. The prevalence is higher in runners and athletes partaking in plyometric exercises. Activities that result in repetitive hip flexion can result in underlying psoas syndrome.

Separately, psoas tendinitis or syndrome can occur with the impingement of the psoas tendon against an oversized acetabulum.

The location of the psoas muscle is in the lower lumbar area of the spine and has attachment points along the pelvis and femur. The primary action of the psoas muscle is it serves as a hip flexor and an external rotator of the leg. The psoas muscle proximal attachment is along with the transverse processes of the lumbar spine. Separately, the iliac muscle proximal attachment is along the inner surface of the ilium. Both muscles then insert on the medial aspect of the proximal femur, on the lesser trochanter. In 15% of people, the iliopsoas bursa communicates with the hip joint. Any snapping or clunking which may occur on physical exam as the patient's leg moves from flexion to extension is due to the iliopsoas tendon moving medially to lateral on the femoral head. The snapping of the iliopsoas muscle leads to inflammation and or fluid accumulation in the iliopsoas bursa.
