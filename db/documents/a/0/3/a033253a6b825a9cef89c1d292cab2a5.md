Ammonia is among the most widely produced chemicals in the United States, a majority of which ends up as chemical fertilizers or as animal feeds. Ammonia exposure occurs mainly in the following ways:

- Gas leaks from production, storage, or transportation facilities of ammonia. Hence, people who work in such facilities are at an increased risk for inhalational and dermal exposure.

- A high level of ammonia may be present in the air after the application of ammonia-containing fertilizers in the soil.

- Household and industrial cleaners contain anywhere from 5% to 25% of ammonia in dissolved form. Hence the residents, especially children of such households, are at an increased risk for accidental or suicidal ingestion exposure. The spillage of such products can lead to significant inhalational exposure as well.

- Ammonia is produced by decaying manure. Hence the farmers who work in animal confinement buildings are at an increased risk for inhalational exposure.
