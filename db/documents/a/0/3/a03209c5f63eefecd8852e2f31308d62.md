Simulation allows the polishing of vital nontechnical skills such as teamwork, situational awareness, task management, and decision making in a controlled and safe environment. The ultimate goal of such tasks is to increase patient safety and improve patient outcomes. The International Network for Simulation-based Pediatric Innovation, Research, & Education (INSPIRE) has established a collaborative process to examine the effects of healthcare simulation, including studies to evaluate the effect of resuscitation training on improving the performance of a code team during cardiac arrest, among others.

Simulation has lead to vast improvements in the clinical training of medical students, residents, and junior faculty. Improved patient outcomes commonly occur with higher fidelity simulation.

Simulation is now utilized for systems assessment and identifying latent safety threats in high-risk environments.
