Medial epicondylitis is primarily caused by repetitive strain from activities that involve frequent loaded gripping, forearm pronation, and/or wrist flexion. In the sports world, it can be seen in throwing athletes (baseball pitchers, javelin throwers), golfers, tennis players, bowlers, rock climbers, archers, and weightlifters. However, most commonly it occurs in golfers, tennis players, and baseball pitchers. The intense valgus forces during the late cocking and acceleration phases of throwing or the late phases of the golf swing just before and during contact with the ball or ground contribute to the prevalence among these athletes.
