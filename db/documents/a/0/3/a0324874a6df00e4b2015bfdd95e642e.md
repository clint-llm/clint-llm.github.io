Histological studies of the decubitus ulcer extent, which include blanch able erythema, non-blanch able erythema, decubitus dermatitis, decubitus ulcer, and black scab/gangrene, show a dynamic process. The initial change occurs in the vessels of the papillary dermis. After this follows the necrosis of skin structures. The scab/gangrene is a full-thickness defect that is due to either persistent ischemia and anoxemia or a sudden occlusion of large vessels due to shear injury.

Detailed analysis of chronic pressure ulcers showed the presence of densely aggregated bacterial colonies, often present in the extracellular matrix, but these findings were not present in acutely developed ulcers.
