The staples of DCS treatment involves administration of 100% oxygen, hydration as clinically indicated, and placement of the patient in Tredenelenburg position with the head slightly angled down.The United States Air Force has published information on using ground-level 100% oxygen therapy for 2 hours following type-1 decompression sickness that occurs at altitude if it resolves upon descent. They used hyperbaric oxygen for more severe cases and for cases of type-1 decompression sickness that did not resolve. They have reported a high success rate with this treatment, with 94% of subjects not requiring further hyperbaric therapy. Further, the majority of individuals (95.6%) experiencing minor symptoms were manageable with ground-level 100% oxygen and had their symptoms resolved before starting any form of therapy, so consider this form of therapy in an individual with minor symptoms that have resolved before starting therapy. It is important to note that those results were from an altitude-chamber study since the high frequency of rapid onset symptoms at altitude is not always expected.  Prognosis is much more improved for type-2 decompression sickness the more expedient treatment is accomplished.  Complete resolution with type-2 DCS is at 75% with about 16% having residual symptoms resolving over 3 months.  This number goes down between 57 to 75% if treatment is delayed greater than 12 hours.
