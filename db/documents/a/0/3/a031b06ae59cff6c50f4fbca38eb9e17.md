Urine microscopy is useful in analyzing the kidney stone if they are obtainable via urine straining. Below are the crystal formations typically associated with each stone type

- Calcium oxalate: envelope or dumbbell-shaped

- Calcium oxalate is the primary component of the majority of stones. They typically occur in the setting of hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypomagnesuria, hypercystinuria, hypocitraturia.

- Calcium phosphate: amorphous, wedge-shaped prisms in rosettes

- Magnesium ammonium phosphate: coffin lid shaped 

- Also known as struvite stones, seen in infectious stones. In the setting of infections with bacteria that produce urease, such as Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The urease produces ammonia and CO2, which creates basic pH urine (>7).

- Uric acid: rhomboid shaped 

- These stones are typically idiopathic. They occur in patients whose diets are high in protein, which acidifies urines pH (<7), allowing for uric acid stone formation.

- Cystine: hexagon-shaped

- These stones are caused by a genetic defect in the transport of the amino acid cystine, resulting in hypercystinuria.
