The diagnosis and management of hypersensitivity pneumonitis is made by an interprofessional team. Once the diagnosis is made, the cornerstone of treatment is the eradication of the causative agent from the patient’s environment. The condition is typically reversible if diagnosed early in the course of the disease and complete antigen avoidance can be achieved. This is often very difficult due to social, economic or occupational reasons. Complete antigen avoidance should be advised by whatever means necessary to prevent progression of disease and fibrosis. Even though corticosteroids are widely prescribed, there are no clinical trials that have shown a reversal of the disease in severe cases. Plus, long term steroids also have serious adverse effects. Many other potent disease-modifying agents have been used but good data to support their use are also lacking. Lung transplantation has been shown to have excellent medium-term survival in patients with advanced lung disease due to HP when compared to patients with UIP/IPF. There is some evidence that patients with chronic HP are less susceptible to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). For patients with lung fibrosis, the life span is significantly reduced.
