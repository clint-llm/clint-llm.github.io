The situations where PC is contraindicated are mainly when the rate of potential complications is high or when the success chance is low. There are several patient and disease factors that affect the safety and rate of success. The absolute contraindications for PC are irreversible coagulopathy or clopidogrel use that is necessary and cannot stop. The relative contraindications include aspirin use, large volume ascites, and hemodynamic instability. Most patients are severely ill, and clinicians should attempt to reverse any contraindications when possible.
