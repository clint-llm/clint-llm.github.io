Tissue excised from the epileptogenic areas may show cortical dysplasia, cortical inflammation, neoplastic/dysplastic changes, or vascular malformations. For patients diagnosed with MTLE, a post mortem autopsy will grossly show hippocampal sclerosis. On a cellular level, Hematoxylin and Eosin staining of cells excised from the sclerotic tissue will exhibit areas of dysplastic changes represented by small pink pools within the cytoplasm surrounding nucleolated nuclei.

For patients presenting with tumor-associated epilepsy, the histopathological characteristics will identify the type and classification of the tumor, but these characteristics are not specific to partial epilepsy.
