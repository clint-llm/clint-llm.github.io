**Upper Blepharoplasty**

An upper blepharoplasty may be indicated for functional reasons.

- Excess laxity with temporal hooding can interfere with superior and supero-temporal vision and may make the patient constantly raise their brows or the chin in order to see. Patients may complain specifically of having difficulty driving and seeing traffic lights. Formal visual fields are sometimes carried out to objectively show the superior field constriction, although many believe this is a waste of precious resources as it rarely changes medical management or affects the outcome.

- Constant use of the frontalis muscle in the presence of dermatochalasis and ptosis may give rise to frontal headaches.

- Eye irritation may be caused by eyelash ptosis or entropion because of the dermatochalasis.

- Skin-on-skin irritation may cause dermatitis

- Down-gaze ptosis is the droop of the upper eyelids that occurs because of redundant upper eyelid skin and interferes with reading.

**Cosmetic Blepharoplasty**

Most patients seeking cosmetic blepharoplasty are seeking a more defined skin crease and an improvement in the fat prominence in the upper eyelids. Depending upon the changes, upper blepharoplasty is often performed with browlifts.
