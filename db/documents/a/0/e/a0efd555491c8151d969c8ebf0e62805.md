Argatroban, like other anticoagulants, is contraindicated in overt bleeding.

When argatroban is used in patients with increased bleeding risk like severe hypertension, after major surgery, immediately following lumbar puncture, spinal anesthesia, particular caution and vigilance are necessary.

Avoid argatroban in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to it or any of its components in the dosage form.
