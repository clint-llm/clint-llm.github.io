The visual field test maps the vision in each individual eye by measuring the entire scope of vision when vision is focused on a central point. A visual field deficit can help to localize a lesion along the visual pathway. Homonymous superior quadrantanopia, also called "pie in the sky" causes a field deficit in the superior field of both eyes on the same side. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of homonymous superior quadrantanopia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of homonymous superior quadrantanopia.
- Review the evaluation of the homonymous superior quadrantanopia.
- Outline management options available for homonymous superior quadrantanopia.
- Summarize the importance of communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients with homonymous superior quadrantanopia.
