Elbow Stiffness: Any injury to the elbow can result in stiffness as a result of immobilization. This is one of the reasons that early, rigid fixation is most often the treatment of choice for distal humerus fractures. This allows for a post-operative protocol that utilizes early range of motion exercises. Most protocols begin with at least partial, protected ROM within 14 days of operative fixation.

Nerve Injury: In particular, ulnar nerve injury can be common, as much as 50%. This is due to its proximity to fracture fragments as well as the need to mobilize and retract the nerve during fracture fixation. This is often in the form of transient nerve palsy that does return but is more serious. Lasting deficits can happen as well.

Heterotopic Ossification: As is the case in most settings of severe trauma, heterotopic ossification can be a postoperative complication. Risk factors that predispose individuals to develop heterotopic ossification include Type A and B distal humerus fractures, floating elbow injuries, and a longer time to surgery.

Nonunion: The risk for nonunion is relatively rare but can occur in distal humerus fractures. Another thing to consider is the risk for non-union of an olecranon osteotomy site if the surgeon chooses to utilize this approach. Risk factors that are generally accepted in association with nonunion are smoking, obesity, and diabetes mellitus.
