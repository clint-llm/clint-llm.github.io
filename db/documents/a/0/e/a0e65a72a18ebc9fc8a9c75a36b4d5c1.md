Stent thrombosis is a major complication associated with stent placement in PCI. Complications associated with untreated stent thrombosis include death, myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock. Complications related to the treatment of stent thrombosis are similar to that of PCI. These include but are not limited to bruising, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, arrhythmia, contrast-induced nephropathy, thrombus formation, infection, ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction.
