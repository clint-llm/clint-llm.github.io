It is essential to understand the different factors influencing breast ptosis and tailoring corrective techniques to patients' individual needs, hence increasing patient and surgeon satisfaction. Periareolar Mastopexy is indicated for mild or moderate ptosis, with little lower pole skin redundancy and reasonable skin and parenchyma quality. Vertical mastopexy is indicated for any degree of ptosis, usually combined with small amounts of parenchymal excision and skin envelope redraping, so it has the potential to reduce the breast size modestly. Inverted-T mastopexy is indicated for severe ptosis because of the excessive skin envelope to parenchyma ratio and breasts with fatty parenchyma or poor skin quality. Combined augmentation and mastopexy are only indicated whenever the volume deficit and the ptosis are severe enough for neither procedure to suffice alone.
