There is minimal preparation needed to complete the Achilles reflex test. The patient should be relaxed, lying on an examination table, and their Achilles tendon area well exposed from the superior calf to the plantar aspect of the foot. The practitioner should have washed hands, reflex hammer in hand, and should be in the position to perform the exam.
