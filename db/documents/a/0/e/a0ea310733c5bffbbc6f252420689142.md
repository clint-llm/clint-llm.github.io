The development of ASAS is associated with an acute presentation after the time of insult. Usually, the first presenting symptom is acute back pain, whose location most of the time correspondsÂ with the level of the injury in the spinal cord.

Acute clinical findings:

- Acute back pain at the level of injury

- Bilateral flaccid para/quadriparesis or plegia

- Loss of pain and temperature

- Preservation of proprioception, vibratory sense, fine touch, and two-point discrimination

- Autonomic dysfunction with hypotension, bradycardia, and impaired temperature regulation

- Respiratory failure

- Spinal shock

Late clinical findings (within days to weeks):

- Continued/permanent motor/sensory dysfunction

- Bilateral spastic para/quadriparesis or plegia

- Hyperreflexia

- Bilateral Babinski signs

- Neurogenic bladder/bowel

- Sexual dysfunction
