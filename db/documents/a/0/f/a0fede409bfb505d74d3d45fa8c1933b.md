Extraocular muscle (EOM) management from ocular, orbital, and cranial trauma can be varied and complex. In the known ocular or orbital trauma setting, elucidating the mechanism, type, and severity of the injury helps triage critical components of the physical exam. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of extraocular muscles with globe and orbital trauma and highlights the role of interprofessional teams in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of traumatic extraocular muscle injury.
- Outline the typical presentation, physical exam findings, and imaging findings associated with an extraocular muscle injury.
- Review the surgical considerations for extraocular muscles during globe and orbital trauma repair.
- Explain the importance of monitoring with continued follow-up exams by the interprofessional team for patients with extraocular muscle injury.
