A majority of the innervation of the lower extremity is given rise by the sciatic nerve from the lumbosacral plexus. This nerve dives under the piriformis muscle and then moves distally. The sciatic nerve branches into the common fibular nerve and tibial nerve at the distal one-third of the femur. As it moves distally, the tibial nerve branches into the medial calcaneal, medial sural cutaneous, medial plantar, and lateral plantar nerves. Also, the common peroneal nerve divides into the deep peroneal nerve and the superficial peroneal nerve.

The deep peroneal nerve provides the motor function for the muscles that dorsiflex the foot, and the superficial peroneal nerve accepts sensory information through the cutaneous branches. The following section will discuss specific innervations of the muscles of the medial longitudinal arch.
