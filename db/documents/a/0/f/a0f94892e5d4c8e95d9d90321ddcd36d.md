An accurate description of PCH has been scant and perhaps nonspecific. Still, some research suggests that on history, patients may report a continuous, pulsatile, or pounding pain of variable intensity that appears within seven days of the surgery. Other common characteristics include symptoms on the same side as the surgical incision and improvement of symptoms over time.

As with all headaches, it is imperative to rule out red flag signs including but not limited to paralysis, papilledema, drowsiness, confusion, memory impairment, loss of consciousness, focal neurologic signs, neck stiffness, sudden onset excruciating pain, or personality changes.

Some evidence points to scar neuromas as a potential trigger for headaches. Thus, it is essential to assess the scar site on the physical exam and evaluate the reproduction of headache pain with palpation.
