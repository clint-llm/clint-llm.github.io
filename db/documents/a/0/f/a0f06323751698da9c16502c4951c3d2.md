Psoriasis has a multifactorial etiology. Apart from genetic predisposition, risk factors that trigger psoriasis include trauma, infection, drugs, metabolic factors, stress, alcohol, smoking, and sunlight. Drugs that can exacerbate psoriasisÂ include antimalarials, beta-blockers, bupropion, calcium channel blockers, captopril, fluoxetine, glyburide, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interferon, interleukins, lipid-lowering drugs, lithium, penicillin, and terbinafine.

Genetic factors do play a role in plaque psoriasis; there is a much higher risk of developing plaque psoriasis if one individual already has the disorder. Patients with susceptible loci (PSOR1) on chromosome 6 are more likely to develop the disorder.

Almost all types of trauma are known to be associated with plaque psoriasis. In addition, excessive scratching can trigger or aggravate localized psoriasis. The development of psoriatic plaques at any site of trauma is known as the koebner reaction.

Sunlight is known to be beneficial for patients with plaque psoriasis; however, in a small number of patients, the disorder may be aggravated by light.

Both HIV and pharyngeal streptococcal infections have been associated with psoriasis. However, HIV patients managed with HAART tend to have less severe disease.
