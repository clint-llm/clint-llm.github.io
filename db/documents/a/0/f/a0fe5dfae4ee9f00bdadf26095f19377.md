As noted above, history and coagulation tests should exclude the possibility of a bleeding disorder. Questions related to drug ingestion should be asked as well, as medications may increase bleeding risk. The provider should inquire about large-volume alcohol ingestion, as alcohol potentiates aspirin-induced and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced prolonged bleeding time for up to two days.

**Day of Procedure**

Steps before and performance of spinal are the same, whether opioids are added to local anesthetic for surgery, or administered for chronic pain in a clinic. Informed consent must be obtained and should include a discussion of the risks and benefits of spinal. Side effects and complications should be discussed. While side effects such as nausea and pruritus may be mentioned, headache and neurologic complications must be carefully explained. Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) incidence is often stated to be 1.5% to 2% among young, pregnant women (though some newer studies report incidences up to 4%), and persistent PDPH has resulted in medical-legal action. Therefore, it is wise to carefully explain to parturients that spinal for caesarian section has been determined to be safer than general anesthesia and that if PDPH occurs, treatments are available. Indeed, a good relationship formed with the patient at this time is likely to result in a request for such treatment, up to and including a blood patch, while a lack of informed consent will lead to a patient who is both in pain and angry. The risk of rare complications such as neurologic deficits should be mentioned, with an incidence of 1:10,000 – 1:25,000 and the fact that these deficits usually resolve in time. These estimates may be conventional, based on the Third National Audit Project of the Royal College of Anaesthetists. The interested reader is referred to this in-depth study that sought to quantify the major complications associated with neuraxial blocks.

Some feel the risk of subependymal hemorrhage (SEH) is sufficiently rare that it need not be discussed. It may be more prudent to discuss this risk while also stating it may be as rare as 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 200,000 in patients without bleeding. In some institutions, consent for anesthesia is included within the surgical consent. At these centers, a note should be written confirming the conversation about spinal with the patient.

The healthcare team must be prepared for unexpected occurrences. Therefore, intravenous access should be established, and vital sign monitors (ECG, pulse oximetry, and blood pressure) applied throughout the performance of a spinal.
