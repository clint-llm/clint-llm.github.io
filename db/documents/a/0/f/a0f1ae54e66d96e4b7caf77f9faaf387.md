They are facultative intracellular organisms. Cryptococcal fungi exist in asexual forms (yeast) and sexual forms (telomorphs). They produce white mucoid colonies when grown on a wide variety of agars. The two-predominant species of Cryptococcus are differentiated by growth features on canavanine-glycine-bromo methyl blue agar. Histological identification can be performed by methenamine silver stain for yeast forms, mucicarmine stain for yeast and capsule forms and Fontana-Masson stain for the melanin in the yeast.
