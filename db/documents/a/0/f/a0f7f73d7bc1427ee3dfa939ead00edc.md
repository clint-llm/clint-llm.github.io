As discussed in Treatment/Management, the overall prognosis of CSF leak is very favorable, with one study citing a 90% first-attempt success rate of endoscopic repair of CSF rhinorrhea and another study citing an overall success rate of 98% across traumatic, iatrogenic, and congenital causes.

A recent study showed that when stratifying by first CSF leak treatment, EBP wasÂ more effective when applied to the right individuals with smaller dural abnormalities. On the other hand, the greater dural abnormalities can be the reason why surgical and lumbar drain treatments fail more frequently. Ninety-seven percent of the patients failed initial EBP, 21.1 failed lumbar drain, 13.5% failed surgery, and the overall failure rate was 10.9%.

The success rate of endoscopic CSF repairs ranges from 87 to 100% after the first attempt.Â Patients with severe skull base abnormalities, lateral sphenoid leaks, raised body mass index, spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea, and elevated BMI are more likely to experience recurrence. Recurrence might also happen in patients in their middle age, who are obese and have an empty sella. A high recurrence rate is linked to elevated ICP, diabetes mellitus, and a body mass index of >30. Patients who have repeated CSF leaks may have a higher failure rate.
