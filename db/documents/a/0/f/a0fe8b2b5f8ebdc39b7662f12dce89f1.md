The clinical-etiology-anatomy-pathophysiology (CEAP) classification system of venous reflux is used to assess the clinical severity of symptoms:

- C0 no visible or palpable signs of venous disease

- C1 telangiectasies or reticular veins

- C2 varicose veins

- C3 edema

- C4a pigmentation and eczema

- C4b lipodermatosclerosis and atrophieÂ blanche

- C5 healed venous ulcer

- C6 active venous ulcer

Initial diagnosis is by clinical evaluation of swelling, discoloration, and skin ulcerations.

Symptoms associated with varicose veins include:

- Leg heaviness

- Itching

- Cramps

- Mild tenderness

- Skin discoloration

- Exercise intolerance

- Leg fatigue

The physical exam may reveal visibly distended veins from the thigh to the ankle. The discoloration is usually most prominent around the ankle and calf. The Trendelenburg test is often used to assess the competency of the deep venous valves. The leg is elevated until all the superficial veins have collapsed. With the hand, the groin area is compressed to occlude the saphenofemoral junction, and the patient is asked to stand up. If the deep valves are incompetent, the leg's superficial veins will start filling up. If distal varicosity remains empty, the point of entry is most likely at the saphenofemoral junction. This patient can benefit from ligation of the saphenous vein at this junction.
