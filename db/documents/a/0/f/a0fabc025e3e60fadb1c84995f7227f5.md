The latissimus dorsi, or "wing" muscle, is among the largest and strongest in the body. It originates on the spine and ilium and extends across the upper and mid-back to insert on the superior humerus. The latissimus lies superficial to the ribs and intercostal muscles, and it traverses inferiorly and laterally to the scapula and scapular muscles. The muscle is perfused by the thoracodorsal vessels and innervated by the thoracodorsal nerve.

Like the circumflex scapular artery, the thoracodorsal artery is a terminal branch of the subscapular artery; it descends accompanying the lateral aspect of the back and is typically accompanied by one, or occasionally two, venae comitantes. The thoracodorsal artery itself gives descending and transverse branches, with one branch supplying the serratus anterior muscle. The vessels enter the latissimus dorsi muscle belly approximately 10 cm from its insertion at the humerus, and they continue along the deep surface of the muscle.
