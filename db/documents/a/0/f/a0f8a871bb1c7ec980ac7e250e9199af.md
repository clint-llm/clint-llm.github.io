Over 40% of distal radius fractures have a concomitant injury to the distal ulna.

Osteoporosis is a significant risk factor placing advanced age individuals and postmenopausal women at risk.Â Obesity, history of falls, alcohol, and dementia are other important risk factors.

Healthcare providers should anticipate an increased incidence of these injuries as the average life expectancy rises in the United States. In children, distal ulna physeal fractures account for 5% of physeal fractures, and Salter-Harris type II involving the metaphysis and physis are the most common.
