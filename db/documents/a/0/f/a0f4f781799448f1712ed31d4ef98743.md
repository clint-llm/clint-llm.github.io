The temporal bone is the thickest bone in the body, requiring significant force to fracture. Such high-velocity head injuries carry the risk of significant morbidity or mortality due to injury of the cranial nerves or important vascular structures traversing the temporal bone but also associated traumatic brain injury or poly-trauma. This activity will review the most common causes of temporal bone fractures and outline the approach to treatment.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiologic factors associated with temporal bone fractures.
- Describe the evaluation of temporal bone fractures.
- Explain the management of temporal bone fractures.
- Explain how the facilitation of interprofessional team education and discussion can optimize the effective detection of temporal bone fractures and inform the need for subsequent evaluations.
