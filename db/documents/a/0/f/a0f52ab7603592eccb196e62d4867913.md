The 2 major indications for measuring C-peptide levels include fasting hypoglycemia and assessment of insulin secretory reserve in patients with diabetes. In patients with fasting hypoglycemia with concomitant hyperinsulinism, one needs to entertain a differential diagnosis comprising insulinoma, exogenous insulin administration (factitious), sulfonylurea therapy (factitious), insulin autoimmune syndrome due to endogenous anti-insulin antibodies (Hirata disease).

The other major indication is the assessment of insulin secretory reserve in patients with diabetes. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by hyperglycemia due to the lack of insulin secretion and/or insulin action. Insulin deficiency is associated with C-peptide-deficiency in type 1 diabetes due to beta-cell demise. A fasting C-peptide level of less than 0.6 ng/ml is consistent with beta-cell failure and predicts the requirement for insulin therapy. Although the origins of type 2 diabetes are insulin resistance, it only manifests clinically when there is beta-cell failure resulting in impaired insulin and C-peptide secretion culminating in fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia. Much more research is needed to define the biology of C-peptide and potential role in the pathogenesis of diabetic microvascular complications or as a novel therapeutic agent.

Also, Medicare uses a C-peptide assessment of insulin reserve as a criterion for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy (insulin pump therapy).

**Pearls**

C-peptide is secreted in equimolar concentrations with insulin from the beta cells.

It is a valid measure of insulin secretion especially following challenges with glucagon or a mixed meal.

C-peptide is extremelyÂ useful in the differential diagnosis of hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia.
