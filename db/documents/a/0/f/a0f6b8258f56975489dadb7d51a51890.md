Many patients die from cyanide poisoning before reaching the hospital. Of those that survive to reach the hospital, many are left with profound disabilities. In one case of 64 patients with concomitant carbon monoxide and cyanide poisoning that were treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy alone, all survived, and 92% were reported to have a good outcome. Patients removed from structure fires have had a prolonged exposure risk poisoning from cyanide, carbon monoxide or both. The survivability depends on the duration of the exposure to the poison, comorbidities such as heart, pulmonary or renal disease as well as access to a level 1 trauma center and emergency hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Burns are also a common comorbidity in these patients further increasing their risk of death. Airway protection is paramount for any patient found with soot in the nares or around the mouth, as edema of the burnt airway is likely to progress to occlusion very rapidly. Access to hyperbaric oxygen treatment 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, as well as rapid administration of hydroxocobalamin, will improve survivability and reduce delayed neurologic sequelae.
