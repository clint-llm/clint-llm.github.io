While at times difficult, an attempt should be made to differentiate lumbosacral facet joint syndrome from the above diagnoses at first with a history and physical examination. While a history of pain radiation to the lower extremity can point more towards radiculopathy or discogenic pain, providers should remember that such presentation may also indicate facetogenic pain, especially in facet joint cysts. Physical examination, while not always completely specific, may help point away from certain diagnoses in the differential. Pain with hip flexion, abduction, and external rotation (FABERE) and hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (FADIR) may point more towards sacroiliac and intraarticular hip pathology, respectively. A positive straight leg raise test may point more towards lumbosacral radiculopathy or discogenic pain. However, these tests are often nonspecific. While imaging with X-ray, CT, and MRI may be useful in evaluating spinal anatomy, these tests are also often nonspecific in diagnosing the true etiology of pain. Lumbar medial branch block, therefore, serves as the most reliable definitive diagnosis of the facet joint as the true etiology of a patient's low back pain.
