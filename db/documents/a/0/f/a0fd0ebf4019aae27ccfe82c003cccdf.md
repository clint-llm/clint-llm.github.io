It is important to take a thorough history when assessing a patient with SNHL. Essential points to obtain include age of onset, laterality of symptoms, rapidity of decline, fluctuating symptoms, and associated symptoms such as tinnitus, aural fullness, disequilibrium, and vertigo. Establishing the premorbid hearing level is crucial to direct rehabilitation and to assess if the hearing loss is new or deterioration of an existing picture. Previous ear surgery, history of noise exposure, previous head trauma, barotrauma, or ototoxic exposure to aminoglycosides are asked.

Patients who present with presbycusis will give a history of progressive decline in hearing. They are turning up the television louder than usual and asking other people to speak up. It is often family members who notice this first. There will be a history of personal noise exposure or occupational exposure in noise-induced hearing loss cases. Social history often helps guide management and provides insight into how the patient's symptoms affect their lives and their families. Many patients with hearing loss find it incredibly isolating. Activities they previously enjoyed, such as going to the cinema, going out to eat at a restaurant, and meeting family and friends, become stressful for them, and they withdraw from them.

When seeing patients in the clinic with a new hearing loss, aside from a focused otological examination, it is essential to do a full head and neck exam, including all the cranial nerves, although it is typically normal.
