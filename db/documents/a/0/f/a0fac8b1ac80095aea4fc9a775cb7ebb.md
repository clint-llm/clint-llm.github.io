Akathisia is defined as an inability to remain still. It is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that is associated with psychomotor restlessness.

The individual with akathisia will generally experience an intense sensation of unease or an inner restlessness that usually involves the lower extremities-this results in a compulsion to move. In most cases the movement is repetitive.

Akathisia is a movement disorder that may be associated with the use of antipsychotic medications. The primary movement disorders from antipsychotic agents are akathisia, acute dystonia, pseudoparkinsonism, and tardive dyskinesia. Akathisia may also rarely occur with antidepressant agents.

It may be difficult to determine whether a patient is experiencing akathisia or anxiety or agitation. Early identification and management are important as akathisia may be associated with treatment nonadherence.

Antipsychotic-induced akathisia may be managed by reducing the dose of the offending agent or switching to an alternative antipsychotic agent.

Beta-blockers such as propranolol and benzodiazepines have historically been used for the treatment of akathisia although the amount of high-quality data supporting their use is limited.

Anticholinergic agents such as benztropine may be utilized if concomitant pseudoparkinsonism is present.
