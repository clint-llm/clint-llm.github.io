The popularity of simulation is continuously increasing as a model of experiential learning that is preferred by adult learners. Debriefing is an intrinsic component of the simulation exercise to ensure meaningful teaching points. The approaches to debriefing are variable and can be adapted depending on the environment and the needs of the learners.

Written tools, such as the PEARLS debriefing tool, attempt to provide structure to the debriefing process in the form of a script and a guide.
