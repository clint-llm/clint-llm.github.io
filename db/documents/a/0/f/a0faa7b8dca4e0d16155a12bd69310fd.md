As a person ages, there are visible changes occur within the structures of the face. There are descent and atrophy of the malar fat pads, deepening of the nasolabial folds (NLFs), loss of skin elasticity, and development of jowls. There is a wide variety of techniques that can be utilized to rejuvenate the mid-face. Lifting the mid-face can be accomplished during a deep plane facelift, as an addition to a superficial muscular aponeurotic system (SMAS) flap lift, or with a minimal access cranial suspension (MACS) lift. It can also be accomplished through a subciliary incision or with carefully placed incisions in the temporal hair tuft and gingivolabial sulcus. The method chosen should be tailored to patient-specific areas of concern.
