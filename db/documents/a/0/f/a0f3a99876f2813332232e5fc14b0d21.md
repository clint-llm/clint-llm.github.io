In plastic surgery centers specializing in DIEP flap breast reconstruction, intensive monitoring is crucial after breast reconstruction using a free flap because signs of deterioration of the flap can appear quite early. Sometimes, suddenly and detection of its signs allows recovery of the flap within an acceptable timeframe.

In recognized university centers, the creation of a universal protocol for monitoring postoperative flaps is recommended to guarantee quality nursing care. Nurses must be more confident in their ability to manage postoperative complications and be able to contact the surgeon in the event of anomalies or under prescription.
