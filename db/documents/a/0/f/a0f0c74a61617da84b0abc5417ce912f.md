The olecranon is the proximal articular portion of the ulna. Along with the coronoid process, it forms the greater sigmoid notch which articulates with the humerus to provide flexion and extension of the elbow. Fractures of the olecranon are a relatively common injury in adults; its subcutaneous location leaves it vulnerable to injury from a direct blow. Fractures sustained range from simple undisplaced fractures to complex open fracture dislocations. Olecranon fractures frequently require surgical management to restore articular congruity and elbow stability. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of fractures of the olecranon and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the most common mechanisms of injury that can result in olecranon fractures.
- Summarize the diagnostic approach for an evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with a potential olecranon fracture, including any indicated imaging studies.
- Outline the treatment options for olecranon fractures, depending on patient population and fracture severity grading.
- Review the role of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to streamline diagnosis, reduction, and/or surgery for patients with olecranon fracture.
