Mucormycosis results from a variety of fungi that may be typically innocuous environmental fungi and primarily affects immunocompromised patients. For this reason, the clinician must have a high index of suspicion to diagnose this disease in any of its forms when it presents in a patient with these risk factors. Starting with the features of the host and the tropism of the fungus once it invades the host, this activity discusses the manifestations of this disease, appropriate evaluation/management of mucormycosis, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of mucormycosis.
- Explain the evaluation of mucormycosis.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for mucormycosis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with mucormycosis.
