There are two sides to the treatment of cluster headaches: treatment of acute attack and preventative treatment.

**Acute Treatment**

Perhaps the most well-known treatment for cluster headaches is 100% oxygen therapy.

Triptans are the only other level A recommended treatment. Delivery of these drugs can be subcutaneous sumatriptan or zolmitriptan delivered via nasal spray.

Other treatment options include intranasal lidocaine (with a reported 33% response), octreotide, and ergotamine.

**Preventative Treatment**

The only level A recommended treatment for the prevention of cluster headaches is a suboccipital blockade. Adverse events are nonserious, including transient injection site pain and low-level headache.

Verapamil is the most widely prescribed preventative drug.

Glucocorticoids are also recommended as preventive therapy for patients with episodic cluster headaches and active cluster periods that are infrequent and last less than two months. A study revealed 70 to 80% response to therapy.

Other pharmacological options include lithium, valproic acid, melatonin, and intranasal capsaicin.

There has been much research into electrical stimulation. Sites of stimulation include the sphenopalatine ganglion, occipital, and vagus nerve. Deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus has been very successful and has proven helpful in treating drug-resistant patients.
