Ureteroscopy has applications in diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Generally, the rigid or semi-rigid ureteroscope is preferred for examination or intervention in the distal ureter, whereas the flexible ureteroscope can better maneuver the tortuosity of the upper ureter, renal pelvis, and calyces. Ureteroscopy approaches can be retrograde by urethral access or antegrade by percutaneous nephrostomy access.

Indications for ureteroscopy include the diagnosis and treatment of:

- Filling defects observed in excretory CT urography (calculi, strictures, post-inflammatory changes, sloughed papilla, blood clots, fungus balls, ureteral and renal pelvic tumors)

- Lateralizing essential hematuria (hemangiomas, minute venous rupture, varices, arterio-venous malformations, and neoplasms)

- Foreign bodies (most commonly migrated or fragmented double-pigtail catheters and broken accessory devices)

- Upper-tract neoplasms (including biopsy, surveillance, laser ablation, and palliative measures)

- Fistulas (diagnostic modality of choice for definitive diagnosis of ureterovaginal fistula)

Ureteroscopy, in conjunction with endoluminal ultrasonography, can assist in identifying extraluminal causes of filling defects and further evaluate the intramural extension of malignant lesions.

The most common indication for ureteroscopy is the management of renal and ureteral calculi. For nephrolithiasis patients with clinically significant stones in whom conservative or medical expulsive therapy has failed, surgical intervention is required. The American Urology Association Guidelines favors ureteroscopy over alternatives, such as shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), for treatment of calculi in the following instances:

- Mid or distal ureteral calculi, regardless of size (may also be used for proximal ureteral calculi, though SWL has similar efficacy and is considered the first-line therapy)

- Suspected cystine or uric acid ureteral stones due to their radiolucency (uric acid) or resistance to SWL (cystine)

- Renal calculi <20 mm in size (>20 mm, PCNL is generally preferred, but flexible ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy is now a reasonable alternative except for stones in the lower pole.

- Removal of residual renal calculi fragments following SWL or PCNL including steinstrasse

- Failure or anticipated failure of SWL, more likely in patients with large body habitus with a skin-to-stone distance of >10 cm

- Patients who are not candidates for PCNL may be offered staged ureteroscopy with or without SWL (sometimes called "sandwich therapy")

- Anatomic or functional obstruction distal to the calculi

- Patients with uncorrected bleeding diathesis or who require continuous anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy where SWL would be contraindicated

Though ureteroscopy is more invasive and has slightly higher morbidity than SWL, it has a more favorable stone-free rate.

A recent study of over 3,000 stone patients suggested that early intervention (ureteroscopy or SWL) should be considered in all stones >7 mm in size and in calculi 5-7 mm in the mid or proximal ureter.

As the technology and design of equipment to perform ureteroscopy constantly evolves and improves, we can expect its indications to increase in the future.
