Depending on the type of debridement chosen, complications range from local irritation to major bleeding.

Surgical debridement and mechanical debridement will have a higher risk for bleeding, along with peri-procedural pain.

Surgical debridement done in the operating room must account for morbidity and mortality due to the anesthesia used. A study by J. Shiffman et al. has shown operative mortalityÂ to be 2% with long-term mortality and as high as 68% following debridement.
