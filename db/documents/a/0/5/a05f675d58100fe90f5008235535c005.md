The etiology is a spinal cord injury, almost always at or above the T6 level. Objectively, an episode is defined as an increase in systolic blood pressure of at least 25 mm Hg or more above baseline.

Although autonomic dysreflexia has been described in the first days or weeks after the original trauma, it generally does not develop until after the period of spinal shock when reflexes have recovered.
