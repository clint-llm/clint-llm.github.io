The significant adverse effects of amlodipine include peripheral edema, heart failure, pulmonary edema, flushing, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, skin rash, nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation. Researchers observed edema, dizziness, flushing, and palpitations in controlled clinical trials in a dose-dependent manner. For example, at a dose of 10 mg, the incidence of edema, dizziness, flushing, and palpitations was 10.8%, 3.4%, 2.6%, and 4.5%, respectively. In addition, the incidence of headaches, fatigue, nausea, and abdominal pain was 7.3%, 4.5%, 2.9%, and 1.6%, respectively.

Calcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, have been linked to rare instances of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver disease. A mixedÂ hepatocellular-cholestatic pattern is a typical feature of amlodipine-induced liver injury.

It is important to note that amlodipine can cause peripheral edema. A prescribing cascade occurs when the edema is mistaken as a new medical condition, and a diuretic is consequently prescribed to treat the edema.
