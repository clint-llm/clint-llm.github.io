**SETTINGS IN HFOV**

The set variables are:

- Respiratory rate/Frequency

- Amplitude/Power/Delta P

- Mean airway pressure (Paw)

- Bias flow

- Inspiratory time

- FiO2

**Frequency**

The rate at which the machine oscillates is set by setting the frequency. A 1 Hz frequency is equal to 60 oscillations per minute. As the I: E ratio is fixed, as the frequency increases, tidal volume/amplitude decreases. Higher frequencies are useful to decrease barotrauma as the pressure change transmitted to alveoli is less at high frequencies. This also increases the zone of safety for ventilation and leads to homogenous aeration of alveoli. The frequency set most often is between 3 to 6 Hz on initiation; it can be as high as 10 to 15 Hz.

**Amplitude/Delta P**

This is the primary determinant of tidal volume. It occurs due to the piston movement towards or away from the airway of a patient. The voltage across the piston, in turn, determines this. Thus increase in polarity increases amplitude and piston movement and, therefore, tidal volumes above the mean airway pressure. In HFOV, inspiration and expiration are both active processes. The amplitude settings are initiated and subsequently adjusted according to PaCO2 levels.

**Mean Airway Pressure (Paw)**

This can be adjusted directly or indirectly. Mean airway pressure is the main determinant of oxygenation, and an increase in Paw leads to the improvement of oxygenation. The settings are adjusted as per oxygenation requirements. Most often, the value initiated will be 5 cm of H2O above plateau pressure in conventional ventilation. Mean airway pressure is adjusted slowly based on saturation in increments of 2 cm H2O. However, the maximum value is 35 cm H2O, and the usual targets are less than 30cm of H2O.

**Bias Flow**

This is the rate of the gas flow in the ventilator and the circuit apparatus. In HFV, the bias flow is usually around 40 L/min to a maximum of 60 L/min. An increase in bias flow is an indirect method of increasing MAP and, thereby, oxygenation. In patients with air leak syndromes, the bias flow needed will be high.

**Inspiratory Time**

The inspiratory time set is always less than 50% of the total respiratory cycle, and most often, it is set at 33%. An increase in inspiratory time increases mean airway pressure and thus improves oxygenation. However, it can increase the risks of barotrauma; thus, it is mostly kept constant.

**Initial Setting for HFOV**

The initial settings are a primary guide and have to be adjusted according to subsequent arterial blood gas and clinical assessment.

The initial parameters are usually set as below:

- Bias flow is usually set from lower values, starting from 20 L/min to 35 L/min, and is adjusted subsequently as per the patient’s needs.

- Inspiratory time is most often constant and is set at 33%, giving an I: E ratio of 1 to 2.

- Respiratory rate/frequency are the main determinants of PaCO2 and are set between 3 to 15 Hz. It is most often initiated at 5 to 6 Hz giving a respiratory rate of about 300 per minute. Subsequent adjustments are made by serial ABG monitoring.

- The amplitude (ΔP) is the primary determinant of tidal volume and is initiated & titrated by looking for chest wiggles/vibrations. In infants, a chest wiggle up to the umbilicus is targetted, whereas, in children and adults, chest wiggles up to the pelvic region and the mid-thigh are targetted, respectively. It is usually set at a value of about 20 to 30 cm H2O higher than patients' PaCO2 on conventional ventilation.

- Oxygenation is mainly determined by FiO2 and mean airway pressure settings. The mPaw is set at 5 cm H2O above mPaw seen on a conventional ventilator when initiating HFOV. FiO2 is initially set at 1.0 and subsequently tapered as per oxygenation requirements of the patient titrated to a target SpO2 of 88 to 92%. Some patients may need a recruitment maneuver before initiating HFOV.

**Weaning from HFOV**

Weaning from HFOV is not based on fixed protocols, and various methods are followed. The process involves weaning to an extent where the patient will be able to tolerate conventional ventilation. The parameters that determine weaning readiness are FiO2 and mean airway pressures. Once oxygenation goals are met, two steps can be followed. The first step is to wean FiO2  to less than 60%, considering a saturation of more than 88%, and the next step is to decrease MAP in increments of 2 cm H2O to achieve a MAP of 30 cm H2O.

- Once the above is done, the next thing is to wean FiO2 to 0.4 and the MAP slowly in increments of 2 cms to reach a final goal of 20 to 25 cm H2O.

- After the above is achieved, the next approach is to transition the patient to conventional lung-protective ventilation and target saturation of more than 88% with mPaw of 20 to 25 cms for the next 24 hours.

- Weaning failure is considered when the patient is weaned to conventional low tidal volume ventilation and subsequently fails to maintain saturation above 88% in the initial 48 hours.
