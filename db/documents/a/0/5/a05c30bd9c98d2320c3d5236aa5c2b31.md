**Temperature-Decreasing Mechanisms**

- Inhibition of the sympathetic centers in the posterior hypothalamus (that control blood vessel tone) causes vasodilation of skin blood vessels.

- When the body core temperature rises above the critical level of 37 C (98.6 F), there is an increase in the rate of heat loss by sweating.

- Shivering and chemical thermogenesis are strongly inhibited.

**Temperature-Increasing Mechanisms**

- Stimulation of the posterior hypothalamic sympathetic centers causes vasoconstriction of skin blood vessels.

- Also, piloerection will take place, which means hairs “standing on end.” This mechanism is not important in humans.

- Increase in thermogenesis by promoting shivering, sympathetic excitation of heat production, and thyroxine secretion
