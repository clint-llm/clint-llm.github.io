A PAX2-related disorder is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with renal and eye abnormalities. The disorder was originally referred to as renal-coloboma syndrome. It is characterized by renal hypodysplasia and abnormalities of the optic nerve. Abnormal renal structure or function is noted in 92% of affected individuals and ophthalmologic abnormalities in 77%. Additional clinical signs are high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, soft skin, and ligamentous laxity.  Ophthalmologic abnormalities are typically described as optic nerve coloboma or dysplasia. Iris colobomas have not been reported in associated with PAX2–related disorder. Ophthalmologic abnormalities may cause significant vision loss or individuals may have normal vision.
