Vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI), also called e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI), is an acute or subacute respiratory illness characterized by a spectrum of clinicopathologic findings mimicking various pulmonary diseases. According to the CDC criteria, EVALI is a clinical diagnosis that requires the use of an e-cigarette in the 90 days preceding the appearance of initial symptoms; pulmonary infiltrates on a plain chest radiograph or chest CT, and the absence of any other possible etiology, such as infection.
