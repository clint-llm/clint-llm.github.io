As stated before, the musculocutaneous nerve innervates the three muscles of the arm’s anterior compartment. The coracobrachialis, the first muscle to receive innervation, originates from the coracoid process and inserts on the middle third of the medial aspect of the humerus. It flexes and adducts the shoulder at the glenohumeral joint. It is important to note that, unlike the other two anterior compartment muscles, the coracobrachialis does not cross the elbow joint and, thus, has no action on the elbow.

The biceps brachii muscle has a short and long head. The short head originates from the coracoid process of the scapula, while the long head originates from the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula. These two heads come together to form a single tendon that inserts in the radial tuberosity and the fascia of the forearm via the bicipital aponeurosis. The biceps brachii acts to flex the elbow, as well as supinate the forearm. The biceps brachii muscle receives its innervation from the C5 and C6 fibers of the musculocutaneous nerve.

The brachialis muscle originates on the distal portion of the anterior humerus and inserts in both the coronoid process and tuberosity of the ulna. Many will think of the biceps brachii when thinking of elbow flexion, but it is actually the brachialis that is considered the primary flexor of the elbow. The brachialis is a versatile flexor in that it is able to flex the elbow from either a pronated or supinated forearm position.
