Complications and outcomes of moderate to severe TBI exist on a spectrum from good recovery (social participation or resumption of normal life with only minor deficits) to moderate disability (able to work but in a sheltered or reduced capacity) to severe disability (dependent on others for ADLs or self-caring but unable to work) to persistent vegetative state to death.

For mild TBI, potential sequelae include post-concussive syndrome (which is thought to occur in 80% of patients), second impact syndrome (a rare disorder that results in rapid cerebral edema and high mortality), post-traumatic epilepsy, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the likelihood of which increases with the number and frequency of concussions.
