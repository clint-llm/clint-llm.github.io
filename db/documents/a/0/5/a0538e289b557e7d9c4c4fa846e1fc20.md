The histologic composition of fascia differs based on its location within the body. The superficial fascia consists primarily of collagen, elastin fibers, and adipose tissue. Superficial fascia requires the ability to resist tensile forces while also allowing elasticity. Hence, the superficial fascia is composed of many elastic fibers.

The deep fascia similarly consists of collagen and elastin, but the composition varies. The deep fascia has fewer elastin fibers, and the collagen fibers are aligned in parallel. This composition gives fascia remarkable tensile strength and the ability to stretch and contract with the musculoskeletal system. Other cell types are also present within the deep fascia, including myofibroblasts, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells.
