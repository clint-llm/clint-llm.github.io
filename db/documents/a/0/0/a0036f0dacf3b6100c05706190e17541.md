The retroperitoneal abdominal aorta enters the abdomen via the aortic hiatus caudal to the xiphoid process. It rests anterior to the vertebral body and parallel to the inferior vena cava.  Extending about 1 to 2 centimeters below the umbilicus, the aorta divides into the common iliac arteries at the level of L4. The aorta diminishes in size as it descends through the abdominal cavity, moving more superficially as well. As it moves caudally, the aorta has consecutive arterial branches: the celiac, superior mesenteric, renal, gonadal, and the inferior mesenteric.

An aneurysm is classified as a focal dilatation greater than 50% of a vessel’s normal diameter. A diameter greater than 3 centimeters demarcates an AAA. Two categories of AAAs exist: fusiform and saccular. The majority are fusiform. Fusiform aneurysms expand circumferentially. Whereas saccular aneurysms are localized outpouchings, often secondary to an infectious etiology.

Approximately 90% of AAAs occur infrarenal, although the renal vessels are often difficult to image with a point of care ultrasound. Scan to where the aorta bifurcates to confirm visualization of the aorta in its entirety.
