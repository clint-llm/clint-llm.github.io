**Stigmatization of Glasses Among Children**

There is still considerable stigmatization of children wearing glasses, especially in public, among children with big or high-powered lenses.

Older children are more likely to be embarrassed among peers when compared to younger age groups.

Economic shortages, beliefs that children will "outgrow" the need for glasses, and reduced staff are a few factors responsible for the disparity in screening rates.

**Cosmesis and Frame/Lens Materials**

The selection of spectacle frames for a child involves standard measurements similar to those for adults. With children, however, it is essential to assess the fit and stability of the spectacles on the child's face. It is important to address the child's preferences when choosing the right glasses, which can help accept and collaborate the regular spectacle use. Red-colored plastic frames were found to be a favorite among children.

Rectangular glasses and spectacles with straight earpieces are also popular choices.
