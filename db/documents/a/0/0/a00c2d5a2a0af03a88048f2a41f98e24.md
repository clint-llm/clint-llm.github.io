Heart failure (HF) is a frequent cause of inpatient admissions. The Framingham study in 1993 described the risk factors for heart failure. A recent study showed results of the five-year study showed an improved survival rate of 58% with the HeartMate 3 (vs. 44% with the HeartMate II). The American Heart Association reported the prevalence of HF to be 5.1 million in the United States in 2006. The worldwide prevalence has been estimated to be 23 million. HF can be categorized based on the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) into systolic and diastolic HF. The former group includes patients with LVEF less than or equal to 40%, also termed heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) includes those with LVEF greater than or equal to 40%. This activity reviews the role of LVADs, their indications, and contraindications and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with end-stage cardiac disease.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications of LVAD.
- Review the contraindications for LVAD.
- Summarize the complications of an LVAD.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients needing an LVAD.
