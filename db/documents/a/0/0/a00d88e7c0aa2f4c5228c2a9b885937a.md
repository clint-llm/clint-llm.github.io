Pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) can result from a multitude of causes and predisposing conditions, including but not limited to, structural heart disease, electrolyte disturbances, drugs/medications, and congenital/inherited channelopathies.

Below are several examples organized into the following categories:

Structural Heart Disease:

- coronary artery disease

- aortic stenosis

- cardiomyopathy

- congestive heart failure

- hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM)

- myocardial infarction (MI)

Electrolyte Disturbances:

- hypokalemia

- hyperkalemia

- hypomagnesemia

- hypocalcemia

Channelopathies:

- Lange-Nielsen Syndrome (prolonged QT with deafness)

- Romano-Ward Syndrome (prolonged QT without deafness)

- Brugada Syndrome

Electrophysiologic Phenomena:

- Wolf-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW)

- Catecholamine Sensitive Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia

Drugs/medications that cause QT prolongation:

- Clarithromycin

- Erythromycin

- Metoclopramide

- Haloperidol

- Methadone

- Droperidol

- Fluoroquinolone antibiotics (i.e., ciprofloxacin)

- Antiemetics (i.e., ondansetron)

- Antiarrhythmics

Other causes:

- Hypovolemia

- Hypoxia

- Acidosis

- Hypothermia

- Tension pneumothorax

- Cardiac tamponade

- Pulmonary embolism
