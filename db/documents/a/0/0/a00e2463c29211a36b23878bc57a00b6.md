Toxoplasmosis is caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular protozoan. Although many people are infected worldwide, the disease is uncommon, as most infections in humans are asymptomatic. It is, however, a common opportunistic infection among patients with HIV/AIDS and among patients who have undergone organ transplantation. This activity reviews the pathogenesis, evaluation, and management of toxoplasmosis infection and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of toxoplasmosis.
- Describe the pathophysiology and role of cell-mediated immunity involved in developing toxoplasmosis. 
- Review the therapeutic management of toxoplasmosis.
- Summarize the importance of interprofessional team coordination to enhance the care of toxoplasmosis and improve patient outcomes.
