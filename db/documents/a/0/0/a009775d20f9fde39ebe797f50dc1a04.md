Differential diagnoses include causes of acute, subacute, and chronic lymphadenopathy. The differential does include viral agents such as CMV, HIV, and EBV, but these agents usually cause diffuse lymphadenopathy. Skin papules similar to the lesion at the inoculation site may occur in fungal infections, leishmaniasis, and nocardiasis. In immunocompromised hosts, there may be a myriad of infectious agents to consider. The presentations of HIV as bacillary angiomatosis may be confused with Kaposi sarcoma.
