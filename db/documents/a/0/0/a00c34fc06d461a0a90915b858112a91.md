While pattern dystrophies are found on routine screenings for most patients, some patients may present with a decrease in vision and metamorphopsia.

The nature and description of the pattern will define the type of pattern dystrophy the patient has. Imaging modalities such as fluorescein angiography (FA), fundus autofluorescence (FAF), EOG, and ERG may provide additional information to stage and define the pattern dystrophy; however, diagnosing pattern dystrophy is a clinical diagnosis. While all pattern dystrophies are associated with pseudoxanthoma elasticum, fundus pulverulentus has the strongest association.

Additionally, maternally inherited diabetes and deafness have shown to have a significant correlation with pattern dystrophies, with some estimates placing it over 80%.
