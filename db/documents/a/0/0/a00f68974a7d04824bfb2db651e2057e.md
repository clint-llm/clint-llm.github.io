The exact epidemiology has not been well studied. Contact sports such as wrestling, mixed martial arts, ultimate fighting, rugby, and boxing may more readily predispose to such injuries. It could be deduced that males are at a higher risk than females; however, the exact ratio is not known. In a survey of college wrestlers, the incidence of auricular hematoma was found to be 52% for those refusing to wear headgear versus 26% who wore ear protection.[4] This places them at a higher risk of developing cauliflower ear.[5]
