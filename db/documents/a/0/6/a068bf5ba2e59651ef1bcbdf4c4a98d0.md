Due to its ubiquitous nature, myriad health care professionals encounter patients affected by M. furfur daily. Dermatologists, internists, mid-levels, nurses, and other specialists will commonly see patients with these dermatoses either as a chief complaint or incidental finding. The interprofessional team includes the pharmacist and nursing, in particular, dermatology specialty-trained nurses. It is thus essential for the clinician to have a solid working knowledge of commensal microorganisms such as M. furfur and their pathogenic role, methods of diagnosis, and treatment.

When the clinician or specialist addresses these conditions, they should enlist the assistance of the other members of the interprofessional healthcare team. Dermatology specialty nursing staff can answer patient questions, explain treatment options, assess therapeutic progress, and evaluate patient compliance. The pharmacist will verify agent selection and dosing, and check for any potential drug-drug interactions. Both the nurse and pharmacist must report any findings or concerns to the clinician/prescriber immediately, so intervention can occur if needed. These interprofessional team dynamics will result in better patient outcomes. [Level 5]

Since SD and PV are predominantly chronic, recurrent conditions, susceptible patients may require long-term collaboration with a clinician to achieve improvement in clinical manifestations and symptoms. After initial treatment, prophylactic and maintenance therapies, along with avoidance of precipitating factors (i.e., cold weather for SD and warm, humid conditions for PV), may lead to sustained remission.
