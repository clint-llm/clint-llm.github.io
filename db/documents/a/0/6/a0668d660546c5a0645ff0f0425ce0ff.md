Before any biopsy or anesthetic application, the biopsy site and the surrounding skin must be cleansed with an antiseptic. Local anesthesia is applied as a nerve block, which can either be a digital block or wing block. After anesthesia application, a 10-15 minute waiting period is sufficient for the full anesthetic effect. During the waiting period, the digit may be placed in a basin of water to soften the nail plate allowing for an easier biopsy. Once ready, a tourniquet is applied to the digit to decrease intraprocedural bleeding. The tourniquet should only be applied for a maximum of 15 minutes to reduce the risk of neurovascular compromise.

For certain biopsy techniques, the nail must be avulsed before biopsy of the lesion in question. A common technique to avulse the nail is with the use of a nail elevator. The nail elevator is first inserted under the proximal nail fold to gently loosen the nail plate from the overlying nail fold. The elevator is then inserted under the distal nail plate and pushed proximally to detach the nail plate from the nail bed and nail matrix.
