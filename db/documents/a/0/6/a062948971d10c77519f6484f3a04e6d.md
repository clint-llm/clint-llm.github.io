Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a nuclear imaging modality used frequently in diagnostic medicine. At its most basic level, SPECT produces a 3-dimensional image of the distribution of a radioactive tracer (sometimes called a probe) injected into the bloodstream and subsequently taken up by certain tissues.

Thus, SPECT allows the clinician to assess the perfusion and functionality of specific tissues. The ability to assess tissue functionality and physiology is what sets SPECT imaging apart from purely anatomic imaging modalities such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and roentgenography.
