Cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), also having been termed for the clinical sign of creeping eruption, is an infectious syndrome caused by multiple types of hookworms. This is most commonly transmitted by animal feces depositing eggs in the soil, with larvae entering humans through direct contact with skin. Cutaneous larva migrans is distinguished from the cutaneous manifestation of Strongyloides stercoralis infection termed larva currens. The latter demonstrating fast movement through the skin. Other non-larval cutaneous migrations, including loiasis, scabies, or larva with dermal penetration, are also excluded from CLM. This activity describes the clinical evaluation of cutaneous larva migrans and explains the role of the health professional team in coordinating the care of this condition.
