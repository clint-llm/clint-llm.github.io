B lymphocytes (plasma cells) produce immunoglobulins, which function as antibodies and can recognize a vast spectrum of antigenic epitopes. Adequate functioning of these immunoglobulins is essential for a healthy humoral immune response. Each immunoglobulin structure is unique, and an extensive collection of immunoglobulins allows the body to respond to a wide variety of antigens, termed passive protection. This passive protection should have a duration to protect the patient until they can produce their own antibodies to protect against VZV.

Human immunoglobulin products are produced from an amalgamation of plasma from several donors; this ensures that the final product contains a wide variety of antibody repertoires with a collection of variable domains of antibodies within the regular serum. The IgG molecules must have suitable functional activities such as complement-mediated bactericidal activity, virus-neutralizing activity, opsonization (i.e., marking a pathogen for destruction), and the ability to inactivate toxins to create an effective immune response against a range of microorganisms.

The herpes zoster immune globulin contains antibodies (IgG) from pooled human plasma of individuals with high titers of varicella-zoster and therefore provides passive immunity.
