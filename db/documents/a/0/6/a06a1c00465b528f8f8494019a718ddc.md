Monitoring parameters for albuterol include forced expiratory volume, peak flow, blood pressure, heart rate, central nervous system stimulation, serum potassium, serum glucose, and asthma symptoms. Since paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, it is important to advise patients to discontinue use and seek medical attention if symptomology worsens with use. If more doses are necessary over time, the clinician may need to make alterations to the patient's current treatment regimen, as the patient's condition may have deteriorated.
