Bethanechol exerts its effects via directly stimulating the muscarinic receptors(M1, M2, M3, M4, M5)  of the parasympathetic nervous system, further increasing the tone of the detrusor urinae muscle of the bladder, giving a contraction adequately effective to initiate micturition and void the bladder.

Bethanechol also acts on the M1 parasympathetic receptors of the gastric parietal cells found in the gastrointestinal tract inciting gastric motility, increasing gastric tone, and may reestablish diminished rhythmic peristalsis.
