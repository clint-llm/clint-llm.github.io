Patients with a low risk for stroke with CHADS2DS2-Vasc score less than 3 or a CHADS2 score of less than 2 are not recommended to have LAAC. Valvular heart disease, such as mitral stenosis, is another contraindication for the intervention. Patients with left atrial thrombus or tumor, active infection, the presence of atrial septal defect (ASD), or a prior patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure device are not recommended for trans-septal catheterization. Patients who have other indications for long-term or lifelong OACs, such as patients with a prosthetic valve, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and thrombi in the left atrium or ventricle, should not undergo left atrial appendage closure.
