OG is a low-grade (WHO Grade II) CNS neoplasm that shares many imaging characteristics with other astrocytomas, and tissue sampling is essential in diagnosis. OG is defined by its IDHmt and 1p/19q deletion status and several imaging features that suggest OG as opposed to astrocytoma to include course calcification and cortical-subcortical location.

OG is chemo- and radiosensitive with a good prognosis when compared to other glial neoplasms, and higher-grade anaplastic OG (WHO Grade III) has a worse prognosis.

Current studies are ongoing to evaluate the best combinations of RT and chemotherapy regimens, as well as evaluating other targeted therapies.
