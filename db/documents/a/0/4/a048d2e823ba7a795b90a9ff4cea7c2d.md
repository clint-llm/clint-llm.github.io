**Mechanism for Dilation**

- As a parasympathetic antagonist, tropicamide exerts its dilatory effects by acting on the pupillary sphincter muscle to cause its relaxation.

**Mechanism for Cycloplegia**

- Accommodation becomes hindered when tropicamide blocks the muscarinic receptors of the ciliary body. Its cycloplegic effect can last anywhere from 4 to 10 hours, with the onset of action occurring within 20 to 30 minutes.

**The mechanism for Reduction of Sialorrhea**

- Inhibition of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on salivary glands is responsible for decreasing hypersalivation in patients with Parkinson's disease.
