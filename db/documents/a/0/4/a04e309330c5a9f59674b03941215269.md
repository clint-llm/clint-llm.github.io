The healthcare team, i.e., clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists, must work together to make sure that pregnant patients correctly take their medications, and importantly, to discuss any serious drug side effects which they encounter, e.g., muscle pain, jaundice, bleeding, etc. A complete medication list for the patient is necessary before prescribing a medication to prevent clinically significant drug interactions, and a pharmacist can perform medication reconciliation to answer any questions or address concerns other healthcare team members may have. In addition, the healthcare team needs to discuss with the pregnant patient potential risks that medication therapy could have on the developing unborn child especially in the case of patients receiving antiseizure medication treatment.
