Dantrolene sodium (sold under a variety of trade names) is a postsynaptic muscle relaxant with multiple indications in the fields of anesthesiology and neurology.   Among the many indications for the use of dantrolene, its primary indication, and FDA-approved usage in both children and adults, is for the treatment of malignant hyperthermia: the very rare but life-threatening disorder triggered by general anesthesia. Malignant hyperthermia is a reaction to the volatile halogenated anesthetics or depolarizing muscle relaxants, causing sustained muscle contraction, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, and hypercarbia, potentially leading to intraoperative patient demise. These symptoms develop as a response to the anesthetic agents acting on defective ryanodine receptors (calcium channels in muscle cell sarcoplasmic reticulum). Given the mechanism of action, dantrolene acts as an antagonist to these receptors, therefore halting and preventing the further progression of the symptoms of malignant hyperthermia. Even though the incidence of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia is estimated to be 1 in 50,000 to 100,000, it is required, according to the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States, that any facility that administers malignant hyperthermia triggering agents (isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, and succinylcholine) should stock dantrolene in their facilities at all times.
