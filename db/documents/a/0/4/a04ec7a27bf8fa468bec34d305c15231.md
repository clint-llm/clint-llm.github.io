**Syphilis******

The chancre and oral lesions in primary syphilis are self-limiting and heal without scar in three to six weeks. A single dose of long-acting benzathine penicillin G (2.4 million units) intramuscular is the drug of choice if primary lesions persist and for secondary syphilis. Tertiary syphilis is also treated with intramuscular benzathine penicillin G once weekly for three to four weeks. The duration of treatment depends on the stage of the disease and its manifestations. Patients who are allergic to penicillin are alternatively treated with doxycycline, tetracycline, or ceftriaxone. Patients diagnosed with syphilis, even if receiving treatment, should abstain from any sexual activity to prevent the spread of the disease. In addition, the sexual partners of a syphilis patient should be notified, tested, and treated accordingly. Post-treatment follow-up is required once every three months for a year using nontreponemal serological tests to ensure the effectiveness of treatment.

**Gonorrhea **

Oropharyngeal gonorrhea can be treated with a single oral dose of 400 mg of cefixime. Increased doses of ceftriaxone and cefixime may be considered due to the growing resistance of N. gonorrhoeae to cephalosporins. The Public Health Agency of Canada recommends an oral cefixime dose of 800 mg or intramuscular ceftriaxone, the latter especially recommended for pharyngeal infections. Aztreonam administered intravenously may also be used to treat pharyngeal and rectal gonococcal infections.

**Tuberculosis**

A combination of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol is used to treat tuberculosis. These drugs are given daily for the initial two months and then another four months of just isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol. A chest physician must provide and supervise this therapy to ensure adherence and reduce the chances of drug resistance.

Patients should also be isolated during their treatment course to prevent the further spread of disease. Some second-line agents include injectable drugs (aminoglycosides, amikacin) and fluoroquinolones.

**Scarlet Fever**

The first-line treatment for GAS infections is beta-lactam antibiotics due to their clinical efficacy and low cost. Penicillins usually outperform cephalosporins and macrolides. If the patient is allergic to penicillin, the first-generation cephalosporin is effective in reducing morbidity and mortality. Penicillin (V) is typically prescribed four times a day for ten days, and other systemic symptoms may be treated with acetaminophen or ibuprofen and fluid replenishment.
