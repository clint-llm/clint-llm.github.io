Certain fetal conditions such as fetal bleeding disorders (e.g., hemophilia, neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, Von Willebrand's disease), fetal demineralizing diseases (e.g., osteogenesis imperfecta) preclude the use of a vacuum to expedite delivery. Its use is discouraged at less than 34 weeks estimated gestational age. Prior to its use, the obstetrician should ensure that all of the above prerequisites have been met and the patient agrees to the care plan.
