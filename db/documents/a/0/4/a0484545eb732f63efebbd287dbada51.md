The mechanism of chemical waves plays a vital role in the development process, that is, of mechanical-chemical information that transports information from one cell to another quickly. These waves or signals are patterns that help tissue morphogenesis. Probably, the management and initiation of these waves occur via chemical reactions at the centrosome level (MTOC - microtubule organizing center).
