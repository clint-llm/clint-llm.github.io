Vitreous floaters are microscopic collagen fibers within the vitreous that tend to clump and cast shadows on the retina, appearing as floaters to the patient. The most common cause of vitreous floaters in ophthalmology is posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), a separation of the posterior hyaloid face from the retina. Often this condition is not visually threatening. Patients that present with signs and symptoms of vitreous floaters need to be evaluated by an ophthalmologist.
