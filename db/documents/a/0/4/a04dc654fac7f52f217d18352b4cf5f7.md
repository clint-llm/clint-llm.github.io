Anetoderma is a rare disease that is best treated by an interprofessional team. The team should include primary clinicians, dermatologists, and pathologists. The primary care clinician needs to be aware of this benign condition and recognize the specific subtype of anetoderma of the patient they have under their care. Knowing the subtype will help monitor the patient for any associated disorders and help offer suitable treatments for the patient. Nurses can play a role in patient education. Strong communication within the team will help improve patient outcomes.
