A review of systems in patients with bulimia nervosa demonstrates sore throat, irregular menstruation, constipation, headache, fatigue, lethargy, abdominal pain, and bloating.

When conducting a physical exam on a patient with diagnosed or suspected bulimia nervosa, obtain the height, weight, vital signs, and orthostatic blood pressures. It is also necessary to examine a patient’s skin, mouth, and abdomen. A neurological examination is essential to check for primary neurological causes of weight loss or vomiting before diagnosing bulimia nervosa.

Common physical exam signs associated with bulimia nervosa include hypotension, dry skin, parotid gland swelling, dental erosion, and calluses on the dorsal aspect of the hand (known as “Russel’s sign.”) Bulimia nervosa can also be associated with hair loss, edema, and epistaxis.
