Amebiasis or amoebic dysentery is a common parasitic enteral infection. It is caused by any of the amoebas of the Entamoeba group. Amoebiasis may present with no symptoms or mild to severe symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bloody diarrhea. Severe complications may include inflammation and perforation, resulting in peritonitis. People affected may develop anemia.

If the parasite reaches the bloodstream, it can spread through the body and end up in the liver, causing amoebic liver abscesses. Liver abscesses can occur without previous diarrhea. Diagnosis is typically by stool examination using a microscope. An increased WBC count may be present. The most accurate test is specific antibodies in the blood.

Prevention of amoebiasis is by improved sanitation. Two treatment options are possible, depending on the location. Amoebiasis in tissue is treated with metronidazole, tinidazole, nitazoxanide, dehydroemetine, or chloroquine. A luminal infection is treated with diloxanide furoate or iodoquinoline. Effective treatment may require a combination of medications. Infections without symptoms require treatment, but infected individuals can spread the parasite to others.

Amoebiasis is present all over the world. Each year, about 40000 to 110000 people die from amoebiasis infection.

E. histolytica is classified as a category B biodefense organism because of its environmental stability, ease of dissemination, resistance to chlorine, and its ability to easily spread through contaminated food products. Besides the GI tract, E. histolytica can affect many organ systems.
