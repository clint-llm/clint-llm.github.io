Prevention of pudendal neuralgia begins when the diagnosis is made. Sports medicine physicians, therapists, personal trainers, coaches, and athletes must be aware of this condition to aid in early diagnosis. For instance, cyclists often continue to cycle despite developing penile or perineal numbness. Adopting a split saddle seat can be very helpful. In the gym and during sports, training is where symptoms of neuropathy will be expressed and should be recognized.

Pediatricians should be aware of and consider pudendal neuralgia as a possible diagnosis in patients with bladder and bowel dysfunction along with abdominal and pelvic pain, as this condition is often the result of congenital anatomic problems. In children, a pinprick test using a toothpick rather than a safety pin can be a less frightening method of conducting sensation testing.

Patient education should emphasize the role of resting the nerve, using a seating pad modified to minimize central pressure, and controlling stress. Patients may need to be reminded of the benefits of non-opioid medications and non-invasive therapies in reducing painful neuropathic signals.
