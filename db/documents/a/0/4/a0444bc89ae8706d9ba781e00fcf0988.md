Placental insufficiency is associated with various obstetric disorders such as pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction, both of which predispose to preterm labor, a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality around the world. Poor placental function is most commonly described by the term ‘placental insufficiency’ within the medical community; however, one study highlighted the problem that there is no standardized definition or consensus for the pathognomonic features pertaining to placental insufficiency.

This poses many challenges when it comes to studying placental insufficiency in the literature, but the general understanding is that placental insufficiency is a process whereby there is a progressive deterioration in placental functioning such that oxygen and nutrient transfer to the fetus via the placenta is decreased, culminating in a decompensated hypoxia and acidosis.

Of note, placental infarcts can be a normal finding, as they are observed in approximately 25% of normal term pregnancies; however, increasing infarction of the placenta has been shown to be associated with placental insufficiency and thus intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Both MRI and ultrasound studies looking for placental insufficiency have demonstrated reductions in placental area and volume as well as increased placental thickness, in addition to globular shaped placentas on MRI.
