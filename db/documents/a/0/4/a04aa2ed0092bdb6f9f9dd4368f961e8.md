When it occurs after lung transplantation or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), it is called bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Bronchiolitis obliterans is a type of obstructive lung disease of the small airways. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and cause of bronchiolitis obliterans and highlights the interprofessional team's role in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for bronchiolitis obliterans.
- Describe the pathophysiology of bronchiolitis obliterans.
- Summarize the treatment options for bronchiolitis obliterans.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve patients' outcomes affected by bronchiolitis obliterans.
