An initial diagnostic workup includes a complete neurologic examination of the scalp, pericranial muscles, nerves and arteries. Laboratory tests may include a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, thyroid function tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, alkaline phosphatase, antinuclear antibody, and rheumatoid factor. If there is clinical suspicion, CT and MRI scans can be considerations to check for underlying central nervous system pathology.

A high prevalence of autoimmune disorders has been reported in patients with nummular headache(69%).Â Most commonly antinuclear antibodies(ANA) were detected in the blood of these patients. In this study, sjogren's syndrome was most commonly identified but most patients had no signs and symtoms of Autoimmune disease at the time of presentation.
