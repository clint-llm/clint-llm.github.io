Patients with uric acid stones should be educated about incorporating a healthy lifestyle. Modifications in the diet, weight, and physical activity are necessary as uric acid stone formation has been connected to insulin resistance and obesity. Diet should be revised to minimize animal protein intake while also avoiding food with high fructose and salt content. Patients should drink sufficient fluids to limit urinary supersaturation. Patients should also be educated to recognize the signs of complications, including fever and anuria, and they should immediately consult their physician.  High-risk cases and all kidney stone patients strongly motivated to optimize preventive measures, should be offered 24-hour urine testing to identify their treatable risk factors for recurrent stone disease.
