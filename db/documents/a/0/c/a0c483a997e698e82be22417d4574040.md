The physician instructs the patient to lie prone on the table. The clinician places the heel of his/her cephalad hand on S1 and allows his/her fingers to drape over the sacrum. The physician’s caudal hand is placed over his/her other hand with the heel over S4-S5 and fingers facing the patient’s head. The physician instructs the patient to inhale deeply, and the physician follows the natural motion of the sacral base posteriorly. At the end of inhalation, the physician applies a slight pressure with the caudal hand to exaggerate sacral extension. The physician then instructs the patient to exhale and follows the sacrum into flexion. At the end of exhalation, the physician applies and holds a slight pressure with his cephalad hand to exaggerate sacral flexion. This process is repeated for 2 or 3 minutes or until the release of tissues is felt. The physician should then reassess the motion of the sacrum.
