Mondor disease is a rare clinical entity affecting more women than men. Patients may develop lesions in sensitive areas such as the breast or penis. Some patients may be embarrassed or afraid to discuss their symptoms with a physician. Having a well-informed health care team with providers such as nurses, technicians, and physicians aware of rare clinical diseases is vital to identifying patients at risk for more sinister diagnoses. Some patients may be more comfortable sharing their symptoms with a different member of the interprofessional team, who in turn must relate the privileged information to the appropriate provider.
