Eccrine carcinoma (EC) is a rare carcinoma that originates from the eccrine sweat glands of the skin and accounts for less than 0.01% of diagnosed cutaneous malignancies. Sweat gland tumors have been traditionally subdivided into four large groups: Eccrine, apocrine, mixed origin (eccrine and apocrine), and other un-classifiable sweat gland tumors. Eccrine tumors are divided into benign and malignant. This activity reviews the evaluation, differential, and treatment of sweat gland tumors and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for sweat gland tumors.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with a sweat gland tumor.
- Summarize the treatment options for sweat gland tumors.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with sweat gland tumors.
