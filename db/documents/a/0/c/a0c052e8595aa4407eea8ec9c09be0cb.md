Internuclear ophthalmoplegia is a condition caused by a lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), a fiber tract responsible for transmitting information that is vital for the coordination of different eye movements. It is a paired white matter tract passing close to the midline, through the brainstem lying ventral to the cerebral aqueduct in the midbrain and the fourth ventricle in the pons and medulla. It is the final common pathway for different types of conjugate eye movements like saccades, smooth pursuit, vestibulocochlear reflex, and forms a communication between all the ocular motor nuclei.
