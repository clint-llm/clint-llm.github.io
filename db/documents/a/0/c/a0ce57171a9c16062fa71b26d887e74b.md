Enhancing patient care and outcomes begins with providers' awareness of hepatic cystadenomas and the risks associated. The application of clinicopathologic history and multiphasic imaging is paramount to distinguish this entity from other benign hepatic cysts due to their differing clinical management. Upon making the diagnosis, clinicians need to follow the patient with serial imaging to ensure that malignant transformation does not occur. Even after surgical excision, there is a risk of recurrence of BCA; hence, patients require monitoring. Interprofessional communication between the radiologists, referring providers, and surgeons are necessary to minimize diagnostic workup, patient anxiety, and optimize outcomes; this is where oncology-trained nursing staff can be of great assistance to the oncologists and other physicians involved in the case. They can provide post-surgical education wound care, and help the patient monitor for malignant transformation if they opt not to pursue surgery, or recurrence if they do, and report to the physician staff should any of these become a concern. This sort of interprofessional collaboration is crucial to the successful management of BCAs. [Level V]

Because of only anecdotal reports, the outcome of these lesions remains a mystery.
