Computed tomography (or CT) refers to a computerized x-ray imaging procedure in which narrow beams of rotating x-ray radiation are directed at a patient and then transcribed by a computer into cross-sectional "slices" of the specific area imaged. The increasing use of diagnostic computed tomography (CT) images has presented a unique challenge in understanding this procedure's risks to the general patient population. There are few direct risks associated with CT scanning. These range from contrast-induced allergic reactions, contrast-induced nephropathy, and long term risk of cancer development due to radiation exposure. Additional considerations include the patient's pregnancy status and radiation effect on the developing fetus. In addition to these considerations, there is radiation attributable risk to pediatric patients in comparison to adults.
