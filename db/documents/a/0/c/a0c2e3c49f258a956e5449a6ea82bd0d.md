A 2013 study conducted by Krebs and Johansen sought to estimate the lifetime prevalence of psychedelic use. They defined psychedelics as either LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, and peyote and described prevalence by age category from a retrospective U.S. population survey. The study cited was the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). This survey takes place annually to estimate general substance use and potential correlations with mental health indicators from a randomly selected group of individuals aged 12 and up. In the 2010 survey, 23 million U.S. residents reported using LSD at least once (23 million, 95% CI: 22 to 25 million). Use among residents in the 50 to 64 year age group was similar to the usage rate amongst those in the 21 to 49 year age group. Interestingly, the rate of lifetime psychedelic use was largest amongst those aged 30 to 34 years; recreational LSD use first became widespread during the 1960s and ‘70s.

Rickert et al. looked at prevalence and risk factors for LSD use among young women in a study first published in 2003; 904 sexually active adolescent and young adult women aged 14 to 26 years took the survey at university-based outpatient reproductive health clinics between April and November of 1997. Out of 904 participants, 119 (13%) reported using LSD at least once, and 536 (58%) reported using marijuana at least once. Further analyses showed that the typical female LSD or marijuana user presented with a distinct profile: women who reported alcohol intoxication at least ten times in the past year, smoked at least half a pack of cigarettes within the same timeframe, and those who identified themselves as being relatively “high-sexual-risk takers” were more likely to have used LSD or marijuana before. LSD users, in contrast to nonusers, however, were more likely to be of white ethnicity, present under the age of 17, and were more likely to report a history of physical abuse and severe depressive symptoms.
