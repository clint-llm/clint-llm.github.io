Patient education about struvite and renal calculi is needed to prevent associated complications. Any person who forms or passes a renal stone should undergo imaging and laboratory analysis of the stone. Besides, patients who have recurrent UTIs should also be made aware that they might be harboring struvite and triple phosphate renal calculi in their kidneys or collecting system. In such cases, treatment of the infection with antibiotics alone is not enough; complete surgical removal of the stone is needed to prevent long-term renal damage and decrease the risk of recurrent UTIs.
