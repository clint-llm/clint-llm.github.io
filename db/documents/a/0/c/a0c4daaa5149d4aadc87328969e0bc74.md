Any neoplasms of the organs which are affected by mesotheliomas should merits consideration in the differential diagnosis; this includes, but is not limited to, malignant mesothelioma, pleural lipomas, sarcomas, malignant fibrous tumor of the pleura, and localized fibrous tumor of the pleura. Lymphomas involving the pleura are quite rare but do occur. This list is far from exhaustive, and it is important to remember that malignant mesotheliomas are more common than benign mesotheliomas. Of course, if mesothelioma is suspected, separating and distinguishing benign from malignant is arguably the most important consideration. Radiology exams may not be able to distinguish between benign and malignant forms of mesotheliomas or pleural neoplasms. Another significant consideration in the world population, though not as pertinent in the United States, should include hydatid cysts in the differential, especially if a biopsy is considered, such as through fine needle aspiration, as rupturing a hydatid cyst can lead to anaphylaxis.
