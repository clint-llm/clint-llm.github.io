The cornea contains abundant tight junctions to prevent transcellular permeability, allowing the transparent and avascular structure to maintain its cellular architecture and prevent angiogenesis, inflammation, and cellular infiltration.

Numerous cells are involved in maintaining tear film homeostasis and responding to perturbances. For example, as stated previously, mucins are produced by the acinar cells of the lacrimal gland, epithelial cells in the cornea and conjunctiva, and goblet cells in the conjunctiva.

The majority of proteins found in the tear film are synthesized and secreted locally by the lacrimal gland; however, some protein components may leak into the tear fluid from systemic circulation.
