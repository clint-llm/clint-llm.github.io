The CT scan involves ionizing radiation, which has the potential to cause biological tissue harm.

It has been estimated that for every 1.0 mSv of exposure, there is a 5% risk of developing fatal cancer. Thus, a radiation dose of 100 mSv will have a 0.5% risk of cancer.

This radiation exposure is especially critical in pediatric patients due to the developing organs' vulnerability when performed under ten years and the cumulative lifelong exposure.

Contrast agents may cause allergic reactions, usually mild, involving itching rash; however, severe reactions can occur such as bronchospasm and anaphylactic reaction.
