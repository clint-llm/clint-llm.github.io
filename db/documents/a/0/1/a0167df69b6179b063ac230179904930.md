The evaluation of the intragastric balloon and a multidisciplinary team approach was analyzed by a retrospective review of 119 balloons placed in 116 patients endoscopically from May 2001 to August 2006. In this review, 49 patients were followed by a multidisciplinary team every 15 days during six months compared to 67 patients followed by individual providers. The patients who were followed by the multidisciplinary team had the most significant decrease in excess body weight and BMI. Conclusions from this analysis demonstrate that intragastric balloon therapy effectively achieves short-term weight loss in obese patients and that a multidisciplinary team approach combined with lifestyle augmentation markedly enhances weight loss. Before, during, and after intragastric balloon placement, a multidisciplinary team is recommended.
