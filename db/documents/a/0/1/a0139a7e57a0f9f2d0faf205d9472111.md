The most common indication for panniculectomy is after the patient experienced a dramaticÂ weight loss, with the resultant excess lower abdominal skin overhanging the groin and pubic regions. This is often seen in patients following bariatric surgery. The risk of formation of a large panniculus post-bariatric surgery is higher in older patients and patients with a higher pre-operative Body Mass Index.

In severe cases, the panniculus can strike against the thighs as the patient walks, causing significant discomfort and irritation. This can severely limit patients' mobility and predispose them to refractory weight gain. Bariatric surgery patients typically achieve stable weight loss in 12 to 18 months, but some patients present in as few as six months for panniculectomy due to interference from the overhanging skin.
