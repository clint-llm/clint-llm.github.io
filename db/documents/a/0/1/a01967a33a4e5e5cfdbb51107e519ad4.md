Human T-lymphotropic virus-1 is estimated to infect 10-20 million persons worldwide.

There are three major routes of HTLV-1 transmission: vertical transmission from mother to child via breastmilk (the most common route), sexual intercourse, and blood transfusions.

Sexual transmission of HTLV-1 is more efficient from men to women than from women to men at a rate of approximately 5:1. HAM/TSP is associated with sexual transmission and blood transfusion.

Transfusion of infected blood is associated with a high risk of rapid seroconversion.

The risk of occupational exposure in healthcare workers via needle stick injuries has never been quantified but is not thought to be significant, and no post-exposure prophylaxis has been validated.
