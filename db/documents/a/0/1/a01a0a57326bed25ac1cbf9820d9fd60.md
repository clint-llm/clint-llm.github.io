Establishing the diagnosis of MPS clinically through history and physical examination is challenging because features of several clinical conditions and syndromes overlap with the characteristics of MPS. However, the evaluation of patients with suspected MPS should commence with detailed family history, including the presence of consanguinity, which increases the risk of autosomal recessive MPS.

Prenatal ultrasonography is utilized for LMPS and remains the standard method for detecting fetal anatomic abnormalities because it allows excellent visualization of fluid-filled structures in the developing fetus. Skeletal anomalies are detectable onÂ radiographic imaging. In addition, features highly suggestive of MPS should undergo molecular genetic testing to detect gene mutations in MPS, which incorporates whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing for confirmation.
