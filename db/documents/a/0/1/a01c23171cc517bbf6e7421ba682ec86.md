The thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) or lumbodorsal fascia (LF) is an aponeurotic structure prominent in the distal of the thoracic vertebrae, as an undeniable function in an upright posture and load transfer from the upper extremity to the lower extremity.

TLF attaches to the spines of the thoracic vertebrae in the midline and closes to the angulus costa of the ribs laterally in the thoracic region, forming a thin cover for the extensor muscles of the vertebral column.

It has three layers in the lumbar region (previously described as just anterior and posterior layers) that surround the erector spine and transversospinalis muscles, which are located between the spinous and transverse processes of the successive vertebra, and the quadratus lumborum muscle, one of the posterior abdominal wall muscles.

An article published in 2019 stated that only the inner layer of TLF contains elastic fibers. Still, these fibers in the structure of TLF are insufficient to qualify the entire fascia as "flexible."

The triangle of auscultation is located on the upper half of the back region. It is bordered by the trapezius, latissimus dorsi, and the medial margin of the scapula. The floor of the triangle of auscultation contains endothoracic fascia and pleura.
