**Summary of the Anatomy of the Pectoralis Major**

- Origin: Clavicular head, anterior sternum, costal cartilages 1 to 7, the sternal end rib 6, aponeurosis of the external oblique

- Insertion: Lateral lip intertubercular sulcus of the humerus

- Nervous innervation: Medial and lateral pectoral nerves (clavicular head C5, sternocostal head C6/7/8, T1)

- Function: Flexion, adduction, and medial rotation of the arm at the glenohumeral joint; clavicular head causes flexion of the extended arm; sternoclavicular head causes extension of the flexed arm

- Arterial supply: Pectoral artery (thoracoacromial trunk,Â the second branch of the axillary artery)

- Venous drainage: Pectoral vein (drains into the subclavian vein)
