A sequential approach integrating risk stratification and biomarkers could be a valuable strategy when managing upper extremity thrombosis. Based on the model employed for lower extremity DVT, the Diagnostic Algorithm in suspected upper extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (ARMOUR) study explored an algorithm that commenced with risk stratification using the Constans rule, followed by D-dimer testing and compression ultrasonography to more accurately rule in or rule out patients with upper extremity DVT. The evaluation of the Constans rule in a cohort of 406 patients with varying risks of upper extremity thrombosis demonstrated good performance in identifying individuals at low risk of events. This approach enabled around 20% of the cohort to avoid ultrasound imaging. However, in a different study including a high-risk patient population such as elderly patients over 75, hospitalized patients, those with malignancy, or those with upper extremity catheters/devices, the algorithm did not perform as well in differentiating a subset of patients where imaging could be withheld. Therefore, this strategy may be more advantageous for patients with low risk for venous thromboembolism.
