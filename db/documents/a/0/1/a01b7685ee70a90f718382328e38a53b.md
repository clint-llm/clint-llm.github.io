Psoas major - The principal flexor of the thigh at the hip. It has a role in maintaining the body in an erect posture during standing. It arises laterally from the T12-L5 vertebrae. It inserts with the iliacus onto the lesser trochanter of the femur.

Iliacus - Another principal flexor of the thigh at the hip. It arises from the iliac fossa and crest and the ala of the sacrum. It Inserts with the psoas major onto the lesser trochanter of the femur.

Sartorius - Flexes, abducts, and laterally rotates the thigh at the hip. It can also flex and medially rotate the leg at the knee. It can also flex the leg at the knee joint. The sartorius arises from the anterior superior iliac spine. It inserts onto the medial surface of the tibia. At its insertion, the tendon of the sartorius joins with that of the gracilis and semitendinosus to form the pes anserinus (Latin - goose's foot). A goose's foot has three toes joined by a web. The sartorius is named from the Latin word for tailor - sartor. Tailors sit on the floor with the thigh abducted and medially rotated at the hip and the leg flexed at the knee.

Pectineus - Flexes and adducts the thigh at the hip. It arises from the superior ramus of the pubic bone. It inserts into the pectineal line of the femur. Pecten is a Latin word for a comb, so named because the parallel fibers of the muscle at its insertion resemble the teeth of a comb.
