Rubella, also known as German Measles, is a viral illness characterized by maculopapular rash, lymphadenopathy, and fever. It is a highly contagious but generally mild disease, without consequences in most cases. However, maternal infection during the first trimester of pregnancy can cause a fetal malformation syndrome called congenital rubella syndrome.
