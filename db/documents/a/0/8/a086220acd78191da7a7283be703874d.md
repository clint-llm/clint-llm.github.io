Meningiomas exhibit a wide range of histological appearances. Of all the subtypes of the WHO classification, the most common are meningothelial, fibroblastic, and transitional meningiomas. Most of the subtypes have a benign behavior, but those categorized as WHO grade II and III are more likely to recur and follow a more aggressive clinical course.

The majority of meningiomas immunostain for epithelial membrane antigen; however, it is less consistent in atypical and malignant lesions. Vimentin positivity is found in all meningiomas but is relatively nonspecific. Somatostatin receptor 2a is expressed strongly and diffusely in almost all cases, including anaplastic meningiomas, but can also be encountered in neuroendocrine neoplasms. Fibrous meningiomas commonly stain positive for S100. Other useful immunohistochemical markers include Ki-67 and progesterone receptors.
