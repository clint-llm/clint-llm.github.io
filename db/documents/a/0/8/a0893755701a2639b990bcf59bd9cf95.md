In adults, the most common cause of unilateral and bilateral exophthalmos is thyroid-associated eye disease, such as Graves-related ophthalmopathy.

In children, orbital cellulitis is the most common cause, whereas bilateral exophthalmos is most likely due to neuroblastoma and leukemia.

Typically, exophthalmos originates from four likely etiologies:

- Extension of inflammation into the orbit, e.g., thyroid-related eye disease, orbital cellulitis, sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and IgG4-related disease

- Invasion of the orbit by new growth, e.g., space-occupying benign or malignant orbital tumors such as capillary haemangioma, neuroblastoma, neurofibromatosis, leukemia, lymphoma, mucocele, pseudotumors, and secondary metastatic deposits

- Interference with the venous return from the orbit, e.g., orbital varices, carotid-cavernous fistula, cavernous sinus thrombosis

- Foreign matter being forced into the orbit, e.g., due to trauma
