In the pediatric population, endoscopy is typically performed by a pediatric endoscopist with the medical knowledge and technical competency specific to perform safe and effective GI procedures in this population. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) published practice modification guidelines to provide guidance regarding performing endoscopy in infants and children.

If it is not possible for a pediatric-trained endoscopist to perform the procedure, an adult-trained endoscopist should perform endoscopic procedures in children in coordination with a pediatrician and pediatric specialists. During endoscopic procedures, procedural and resuscitative equipment appropriate for pediatric use should be readily available. If sedation is needed for the procedure, personnel trained specifically in pediatric life support and airway management should also be readily available. In symptomatic children with known or suspected caustic ingestion, endoscopy should be performed within 24 hours. It is recommended to perform emergent foreign body removal of esophageal button batteries as well as two or more rare-earth neodymium magnets.
