Evaluating the AC and SC joints is critical before beginning treatment. Visual assessment (bruising, erythema, edema), pain scale, the strength of surrounding musculature, and range of motion of the AC and SC joints should all be accounted for both before and after treatment.

The following will explore two somatic dysfunctions of the AC joint in this review that are treatable with muscle energy:

- Internally rotated AC joint, or

- Externally rotated AC joint

Palpation of the AC joint can be done by "walking" on hand down the spine of the scapula to the acromion, while the other hand travels down the clavicle laterally. Where these two points meet will be the AC joint. Let the patient's arm hang by there side in sight abduction of the shoulder with minimal flexion of the elbow. With the patient in this position, palpate the AC joint with one hand, and manipulate their shoulder into internal rotation, followed by external rotation. We compare this movement of the AC joint bilaterally. The somatic dysfunction is named the opposite of the restriction. For example, if the range of motion of the left and right AC joint is normal in internal rotation B/L, but the AC joint on the right has a restriction in the external rotation when compared to the left. The right AC joint is said to be internally rotated. One could also look at naming the somatic dysfunction as where the joint is "living." For example, if a patient has a left externally rotated AC joint, this means the AC joint allows for external rotation (AKA "living" in external rotation) and shows restriction in left internal rotation (when compared to the right AC joint).

For the SC joint, this text will also explore two possible somatic dysfunctions:

- Adducted clavicle

- Horizontally extended clavicle

Before getting into the evaluation of somatic dysfunction, it is imperative to understand the relationship between the shoulder and clavicle. The position of the clavicle is named for the movement at the lateral aspect of the clavicle! Abduction of the shoulders causes the medial edge of the clavicle (closest to SC joint) to drop inferior, and the lateral edge to rise superior (as if it is abducting with the shoulder).

You can also think of the clavicle and its movement as a see-saw. Flexion of the shoulder brings the arm anterior, and we would say the lateral edge of the clavicle travels anterior (horizontal flexion) with it, and the medial edge travels posterior. As we extend the shoulder, the arm moves posterior, and the lateral edge of the clavicle also travels posterior (horizontal extension), while the medial portion of the clavicle travels anteriorly.

The SC joint can be palpated by following the clavicle medially with one hand and traveling laterally off the manubrium with the other. Evaluation of this joint is best with the patient in the supine position.

To evaluate for an adducted clavicle:

- The provider should be at the head of the table, with the index finger on the superior portion of the SC joint.

- The patient (lying supine) will be instructed to shrug both shoulders to their ears simultaneously (this imitates the abduction of the shoulder)

- The provider will compare the SC joints at the peak of this shoulder shrug: whichever SC joint drops least inferior (or stays more cephalad in terms of the supine patient), is the adducted clavicle.

- To evaluate for a horizontally extended clavicle:

- The provider should be at the head of the table, with index fingers on the anterior portion of the SC joint.

- The patient (supine) is instructed to slowly move their shoulders into flexion.

- The provider compares the posterior movement at the SC joint, whichever SC joint does NOT drop posteriorly is said to be a horizontally extended clavicle.
