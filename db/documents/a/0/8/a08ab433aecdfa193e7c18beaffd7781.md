The genus Yersinia comprises a group of gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria that are broadly distributed in the environment. This genus encompasses 17 different species of which 3 organisms are virulent to humans. These include Yersinia pestis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Both Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis are known to cause an enteric illness; however, Y. pseudotuberculosis is rare in humans compared to Y. enterocolitica, which is more commonly seen.
