Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are performed primarily by interventional radiologists, interventional pain management physicians, and neurosurgical/orthopedic spine specialists. Intraoperative personnel may also include a fluoroscopy technician, nurse, and a company representative. If general sedation is implemented, an anesthesiologist is also present.
