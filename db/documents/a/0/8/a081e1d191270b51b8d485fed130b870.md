Sleep behavior disorder is often difficult to diagnose and manage. Thus, it is best managed with an interprofessional team that includes mental health nurses. The primary goal of treatment is to provide patients with a safe sleeping environment for them and their bed partners. Healthcare professionals can achieve this through non-pharmacologic approaches and pharmacotherapy if needed. It is important to counsel patients and their bed partners on avoidance of potentially hazardous and injuries objects near the patients, for example, firearms or glass objects. Bed partners should be educated on the disease, and the patientâ€™s enactments during dreams are not under voluntary control.
