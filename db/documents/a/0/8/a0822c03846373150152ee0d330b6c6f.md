Intranasal corticosteroids such as budesonide, fluticasone propionate, and mometasone furoate have been shown to reduce polyp size. These should be used twice daily for several weeks before optimal effects can be appreciated. In contrast, for more severe disease, oral corticosteroids can be given; these should be provided in pulses and in a tapered way. There is no clear consensus among otolaryngologists regarding the maximum daily dose of systemic steroids, nor the tapering regimen.

While antibiotics can be utilized for acute infection, the role of antibiotics in CRSwNP is controversial. There have been some reports of success in patients with CRSwNP with low IgE and neutrophilic diseases that receive macrolides. Current trials are underway to study further efficacy of this class of antibiotics. However, macrolides should be used judiciously since there are cardiovascular risks associated with them. Doxycycline has shown success in the literature, with one randomized control trial (RCT) revealing a small decrease in polyp size, post-nasal drip, and inflammatory markers.
