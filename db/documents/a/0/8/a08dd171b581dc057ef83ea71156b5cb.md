The prevalence of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia globally is similar to the United States. Close to 60% of the paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia is AVNRT, with approximately two-thirds of that in women. A study found that the majority of patients presenting with symptoms due to AVNRT are in their twenties, but some patients might present with AVNRT in their seventh or eighth decade.
