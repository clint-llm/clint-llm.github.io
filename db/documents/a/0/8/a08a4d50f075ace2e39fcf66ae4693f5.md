The gag reflex, also known as the pharyngeal reflex, is an involuntary reflex involving bilateral pharyngeal muscle contraction and elevation of the soft palate. This reflex may be evoked by stimulation of the posterior pharyngeal wall, tonsillar area, or base of the tongue. The gag reflex is believed to be an evolutionary reflex that developed as a method to prevent swallowing foreign objects and prevent choking. It is an essential component of evaluating the medullary brainstem and plays a role in the declaration of brain death.
