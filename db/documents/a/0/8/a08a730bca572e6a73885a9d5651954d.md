Fibrous dysplasia is a typically benign bone lesion characterized by intramedullary fibro-osseous proliferation secondary to altered osteogenesis. The polyostotic form often presents in childhood. Malignant transformation is rare, and remote radiation therapy has been reported as a risk factor. McCune-Albright syndrome is a relatively rare condition featuring polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (often unilateral) with skin pigmentation lesions and endocrine dysfunction (often female precocious puberty). This activity examines how to properly evaluate fibrous dysplasia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the history and physical exam of a patient with fibrous dysplasia.
- Summarize the treatment of fibrous dysplasia.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient suspected of having fibrous dysplasia.
- Explain how the facilitation of interprofessional team education and discussion can optimize the effective detection of fibrous dysplasia and inform the need for subsequent evaluations.
