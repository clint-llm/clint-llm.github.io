Seven extraocular muscles are associated with the bones of the orbit. All but the inferior oblique muscle originate at the orbital apex. The inferior oblique, as noted above, originates at the floor of the orbit in a depression on theÂ orbital floor near the orbital rim. All of the rectus muscles originate at the annulus of Zinn. The superior oblique originates just medial to the optic foramen, between the annulus of Zinn and periorbita. This is the muscle that travels through the trochlea, forming a pulley that allows for intorsion of the globe. All of the extraocular muscles insert on the globe except the levator palpebrae superioris, which broadens anteriorly to become the levator aponeurosis, and is responsible primarily for eyelid elevation.
