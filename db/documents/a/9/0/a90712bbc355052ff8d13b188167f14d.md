Here are a few important points to take note:

- The thymus has a major role in T-cell differentiation and maturation.

- Thymic hyperplasia is the increase in the size of the thymus due to an increase in the number of cells.

- Thymic hyperplasia could be congenital or acquired, leading to hypo functioning or hyperfunctioning thymus.

- Thymic hyperplasia could be due to an increase in the number of thymic epithelial cells or hyperplastic lymphoid follicles.

- Hyperplastic thymus can cause local symptoms like cyanosis, dyspnea, superior vena cava syndrome due to compression of local structures.

- It can also cause systemic symptoms due to autoimmune diseases like myasthenia gravis.

- CT-scan or MRI of the chest is used for diagnosis.

- The best treatment is usually thymectomy.

- Thymic hyperplasia usually has a good prognosis.
