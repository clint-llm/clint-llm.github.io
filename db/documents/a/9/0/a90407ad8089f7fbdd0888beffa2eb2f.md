The peroneus brevis muscle partially forms the lateral compartment of the leg, together with its longer counterpart, the peroneus longus. The function of the peroneus brevis muscle is to evert the foot and plantarflex the ankle. The muscle receives innervation from the superficial peroneal nerve, and its arterial supply is by muscular branches of the peroneal artery. The peroneus brevis originates from the lower two-thirds of the lateral fibula and inserts on the proximal fifth metatarsal. The peroneus brevis muscle is relevant to occupational medicine due to frequent involvement in lateral ankle sprains; its tendon (along with the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle) is the most commonly dislocated tendon in the ankle
