The most common side effect of primidone therapy is sedation and drowsiness. Ataxia, diplopia, and nystagmus occur at the initiation of treatment. Other adverse reactions include dizziness, vertigo, epigastric pain, megaloblastic anemia, respiratory depression, polyuria, skin rash, facial edema. Hypersensitivity reactions tend to occur more frequently in patients with a history of asthma, urticaria, or angioedema. Agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia are rare.

Long term use of barbiturates is associated with:

- Connective tissue disorder.

- There is a higher risk of decreased bone mineral density that may lead to weakened or brittle bones. In such cases, the prescriber should consider discontinuation of primidone.

- An increased risk ofÂ rickets and osteomalacia (phenobarbital) due to increased metabolism of vitamin D.

- There can also be folate deficiency leading to megaloblastic anemia.

- There have been instances of hyperhomocysteinemia secondary to reduced folate level, with elevated cholesterol and apoprotein A and B levels.

- Newborns of mothers on primidone therapy have demonstrated a coagulation defect that is similar to vitamin K deficiency.
