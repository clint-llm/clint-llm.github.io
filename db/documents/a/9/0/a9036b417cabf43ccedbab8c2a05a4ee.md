The incidence of AKI has been cited as 1% on hospital admission, 2% to 5% during hospitalization, and in as many asÂ 37% of patients treated in intensive care units (ICUs), and in 4% to 15% of patients after cardiovascular surgery.

- Overall, the incidence of AKI has been estimated to be 209 patients per million population per year, with 36% of patients with AKI requiring renal replacement therapy.

- The incidence and prevalence of CRF in the United States are uncertain. The third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) shows that almost 2 million people in the United States have a serum creatinine level of 2 mg/dl or greater.

- CRF is known to be more prevalent in men than in women. This gender disparity extends to ESRD.

- ESRD develops in over 100,000 persons a year in the United States.

- Rates of ESRD vary with race. Both the incidence and prevalence of ESRD are three to four times higher in blacks than in whites.
