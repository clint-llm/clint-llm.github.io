Any condition that lowers the transmission of sound from the external space to the cochlea will cause conductive hearing loss. This include cerumen, abnormalities of the helix or auricle, effusions, and fixed ossicular chain. Besides cholesteatoma, other masses include glomus tumors, schwannomas of the facial nerve and hemangiomas.

Sensorineural hearing loss is due to interruption of sound transmission after the cochlea. This may be due to damage to the hair cells or damage to the 8th cranial nerve. Even mild distortions in the hair cells can result in severe hearing loss.

Categories of hearing loss are as follows:

- Slight hearing loss: 16-25dB

- Mild hearing loss:    26-40dB

- Moderate hearing loss: 41-55dB

- Severe hearing loss: 71-90dB

- Profound hearing loss: 90dB
