Diagnosis traditionally relies on clinical history, physical examination, and electrodiagnostic studies. It has been suggested that combination of electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) tests can improve diagnostic accuracy by mapping out the location of pathological compression of the ulnar nerve, which would provide a relatively early diagnosis in patients who have symptoms suggestive of ulnar nerve lesions.

Ultrasound (US) has also been suggested as a screening and follow-up imaging modality in patients with ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, as US can detect the morphologic changes and the extent of the ulnar nerve lesion at the elbow. A recent meta-analysis showed that in healthy participants, the ulnar nerve cross-sectional area at various locations at the elbow rarely exceeds 10 mm, and this can be consideredÂ a cutoff point for diagnosing ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow region.
