The management of osteogenesis imperfecta is challenging and complex and requires an interprofessional healthcare team approach to management.

Medical management with bisphosphonates can prevent fractures in children with recurrent fractures. The pharmacist can perform medication reconciliation, verify dosing, counsel parents on the potential adverse effects, and answer their medication questions. If they note any concerns in the patient's medication regimen, they must immediately reach out to the prescriber or nurse to implement corrective measures. A neurosurgeon may be involved in managing upper cervical spine/craniocervical junction compressive pathologies or spinal deformities. The role of parent education on what to expect at different stages of disease management is also highly significant. Nurses can play a vital role in imparting holistic care to the patient and providing the needed support to the caregivers. Such interprofessional care can aid in meeting basic goals in the management of OI, including ameliorating the patient's functional status, preventing deformity and disability, correcting existing deformities, and monitoring for possible complications.

Most of the current knowledge on the subject of OI has its basis in available level 3 to 5Â evidence.
