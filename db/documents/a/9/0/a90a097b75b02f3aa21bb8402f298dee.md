Cryosurgery should not be performed on a neoplasm of uncertain behavior. Before cryosurgery is performed a diagnosed must be made either by histologic or clinical and dermatoscopic diagnosis.

Other contraindications for cryosurgery are conditions that can be exacerbated by cold exposure such as cryoglobulinemia, multiple myeloma, Raynaud disease, cold urticaria, previous history of cold induce injury at the site or limb, as well as poor circulation at the site or in that limb. Cryosurgery can induce vasoconstriction so cryosurgery to a vascularly impaired area may lead to undesired tissue necrosis.
