The most basic definition of cerebral edema is swelling of the brain. It is a relatively common phenomenon with numerous etiologies.  Cerebral edema categorizes into either vasogenic, cellular, osmotic, and interstitial causes.

The explanation of the mechanism of injury arising from cerebral edema comes via the Monroe-Kellie doctrine.  The Monroe-Kellie doctrine states that space of the cranial cavity is fixed in volume and contains fixed proportions of brain matter (approximately1400 ml), blood (approximately 150 ml) and cerebrospinal fluid (approximately 150 ml).  Because of this fixed space, an increase in the volume of one of these components must, therefore, result in the loss of another component in equal amounts.
