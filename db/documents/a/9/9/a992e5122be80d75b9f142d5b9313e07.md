**Local Symptoms**

The offending organism is often unnoticed, but victims often feel the onset of stinging pain at the affected site within seconds of the inciting event. The initial local pain is usually not severe and wanes within 30 minutes. Within the first 20 minutes, papular erythematous skin lesions can occur, approximately 2 cm in diameter, the same size as the jellyfish itself, often described as “goose pimples,” which usually fade shortly after, but can also persist for days.

**Systemic Symptoms**

Severe systemic symptoms usually occur within the first 30 minutes of a sting, but this can range anywhere from 5-120 minutes.

The syndrome is classically associated with a sense of “impending doom.”

Interestingly, most cases of Irukandji syndrome and stinging occurs within net enclosures designed to prevent jellyfish stings.
