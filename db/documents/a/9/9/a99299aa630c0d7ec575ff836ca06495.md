As a result of the vertebral arteries complex course along the posterior arch of the atlas (C1), it is susceptible to compression and occlusion due to rotation of the head. Disk herniation, osteophytes, spondylotic changes, vertebral artery dissection, cervical spondylosis, and any other anatomical or surgical derangements in the cervical-occipital region may result in vertebral artery occlusion. Musculotendinous compression can cause this condition in association with thoracic outlet syndrome. Osteophytes and bone spurs are the most common causes of occlusion.
