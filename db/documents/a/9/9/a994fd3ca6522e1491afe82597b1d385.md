Several soft tissue layers comprise the brow. From superficial to deep, they include the skin, the subcutaneous fat, and the frontalis muscle; deep to this; there are the periosteum and skull.

Sun exposure, gravity, and the natural involutional degeneration of the skin and soft tissues are the main contributors to brow ptosis. Denervation of the brow elevators, whether via trauma, surgery, botulinum toxin treatment, or disease process, will also lead to brow ptosis. Long-term spasm of the brow depressors can also lead to brow ptosis. Spasms may result from spastic dystonia after facial denervation, facial tics in conditions like Tourette syndrome, or spastic syndromes like blepharospasm.
