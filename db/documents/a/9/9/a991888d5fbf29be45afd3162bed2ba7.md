Following multiple cycles of recurrent inflammation and healing of the small bowel, scar tissue replaces normal cells. As a result, scar tissue can cause the narrowing of the gastrointestinal tract. Occasionally, this narrowing can get severe to an extent where it can cause small bowel obstruction. The most common locations for strictures are the ileum and the ileocecal valve; however, strictures can happen anywhere in the GIT, including the colon, rectum, and the anus. Depending on the location of the stricture, patients may present with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating, or inability to pass gas and stool.
