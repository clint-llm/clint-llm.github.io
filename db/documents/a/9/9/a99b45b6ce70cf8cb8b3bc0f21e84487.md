The cervical spine is close to many vital structures in the head and neck. Most surgical interventions in the cervical spine are either performed via an anterior approach or a posterior midline approach. The anterior approach to the cervical spine is used to expose vertebral bodies from C2 to T1. It is indicated for anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion, corpectomy and fusion, cervical disk replacement, tumor resection, fracture, and infection. Surgeon preference dictates the side of access. A left-sided approach is often preferred since the recurrent laryngeal nerve demonstrates a less variable course compared to the right side, and injury to this nerve can result in vocal cord paralysis and hoarseness. However, clinical significance remains controversial. The superficial dissection either splits or transects the platysma muscle at the desired level. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is then identified and retracted laterally, protecting the carotid sheath and leaving the strap musculature medially. In this layer, careful dissection is important to avoid injury to the structures within the sheath. Deeply, the trachea and esophagus are retracted medially to allow access to the longus colli muscles. The longus colli muscles are then divided longitudinally and retracted laterally, exposing the anterior longitudinal ligament that overlies the vertebral bodies and disks. Careful retractor placement and dissection are important to avoid injury to the trachea, esophagus, and stellate ganglion, typically located around the lateral border of the longus colli muscles at the level of C6. Injury of this sympathetic structure can result in Horner syndrome, characterized by ptosis, anhydrosis, miosis, enophthalmos, and loss of ciliospinal reflex on the side of the injury. Postoperative lateral X-ray of the cervical spine is vital in evaluating any soft tissue swelling. The soft tissue shadow anterior to the cervical spine should be less than 10 mm at the level of C1, less than 5 mm at C3, and less than 15 to 20 mm at the level of C6.

The posterior approach to the cervical spine uses a midline plane between the paraspinal musculature. Adequate hemostasis and retractor placement during this approach are again important to minimize bleeding from the muscles. This approach allows access to the posterior elements of the cervical spine and is used for multiple procedures, including laminectomy, laminoplasty, foraminotomy, and posterior cervical instrumentation. The particular anatomy of the cervical spine does not allow safe placement of pedicle screw fixation; this is primarily due to the pedicles of C3 to C6 being small and close to the vertebral arteries.Â Instead, lateral mass screw placement is preferred. Careful placement of lateral mass screws often achieved with radiographic navigation, is recommended to decrease the risk of injury to the vertebral arteries. The safe placement of pedicle screws is usually possible in C2 and C7.

Fractures of the upper thoracic spine are most frequently accessed via a posterior approach. The unique anatomy of this spinal segment begets particular risks that warrant consideration during surgical intervention. During placement of lateral mass screws at the level of the atlas, dissection of the posterior arch should not involve more than 1.5 cm of lateral exposure from the midline to minimize the risk of injury to the vertebral arteries. When placing C1 lateral mass screws, the screw should be angled 10 to 15 degrees medially to avoid the laterally coursing vertebral artery.
