Because the DPA is superficial and readily palpable, it is a preferred site for palpating the pedal pulse on physical examination. The pedal pulse is palpated by placing the index and third fingers lateral to the extensor hallucis longus tendon and with light compression of the dorsum of the foot, half-way between the first and second metatarsals. A diminished or absent dorsalis pedis artery pulse may show vascular insufficiency; however, due to differences in the anterior tibialis termination, some individuals may have a congenitally non-palpable pulse.

A standard component of a proper vascular examination is performing an ankle-brachial index (ABI) using an inflatable BP cuff and a hand-held Doppler ultrasound device. The ABI is essential in diagnosing peripheral vascular disease and is often used as an indicator of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. The ABI is calculated by dividing the measured systolic blood pressure in the brachial artery by systolic blood pressure in dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery. A value of 0.9 to 1.1 suggests a normal ABI. An ABI less than 0.9 suggests stenosis of leg arteries while an ABI greater than 1.1 may indicate atherosclerotic stiffening or vessel hardening due to calcification of the vessel wall.
