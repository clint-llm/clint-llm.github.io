Diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome can be suspected through detection of hyperbilirubinemia on routine blood tests with an increase in unconjugated bilirubin. It is important to follow up the patient with tests to exclude liver disease and hemolysis for at least 6 months before making the diagnosis. Detecting the A(TA)7TAA genotype through genetic testing can serve as a definitive diagnosis of the syndrome. However, this technique should only be used when the serum bilirubin level is greater than 5.0 mg/dl or treatment with irinotecan will be utilized. The diagnosis can be confirmed by repeating bilirubin levels before and after prolonged fasting, which exacerbates the increase in unconjugated bilirubin.

There are no simple tests to diagnose Crigler Najjar syndrome type 1. Genetic testing can be utilized to sequence the coding region for known mutations, such as exons 2 to 5 in UGT1A1, and make a definitive diagnosis. Multiple tests can be used to differentiate between Crigler Najjar syndrome type 1 and type 2, however. Lowered levels of serum bilirubin, usually less than 15 mg/dL, and a greater than 30% decrease in serum bilirubin after administration of phenobarbital indicate a diagnosis of Crigler Najjar syndrome type 2.
