Homeostasis is the bodyâ€™s way of preventing blood loss, broken down into three main stages: vasoconstriction, platelet plug formation, and blood clotting. Within a clot, fibrin mesh strengthening occurs with the aid of Factor XIII, mainly by keeping the platelet plug together. Both the intrinsic pathway and extrinsic pathways of the coagulation cascade feed into the common pathway. The common pathway involves thrombin-catalyzed cleavage of fibrinogen into fibrin, forming a mesh that strengthens the platelet plug. Subsequently, Factor XIII covalently bonds to fibrin to further support fibrin's interaction with the platelets to prevent dissolution of the clot. Clot retraction, which usually occurs a day after the initial clot formation, involves disruption of Factor XIII crosslinks and fibrinolysis.
