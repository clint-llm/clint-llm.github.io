The vestibular system is an essential function of the body that helps humans maintain postural balance and spatial orientation in response to changes in the environment. Starting from the inner ear, a complex interplay among constituents in the vestibular pathway allows sensory information to reach multiple destinations in the body and make simultaneous outputs. Any disruption along the pathway leads to various symptoms, including imbalance and uncoordinated eye movements. This review discusses the anatomy of the vestibular system and its clinically significant pathological conditions, such as vestibular schwannoma, oscillopsia, and Wallenberg syndrome, to help readers make the right diagnosis based on specific signs and symptoms pertaining to each vestibular lesion.
