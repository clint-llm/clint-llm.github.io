Solar urticaria pathophysiology is not entirely understood. It is an immediate hypersensitivity reaction, which might be IgE-mediated, occurring after exposure to the sun. The radiation may activate an endogenous substance called a chromophore, which could be present in the serum and/or the dermis, turning it into an immunologically active photo allergen. This later induces the degranulation of mast cells, resulting in lesions of urticaria. The intradermal positive reaction after injection of the patient’s irradiated serum is consistent with the hypothesis of a circulating chromophore.

Certain radiation wavelengths (usually long ones) may inhibit the immunological reaction induced by other wavelengths (usually short ones). This is called the double spectrum of action.

Occasionally, solar urticaria is triggered by an exogenous substance, such as some medications. Some examples include atorvastatin, chlorpromazine, tetracycline, or oral contraceptives.
