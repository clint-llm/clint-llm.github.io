Several limitations of the MAUDE database are addressed earlier. These are also mentioned in MAUDE database-related papers as well as identified on the database's website. Despite these inherent limitations, the MAUDE database serves as a powerful tool for clinicians, manufacturers, and regulatory authorities. Operators can utilize these resources for recognizing the most commonly reported device malfunctions and adverse events, learn common pitfalls, apply them to their practice to improve technique, and appropriately counsel their patients when obtaining informed consent for the procedure. The manufacturers can take this opportunity to identify device-related issues and improve them and improve operator training. Furthermore, this information can be utilized as feedback for product development and improvement, make a benefit-risk assessment of the device, patient counseling, and furthering operative techniques.
