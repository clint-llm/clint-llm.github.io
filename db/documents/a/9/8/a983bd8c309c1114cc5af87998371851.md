This type of flap is generally chosen when a surgical defect in this vicinity cannot be suitably be treated with primary closure, adjacent tissue transfer, or a skin graft. This activity describes the technique and concepts of paramedian forehead flaps.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of forehead flaps.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to the paramedian forehead flap.
- Review the evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of forehead flaps.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the performance of paramedian forehead flaps and improve outcomes.
