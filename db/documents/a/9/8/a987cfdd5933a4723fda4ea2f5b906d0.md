Hospice provides patients with many benefits. Some of the benefits of hospice include a 24-hour on-call nurse, increased availability to health care professionals, and reduced to no cost durable medical equipment and medications to increase comfort. Additionally, patients who chose to die at home with hospice care exhibited an improved quality of life; this was also true for their family members. Once patients and their families have acknowledged the seriousness and life-limiting nature of the underlying disease, discussions regarding hospice as a care option should begin. Patients who have a prognosis of six months or less should be urged to enroll in hospice care so the family and patient can focus on improving their symptoms and increasing their comfort.

Unfortunately, acceding to hospice care is a difficult choice; once the patient and their family members accept the condition as a terminal illness, hospice care may be the best option. Hospice care provides the necessary support and cares to optimize the overall end-of-life patient and family experience when medications and treatments will no longer improve the patient’s condition.
