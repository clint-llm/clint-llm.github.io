Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), previously known as lymphoepithelioma, is a malignancy arising from the epithelium of the nasopharynx. Endemic to China, the malignancy shows a variable rate of occurrence ranging from high incidence in the Southern part of China to a low rate in the White population and Northern China with an incidence ranging from 15 to 50 per 100,000. A complex interplay of genetic susceptibility and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection is responsible for the disease.
