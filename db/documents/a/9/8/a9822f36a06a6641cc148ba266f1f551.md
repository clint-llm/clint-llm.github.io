Initially, nonoperative management is attempted with the goal to alleviate symptoms and minimize epiphyseal deformity to limit the progression to arthritis regardless of the severity of the disease. Activity modification, protected weight-bearing (stiff-soled shoe, fracture boot, or cast), shoe wear modifications, and oral anti-inflammatory medications are utilized in this early treatment. Shoe wear modifications may include orthoses with metatarsal bars designed to offload the painful metatarsal head have been shown to help patients respond without long-term disability. Most patients with Smillie stage 1 through 3 respond to conservative treatment and obtain long-term success.

There is a large number of surgical procedures proposed for the treatment of Freiberg disease when conservative measures have failed, largely reserved for patients with Smillie stage 4 and stage 5 disease.
