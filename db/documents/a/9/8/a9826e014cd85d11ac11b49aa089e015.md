After obtaining arterial access via the radial or common femoral artery, the index vessel is engaged with a guiding catheter. The pressure wire product packaging is opened under sterile conditions, flushed with saline, and then zeroed. The wire tip is typically shaped per standard practice based on angulation and tortuosity of the vessel. The wire is then advanced through an introducer and guiding catheter into the coronary artery. Normalization of the waveform is obtained, at the tip of the guide catheter. Pressure wire is then parked, just distal to the stenosis. An iFR measurement is recorded. An iFR ≤ 0.89 may prompt the interventionalist to perform revascularization.

Similarly, during FFR measurement, the pressure wire is placed distal to the stenosis, and a hyperemic agent such as adenosine is administered (15 to 30 mcg bolus in RCA and 20-40 µg bolus in the LM or 140 mcg/kg/min for 3 min via IV infusion). FFR calculation is then obtained. FFR values of less than 0.80 indicate significant stenosis.
