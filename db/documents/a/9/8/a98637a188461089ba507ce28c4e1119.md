iNO's adverse effects are primarily dose-dependent, and the recommended limit for clinical use is 20 ppm for up to 14 days in a preterm infant. However, even low doses may exert cellular toxicity. Infants that received iNO and ventilation for PPHN for 1 to 4 days showed nitrotyrosine residues within their lungs, indicating potential long-term pulmonary complications. Clinical doses of iNO have also exhibited adverse effects. Infants weaning from nitric oxide, when having it withdrawn rapidly, suffered from severe rebound pulmonary vasospasm, most likely due to the actions of exogenous nitric oxide downregulating activity of nitric oxide synthase.

NO can also rapidly interact with other atoms or anions to facilitate damage. It can combine with oxygen in the lungs to form nitrogen dioxide, a potent pulmonary irritant. Additionally, it can interact with a superoxide anion to form peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite is cytogenic and can disrupt surfactant functioning within the lungs.

**Clinical adverse effects of iNO include the following:**

- Worsening heart failure

- Hypotension

- Pulmonary vasospasm

- Methemoglobinemia: The risk of methemoglobinemia increases with the simultaneous use of the eutectic mixture of local anesthetics. (EMLA-Lidocaine/Prilocaine)
