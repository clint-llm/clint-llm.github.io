Personnel needed depends on the setting in which hysteroscopy is undertaken. In the operating room, personnel includes a dedicated anesthesiologist and/or certified nurse anesthetist, nurses for pre and post-operative care, nurses and techs for operating room and supply maintenance, scrub techs, and transport staff.

In the office, the number of staff needed is significantly reduced. Dedicated patient monitoringÂ requires a staff member who is qualified to do so other than the physician. The presence of a team member with ACLS certification and capabilities is highly recommended. Another consideration for in-office hysteroscopy is the accessibility of equipment for treating cardiovascular emergencies and anaphylaxis. Dedicated anesthesia personnel is not needed in the office since the procedure is usually performed with only local or no anesthesia.
