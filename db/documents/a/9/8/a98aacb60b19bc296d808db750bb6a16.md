Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious medical condition, which often results in severe morbidity and permanent disability. It occurs when the axons of nerves running through the spinal cord are disrupted, leading to loss of motor and sensory function below the level of injury. Injury is usually the result of major trauma, and primary injury is often irreversible. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of SCI and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of medical conditions and emergencies due to spinal cord injuries.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation steps for spinal cord injuries.
- Review the management options available for spinal cord injuries.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of spinal cord injuries and improve outcomes.
