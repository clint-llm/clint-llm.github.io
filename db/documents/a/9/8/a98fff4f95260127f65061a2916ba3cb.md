Eagle syndrome, also known as stylohyoid syndrome, styloid syndrome, or styloidâ€“carotid artery syndrome, is a rare condition caused by an elongated or disfigured styloid process. This abnormal styloid process interferes with the function of neighboring structures and gives rise to orofacial and cervical pain that are often triggered by neck movements. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of eagle syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients affected by eagle syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Eagle syndrome.
- Review the presentation of Eagle syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment options for eagle syndrome.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and management of eagle syndrome and improve outcomes.
