An EPS requires a specialized team composed of one or two electrophysiologists, a technician, and one or two nurses. The electrophysiologist usually manipulates the catheters; the technician is operating the external stimulator, the data acquisition system, and the ablation generator, and the nurse takes direct care of the patient in terms of preparation, hemodynamic status, and pulse-oximetry monitoring, administration of drugs and oxygen.
