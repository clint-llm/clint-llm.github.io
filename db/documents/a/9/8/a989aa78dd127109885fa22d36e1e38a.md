Hydrogen sulfide poisoning usually occurs by inhalation, local irritant effects result in direct irritation to the eyes, causing conjunctival injection initially and the corneal injury eventually. When inhaled, it leads to pulmonary injury presenting as hemorrhagic pulmonary edema. Hydrogen sulfide inhibits mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase by making a complex bond to the ferric moiety of the protein, therefore arrest aerobic metabolism. Once it enters the bloodstream and passes the blood-brain barrier, neurotoxic effects can be seen, namely dizziness, seizure, coma, and ultimately death.

Animal studies have reported marked disruption in the lung surfactant activity, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and increased total protein in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
