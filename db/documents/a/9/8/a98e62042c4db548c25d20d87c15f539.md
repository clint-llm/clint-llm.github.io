Opioids are a class of medication used in the management and treatment of pain. This activity outlines the indications, actions, and contraindications for opioids as a valuable agent in treating acute and chronic pain. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with various forms of pain and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for the use of opioids for analgesia, as outlined by recent CDC guidelines.
- Outline the relative contraindications for the use of opioid analgesia and risk factors for misuse.
- Summarize proper monitoring of patients using opioid analgesia to prevent misuse, toxicity, or diversion of medications.
