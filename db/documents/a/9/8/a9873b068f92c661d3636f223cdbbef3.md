The incidence and prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are rising and will continue to grow due to increasing obesity and lifestyle changes. The management of NAFLD will require an interprofessional team that consists of a primary care provider, nurse practitioner, hepatologist or gastroenterologist, nutritionist, endocrinologist, bariatrician. Primary prevention with adequate management of metabolic derangement is essential to prevent the rising incidence of NAFLD and its associated complications. To lower the risk of heart disease, patients should be urged to reduce body weight, discontinue smoking, eat a healthy diet, and participate in regular exercise.

Management of NAFLD is optimal with an interprofessional health care team that includes providers, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and where appropriate, pharmacists. These different disciplines need to engage in open communication about the patient to ensure the best possible outcomes.
