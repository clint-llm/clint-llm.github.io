Radiation causes vascular endothelial damage and demyelination of the white matter, leading to necrosis.

SRS has a better side effect profile than WBRT.

FSR is emerging as a valuable treatment option. It has a lower rate of radiation necrosis than SRS and a reduced risk of radiation-induced optic nerve neuropathy.
