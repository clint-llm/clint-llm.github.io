Studies regarding prognosis are conflicting; some report equivalent outcomes with conventional cervical adenocarcinoma, whereas others report a much more aggressive disease course.

Important parameters for the determination of prognosis of cervical clear cell carcinoma are

- FIGO stage

- Tumor size

- Growth pattern

- Nuclear atypia

- Mitotic activity

- Depth of stromal invasion

Several studies showed a better prognosis in diethylstilbestrol-induced carcinoma than those with spontaneous clear cell carcinoma.

Unfavorable prognosis is related to a larger size, higher stage, high mitotic rate, positive surgical margin, parametrial involvement, and lymphovascular spread.

According to some studies, the overall survival rate of patients with stages (I/II) is (81.5 to 91%).
