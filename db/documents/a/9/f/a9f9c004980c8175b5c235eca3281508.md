**CAMT**

Differential diagnosis includes thrombocytopenia due to birth asphyxia or placental insufficiency, TORCH (toxoplasmosis, rubella, CMV, herpes) infections. sepsis, congenital syphilis, varicella, parvovirus B19, Wiskcott Aldrich syndrome, Fanconi anemia, and dyskeratosis congenita.

**AAMT**

Etiology for thrombocytopenia in adults is extensive. Each cause must be painstakingly ruled out before one can come to the diagnosis of AAMT, which is ultimately confirmed on bone marrow biopsy. Thrombocytopenia can be caused by:

- Infections like Epstein–Barr virus, varicella, leptospirosis, anaplasmosis, dengue, babesiosis, and tick-borne diseases

- Medications like daptomycin, valproic acid, linezolid, penicillins

- Beverages like alcohol, tonic water containing quinine, and herbal supplements

- Vitamin deficiency like B12 and folic acid deficiency

- Decreased THPO production due to liver dysfunction

- Blood cancers or solid organ cancers with metastasis to the bone

- Chemotherapy and radiation therapy used to treat blood cancers or metastatic cancer

- Rheumatologic conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus with or without the anti-phospholipid syndrome

- Peripheral destruction of platelets by shearing stress as seen in the use of intra-aortic balloon pumps and aortic aneurysms

- Splenic sequestration of platelets

- Consumptive coagulopathies like disseminated intravascular coagulation, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis, or hemolytic uremic syndrome
