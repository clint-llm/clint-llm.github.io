Atypical fibroxanthomas present as well-circumscribed red or pink nodules or plaque that may have ulceration, crust, or scale. Atypical fibroxanthoma lesions are typically small in size, with a median diameter of 1 cm, with less than 5% of the lesions being greater than 2 cm in diameter. They often develop rapidly but lack symptoms such as pain or pruritus. More than 90% of atypical fibroxanthoma tumors occur on the head and neck, while the remaining cases typically present on the extremities and trunk. Dermoscopy of lesions reveals polymorphic vessels (linear, dotted, hairpin, arborescent, and/or highly tortuous vessels) radiating to the center of the lesion with intervening white areas. The differential diagnosis includes basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, amelanotic melanoma, leiomyosarcoma, atypical (pseudosarcomatous) dermatofibroma, pleomorphic dermal sarcomas, and metastasis from internal malignancies. Compared to atypical fibroxanthoma, pleomorphic dermal sarcomas are often clinically larger and are more likely to recur locally and metastasize.
