Inferior alveolar nerve and lingual nerve injuries are rare but recognized complications of numerous oral and maxillofacial procedures. Clinicians should be familiar with the risk factors that increase the chance of nerve injuries (such as complicated anatomy or prior surgery) and be able to weigh risks and benefits when deciding whether to undertake an operation on the lower face and which techniques to employ. Additionally, it is crucial to counsel patients on the risks of nerve injury and other potential operative sequelae when making shared decisions about treatment planning.
