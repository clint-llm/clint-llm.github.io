Obtain informed consent from the patient. Position the patient so that the volar aspect of the affected arm is easily accessible. This can be done with the forearm and hand supinated while resting on a flat surface, or with the arm flexed to 90 degrees at the elbow with the forearm pronated and rested upright against a stack of towels. The latter position allows the clinician to stabilize his/her arm on top of the stack of towels while holding the ultrasound probe. Once positioned, cleanse the skin over the intended injection site with povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine 2%. Apply a sterile probe cover to a high-frequency linear ultrasound probe, then apply sterile gel to the surface. Draw up your preferred local anesthetic into a syringe. Ensure that the patient is appropriately monitoredÂ and that there is access to intralipid 20% if needed for severe symptoms due to local anesthetic systemic toxicity.
