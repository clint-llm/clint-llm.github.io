The primary adverse effect of insulin aspart is hypoglycemia, defined as blood glucose less than 70 mg/dL. Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia include dizziness, light-headedness, sweating, confusion, headache, blurred vision, slurred speech, shakiness, tachycardia, irritability, or hunger.

Additional adverse reactions may include allergic reactions, including local injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, rash, pruritus, and hypokalemia. Hypokalemia is dose-dependent, though the other additional adverse drug reactions are not dose-dependent.
