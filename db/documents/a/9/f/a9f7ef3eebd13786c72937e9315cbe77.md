The pulmonary veins receive innervation from the pulmonary plexus. Parasympathetic and sympathetic motor nerve fibers control vasoconstriction and vasodilation, respectively. The parasympathetic portions of the pulmonary plexus derive from the vagus nerve. These nerves run anterior to the pulmonary bronchi and superior to the pulmonary veins. The sympathetic portion of the pulmonary plexus derives from the sympathetic trunk. These trunks run parallel to each other and lateral to the vertebral column. The sympathetic chain cuts medially into the hilum. This portion of the pulmonary plexus primarily runs posterior to the pulmonary bronchi. The pulmonary branch is the 1-4 ganglia group within the sympathetic trunk, at the level of T2-T5.
