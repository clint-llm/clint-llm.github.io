History and physical examination are vital in distinguishing benign from life-threatening headache presentations in the postpartum period. Important historical points to elicit include:

- Time of delivery

- Vaginal vs. surgical delivery

- Complications of the pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia or gestational hypertension

- Delivery complications, including bleeding and postpartum fevers

- Use of epidural anesthesia

- New medications

- Illicit drug use

- Personal or family history of hypercoagulability or bleeding syndromes

- Shortness of breath

- Chest pain

- “Thunderclap” onset

Physical examination findings that raise suspicion for a life-threatening secondary cause of a headache in the puerperium include:

- Hypertension

- Decreased urination

- Lower extremity swelling

- Visual changes

- Abnormalities on neurological examination, including hyperreflexia
