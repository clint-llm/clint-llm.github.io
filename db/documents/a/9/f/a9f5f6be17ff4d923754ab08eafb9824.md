Frontal lobe syndrome, in general, refers to a clinical syndrome resulting from damage, and impaired function of the prefrontal cortex, which is a large association area of the frontal lobe. The areas involved may include the anterior cingulate, the lateral prefrontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the frontal poles. Frontal lobe syndrome is a broad term used to describe the damage of higher functioning processes of the brain such as motivation, planning, social behavior, and language/speech production. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of frontal lobe syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the evaluation of a patient with frontal lobe syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment options for frontal lobe syndrome.
- Describe the differential diagnosis of frontal lobe syndrome.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by frontal lobe syndrome.
