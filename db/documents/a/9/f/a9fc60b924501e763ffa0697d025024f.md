The majority of IVH in preterm infants occurs within the first three days of life.

Current American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation for ultrasonographic IVH screening

- All infants born at ≤ 30 weeks’ gestational age should be screened by 7 to 10 days of age.

- Repeat screening is recommended at 4 to 6 weeks of age and 36 weeks gestational age or before hospital discharge.

- Serial and more frequent cranial ultrasonography is recommended for infants with abnormal cranial ultrasonography findings.

- CT scan is not recommended for IVH screening.

- Routine MRI before discharge is also not recommended.

Diagnosis of PIVH is via transcranial ultrasound doppler screening in all neonates less than 30 weeks gestational age. This is the recommendation established by the American Academy of Neurology and suggests that the initial ultrasound should take place between 7 and 14 days of life with a repeat ultrasound at between 36 and 40 weeks of maturity.

Although not routinely employed in the initial evaluation, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been demonstrated to be useful in identifying cerebellar hemorrhages and white matter injury. It is used to investigate suspected cerebral anomalies found on ultrasound.

Daily measurement of head circumference is useful to monitor the development of hydrocephalus.
