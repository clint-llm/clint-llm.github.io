Endophthalmitis, a dreaded ophthalmic emergency, is defined as the intraocular infection of the coats of the eyeball associated with diffuse vitreous inflammation. It can manifest in significant ocular and systemic complications.

Prompt clinical diagnosis, targeted investigation, meticulous management, and regular follow-up is mandated to safeguard vision in these cases. Medical management includes topical and systemic antibiotics or antifungals, intravitreal antibiotics or antifungals, and surgical treatment of choice is pars plana vitrectomy. The collaboration of the treating ophthalmologist or vitreoretinal surgeon, microbiologists, pathologists, and the critical care physician plays a vital role in determining the patient's final systemic and ocular outcome.
