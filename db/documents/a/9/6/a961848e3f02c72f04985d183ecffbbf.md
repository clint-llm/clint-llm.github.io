There are a variety of benign and malignant indications for women that may cause a patient to seek fertility preservation counseling. Several benign conditions that may lead to early infertility include endometriosis, ovarian torsion, benign ovarian cysts, and premature ovarian insufficiency, which may be a result of genetic conditions such as Turner syndrome, Fragile X premutation, or galactosemia.

In addition, there are a variety of autoimmune medical conditions such as Lupus Nephritis and hematologic conditions such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia that may require chemotherapy, radiotherapy, a combination of both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and in some instances, even bone marrow transplantation.
