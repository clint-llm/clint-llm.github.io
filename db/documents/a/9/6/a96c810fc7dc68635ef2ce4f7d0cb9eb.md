Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy is one of the CAG repeat disorders that show atrophin-1 protein deposition in the nucleus of affected neurons, known as neuronal intranuclear inclusion (NII). Polyglutamine (poly-Q) expansion characterizes autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington disease (HD), and six of the spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) disorders, which could be an important pathogenic feature in common with DRPLA and may explain the genetic anticipation and de novo expansion.

Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and its target ATN1 may be responsible for neuronal pluripotent development of cells in the cortex.

Antibody mediated-immunohistochemistry, in DRPLA post-mortem brains, shows polyglutamine protein structures or stretches that co-deposit with a mutant and insoluble ATN1 protein as part of a diffuse intraneuronal accumulation in densely packed areas within the NII. The dominant hypothesis is that the number of NII correlates with clinical features such as dementia and epilepsy, with neuropathological studies showing reduced number and size of spines and diameter of dendrites. All these findings could explain the brain atrophy seen in neuroimaging.
