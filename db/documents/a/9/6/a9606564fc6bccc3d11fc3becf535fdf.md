Knowledge of Young's Rule can serve several purposes in pediatric drug dosing, and interprofessional healthcare team members should be familiar with it. The most obvious use is for the clinician when calculating the dose for a pediatric patient. A secondary use can be to verify that the dose ordered or prescribed is not outside of the parameters for the child. This is where nurses, during administration or pharmacists, when filling an order or prescription, can apply the Young's Rule and potentially prevent a toxic or therapeutically insufficient dose from being dispensed. In an open, interprofessional team environment, this can improve patient outcomes and prevent adverse events. [Level V]
