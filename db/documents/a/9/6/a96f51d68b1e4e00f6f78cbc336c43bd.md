Cholinergic toxicity is caused by substances that stimulate, enhance or mimic the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, the primary neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous systems. Acetylcholine stimulates muscarinic and nicotinic receptors to cause muscle contraction and glandular secretions. Cholinergic toxicity occurs when too much acetylcholine is present in the receptor synapse leading to excessive parasympathetic effects. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of cholinergic toxicity and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the history and physical exam findings typically seen in patients with cholinergic toxicity.
- Summarize the appropriate treatment for cholinergic toxicity.
- Review the pathophysiology of cholinergic toxicity.
- Explain the modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by cholinergic toxicity.
