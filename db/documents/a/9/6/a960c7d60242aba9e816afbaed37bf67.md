It is well known that coronary calcification causes reduced myocardial perfusion, abnormal vasomotor response, and overall impaired vascular compliance. Several theories have been proposed about the development of coronary artery calcification. However, the entire mechanism is currently unknown. Mechanisms theorized include calcium-phosphorus imbalance, apoptotic bodies, induction of bone formation, and the role of vascular smooth muscle cells. Nonetheless, it is known that calcification in the coronary arteries can occur as early as the second decade of life, immediately after fatty streak formation. Laboratory analysis of lesions of young adults has demonstrated aggregation of crystalline calcium among lipid particles. Furthermore, calcific deposits are found in greater quantities in older adults and complex lesions.
