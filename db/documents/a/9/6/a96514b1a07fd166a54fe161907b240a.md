There is no specific clinical feature that distinguishes tubular carcinoma from the more common invasive carcinomas of no particular type or other types. Initially, tubular breast carcinoma may not cause any symptoms. Over time, a lump may grow large enough to be detected during breast self-examination or examination by a doctor. Tubular carcinomas are usually small, measuring 1 cm or less in diameter and are firm or hard in consistency.
