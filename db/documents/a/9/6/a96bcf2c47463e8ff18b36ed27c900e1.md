Radiofrequency ablation or RFA is a minimally invasive procedure approved by the FDA in 1999Â treating varicose veins. The commercially available radiofrequency catheters are built with a heating element at its tip that uses thermal energy to destroy the endothelium of the vein. The length of the heating element is variable based on the manufacturer.
