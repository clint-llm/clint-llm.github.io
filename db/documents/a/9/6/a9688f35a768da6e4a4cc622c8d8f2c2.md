In utero, the patella develops from a continuous band of fibrous connective tissue of the mesenchymal interzone along the anterior surface of the knee joint at the distal end of the femur. Around week 9 of gestation, chondrification of this fibrous connective tissue begins to separate the previously continuous band into the quadriceps tendon superiorly, and the patellar ligament inferiorly, and the patella becomes completelyÂ cartilaginous by week 14. The medial and lateral patellar facets are initially equal in size, but the lateral facet usually becomes larger than the medial facet by week 23 of gestation. Primary ossification of the patella does not typically occur until age 5 or 6, but radiographic evidence of ossification may be present by age 2 or 3. Initially, in this process, there are multiple small foci of ossification, but these quickly coalesce and spread to the margins of the what will eventually become the adult bone. Periosteum quickly forms on the anterior surface of the patella, but the other margins of the bone retain a chondro osseous interface that persists through adolescence, leaving these areas susceptible to avulsion fractures until skeletal maturation.
