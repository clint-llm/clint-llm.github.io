The diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy needs a thorough physical examination of the patient, followed by the categorization of signs and symptoms according to the West Haven criteria. It is important to rule out other causes of encephalopathy such as viral encephalopathy, intracranial lesions, masses, hemorrhage or stroke, post-seizure encephalopathy, intracranial infections, or toxic encephalopathy. The diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy is based on four main factors:

- Peculiar clinical pattern

- Diagnosis of liver dysfunction or portosystemic shunt along with hyperammonemia

- Alternative diagnoses ruled out

- Response of the patient to ammonia lowering therapy

An electroencephalogram (EEG), computed tomography (CT) scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head can be used to rule out other causes of encephalopathy.
