Trigeminal neuralgia is one of the most painful neurological conditions and is often described as a 'lightning bolt' stuck on the face or a stabbing sensation on the face. Indeed, such short-lasting paroxysms of pain occur multiple times throughout the day, debilitating the patient. This condition is almost always unilateral and can involve one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of trigeminal neuralgia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, managing, and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of trigeminal neuralgia.
- Outline the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of trigeminal neuralgia.
- Review the treatment and management options available for trigeminal neuralgia.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes in patients with trigeminal neuralgia.
