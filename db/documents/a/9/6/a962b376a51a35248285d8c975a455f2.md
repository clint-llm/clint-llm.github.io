Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) can either be congenital or sporadic, with the majority of congenital cases being secondary to HHT. PAVMs can be present from birth and ultimately develop by adult life. Up to 80 to 90% of individuals with PAVMs will later go on to develop HHT.

Sporadic causes of PAVMs are rare and include prior chest surgery, trauma, schistosomiasis, actinomycosis, mitral stenosis, Fanconi’s syndrome, hepatic cirrhosis related hepatopulmonary syndrome, and metastatic carcinoma.
