Fibroblasts are elongated, disc-like structures that are not readily visible upon standard light microscopy evaluation. Usually, only the nucleus is visible in proximity to collagen fibers. Fibroblasts possess long, thin, pale-staining processesÂ that form the bulk of the cell's cytoplasm. These processes are visualized more readily during times of wound repair when rER is actively synthesizing new proteins for the ECM.
