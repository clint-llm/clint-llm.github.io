Where there is suspicion for SI joint pain, SI joint blocks are used to diagnose and treat SI joint pain. While SI joint injections can be performed without imaging guidance, according to various studies, there is only a 12% to 22% chance of the needle reaching the SI joint without imaging guidance. Other imaging guidance modalities include ultrasound or CT. When compared to ultrasound guidance, fluoroscopy can confirm injectate being placed intraarticularly, and fluoroscopy is better than CT imaging at visualizing the medicineâ€™s spread from the joint to the surrounding structures.

With diagnostic SI joint injections, when there is more than 75% pain relief while performing previously painful movements, the SI block is deemed successful. Certain physicians may decide also to perform a controlled (dual) local anesthetic block to rule out false positives.
