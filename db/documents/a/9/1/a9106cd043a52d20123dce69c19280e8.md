A diagnosis of MS can be difficult for a patient, and the physician plays a supportive role in counseling the patient about the diagnosis. Predicting disease course is difficult, and a provider should educate the patient on the wide range of possibilities in disease progression.

Clinicians should emphasize that patients often do well and explain the role of effective medicationsÂ on disease treatment. Patients should receive counsel on reliable sources online on learning about their diagnosis. Reliable sources include the MS International Federation and the National MS Society. Educating the patient on the nature of relapses and long term complications is essential. Patients should know to contact their provider if they experience new neurologic symptoms that last greater than 24 hours, as this may require the administration of corticosteroids. Emphasizing smoking cessation, Vitamin D supplementation, a balanced diet, and other lifestyle medications is also important. A patient should also be counseled on the importance of compliance with disease-modifying therapy, considering the side-effect profile of these medications.
