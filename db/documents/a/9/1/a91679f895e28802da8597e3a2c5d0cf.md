Epidemiological studies have reported a large variation in the incidence of HM. Southeast Asia and Japan have the highest reported incidence which has been estimated to be two in 1000 pregnancies. In the United States, HMs occur in approximately 1 in 600 therapeutic abortions and 1 in 1500 pregnancies. Twenty percent of these patients will develop malignant transformation requiring chemotherapy after the evacuation of the mole. In the United States, choriocarcinoma occurs in approximately 1 in 20,000 to 40,000 pregnancies; 50% occur after term pregnancies, 25% of molar pregnancies, and 25% after other gestational events. However, in Southeast Asia and Japan choriocarcinoma rates are higher at three to nine per 40,000 pregnancies. The incidence rates of both hydatidiform mole and choriocarcinoma have declined over the past 30 years in all populations.
