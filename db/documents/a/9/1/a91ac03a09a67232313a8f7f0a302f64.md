Laboratory tests are beneficial for patients if an illness is detected, and the monitoring is timely and might have negative effects if the patient complaint is not diagnosed and monitored. Some unnecessary consequences include but are not limited to unwanted phlebotomies leading to phlebitis, pain, journeys, delay in important tests, and improper use of patient and technician time.

A campaign named “Choosing Wisely” by the American Board of Internal Medicine in North America advocates for choosing clinical value tests and encourages patients and healthcare workers to mobilize laboratory resources wisely. Tests that are ordered sometimes have major side effects: they are responsible for a <5% increase in healthcare costs but affect 70% of major decisions regarding admission, treatment, and discharge plan. A study defined by clinical guideline’s recommendations demonstrated that repeat testing is unnecessary in about 25 to 30% of cases. Among medical specialties, family practitioners represent the largest group of doctors ordering laboratory tests, followed by the internal medicine department.
