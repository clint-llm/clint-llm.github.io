Sertoli cell-only syndrome, also known as del Castillo syndrome or germ cell aplasia, is one of the most common causes of azoospermia in infertile men. In this syndrome, only Sertoli cells line the seminiferous tubules of the testes, and the patients have very low or absent spermatogenesis. These patients are typically normal on physical examination as this condition presents with infertility without any other sexual abnormality. Diagnosis is usually made based on testicular biopsy findings. Many patients can still reproduce with assisted reproductive technology. This activity describes the diagnosis and treatment of Sertoli cell-only syndrome and highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of Sertoli cell-only syndrome.
- Describe the presentation of Sertoli cell-only syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment options for Sertoli cell-only syndrome.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by Sertoli cell-only syndrome.
