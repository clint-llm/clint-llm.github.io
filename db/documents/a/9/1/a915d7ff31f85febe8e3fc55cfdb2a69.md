A comprehensive echocardiographic examination requires a team that includes an imaging cardiologist as well as an echocardiography technician. It is vital to take a proper historyÂ and perform a detailed physical examination pre-procedure to understand the appropriate indications of the procedure. Communication between the referring physician, echocardiography technicians, and the cardiologist is essential, especially when there is a discrepancy in the clinical examination and echocardiography findings.
