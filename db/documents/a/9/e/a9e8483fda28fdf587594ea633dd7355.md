Hyperbaric oxygen therapy provides a hundred percent concentration and at supra atmospheric pressures about 1.5-3 times higher than normal atmospheric pressure. This method is utilized for the healing of the body by ensuring more than adequate oxygen supply. However, both the high-pressure environment as well as the hyperoxygenation that is associated with hyperbaric oxygen treatments (HBOT) have numerous consequences on the human cardiovascular system. Understanding these mechanical and physiological changes plays an important role in how HBOT is utilized.
