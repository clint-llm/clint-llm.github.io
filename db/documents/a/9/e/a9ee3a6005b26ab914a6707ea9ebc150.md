Prior to the era of open-heart surgery, the prognosisÂ for most patients with mitral stenosis was poor. In the age of mitral valve replacement, the prognosis is excellent. Survival is significantly better for patients undergoing an open mitral valve replacement compared to a commissurotomy. Today, there is an 80% survival at ten years, but in patients who have developed pulmonary hypertension, the survival is less than three years. Other complications that may result in high morbidity include stroke and persistent atrial fibrillation.
