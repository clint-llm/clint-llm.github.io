Floppy eyelid syndrome is characterized by decreased levels of elastin fibers in the tarsus on light microscopy and immunohistochemical staining. Collagen types I and III are comparable to patients without FES.

Inflammation of the adjacent lamina propria is typically confined to this space and does not extend into the tarsus.

Evaluation of elastin fibers within the tarsal collagen using Verhoeff’s modified elastin has demonstrated a prominent decrease in elastin fibers between the acini. The endomysium and perimysium of the pretarsal orbicularis muscle can also demonstrate decreased levels of elastic fibers. Despite the persistent reductions in elastin fibers, the ultrastructure of tarsal collagen remains mostly unchanged.
