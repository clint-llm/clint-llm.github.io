In normal states, the usual function of ET is the maintenance of the stability of the vasculature. The most important interaction with ET is nitric oxide (NO). NO gets released after the utilization of L-arginine by the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) to, therefore, increase cyclic GMP.

**Dysfunctional Endothelium**

There is a plethora of research supporting the loss of NO bioavailability or activity to be a sentinel event in endothelial dysfunction leading to a cardiovascular compromise.
