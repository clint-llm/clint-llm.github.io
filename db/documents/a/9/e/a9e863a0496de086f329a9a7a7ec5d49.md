Patients requiring CPR are unconscious and unresponsive with absent pulses. There is a prognostic benefit in determining the last time the patient was seen normal, or better yet, the time when pulses were lost. Additionally, collateral history from bystanders, family members, friends, and the primary care physician can help etiologic evaluation.

There are no specific physical examination findings, but signs of cyanosis and reduced peripheral perfusion can suggest a cause for the arrest.
