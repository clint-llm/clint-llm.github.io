There are several complications associated with posterior nasal packing, including:

- Pain on insertion

- Pain on removal

- Failure to achieve hemostasis

- Rebleeding on removal

- Otitis media due to Eustachian tube obstruction

- Sinusitis

- Toxic shock syndrome

- Nasal ala necrosis

- Pressure necrosis of nasal mucosa

- Aspiration

- Dislodgement and airway obstruction

- Cardiopulmonary complications, including the risk of death - the "nasopulmonary reflex" has historically been cited as a deadly complication that arises from bilateral posterior nasal packs and necessitates continuous telemetry of patients with posterior nasal packs in place; however, studies have failed to reproduce bradycardia or desaturation reliably in patients with posterior nasal packs.
