While the biopsy is technically simple, the choice of biopsy type and site is essential to obtaining a useful sample. Â  Especially if performing a biopsy without an assistant, it is important to have all needed supplies available and open prior to beginning. Also prior to biopsy, it is very helpful to take photographs of good quality. It is also of utmost importance to provide information to the pathologist, including clinical description, location of biopsy, and clinical differential diagnosis.
