Ricin is a naturally occurring carbohydrate-binding protein produced in the seeds of ricinus communis, the plant that produces castor oil. It is toxic when inhaled, ingested, or injected. As few as five to ten micrograms per kilogram can be lethal. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients effected by ricin toxicity, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of ricin. 
- Outline the symptoms and presentation of patients exposed to ricin. 
- Summarize appropriate diagnostic testing and medical management of patients exposed to ricin. 
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team as well as public health officials, law enforcement agencies, members of the media, and elected officials to ensure appropriate treatment of patients exposed to ricin and management of incidents involving ricin.
