In immunocompetent patients, nitazoxanide is the treatment of choice and FDA-approved for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis. Unfortunately, it is not always successful in reducing symptoms. Paromomycin or azithromycin may also be used. However, in immunocompromised patients, these treatments may fail without immune reconstitution. Intact cellular immunity is essential for resolution of symptoms. Drug targets under investigation include microtubule function, calcium-dependent protein kinases and other metabolic pathways key for cryptosporidiosis growth.
