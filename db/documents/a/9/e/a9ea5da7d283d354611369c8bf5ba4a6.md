Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by excessive fear of embarrassment, humiliation, or rejection when exposed to possible negative evaluation by others when engaged in a public performance or social interaction. It is also known as social phobia. Over fifty years ago, in 1966, social phobia was first differentiated from agoraphobia and specific phobias. Since that time, the concept has transformed from being a relatively rare and neglected condition to one that is recognized as prevalent throughout the world.
