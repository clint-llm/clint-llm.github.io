Untreated or unmanaged hyperthyroidism can lead to an extreme case of hyperthyroidism, referred to as a thyroid storm. Reflecting the hypermetabolic state of hyperthyroidism, the patient experiencing thyroid storm will present with tachycardia, increased GI motility, diaphoresis, anxiety, fever, and manifestations of multiple organ dysfunction. Thyroid storm is a potentially life-threatening complication of hyperthyroidism, thus requiring immediate attention. The mortality rate is high in individuals more than 60 years of age, of about 16%.

Prolonged untreated or undertreated hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of acute cardiovascular events, atrial fibrillation, ischemic stroke, osteoporosis, infertility, abnormalities of menstrual cycles, and mortality.
