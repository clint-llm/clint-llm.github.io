Postoperative and rehabilitation care after a TKA is aimed at restoring the highest possible range of mobility in and full muscular control of the operated knee. Adequate rehabilitation is an important requirement for successful TKA.

The typical hospital stays for a TKA is 1 to 2 nights, depending on the patient. The first postoperative visit is at the two-week mark, where a wound check is performed, and surgical staples are removed if present. Outpatient physical therapy will begin at this time if not begun already. The patient increases their ambulation, independence in their activities of daily living, works on their ROM and works on their quadriceps strength. Patients can resume driving when they can operate the pedals safely and rapidly. This usually takes 4 to 6 weeks. Return to work usually takes 4 to 10 weeks, depending on the work obligations. Patient follow-up is routinely at 6 weeks, 3 months, and one year after surgery. Once strength, mobility, and balance are regained, patients can resume low-impact sporting activities. High-impact activities are discouraged.
