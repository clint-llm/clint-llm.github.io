As the loss of blood occurs in postpartum hemorrhage, the patient is at risk of hypovolemic shock. When the patient loses 20% of the blood, they develop tachycardia, tachypnea, narrowed pulse pressure, and delayed capillary refill. This may lead to ischemic injury to the liver, brain, heart, and kidney.

Sheehan syndrome or postpartum hypopituitarism is one of the complications of excessive blood loss seen in postpartum hemorrhage.

The complications related to management include the following:

- Transfusion-related acute lung injury

- Infections

- Hemolytic transfusion reactions
