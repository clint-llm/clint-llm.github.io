The pathophysiology of these syndromes is unique to each and can vary widely in phenotypic disease manifestation (see Table 2). The direct cellular mechanisms of several syndromes such as PKAN, aceruloplasminemia, and diseases of lipoproteins are understood and described in the current literature. These syndromes tend to have better outcomes either due to milder disease progression or treatment modalities that prevent significant mortality and morbidity.
