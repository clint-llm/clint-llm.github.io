- Vitreomacular traction and epiretinal membrane: The mechanical forces caused by the vitreous traction on macula lead to the accumulation of fluid.

- Autosomal dominant cystoid macular edema (CME) occurs due to muller cell dysfunction and resultant leakage from the perifoveolar capillaries.

- Congenital juvenile X-linked retinoschisis (JXLR): It occurs due to mutation(s) of the retinoschisin 1 (RS1) gene, which is located on the X-chromosomeâ€™s short arm. The gene encodes for the protein retinoschisin, which is involved in cell-to-cell adhesion. The exact pathophysiology underlying the formation of schitic cavities is not completely understood.

- Hypotony macular edema occurs due to abnormal retinal capillary permeability secondary to reduced IOP.

- Congenital cavitary disc maculopathy: These include optic nerve head (ONH) pit, morning glory anomaly, optic nerve coloboma, and extrapapillary cavitation. Serous maculopathy occurs due to the disruption of the normal anatomic features of the ONH, which keep the potential subretinal space in a dry state. As a result, vitreous and/or cerebrospinal fluid travels down the pressure gradient and gets accumulated in the neurosensory retina (NSR) and/ or subretinal space.

- Chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (cCSCR): Cystoid spaces may be seen within the NSR in eyes with cCSCR. This OCT finding is termed posterior cystoid retinal degeneration (PCRD). It occurs secondary to primary choroidopathy and RPE dysfunction. It is not associated with leakage on fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA).

- Microcystic macular edema (MME) in advanced glaucoma and optic neuropathy occurs due to severe retinal ganglion cells atrophy secondary to retrograde transsynaptic cell loss.

- Berlin edema or Commotio retinae is a misnomer. It is characterized by grey-white retinal discoloration secondary to blunt trauma. This characteristic appearance is caused by disruption of the outer segment of the photoreceptor layer.
