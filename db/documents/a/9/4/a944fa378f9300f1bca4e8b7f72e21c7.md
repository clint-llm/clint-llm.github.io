The management of acne keloidalis is best done with an interprofessional team consisting of clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists. The disorder is not easy to treat and there is no one treatment that is suitable for all individuals. The nurse practitioner and primary care provider must educate the patient on removing the trigger factors.

Patient education is a critical step in improving active inflammation by avoiding potential exacerbating factors. Instruct the patient to avoid picking, rubbing, or scratching the affected area. Also, he needs to discontinue close shaving and trimming. Irritation by high-collared shirts should be avoided.

If acne keloidalis nuchae is diagnosed and treated early, the prognosis is good. However, once scarring has developed, the treatment is difficult, and most patients are left with a major cosmetic problem. The large plaques that occur also create poor body aesthetics and many males become withdrawn, shy, and depressed. Pruritus is common, and the constant scratching may lead to the breakdown of the papules and drainage. Finally, scarring alopecia results.
