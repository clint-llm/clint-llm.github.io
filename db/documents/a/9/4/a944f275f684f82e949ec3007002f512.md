Cryoanalgesia has shown good postoperative pain reduction, with a possible increase in long-term pain when used intraoperatively.

Long-term postoperative pain scores may be worsened with intraoperative cryoanalgesia. A double-blind, randomized study of 42 patients after posterolateral thoracotomy found increased pain scores in the cryoanalgesia arm at eight weeks and statistically more neuropathic-type pain, this resolved at six months with no difference between groups.

For chronic pain, cryoanalgesia can be effective for lumbar facet pain, intercostal neuralgia, and phantom limb pain. In a retrospective study of 91 patients who underwent cryoneurolysis for lumbar facet pain, the mean pain scores (VAS) were decreased from 7.70 to 3.72 following treatment.

Cryoneurolysis is an old technique with many possible future applications. Data for its use is encouraging for postoperative pain, and in select groups, for chronic pain.
