Patients generally tolerate benzathine penicillin well, with pain from the injection being the most common concern. Other adverse events include hypersensitivity reactions. Patients with a previous history of hypersensitivity to penicillins or those with a history of asthma, hay fever, allergies, or urticaria, are at higher risk of hypersensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions can be serious and/or fatal and include the type-I, IgE-mediated reaction, also known as anaphylaxis. This type-I hypersensitivity reaction typically includes urticarial skin rash, itching, wheezing, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea and can progress to hemodynamic instability and death. Any previous anaphylactic reaction or serious skin reaction (for example, Steven-Johnson or Toxic Epidermal Necrosis) to any penicillin is a contraindication for use. There have been previous reports that patients with anaphylactic or severe skin reactions from cephalosporins or carbapenems will have a type of cross-reactivity reaction that will also have such serious adverse events when administered any penicillin medication, but these reports are believed to be much lower than previously suspected.

The other adverse effect is known as a superinfection that can result from prolonged use. A superinfection can occur up to 2 months of post-antimicrobial treatment. These potentially fatal infections include C. difficile-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis.
