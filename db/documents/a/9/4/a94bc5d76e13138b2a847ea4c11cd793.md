Ocular melanoma is a serious and lethal clinical malignancy with a poor prognosis when it metastasizes.Â Close attention needs to be paid attention to when patients present with benign lesions in their uveal tract from their iris to the choroid. An interprofessional team can be helpful for proper assessment and treatment. Ophthalmologists and optometrists are often the first to see the lesion. A complete, dilated eye exam with appropriate imaging should then be performed. Treatment of the ocular disease is performed by an ocular oncologist. Medical and radiation oncologists may be consulted if there is suspected metastasis. Ophthalmic technicians, nurses, and medical assistants are involved in the treatment, monitoring, and team coordination of the patient's care. Oncologic pharmacists review medications, verify doses and check for drug-drug interactions. Pharmacists and nurses help with patient and family education. Close follow-up with repeat imaging directed by the oncologist should be done diligently. An interprofessional approach results in the best outcomes.[Level 5]
