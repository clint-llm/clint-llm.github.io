The levator scapulae muscles are superficial extrinsic muscles of the back that primarily function to elevate the scapulae. Levator comes from the Latin levare, meaning "to raise." Scapulae refer to the scapulas, or shoulder blades, possibly originating from the Greek "skaptein," meaning "to dig." In conjunction with other posterior axial-appendicular muscles, the levator scapulae can inferiorly rotate the glenoid cavity and extend and laterally flex the neck. The levator scapulae also serve a role in connecting the axial skeleton with the superior appendicular skeleton. The levator scapulae can be involved in numerous pathologies, including snapping scapula syndrome, levator scapulae syndrome, Sprengel deformity, cervical myofascial pain, and fibromyalgia.
