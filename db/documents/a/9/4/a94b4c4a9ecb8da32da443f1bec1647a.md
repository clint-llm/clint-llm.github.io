All the patients presenting with signs and symptoms of EVALI should be counseled to discontinue vaping as the risk of rehospitalization with potentially severe symptoms exists. Adults without any previous history of smoking tobacco products should not start vaping. Those patients using e-cigarettes or vapes as an alternative to cigarettes should not return to smoking cigarettes.

CDC strongly advises against the use of all THC-containing e-cigarettes or vaping products.
