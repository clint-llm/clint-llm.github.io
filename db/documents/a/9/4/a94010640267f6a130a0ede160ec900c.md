Differential diagnosis of Alzheimer dementia includes- Pseudodementia, Lewy body dementia, Vascular dementia, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Other disorders to consider and rule out when evaluating for Alzheimer's disease include age-associated memory impairment, alcohol or drug abuse, vitamin-B12 deficiency, patients on dialysis, thyroid problems, and polypharmacy.

Lewy Body Dementia (DLB): Approximately 15% of cases of dementia can be attributed to DLB.  The DSM-5 includes it within Neurocognitive Disorder with Lewy Bodies. Cortical Lewy bodies are the histologic abnormalities found in these patients. The concentration of the Lewy bodies correlates with the severity of dementia. These bodies are spherical intracytoplasmic inclusions, composed of a dense circular eosinophilic core surrounded by loose fibrils. The core contains aggregates of proteins α-synuclein and ubiquitin. Patients with Lewy Body dementia have core clinical features (fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, one or more symptoms of Parkinson with onset subsequent to the development of cognitive decline), suggestive clinical features (REM sleep behavior disorder and severe antipsychotic sensitivity), and indicative biomarkers (123-MIBG demonstrates low uptake, SPECT or PET shows reduced dopamine transporter uptake in basal ganglia, and PSG shows REM sleep without atonia). A probable diagnosis is given if a patient has 2 core features or one suggestive feature with one or more core features. A possible diagnosis is given if the patient has only one core feature or one or more suggestive features.

Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD): It accounts for 5 % to 10 % of all dementia cases. Its mean age of onset is 53 and is more common in men than women. Patients with Frontotemporal Dementia have personality and behavioral disturbances with or without language impairment preceding dementia with insidious onset. Pick disease is an older term for FTD, based on the histologic finding of intraneuronal inclusions known as "Pick bodies." FTD has two subtypes- behavioral variant and language variant. For behavioral variant, possible diagnosis requires that the patient have three of the following symptoms: Disinhibition, Apathy, Loss of sympathy, Stereotyped or compulsive behaviors, Hyperorality, and decline in social cognition and executive abilities. The language variant has a decline in language ability. For probable diagnosis, in addition to these symptoms evidence of genetic mutation or frontal and temporal lobe involvement on CT/MRI is required. Regardless, these patients still retain their visuospatial abilities.

Dialysis Dementia: Dialysis dementia is a neurologic complication of chronic dialysis. It can be due to vascular causes (as dialysis patients have a greater risk of stroke), or metabolic abnormalities, or due to dialysis itself. In the past, it was attributed to aluminum toxicity but nowadays it's uncommon due to the use of alternatives to aluminum-containing substances. The exact mechanism is still unclear.

Some atypical presentations of Alzheimer disease include:

- The multidomain amnestic syndrome affects multiple areas of cognition especially language and spatial orientation with relative sparing of memory in early stages.

- Posterior cortical atrophy manifests as progressive cortical visual impairment with features such as simultagnosia, object, and space perception deficits, acalculia, alexia, and oculomotor apraxia, with relative sparing of anterograde memory, non-visual language function, behavior, and personality. Neuroimaging shows occipitoparietal or occipitotemporal atrophy.

- Primary progressive aphasia is characterized by progressive language difficulty with relative sparing of memory and other cognitive functions in early disease.

- Dysexecutive or frontal variant patients have impairment in executive functions relative to memory loss.
