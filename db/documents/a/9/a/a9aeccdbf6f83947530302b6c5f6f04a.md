Spondylolysis is a unilateral or bilateral defect in the region of the pars interarticularis, (isthmus or bone bridge between the inferior and superior articular surfaces of a single vertebra) is most commonly the result of repetitive trauma to the growing immature skeleton of a genetically susceptible individual. The prevalence of this condition is 4% by age 6 and 6% by age 14. Spondylolysis usually is asymptomatic, but approximately 10% of affected individuals present with symptoms including insidious onset, low back pain that is exacerbated with activity or lumbar hyperextension, and may or may not be associated with a radicular component. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of spondylolysis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the causes of spondylolysis.
- Review the presentation of a patient with spondylolysis.
- Summarize the treatment options for spondylolysis.
- Outline the importance of cooperation among the interprofessional team on the proper biomechanics to optimize comfort, decrease stress, and promote healing in those with spondylolysis.
