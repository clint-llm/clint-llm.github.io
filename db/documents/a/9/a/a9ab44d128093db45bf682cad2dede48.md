Many fungal species can result in FK, however, the most commonly implicated are Fusarium, Aspergillus, and Candida species.Aspergillus species were the most commonly isolated species followed by Fusarium.Aspergillus was responsible for more than 55% of all FK cases, suggesting that Aspergillus species are the most common cause of FK in the Indian subcontinent.Fusarium was the most common etiology of FK in other parts of the world including south India.Fusarium, while 22% were caused by yeasts including Candida.Fusarium (>50%), followed by Aspergillus (>9%) and Alternaria (>7%).Candida (57%) was the most prevalent causative fungus followed by Aspergillus (17%).

The prevalence of specific types of fungi causing FK also depends on specific patient-related risk factors. For example, Fusarium species are found more commonly in association with trauma and contact lens use,Candida species are found more in association with ocular surface disease and topical steroid use.Fusarium, however, it may also result in bacterial infections.

Corneal refractive surgery including laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) may also rarely be a cause of fungal keratitis that could lead to severe consequences if not properly treated.Candida, Fusarium, Aspergillus, and Alternaria species.
