Some of the common diseases associated with eosinophilia are celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, infections (parasitic, amebic, fungal), connective tissue disorders, vasculitis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome, for instance. Radiographically, inflammatory bowel disease and lymphoma can mimic eosinophilic gastroenteritis.

In the pediatric group, non-IgE mediated food allergy and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis require exclusion, along with differential diagnoses mentioned above.
