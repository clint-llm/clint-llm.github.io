The majority of cases of isolated renal ectopy are diagnosed as incidental findings in asymptomatic patients. For example, in a case series published by Guardino et al. (2004), 79 of the 99 patients included were asymptomatic at diagnosis.

A small or even tiny ectopic pelvic kidney may rarely cause primary, persistent, continuous urinary incontinence in a female. It may sometimes be too small to be seen by ultrasound alone and may require a renal nuclear scan or magnetic resonance imaging with contrast to identify the associated hydronephrotic ureter and tiny ectopic renal tissue. Therefore, a high degree of suspicion should accompany any female patient with primary, continuous incontinence. There may even be compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral renal unit.
