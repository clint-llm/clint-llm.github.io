**Missed Injury**

Although missed intestinal injury has not been examined individually, multiple studies have examined outcomes in missed abdominal injuries after trauma. Prompt diagnosis is crucial because delay in treatment of 60 to 90 minutes was associated with increased mortality.

**Delayed Presentation**

Delayed presentation is an inevitable result of more patient’s being managed non-operatively. In these cases, patients do not initially have any signs or symptoms of intestinal trauma. The patient’s other traumatic injuries are managed non-operatively, and then later, they develop symptoms leading to the discovery that there had been an intestinal injury. The safety regarding the increased use of non-operative management remains controversial.

**Bleeding**

Bleeding associated with intestinal trauma complicates a surgeon’s ability to restore intestinal continuity properly. Higher blood product requirements are associated with higher anastomotic leaks.

**Leak After Repair**

The leak of intestinal content following repair can lead to significant mortality. The intestinal leak rate after an intestinal repair is approximately 5% to 8%.
