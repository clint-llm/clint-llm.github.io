**Frequency of Chronic Pain**

According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), about 20.4% of people over the age of 18 years old in the US suffered from chronic pain in 2016.

Chronic pain is estimated to cost approximately $560 billion annually in lost productivity and medical treatment.

The incidence of chronic pain is increasing due to the prevalence of obesity-related pain conditions, increased survival of trauma and surgical patients, an aging population, and heightened public awareness of pain as a treatable condition.

**Frequency of Opioid Use, Morbidity, and Mortality**

In the past, providers in the United States rarely prescribed opioids for any condition except chronic cancer pain. This approach began to change in the 1990s.  Dr. James Campbell addressed the American Pain Society in 1995 and urged healthcare providers to treat pain as the fifth vital "sign."
