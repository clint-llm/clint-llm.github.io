Because of the diverse presentation and multiple organ involvement, Cowden syndrome is best managed by an interprofessional team including oncology nurses.

Even though Cowden syndrome is associated with benign hamartomas, clinicians need to be aware that long term monitoring of these patients is mandatory because of the risk of malignancy. The risk of colon cancer in patients is slightly elevated] Uterine leiomyomas and ovarian cysts can occur in females and may produce menstrual abnormalities along with a possible 20% to 30% increased risk of endometrial carcinoma. Females with Cowden disease are also at a much higher risk of breast carcinoma, with about 85% of females with Cowden syndrome developing breast carcinoma at some time in their life. Thyroid abnormalities such as goiter, thyroglossal duct cysts, and adenomas are also common. Thyroid carcinoma risk is also increased by up to 30%. Melanoma skin cancer is also increased in patients with Cowden disease and may occur in 5% of patients. In order to improve patient outcomes, a screening program must be in place to ensure that the malignancies are detected at an early stage.

The quality of life of most patients is poor because of the continuing hospital admissions and work up to rule out malignancy.
