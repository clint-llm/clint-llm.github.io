Acute intoxication with a high dose of aflatoxin may result in fulminant hepatic failure and rhabdomyolysis. Chronic exposure to aflatoxin may result in liver cirrhosis and ultimately lead to hepatocellular carcinoma. Also, gall bladder carcinoma is associated with chronic toxicity.

In children, aflatoxin exposure is associated with growth stunting, nutrition deficiencies, and impaired development.
