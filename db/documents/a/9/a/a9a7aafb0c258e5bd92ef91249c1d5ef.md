Atopic dermatitis (AD), which is a specific form of eczema, is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease.

This chronic disorder associated with pruritus usually starts in infancy and presents with dry skin, eczematous lesions and lichenification. It is believed that AD is associated with other IgE associated disorders like allergic rhinitis, asthma, and food allergies. AD has significant morbidity and it appears that the prevalence of the disorder has been increasing over the past few decades.
