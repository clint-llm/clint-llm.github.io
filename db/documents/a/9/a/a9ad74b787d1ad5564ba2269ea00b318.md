Cardiac complications include congestive heart failure caused by valvular damage from the infection, annular abscess, the extension of infection into the conduction system leading to atrioventricular blocks, mycotic aneurysms of the sinus of Valsalva which can result in pericarditis, hemopericardium, and cardiac tamponade, or fistulas to the cardiac chambers including the right or left ventricle.
