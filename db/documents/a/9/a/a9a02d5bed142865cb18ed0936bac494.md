An airborne disorder is any disease that is caused by a microorganism that is transmitted through the air. Many clinically important airborne diseases are caused by a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

According to the World Health Organization, “Airborne transmission of infectious agents refers to the transmission of disease caused by the dissemination of droplet nuclei that remain infectious when suspended in air over long distance and time.” Airborne transmission can be characterized as obligate or preferential depending on whether it is only transmitted via droplet nuclei or if it has multiple other routes of transmission.

The microorganisms transmitted by an airborne route may be spread via fine mist, dust, aerosols, or liquids. The aerosolized particles are generated from a source of infection, such as an infected patient or animal. In addition, aerosols may be generated from biological waste products that accumulate in garbage cans, caves, and dry arid containers. In aerosolization, the microorganisms that are less than 100 micrometers in size float in the air. These microorganisms, contained in droplets, are then dispersed via air currents to varying distances and can be inhaled by susceptible hosts.

The control and prevention of airborne transmission of infections are not simple; it requires the control of airflow with the use of specially designed ventilation systems, the practice of antiseptic techniques, wearing personalized protective equipment (PPE), and performing basic infection prevention measures like hand washing.

**Airborne Organisms**

In almost all cases, airborne pathogens cause an inflammatory reaction of the upper airways affecting the nose, sinuses, throat, and lungs. The involvement of these structures may result in sinus congestion, sore throat, and lower respiratory tract symptoms. Any coughing or sneezing activity may then generate aerosolized particles leading to airborne transmission. Some of the common pathogens that may spread via airborne transmission are:

- Anthrax

- Aspergillosis

- Blastomycosis

- Chickenpox

- Adenovirus

- Enteroviruses

- Rotavirus

- Influenza

- Rhinovirus

- Neisseria meningitidis

- Streptococcus pneumoniae

- Legionellosis

- Measles

- Mumps

- Smallpox

- Cryptococcosis

- Tuberculosis

- Bordetella pertussis

- Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)

- Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)

- Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)

This is a non-exhaustive list that only encompasses some of the common diseases that have been implicated in airborne transmission.

Airborne diseases are not exclusive to humans and can also infect animals. A notable example is poultry that is often affected by an avian disorder (Newcastle disease), which is also transmitted via an airborne route. However, it is important to understand that exposure to an animal or a patient with an airborne disease does not automatically ensure disease transmission. The infection also depends on the host's immunity, the amount of exposure, and the duration of exposure to the infected patient.

**Airborne Particles Generated from Medical Equipment**

Besides patients, several medical and surgical procedures may also generate aerosolized infectious particles. In most cases, these airborne particles are generated during the manipulation of the lung airways. These include:

- Manual ventilation with a bag and mask

- Intubation

- Open endotracheal suctioning

- Bronchoscopy

- Cardiopulmonary resuscitation

- Sputum induction

- Chest physiotherapy

- Lung surgery

- Nebulizer therapy and steam inhalation

- Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (BIPAP, CPAP)

- An autopsy of the lungs

Care must be taken while performing the above medical procedures on patients known to have diseases with high transmissibility through airborne routes.
