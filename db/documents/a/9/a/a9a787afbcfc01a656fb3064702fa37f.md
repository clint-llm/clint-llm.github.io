The outcome of diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis depends on the stage at which the patient gets diagnosed with the disease. Renal biopsies with a greater extent of tubule-interstitial injury with inflammation atrophy and fibrosis and the presence of crescents have been associated with worse outcomes. Moreover, factors affecting the survival percentage included the degree of proteinuria, serum creatinine levels, blood urea nitrogen levels, and eGFR at the time of presentation.
