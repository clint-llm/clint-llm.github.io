According to a cross-sectional study using a nationally representative sample of 31,162 US adults from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey, 34% of respondents reported having at least 1 sunburn in 2015. Prevalence was highest among Fitzpatrick skin types I to III, those in younger age groups (adults 18 to 29 years old), and non-Hispanic white individuals. Additionally, individuals who used tanning lotions, engaged in physical activity, binge drink, and are overweight were also more likely to get sunburned.

**Fitzpatrick's Skin Phototypes**

- Type I: Pale white skin, burns easily, does not tan

- Type II: White skin, burns easily, tans with difficulty

- Type III: White skin, may burn but tans easily

- Type IV: Light brown/olive skin, hardly burns, tans easily

- Type V: Brown skin, usually does not burn, tans easily

- Type VI: Black skin, very unlikely to burn, becomes darker with UV radiation exposure

As mentioned above, individuals with Type I to III Fitzpatrick skin phototypes were at increased risk for sunburn. This is due to decreased melanin pigment in the skin that blocks UV radiation. People with a lower Fitzpatrick skin phototype have a lower MED, or minimal erythema dose, the amount of UV radiation measured in energy per unit area that leads to erythema of non-diseased skin.
