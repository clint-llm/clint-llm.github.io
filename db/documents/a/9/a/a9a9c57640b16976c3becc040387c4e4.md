The underlying cause of chylous ascites (CA) is the disruption of lymphatic flow. Lymph mainly originates in the intestine and the liver, as well as other organs in the abdomen. Long-chain triglycerides (TG) in the diet are absorbed as chylomicrons into the lymphatic system following conversion into monoglycerides and fatty acids in the small intestine. This attributes to the milky appearance of lymph due to the high content of TGs.

In cases of CA, due to portal hypertension, endothelial compromise occurs due to high lymphatic pressure, leading to the dilation of lymphatic channels, which results in their rupture and CA formation. In non–portal etiology, lymph material is filtered as an exudate into the peritoneum by a fistula that is formed retroperitoneally due to congenital or acquired megalymphatics. Over time, the deposition of collagen in the basement membrane (BM) of the lymphatic channels occurs due to increased lymphatic pressure leading to a decline in the capacity of absorption of the intestinal mucosa. This can lead to protein-losing enteropathy manifested by inadequate absorption, malnutrition, and steatorrhea.

The pathophysiology of chylous ascites (CA) varies depending on the etiology. This can be divided into three mechanisms:

- 
**Acquired Lymphatic Disruption**

Acquired lymphatic disruption can be traumatic or secondary to surgical procedures. This causes dilation of the retroperitoneal lymphatics with drainage of lymph into the abdomen through a fistula between the lymphatic system and retroperitoneum. The dilation can also be a result of the increased production of lymph and the elevated pressure in the hepatic veins that are seen in cases of portal hypertension (HTN) secondary to cirrhosis and constrictive pericarditis.

- 
**Fibrosis of the Lymphatic System**

This is mostly seen in malignancies obstructing the lymphatic flow from the gut into the cisterna chyli, with leakage from the subserosal dilated lymphatics into the peritoneal cavity and lymph node fibrosis.

- 
**Congenital Causes**

Congenital anomalies such as congenital lymphangiectasia cause exudation of lymph into the peritoneal cavity causing CA.
