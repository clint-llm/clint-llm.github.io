Treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma is based on risk stratification, which includes histologic classification, presurgical stage, and postsurgical clinical group. Treatment modalities include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Local treatment is a crucial part of rhabdomyosarcoma management; however, the pros and cons of radical surgery and/or radiotherapy should be considered. Chemotherapy and, in some cases, radiotherapy can induce partial differentiation in childhood rhabdomyosarcoma. The last decade has shown great improvement in patient outcomes as a result of multimodality therapeutic protocols. Two main chemotherapy regimens used in the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma include (1) the VAC regimen, which consists of vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide, and (2) the IVA regimen, which consists of ifosfamide, vincristine, and actinomycin D. These drugs are administered in up to 15 cycles, depending on disease stratification. Ionizing radiation (IR) therapy has been shown to be a powerful tool in decreasing disease recurrence rates and is often indicated in higher stage classifications. IR therapy is mainly used to complement patient management, especially when complete resection is not possible. In conclusion, the treatment of patients with rhabdomyosarcoma is undergoing continuous evolution as new, evidence-based results emerge from clinical trials
