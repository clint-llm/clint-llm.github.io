Trauma to the bursa increases blood flow, migration of leukocytes into the bursa, and fluid production from within the synovial cells of the bursa, providing the foundation of the inflammatory response seen in bursitis. Trauma itself, direct inoculation, presence of overlying skin and soft tissue infections, or hematogenous spread can lead to septic bursitis. Direct microscopy examination of the synovial fluid of the bursa may reveal a source of inflammation, including gout or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals or bacteria. Molecular examination of fluid is likely to reveal elevated inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, various interleukins, and cyclooxygenases.
