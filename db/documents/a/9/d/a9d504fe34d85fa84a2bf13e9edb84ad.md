The etiology of a pericardial effusion varies widely and can be divided into several categories:

- Infectious: Pericardial effusion may be due to infection with a multitude of viral, bacterial, fungal, and even parasitic pathogens.

- Inflammatory/rheumatologic: Numerous auto-immune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren syndrome, can cause a pericardial effusion.

- Neoplastic: Both metastatic disease and primary cardiac tumors can cause pericardial effusions. Lung cancer is the most common cause of malignant pericardial effusion.

- Trauma: Blunt, penetrating, and iatrogenic injury to the myocardium, aorta, or coronary vessels can lead to the accumulation of blood within the pericardial sac.

- Cardiac: Post-myocardial infarction (referred to as Dressler syndrome), cardiac surgery, cardiac wall rupture.

- Vascular: Aortic dissection, type A, can be complicated by cardiac tamponade.

- Idiopathic: Many cases of pericardial effusion are idiopathic.

- Other: There are numerous additional etiologies of pericardial effusion, including radiation, chronic kidney disease, renal failure, congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, hypothyroidism leading to myxedema, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, and drug-induced.
