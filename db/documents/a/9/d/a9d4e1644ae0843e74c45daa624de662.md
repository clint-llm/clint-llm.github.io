The prognosis of osteoblastoma is excellent, with most patients cured following the initial surgical treatment. However, local recurrence is a relatively common complication, with rates ranging from 15% to 25%.

Recurrence is more common in the setting of lesions treated with curettage. Since spinal lesions are often treated with curettage due to the anatomic challenges and morbidity of performing wide local excision, it is not surprising that high recurrence rates have been associated with spinal lesions. Recurrence is most common in the initial two years following treatment and rare beyond two years post-treatment. Also, borderline lesions such as aggressive osteoblastoma or osteoblastoma-like osteosarcoma can be mistakenly diagnosed as osteoblastoma, leading to delayed diagnosis and incomplete treatment. Long-term follow-up imaging and clinical surveillance (generally at least two years based on recurrence data) are commonly performed due to the risk of recurrence.

While degeneration into osteosarcoma has been reported in the literature, recent genomic studies contradict these findings, and malignant transformation remains controversial. Degeneration of osteoblastoma to osteosarcoma is exceptional but has been reported
