Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of hematologic neoplasms classically described as a clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells leading to dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis in the bone marrow. Some patients with MDS may have a transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This activity describes the cause and presentation of myelodysplastic syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of myelodysplastic syndrome.
- Describe the pathophysiology of myelodysplastic syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment of 
myelodysplastic syndrome.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by myelodysplastic syndrome.
