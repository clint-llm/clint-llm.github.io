A deep understanding of nasal anatomy is the cornerstone of a good rhinoplasty. A slight change in one nasal structure can have an impact on the rest and dramatically modify the facial configuration.

The **external nose**consists of a bony and cartilaginous framework, covered by muscles, soft tissue, and skin.

- **Nasal Bones and Cartilages**: The upper third of the nose is defined by the paired nasal bones and the frontal process of the maxilla, which constitute the bony pyramid. Nasal bones are in an intimate relationship with the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone. The middle third is formed by the upper lateral cartilages, which attach to the nasal bones cranially. Nasal bones overlap the upper lateral cartilages for 4 - 5 mm, constituting the “Keystone area.” This anatomical landmark is important for the aesthetics of the dorsal contour and should be treated carefully during surgery. Upper lateral cartilages also attach to the septum dorsally, forming an angle of 10 - 15 degrees approximately. This narrow zone of air resistance is called the internal nasal valve and has clinical importance. During surgical maneuvers, it is important to maintain this angle in order to guarantee a patent airflow. The lower lateral cartilages define the lower third with its medial, middle, and lateral crura. The anatomical configuration of these cartilages will determine the shape and size of the nasal tip area. They also set the framework for the external nasal valves.

- **Muscles**: The main mimetic muscles of the nose are the nasalis, levator labii aleque nasi, and depressor septii. These muscles are enclosed and interconnected by a fibrous fascia called the nasal superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS). The importance of nasal muscles may sometimes be underestimated, but they are important for keeping a patent airway. A proof of this is patients with facial paralysis, where a collapse of the external nasal valve can be observed.

- **Skin and Soft Tissue Envelope (SSTE)**: When divided into upper, medial, and lower thirds of the nose, the tissue covering the Rhinion zone is the thinnest, followed by the upper and then lower third which is the thickest. Based on multiple characteristics like sex, age, ethnicity, and others, SSTE can be thinner or thicker. This plays a significant role in surgical planning. When dealing with patients with very thin SSTE, small changes in nasal cartilage and bony structures will have a significant impact on the shape, and small irregularities of grafts utilized can be very noticeable. Contrarily, in patients with very thick SSTE, a more aggressive approach is often needed so that the changes can be perceptible, and small irregularities won’t have such an impact on the aesthetics of the nose after surgery.

The **internal nose**is constituted of the septum and the turbinates, all of which are covered by mucosa.

- **Septum**: The nasal septum is a rigid, quadrangular-shaped structure covered by mucosa that is located in the midline of the nasal cavity. It separates the two nostrils, and it constitutes the principal support for the nose. In the junction between the dorsal and caudal septum lies the anterior septal angle, which helps to determine nasal projection. It also helps to define other parts of the nasal anatomy like the dorsal and columellar areas. Through the internal nasal valve, it has a very important role in maintaining a patent airway. The septum is composed of cartilaginous and bony components, the latter being the maxillary crest, the vomer, and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone. The thick cartilaginous portion is extensive and is one of the main sources for cartilage harvesting in nasal surgery.

- **Turbinates**: Turbinates are bony outgrowths covered by mucosa. These structures form pathways where the air flows and is warmed and humidified. They also help in removing particles from the inspired air and additionally assist in regulating the airflow by contracting and expanding. They are divided into superior, middle, and inferior turbinates. Most of the airflow passes through the middle and inferior turbinates. Some causes like rhinitis or septal deviation can induce turbinate hypertrophy, which can obstruct the air canal to variable extents. If an obstruction is found, it must be addressed during surgery in order to improve nasal function.

**Blood Supply**: The nose has a rich vascular network. This allows for wide-undermining without compromising tissue irrigation.

The main nasal arteries are the supratrochlear and the facial artery (branches of the internal and external carotid, respectively). Both these arteries, together with branches of the ascending columellar arteries, will widely anastomose, forming a network.

Blood to the nasal septum is supplied by the anterior and posterior ethmoid arteries, originating from the ophthalmic branch, the sphenopalatine artery (branch of the external carotid), and the septal branch of the superior labial artery. All these branches end up anastomosing in a network known as Kiesselbach's Plexus, which is the most common site for nosebleeds.

Venous drainage is primarily through vessels anastomosing to the facial vein.
