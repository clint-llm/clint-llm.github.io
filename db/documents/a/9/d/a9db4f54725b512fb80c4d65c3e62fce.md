Caring for patients with cognitive impairments can be a difficult task. First, the healthcare provider must distinguish between many processes that can lead to cognitive impairment (e.g., delirium, depression, schizophrenia, dementia, etc.).

Occupational therapy methods for screening functional cognition are of significant value for patient assessment. Knowledge of the level of function and understanding of this level assist occupational therapists in developing client-centered interventions. They identify the patients remaining abilities and strengths and identify safety issues and the appropriate level of supervision. The Allen Cognitive disabilities model is based on strengths, not disabilities, to promote the highest possible functional level. The model was developed while working with adult patients in mental health settings but is now applied in other areas.
