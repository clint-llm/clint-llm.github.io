Child et al. (2009) mentioned about the age of onset of lipedema during puberty (55%), reduction of fat above the waist only through diet (96%), no effect on lower extremities making it more disproportionate fat distribution, pain upon pressure (71%), easy bruising (82%), varicose veins (39.5%), vein telangiectasia (53%), fat pads (bulging protuberance of fat above or below the knee; pre-tibial fat pads) (58%). Surprisingly, four percent of lipedema patients recorded to have normal BMI (18.5 to 24.99%), eleven percent were pre-obese or overweight (BMI 25.0 to 29.99%), eight percent obese class I group (BMI 30 to 34.99%), twenty-seven percent obese class II (BMI 35.0 to 39.99%) and fifty percent obese class III (BMI ≥40%).

Development

Fat deposition from & below the waist gradually progresses downwards without foot involvement.

Starts distally and progresses to proximal areas of the body

Affects the entire body gradually, except the trunk is mainly involved in centripetal

Effect of diet

Reduction of fat above the waist, no effects on legs

Symmetrical loss from trunk and legs

Symmetrical loss starts from the face and descends gravitationally

Symmetry

Usually bilateral symmetrical

Unilateral or bilateral
