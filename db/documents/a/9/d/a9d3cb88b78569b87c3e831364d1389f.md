Diaphragmatic pacing is a procedure that is performed to stimulate the phrenic nerve to cause diaphragm contraction. This diaphragm contraction helps in the generation of breath, provides reliable minute ventilation, and may facilitate ventilator weaning or delay the progression to noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of patients with diaphragmatic dysfunction and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients requiring this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of diaphragmatic pacing.
- Describe the technique in regards to diaphragmatic pacing.
- Review the potential complications of diaphragmatic pacing.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with a diaphragmatic pacer.
