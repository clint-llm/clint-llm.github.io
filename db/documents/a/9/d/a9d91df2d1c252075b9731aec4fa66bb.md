Hallux varus is a clinical condition characterized by medial deviation of the great toe at the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. This condition has multiple etiologies and patients may present with various symptoms and with varying severity of hallux varus. Adult acquired hallux varus deformity is commonly iatrogenic, occurring as a result of surgery for hallux valgus. Mild hallux varus can be managed with stretching exercises and splints. However, if symptoms become significant and affect daily activities, surgery should be considered. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hallux varus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.
