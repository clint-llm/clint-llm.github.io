Polymorphic light eruption is the most common form of immunologically mediated photosensitivity dermatoses. Exposure to sunlight in spring or summer results in an irritable rash that resolves within a few days, providing further exposure is avoided. Variants include juvenile spring eruption (vesicles on the ears of young boys) and PMLE sine eruption (pruritus on sun-exposed skin without visible skin changes). Polymorphic light eruption is also known as polymorphous light eruption and prurigo aestivalis.
