Described initially in 1897 by Walter Smith, monilethrix is a rare structural hair shaft disorder characterized by hair fragility and resulting in patchy dystrophic alopecia. Monilethrix typically transmits in an autosomal dominant mode, and it is characterized by a regular, periodic thinning of the hair shaft leading to a characteristic beaded appearance of the hair. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and presentation of monilethrix and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the etiology of monilethrix.
- Describe the typical presentation of monilethrix.
- Summarize the treatment for monilethrix.
- Identify modalities for optimizing care coordination among interprofessional teams to improve outcomes for patients affected by monilethrix.
