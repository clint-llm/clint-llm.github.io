The angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) is involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS; media item 1) and stimulates the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors are competitive inhibitors of ACE, which prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II acts as a potent vasoconstrictor that, when inhibited, can reduce blood pressure by dilating vessels and decreasing aldosterone secretion.

It is essential to understand the role of the RAAS hormonal system in depth to appreciate the therapeutic effects of ACE inhibitors and understand why this is a target for hypertensive therapy. Initially, afferent arteriole juxtaglomerular cells synthesize prorenin, which is actively cleaved to renin. Angiotensinogen produced from the liver is then cleaved by renin to form angiotensin I. The angiotensin I molecule is converted to angiotensin II by ACE. Angiotensin II is a molecule that has significant actions on various systems. Initially, angiotensin II induces vasoconstriction, which ultimately increases systemic blood pressure.

Antidiuretic hormone increases the synthesis of aquaporin-2 channels in the collecting duct inducing selective reabsorption of water. Actions of angiotensin-II and aldosterone lead to adverse cardiac remodeling. ACE inhibitors prevent adverse cardiac remodeling by reducing the concentrations of angiotensin-II and aldosterone.
