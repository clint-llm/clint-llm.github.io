The heterogeneous nature of frontotemporal dementia, as well as its relatively low prevalence compared to Alzheimer's disease, has led to difficulty defining accurate prognosis and life-expectancy figures. Survival rates feature a wide distribution depending on the subset of phenotypes being evaluated. Patients with the motor neuron disease variant have the shortest disease course at two to three years from diagnosis to death.
