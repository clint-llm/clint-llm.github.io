Hypoxia is a common disorder that we encounter every day in the hospital. However, the causes of hypoxia are multiple, and its prevalence is variable. Some of these causes are very common like pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); others are quite rare like hypoxia due to reduced oxygen tension as in high altitude or due to cyanide poisoning.
