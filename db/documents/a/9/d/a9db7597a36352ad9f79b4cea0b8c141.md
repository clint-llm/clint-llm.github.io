Obstetric anesthesia in high-risk cardiac patients is a challenging and rewarding subspecialty of anesthesia. Anesthesiologists must be well-versed in the physiological changes of pregnancy and the pathophysiology of cardiac disease to understand the best way to administer an anesthetic without exacerbating a cardiac condition. This activity reviews common cardiac conditions the anesthesiologist may encounter and highlights the anesthetic management of this fascinating subset of patients, emphasizing the interprofessional teamwork between the anesthesiologist, obstetrician, and cardiologist to deliver both the child and anesthetic in a safe manner.

**Objectives:**
- Review the physiologic changes of pregnancy.
- Summarize the goals of anesthetic management of patients with coronary artery disease, valvular disease, pulmonary hypertension, and tachyarrhythmias.
- Identify tools that can be used to help assess anesthetic risk for obstetric patients.
- Explain the effects of increased/decreased afterload amongst valvular disorders in the pregnant population.
