Since the most mobile portion of the cervical spine is the atlantoaxial joint, the main stabilization sources are the two major surrounding and stabilizing ligaments: the transverse ligament and the alar ligament. Several muscles in the posterior neck and suboccipital triangle act to stabilize the cervical vertebrae and joints as they enable rotatory, extension/flexion, and side-bending. The suboccipital muscle group, which includes the posterior occipital triangle muscles, acts as attachments, postural stabilizers, and craniocervical movement initiators. They also prevent posterior shifting of the occiput on C1. These four muscles include the rectus capitis posterior major and minor and the obliquus capitis superior and inferior.

The craniovertebral ligaments that play a role in the stability of the atlantoaxial joint are the following:

- Cruciform ligament (transverse ligament of the atlas)

- Tectorial membrane

- Alar ligaments

- Apical ligament of dens
