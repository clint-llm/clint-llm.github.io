An interprofessional team of otolaryngologists, neurologists, radiologists, audiologists, and vestibular therapists that provides a holistic and integrated approach to vestibular care can help achieve the best possible outcomes. Early recognition of patients presenting with vertigo and dizziness of central nervous system etiology is essential. Clinicians need to be familiar with bedside examination techniques that differentiate peripheral from central causes of vertigo, as well as have an understanding of how time course and associated symptoms help to narrow the diagnosis.

Collaboration, shared decision-making, and communication are key elements for increasing the chances of a good outcome. Interprofessional care provided to the patient must use an integrated pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to evaluating and managing vestibular dysfunction.
