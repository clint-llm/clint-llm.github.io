Calcium homeostasis is maintained by actions of hormones that regulate calcium transport in the gut, kidneys, and bone. The 3 primary hormones are parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (Vitamin D3), and calcitonin.

The parathyroid glands release parathyroid hormone (PTH) in response to a decrease in serum calcium. PTH acts on the kidneys to increase calcium reabsorption in the ascending loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule, and the collecting duct. The kidney also responds to PTH by increasing secretion of Vitamin D3, which in turn stimulates calcium absorption through the gut.Â  PTH acts on the bones to stimulate osteoclasts involved in bone reabsorption and the release of free calcium. All of these processes contribute to the rise in serum calcium.

Calcitonin is released by the thyroid parafollicular cells (C-cells) in response to an increase in serum calcium. Calcitonin acts on the bones to stimulate osteoblasts to deposit calcium in bones. Calcitonin also inhibits renal reabsorption of calcium, increasing urinary calcium excretion. Finally, calcitonin also inhibits calcium absorption in the intestines. These processes lead to a decrease in serum calcium.
