While the rates of limb salvage in a patient who presents with acute limb ischemia secondary to a thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysm have improved significantly over recent years, bypass patency and limb salvage rates are still considerably lower in those treated emergently vs. electively.  Therefore detection, monitoring, and elective repair are preferred.  Careful examination and identification of patients with popliteal artery aneurysms should prompt referral to a vascular surgeon for further evaluation.  Once a patient has suffered ALI an interprofessional team, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nursing, and pharmacists involved in patient care is critical to identify, evaluate and treat these patients and guide the case to the best outcomes.
