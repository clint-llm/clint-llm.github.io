Tennis elbow is the most common cause of elbow symptoms in patients presenting with elbow pain in general.  The condition tends to affect men and women equally. The annual incidence is one to three percent in the United States. Despite the condition being commonly referred to as tennis elbow, tennis players make up only 10% of the patient population. Half of all tennis players develop pain around the elbow, of which 75% represent true tennis elbow. It is more common in individuals older than 40 years of age. Smoking, obesity, repetitive movement for at least two hours daily, and vigorous activity (managing physical loads over 20 kg) are risk factors in the general population for developing this condition. The natural course of the condition is favorable, with spontaneous recovery within one to two years in 80% to 90% percent of the patients.
