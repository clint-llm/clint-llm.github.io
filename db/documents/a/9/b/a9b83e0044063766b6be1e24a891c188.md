Acute angle-closure glaucoma is best managed by an interprofessional team, including an ophthalmologist, family clinician, an ophthalmology nurse, and the pharmacist. After managing the emergency with eye drops, the patient should be scheduled for an iridectomy. Clinicians need to be aware that the other eye is also at risk for acute angle-closure glaucoma, and prophylactic surgery is recommended.

The outcomes for patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma are good following treatment. However, delay in treatment can lead to damage to the optic nerve and vision loss.
