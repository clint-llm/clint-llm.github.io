When the human embryo is 21 days old, there are three pairs of essential veins supplying and draining the embryo: the vitelline veins, the umbilical veins, and the cardinal veins. Historically, literature has suggested that the superior mesenteric vein remains in the adult human as a remnant of the regressed left vitelline vein. Recent literature has suggested that, although the vitelline vein contributes to the superior mesenteric vein, it is not the sole embryological basis of the vein. This recent 2017 study, which studied serial sections of 5- to 6-week old embryos, suggests that the superior mesenteric vein secondarily develops within the mesentery during or after regression of peripheral courses of the left vitelline vein.
