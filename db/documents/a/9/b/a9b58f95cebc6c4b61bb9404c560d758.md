Questions should involve any history of cardiac disease both current and congenital, recent cardiac procedures and current medications. Patients with Mobitz type II often present with fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, presyncope or syncope, and even sudden cardiac arrest.

Physical examination will often reveal bradycardia. Patients who have severe bradycardia resulting in hypotension and decreased cardiac output may be diaphoretic and pale. Patients who have a second-degree atrioventricular block secondary to myocardial ischemia may present with chest pain.
