ABCA12 functions as a keratinocyte transmembrane lipid transporter protein. It is a component of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter that bind and hydrolyze ATP to mediate transport of lipid molecules across extracellular membranes. ABCA12 functions to transport across extracellular membranes via lamellar granules forming the extracellular lipid layers of the epidermis, specifically the stratum corneum. Mutations in the ABCA12 transport system cause defective transportation of lipids to the stratum corneum. Consequently, malformation of the lipid barrier leads to over-accumulation of lipids in the epidermal keratinocytes known as hyperkeratosis. Intracellular accumulation of lipids in the epidermal keratinocytes gives rise to the characteristic phenotypes that are seen in HI.
