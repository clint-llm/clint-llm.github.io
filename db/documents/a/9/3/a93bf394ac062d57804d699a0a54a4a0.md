The initial step in the treatment of sacroiliac joint syndrome is similar to the management of any axial low back pain. This would be an exercise orientated spinal stabilization/stretching program. Belts applied to hold the sacroiliac joints in place have equal benefit as a home exercise program or a structured clinical exercise program in pregnancy-induced sacroiliac joint dysfunction

**Interventional treatments include the following:**

- Prolotherapy â€“ this involves the injection of substances like dextrose and platelet-rich plasma into the joint.

- Extra-articular or intraarticular steroid injections. Extra-articular or combined is favored to just intra-articular injections.

- Radiofrequency denervation. Involves lesioning the lateral branch nerves innervating the sacroiliac joint. The area of ablation increases with bipolar and cooled radiofrequency devices. The drawback is that radiofrequency denervation only addresses the posterior nerves. It does not address the anterior nerves.

- Pulsed radiofrequency. Normal radiofrequency destroys the nerves. Pulsed radiofrequency, on the other hand, creates an electrical field altering the pain transmission in the A-delta and C-fibers.

- Recalcitrant cases may require surgical intervention. However, results are not uniformly encouraging. Schutz and co-workers
