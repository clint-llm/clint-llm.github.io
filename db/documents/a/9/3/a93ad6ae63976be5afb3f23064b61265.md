The clinical manifestations guide the differential diagnosis of this condition during the presentation. Inborn errors of metabolism do not represent the most common cause of confirmed seizures or encephalopathy. Thus, the clinician should first consider acute metabolic disturbances (for example, hypoglycemia), hypoxia, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, thrombosis, neonatal epilepsy syndromes, or congenital brain malformations.

During the newborn screening, or when a clinician suspects an inborn error of metabolism, laboratory features of nonketotic hyperglycinemia may be present. The following conditions, therefore, must be differentiated from nonketotic hyperglycinemia. These include:

- Medications (particularly valproate, which is known to decrease glycine cleavage enzyme system activity)

- Artificial elevation due to laboratory sampling technique

- Starvation

- Use of glycine-containing fluids (i.e., bladder irrigation fluid)

- Transient glycine encephalopathy due to intracerebral hemorrhage or hypoxic-ischemic injury

- Transient glycine encephalopathy due to immaturity of the glycine cleavage enzyme system

- Hyperglycinuria (due to defects in the renal transport of glycine, including familial iminoglycinuria or benign hyperglycinuria)

There are inherited metabolic conditions that resemble nonketotic hyperglycinemia, but they have different pathophysiologic mechanisms, and they may require different treatment strategies. These include:

- Organic acidurias

- Pyridoxine dependent epilepsy

- Disorders of intracellular cobalamin metabolism

- GLYT1 encephalopathy

- Lipoate deficiency
