The indications for (list 1) an exercise nuclear stress test and conditions (list 2) where pharmacologic stress test is the recommended approach according to the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology,

A - Detection of coronary artery disease: symptomatic

B - Detection of coronary artery disease/risk assessment without ischemic equivalent.

C - Risk assessment with prior test results and/or known chronic stable coronary artery disease

D - Risk assessment: preoperative evaluation for noncardiac surgery without active cardiac condition

E - Risk assessment: within 3 months of an acute coronary syndrome

F - Risk assessment: Post-revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting surgery)

**AND**

**A.**The patient does not possess the capacity to perform the required exercise due to non-cardiac physical limitations (e.g., musculoskeletal injury) and/or cognitive conditions, or if the patient doesn’t want to exercise.

**B.**If the patient presents with abnormal baseline electrocardiographic measurements such as left bundle branch block, ventricular pre-excitation (Wolff-Parkinson White syndrome), and/or permanent ventricular pacing.

**C.**In the process of risk stratification for patients after acute myocardial infarction who are clinically stable at the time of presentation; and for patients who present to the emergency department with a suspected acute coronary syndrome, which has been excluded by serial clinical evaluation, electrocardiograms, and serum markers.
