While this article has noted that nociceptors are present in the viscera, skin, joints, bone, and muscle, an important consideration is that there are no nociceptors found in the CNS; this is the rationale for why awake craniotomy is possible, and not painful for the patient.

It is also necessary to appreciate that the specific sensory modalities leading to nociception differ depending on the type of tissue:

- In skin, noxious stimuli are commonly thermal, mechanical (e.g., a cut), and chemical (e.g., exogenous allergens)

- In the joints, noxious stimuli commonly derive from mechanical stress (e.g., excessive joint torque) and chemical inflammation

- In the visceral organs: mechanical distension, traction as well as chemical irritants are usually responsible for nociceptive signals

- In the muscles, strenuous mechanical exertion (e.g., blunt force, over-stretching) and chemical modalities are most common

Nociceptive signal transduction to the brain is what elicits the perception of pain. The complex biopsychosocial phenomenon of pain occurs in the cortical and subcortical regions, such as the thalamus, amygdala, hypothalamus, periaqueductal grey, basal ganglia and areas of the cerebral cortex. While in typical situations, nociception does typically precede perception of pain, there are clinical circumstances in which these interfaces do not overlap. Nociception can occur without subsequent awareness of pain, and pain can be present without a measurable underlying noxious stimulus. For instance, the former may be observable following severe trauma when victims are remarkably pain-free despite massive injury; the latter may be observable with individuals suffering from functional pain syndromes who report substantial pain without signs of physical damage.
