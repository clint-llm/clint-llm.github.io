The Association of Pelvic Organ Prolapse Support provides up to date information regarding vaginal prolapses, including anterior vaginal wall prolapse, and the POP (Pelvic Organ Prolapse) Risk Factor Questionnaire is also available on their website.

The International Urogynecological Association offers helpful informational leaflets for patients regarding cystocele and different management approaches in different languages. These leaflets should be given to women during urogynecological appointments for pelvic organ prolapse.

The American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS) offers an interactive POPQ tool designed to show different stages of vaginal wall prolapse. Its visual features could be incredibly beneficial during consultations with patients regarding pelvic organ prolapse expectations and management.

One study has shown that educational leaflets and a face-to-face conversation, when used together, provide a better understanding of the condition and improve women's knowledge of the care offered, regardless of their education.
