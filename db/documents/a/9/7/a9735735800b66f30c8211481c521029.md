Several clinical considerations apply to spinal nerve anatomy. As previously mentioned, nerves exiting the cervical spine course horizontally from the spinal cord, exiting the intervertebral foramen. On the other hand, since the spinal cord usually extends caudally to the level of the L1 or L2 vertebral levels, the more caudal nerve roots travel in a somewhat vertical fashion caudally until exiting at their respective intervertebral foramen. For this reason, In the cervical spine, any type of disc herniation would result in symptoms and or neurologic deficits at the nerve root exiting at that specific level. For example, a C5-C6 right-sided disc herniation would cause symptoms and or neurologic deficits in the C6 distribution regardless of the disc herniation being far lateral or paracentral.

In contrast, in the lumbar spine, the involved nerve root would depend on the type of disc herniation. Far lateral disc herniations will present symptoms in the distribution of the exiting nerve root, whereas a paracentral disc herniation would present symptoms in the distribution of the traversing nerve root at that level. For example, a far lateral disc herniation at the level of L4-L5 would present symptoms in an L4 distribution, whereas a paracentral disc herniation would present symptoms in an L5 distribution.
