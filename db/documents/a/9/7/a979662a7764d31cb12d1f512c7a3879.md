Allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) is the most common form of acute interstitial nephritis. It is most often caused by exposure to a drug. AIN is often associated with a sharp decline in renal function and may be related to permanent renal insufficiency. This activity discusses the etiology, pathophysiology, clinical symptomatology and outlines the interprofessional team's role in managing patients with allergic interstitial nephritis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of allergic interstitial nephritis.
- Discuss the typical diagnostic workup of allergic interstitial nephritis.
- Outline the treatment options available for allergic interstitial nephritis.
- Describe how an optimally functioning interprofessional team would coordinate care to enhance outcomes for patients with allergic interstitial nephritis by emphasizing the need for prompt diagnosis.
