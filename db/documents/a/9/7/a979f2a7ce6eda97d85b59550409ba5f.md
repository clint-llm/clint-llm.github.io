The rarity of biloma presentation means there is little evidence from large trials to guide diagnosis and management. Most evidence is in the form of case series and case reports. However, there is a consensus in the literature that bilomas, when diagnosed early and managed appropriately with percutaneous drainage or, in certain cases, surgical intervention, have a good prognosis. As there is little evidence to guide clinicians, expert opinion should be sought from gastroenterological surgeons, clinicians, and radiologists to undertake prompt and accurate diagnosis and effective management of bilomas.

The interprofessional team, including medical, nursing, and perioperative care practitioners, should be aware of biloma formation that can result from hepatobiliary surgical or endoscopic interventions.
