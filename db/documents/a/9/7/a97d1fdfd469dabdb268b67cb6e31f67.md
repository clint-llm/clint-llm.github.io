Formulating a clear treatment plan is crucial, and the responding team should consider patient, personnel, and environmental factors.

- Patient factors include predictors of a difficult airway (such as facial trauma or vomitus), patient positioning, and physiological and psychological status, including whether these can be optimized prior to the proceeding.

- Personnel factors include the relative training and experience of the clinicians who are present, the availability of backup, fatigue and stress, and familiarity with the available equipment.

- Environmental factors include the time of day, ambient light, temperature, altitude, weather conditions, proximity to other healthcare resources (such as travel time to the nearest hospital), and safety of the immediate environment (particularly in tactical or military settings).Â Monitoring of airway adjunct balloon turgor is an important aspect in relation to atmospheric pressure changes in flight. Video laryngoscopy equipment may malfunction in extremes of temperature, and backup methods should be available in case of malfunction.
