Tissue pathology in SLE can demonstrate a variety of aberrant immunologic mechanisms, including immune complex formation, autoantibody formation, and immunologically mediated tissue injury.

LE body or hematoxylin body is a hallmark of SLE pathology. It is a homogeneous globular mass of nuclear material that stains bluish-purple with hematoxylin. It can be observed in the lungs, kidneys, spleen, heart, lymph nodes, and serous and synovial membranes. They contain immunoglobulins and DNA, and phagocytes' engulfment of the LE body leads to the formation of the classic LE-cell.

Pathology from skin lesions in SLE demonstrates immune complex formation leading to tissue damage, vascular and perivascular inflammation, and chronic mononuclear cell infiltration. Acute lesions demonstrate fibrinoid necrosis at the dermo-epidermal junction and the dermis, along with liquefactive degeneration of the epidermis and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration with a T-cell predominance. Chronic lesions can also demonstrate hyperkeratosis and follicular plugging. In addition, edema and RBC extravasation can be seen in all SLE lesions. Immunofluorescence demonstrates deposition of IgG, IgA, and IgM immunoglobulins and complement components along the dermal-epidermal junction.

Vasculitis is common in SLE, and vascular lesions may demonstrate various pathologies. Immune complex deposition with an inflammatory response is the most common lesion, although it may be seen without a significant inflammatory response. Small and large vessel necrotizing vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis is less common but can be seen and differentiated from other vasculitides by immune complex deposition in the vessel wall. Thrombotic microangiopathy can present in patients with SLE and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.

In SLE, central nervous system pathology reveals small intracranial vessel involvement with thrombotic lesions with or without perivascular inflammation and endothelial proliferation. Necrotizing vasculitis is present rarely. Thromboembolism from Libman-Sacks endocarditis has been seen as well.

Cardiac pathology may include valvular involvement leading to Libman-Sacks endocarditis which is sterile verrucous endocarditis. It tends to involve the mitral valve, most commonly with vegetations seen on the forward flow side of the valve. Pathology reveals platelet thrombi, necrotic cell debris, proteinaceous deposits, and mononuclear cells. Pericarditis with fibrinous exudate is common, and pathology reveals mononuclear cells' fibrinoid necrosis and perivascular infiltration. Myocarditis can be seen as well. SLE poses a very high risk for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, and vasculitis, immune complex deposition in addition to corticosteroid use, and hypertension are thought to be contributory.

Lymphadenopathy is common in SLE, and pathology may reveal follicular hyperplasia with giant cells, plasma cells infiltration of the interfollicular zones, and necrosis of the paracortical T-cell zones. LE bodies may be rarely seen. The necrotic vessel wall shows immunoglobulin and Complement C3 deposition. Splenomegaly is also common in SLE, with pathology showing the classic onionskin lesion with has multiple concentric rings of perivascular collagen. Follicular hyperplasia and periarterial fibrosis are common.

Lupus pneumonitis can be seen in up to 10% of lupus patients. Interstitial pneumonitis, alveolitis, alveolar wall injury, and edema and hemorrhage are commonly seen in these patients. Immunoglobulin and complement deposition is seen in the vessel wall. Chronic interstitial lung disease can occur in up to 50% of these patients and is characterized by interstitial lymphoid aggregates and fibrosis, septal thickening, and type-2 pneumocyte hyperplasia. Medial hypertrophy and intimal fibrosis involving the pulmonary artery branches lead to pulmonary hypertension in SLE. Again, immunoglobulin and complement deposition can be seen in the vessel wall.

Lupus nephritis can involve the glomeruli, interstitium, tubules, and vessels with immune complex deposition in all four compartments. The World Health Organization classification criteria for lupus nephritis describes six classes of lupus nephritis, all with distinct pathological features and significant differences in clinical outcomes. This has led to a different treatment approach for each class and knowing the class of lupus nephritis before initiating treatment is vital.

- Class I: Minimal mesangial lupus nephritis

- Class II: Mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis

- Class III: Focal lupus nephritis

- Class IV: Diffuse segmental or Diffuse global lupus nephritis

- Class V: Membranous lupus nephritis

- Class VI: Advanced sclerosing lupus nephritis
