A cardiac abscess is a suppurative infection of the myocardium, endocardium, native or prosthetic valve tissue. Similar to other abscesses, it develops either by dissemination from a distant source such as bacteremia or sepsis or by direct extension of a pre-existing cardiac infective focus. This activity reviews the cause and presentation of cardiac abscesses and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the cause of the cardiac abscess.
- Describe the presentation of the cardiac abscess.
- Summarize the treatment of a cardiac abscess.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by cardiac abscesses.
