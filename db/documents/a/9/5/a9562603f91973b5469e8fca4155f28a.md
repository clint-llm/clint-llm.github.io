Pemphigus foliaceous is less common worldwide than pemphigus vulgaris. Pemphigus foliaceous affects men and women equally, and the mean age of onset is usually 50 to 60 years. However, PF has been reported in children.

Endemic pemphigus foliaceus is common in Tunisia and Brazil, where it is also commonly known as fogo selvagem. This endemic form frequently occurs in genetically related family members, although it is not contagious, and to date, spread by blood products or body fluids has not been documented.
