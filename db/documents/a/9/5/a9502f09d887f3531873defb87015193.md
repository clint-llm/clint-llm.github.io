Tenosynovitis can be divided into infective and non-infective causes. Non-infective causes include autoimmune, overuse, and idiopathic.

**Autoimmune**

There is a strong link between rheumatoid arthritis and tenosynovitis, and up to 87% of rheumatoid arthritis patients have radiological features of tenosynovitis on MRI

**Overuse**

Frequent repetitive movements can cause inflammation of the synovial sheath; this is often referred to as repetitive strain injury or overuse syndrome. A typical example is the prolonged periods working on a computer that strain the fingers, wrist, and forearm. Any prolonged repetitive movements increase the risk of tendon irritation and, thus, tenosynovitis.

**Idiopathic**

Tenosynovitis can be idiopathic; these patients have no established cause for their condition.

**Infective**

Infective tenosynovitis is caused by infective pathogens proliferating within the tendon sheaths. They reach the sheaths either by direct inoculation from injury or can spread from local or distant infections. Common organism found in infective tenosynovitis includes Staphylococcus aureus (40 to 75%) and MRSA (29%), other common skin commensals such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Eikinella in human bites, and Pasturella multocida in animal bites.
