The primary imaging differential diagnoses are holoprosencephaly and septo-optic dysplasia.

The main feature whichÂ helps to differentiate between the absence of septum pellucidum and agenesis of the corpus callosum is the presence of fused or communicating frontal horns and of the corpus callosum(which may sometimes appear thinned).

The presence of fused frontal horns, an abnormal anterior cerebral artery (azygos anterior cerebral artery), and absence of a normally developed interhemispheric fissure anteriorly in holoprosencephaly assist in differentiating it from isolated and complete agenesis of the corpus callosum.

Midline interhemispheric cysts may also be associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum. The differential diagnosis of such cysts are:

- Cavum septum pellucidum

- Cavum vergae

- Cavum velum interpositum and

- Interhemispheric arachnoid cyst

Sometimes these conditions can cause difficulty in diagnosis as a dilated third ventricle with a dorsal cyst can also appear the same. But the presence of choroid plexus in the roof of the third ventricle helps in differentiating the latter.
