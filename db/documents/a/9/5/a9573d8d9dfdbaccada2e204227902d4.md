Neonatal anesthesia requires a unique knowledge of neonatal physiology, which is different from older infants, children, or adults. Oftentimes, health professionals have limited experience caring for neonates, and neonatal anesthesia can be stressful for these practitioners. This activity reviews the physiology and background information necessary to perform safe neonatal anesthesia and describes some methods to improve interprofessional team management of those undergoing anesthesia.

**Objectives:**
- Describe common health professional concerns regarding the provision of neonatal anesthesia.
- Identify the physiology unique to neonates that must be considered to provide safe general anesthesia.
- Describe the considerations involved in setting up medications, operating room equipment, and planning for neonates undergoing general anesthesia. 
- Describe how communication and collaboration among interprofessional teams can improve transitions of care for neonates undergoing general anesthesia.
