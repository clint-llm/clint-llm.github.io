There will be 1.2 million cases of invasive cancer diagnosed in the United States this year. Half of those patients will receive radiation therapy as part of their treatment program. Serious radiation complications will occur in 5% of patients receiving radiation therapy. This represents about 30,000 cases per year.

Radiation is dosed in Rads and Grays:

1 rad = 1 centigray (cGy) = 100 ergs of energy per gm of tissue

Often, delayed effects of radiation are diagnosed when an additional insult to the tissue such as surgery or trauma occurs.
