Telangiectatic osteosarcoma is a rare high-grade malignant neoplasm, accounting for less than 10 percent of all cases of osteosarcoma. It is a rare variant of osteosarcoma characterized by distinctive radiographic, gross, and microscopic features. It is a bone-forming tumor that mimics radiologically and histopathologically aneurysmal bone cyst and giant cell tumor. Telangiectatic osteosarcoma is predominantly seen in children, adolescents, and young adults. The mean age at presentation of telangiectatic osteosarcoma is 17.5 years (range from 15 to 20 years) with a male-to-female ratio of 2 to 1. This activity reviews the workup of telangiectatic osteosarcoma and describes the role of the multidisciplinary team of health professionals working together to manage this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of telangiectatic osteosarcoma.
- Review the clinical features of telangiectatic osteosarcoma.
- Summarize the treatment of telangiectatic osteosarcoma. 
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by telangiectatic osteosarcoma.
