Subphrenic abscesses represent infected collections bounded above by the diaphragm, and below by the transverse colon and mesocolon, and the omentum. They typically arise from abdominal surgery, trauma, or local inflammation in the space between the liver, intestines, and lungs, making drainage a challenge. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of subphrenic abscess and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of subphrenic abscess.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of subphrenic abscess.
- Outline the management options available for subphrenic abscess.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination to enhance the care of subphrenic abscess and improve outcomes.
