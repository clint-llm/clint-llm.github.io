Historically it has been shown that there are three properties essential for a muscle contraction: sensitivity level to ryanodine, how rapidity of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the ryanodine receptor.

The skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling appears to depend on the conformational change denoted through the protein to protein interactions that link dihydropyridine subunits to the type 1 ryanodine receptors.

In cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, calcium ions enter the dyadic junction through the dihydropyridine receptor and activate the type 2 ryanodine receptors via calcium-induced calcium release.
