Screening of the general population is not advised but could be considered in certain patients. For instance, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend checking for orthostatic hypotension in patients with hypertension alongside type 2 diabetes mellitus or those who have hypertension and are 80 years of age and over. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) advises assessing orthostatic hypotension during the initial assessment of hypertension in all patients having diabetes mellitus and periodically at follow-up, even when there are no symptoms.

Patients and the general population should be given information about the symptoms and their association with the change of posture. They should be educated that their GP can help diagnose the condition and advise lifestyle modifications. The goal of treatments is to avoid falls in the community. Lifestyle changes will be the first-line option for treatment, but there are pharmacological options available.
