**Summary**

- Diabetes is the most prevalent risk factor for prostatic abscess formation and is found in over 50% of all patients who develop the disorder.

- The diagnosis of a prostatic abscess cannot be confirmed based solely on history and physical findings alone because the symptoms are too non-specific.

- Prostatic abscesses are relatively rare and typically present with non-specific symptoms making it difficult to differentiate from acute bacterial prostatitis and similar infections. This often results in delayed diagnosis and late treatment, which contributes to the morbidity and mortality of this condition.

- A high level of clinical suspicion, particularly in high-risk individuals and non-responding acute prostatitis patients, is required for early diagnosis, timely treatment, and optimal outcomes.

- Younger patients with a prostatic abscess should be evaluated for predisposing underlying medical conditions like diabetes.

- Patients treated for acute bacterial prostatitis who fail to improve after 48 hours, especially high-risk immunocompromised individuals, should be promptly evaluated for a prostatic abscess with an appropriate imaging test.

- Prostate imaging with either transrectal ultrasound, CT scanning, or a prostatic MRI is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

- MRI-transrectal ultrasound fusion guidance can be used to help target prostatic abscesses for transrectal aspiration.

- Large-bore needles (at least 18 gauge) are recommended for aspiration as abscess contents can be quite thick and viscous.

- Initial antibiotic therapy for any febrile male with a urinary tract infection or acute bacterial prostatitis should consider using intravenous carbapenem, third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam, amikacin, or various combinations while awaiting culture results due to the high rate of bacterial resistance to first-line antimicrobial agents. This is especially important in patients with febrile urinary tract infections after prostate biopsies.

- Abscesses smaller than 2 cm in diameter can be treated conservatively with culture-specific antibiotics but will respond more quickly if the abscess is aspirated and drained.

- Transurethral prostate resection or unroofing is the recommended treatment for larger abscesses and when aspiration therapy has failed.

- A holmium laser can be used for abscess unroofing or prostatic resection in selected cases where anticoagulation cannot be stopped or an untreated coagulopathy.

- Fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are the usual recommended oral antibiotics, as appropriate based on culture results, after the initial broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage is completed. Antibiotic therapy typically takes at least four weeks, although there is evidence that two weeks may be sufficient in some cases.

- Serial follow-up imaging studies and urine cultures are recommended to ensure complete resolution of the abscess.
