**Clinical Manifestations of COVID-19**

- The median incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 5.1 days, and the majority of patients will develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.

- The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic forms to clinical illness characterized by acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, septic shock, and multiple organ failure.

- It is estimated that 17.9% to 33.3% of infected patients will remain asymptomatic.

- Conversely, the vast majority of symptomatic patients commonly present with fever, cough, and shortness of breath and less commonly with a sore throat, anosmia, dysgeusia, anorexia, nausea, malaise, myalgias, and diarrhea. Stokes et al. reported that among 373,883 confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 cases in the US, 70% of them experienced fever, cough, shortness of breath, 36% reported myalgia, and 34% reported headache.

- A large meta-analysis evaluating clinicopathological characteristics of 8697 patients with COVID-19 in China reported laboratory abnormalities that included lymphopenia (47.6%), elevated C-reactive protein levels (65.9%), elevated cardiac enzymes (49.4%), and abnormal liver function tests (26.4%).[58] Other laboratory abnormalities included leukopenia (23.5%), elevated D-dimer (20.4%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20.4%), leukocytosis (9.9%), elevated procalcitonin (16.7%), and abnormal renal function (10.9%).

- A meta-analysis of 212 published studies comprising of 281,461 individuals from 11 countries/regions reported that severe disease course was noted in about 23% with a mortality rate of about 6% in patients infected COVID-19.

- The elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived NLR ratio (d-NLR) [neutrophil count divided by the result of WBC count minus neutrophil count], and the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio is indicative of a cytokine-induced inflammatory storm.

Based on the severity of presenting illness that includes clinical symptoms, laboratory and radiographic abnormalities, hemodynamics, and organ function. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued guidelines that classify COVID-19 into five distinct types.

- **Asymptomatic or Presymptomatic Infection**: Individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 test without any clinical symptoms consistent with COVID-19.

- **Mild illness**: Individuals who have any symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anosmia, or dysgeusia but without shortness of breath or abnormal chest imaging

- **Moderate illness**: Individuals who have clinical symptoms or radiologic evidence of lower respiratory tract disease and who have oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≥ 94% on room air

- **Severe illness**: Individuals who have (SpO2) ≤ 94% on room air; a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen, (PaO2/FiO2) <300 with marked tachypnea with respiratory frequency >30 breaths/min or lung infiltrates >50%.

- **Critical illness**: Individuals who have acute respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction. Patients with severe COVID-19 illness may become critically ill with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which tends to occur approximately one week after the onset of symptoms.

ARDS is characterized by a severe new-onset respiratory failure or worsening of an already identified respiratory picture. The diagnosis requires a set of clinical and ventilatory criteria such as chest imaging utilized including chest radiograph, CT scan, or lung ultrasound demonstrating bilateral opacities (lung infiltrates > 50%), not fully explained by effusions, lobar, or lung collapse. If there are clinical and radiologic findings of pulmonary edema, heart failure, or other causes such as fluid overload, they should be excluded before assessing it to be ARDS. The Berlin definition classifies ARDS into three types based on the degree of hypoxia, with the reference parameter being PaO2/FiO2 or P/F ratio

- **Mild ARDS**: 200 mmHg < PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg in patients not receiving mechanical ventilation or in those managed through non-invasive ventilation (NIV) by using positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ≥ 5 cmH2O.

- **Moderate ARDS**: 100 mmHg < PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 mmHg

- **Severe ARDS**: PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 100 mmHg.

When PaO2 is not available, a ratio of SpO2/FiO2 ≤ 315 is suggestive of ARDS. A multicenter prospective observational study that analyzed 28-day mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS concluded that COVID-19 ARDS patients had similar ARDS features from other causes. The risk of 28-day mortality increased with ARDS severity.

**Extrapulmonary Manifestations**

Although COVID-19, the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, predominantly affects the respiratory system, COVID-19 can be considered a systemic viral illness given the multiple organ dysfunction associated with this illness.

- **Renal manifestations**: Patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 are at risk for developing kidney injury, most commonly manifesting as acute kidney injury (AKI), which is likely multifactorial in the setting of hypervolemia, drug injury, vascular injury, and drug-related injury, and possibly direct cytotoxicity of the virus itself. AKI is the most frequently encountered extrapulmonary manifestation of COVID-19 and is associated with an increased risk of mortality.

- **Cardiac manifestations:**Myocardial injury manifesting as myocardial ischemia/infarction (MI) and myocarditis are well-recognized cardiac manifestations in patients with COVID-19. Other common cardiac manifestations include ACS, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and cardiogenic shock. A single-center retrospective study analysis of 187 patients with confirmed COVID-19 reported that 27.8% of patients exhibited myocardial injury indicated by elevated troponin levels. The study also noted that patients with elevated troponin levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias and a high mechanical ventilation rate than patients with normal troponin levels.

- **Hematologic manifestations:**Lymphopenia is a common laboratory abnormality in the vast majority of patients with COVID-19. Other laboratory abnormalities include thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, elevated ESR levels, C-reactive protein (CRP) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and leukocytosis. As previously discussed, COVID-19 is also associated with a hypercoagulable, evidenced by the high prevalence of venous and thromboembolic events such as PE, DVT, MI, ischemic strokes, and arterial thromboses that also occurred in patients despite being maintained on prophylactic or even therapeutic systemic anticoagulation. Notably, COVID-19 is associated with markedly elevated D-dimer, fibrinogen levels, prolonged prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time(aPTT) in patients at risk of developing arterial and venous thrombosis.

- **Gastrointestinal manifestations:**GI symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting, anorexia, and abdominal pain are seen in up to 1 in 5 patients with COVID-19 infection based on the results of a meta-analysis study by Tariq et al. that analyzed 78 studies involving 12, 797 patients. The weighted pool prevalence of diarrhea was 12.4% (95% CI, 8.2% to 17.1%), nausea and/or vomiting was 9% (95% CI, 5.5% to 12.9%), loss of appetite was 22.3% (95% CI, 11.2% to 34.6%) and abdominal pain was 6.2% (95% CI, 2.6% to 10.3%). The study also reported that the mortality rate among patients with GI symptoms was similar to the overall mortality rate.

- **Hepatobiliary manifestations:**Elevation in liver function tests manifesting as an acute increase in aspartate transaminase(AST) and alanine transaminase(ALT) are frequently noted in 14% to 53% of patients with COVID-19 infection.

- **Endocrinologic manifestations:**Patients with underlying endocrinologic disorders such as diabetes mellitus who contract this virus are at increased risk of developing severe illness. Clinical manifestations such as abnormal blood glucose levels, euglycemic ketosis, and diabetic ketoacidosis have been noted in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

- **Neurologic manifestations**: Besides anosmia and ageusia, other neurological findings include headache, stroke, impairment of consciousness, seizure disorder, and toxic metabolic encephalopathy. Five patients with COVID-19 developed Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) based on a case series report from Northern Italy.

- **Cutaneous manifestations:**Acral lesions resembling pseudo chilblains (40.4%) were the most common cutaneous manifestations noted in patients with COVID-19 based on the results of a meta-analysis study which included 34 published studies describing 996 patients with COVID-19. Other cutaneous manifestations described erythematous maculopapular rash (21.3%), vesicular rashes (13%), and urticarial rashes (10.9%). Notably, the appearance of a specific type was rash appeared to be dependent on the patient's age. Other uncommon rashes described were vascular rashes (4%) resembling livedo or purpura, especially in elderly patients, and erythema multiforme-like eruptions (3.7%), mostly in children.
