The clinical significance of surgical aortic valve replacement and bioprosthetic valves should be seen in the context of aortic valvular disease, which uncorrected, is dismal. Severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis carries a five-year survival rate quoted between 38 and 83%, and with the advent of symptoms, a patient faces a sudden cardiac death risk of 2% per month.

Juxtaposing this natural history against SAVR mortality rates, it is a life-saving surgery. Thirty-day mortality for isolated SAVR is quoted at 3.4%.

Survivorship is not the only clinically significant benefit. The left ventricle begins to remodel and regress its hypertrophy 18 months through 5 years after surgery, and 70 to 90% of patients with heart failure symptoms find symptomatic regression to New York Heart Association class I levels, remaining stable up through ten years postoperatively.
