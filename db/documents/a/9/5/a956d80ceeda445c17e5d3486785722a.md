# Continuing Education Activity

An interpolated flap is a 2-stage tissue flap in which the base of the flap is not directly adjacent to the recipient defect, and the flap bridges over an intervening segment of normal tissue. These flaps are used when insufficient tissue or mobility in nearby skin prevents the coverage of a surgical defect with primary closure or an adjacent flap. This activity explains and describes the technique in common anatomic areas, and describes the techniques, risks, and contraindications.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of interpolation flaps.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to interpolation flaps.
- Summarize appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of interpolation flaps.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance reconstructive techniques and improve outcomes.

# Introduction

An interpolated flap is a two-stage technique in which the base of the flap is not directly adjacent to the recipient defect. These flaps are used when insufficient tissue or mobility in nearby skin prevents the coverage of a surgical defect with primary closure or an adjacent flap.

Examples of interpolated flaps include:

- Paramedian forehead flap

- Melolabial flap

- Postauricular flap

- Deltopectoral flap

- Waltzing flaps

# Anatomy and Physiology

Interpolated flaps are often based on a named vascular supply, but frequently include more random blood supply at the distal edges. The paramedian forehead flap is an axial flap based on the supratrochlear arterial blood supply, although some authors have reported that with the abundant anastomoses in the forehead, it can be performed as a random flap. This flap can also be based on the supraorbital vessels, though this is uncommon.

After the interpolated flap is raised and inset in the first surgery, the bridging pedicle is left in place to allow neo-vascularization between the flap and recipient site. For most paramedian, melolabial, and postauricular flaps this connection is maintained for three weeks, then the pedicle is divided. For deltopectoral flaps and waltzing flaps, four to six weeks is often required before the pedicle can be divided safely.

# Indications

Interpolated flaps are used when insufficient tissue or mobility in nearby skin or soft tissue prevents the coverage of a surgical defect with primary closure or an adjacent flap. The forehead flap is especially useful on larger defects that are deep or full-thickness and located on the distal nose.

# Contraindications

The use of interpolated flaps is contraindicated in patients who are unwilling or unable to tolerate multiple-staged surgical procedures. Likewise, these procedures should be avoided in patients who cannot leave their surgical sites undisturbed, or special measures must be taken to protect the sites in these patients. Actively infected skin should not be covered with a flap or used to form a flap. When performing the paramedian forehead flap (PFF) on a patient with a forehead of low vertical height, a variation of the forehead flap or another repair method may be required to avoid transferring hair-bearing skin to the nose, or the patient must be counseled that subsequent hair removal will be required via laser or electrolysis.

Smoking is a relative contraindication to the use of staged island pedicle flaps because it increases the risk of flap necrosis. However, procedures with these flaps can usually be performed safely if fat is not thinned excessively from the undersurface of the flap. In addition, avoiding the use of previously radiated skin or a previous surgical site is generally best, unless no better repair options are available. Interpolated flaps should be performed with great care in patients who are receiving anticoagulant therapy or in patients with bleeding disorders. Consultation with the physician who prescribed the medication is prudent before discontinuing any anticoagulant therapy. Contacting consulting physicians is appropriate before operating on individuals with bleeding dyscrasias.

# Equipment

Equipment required for interpolation flaps is generally the same for other local or regional flap surgery, with a few possible additions.

Pre-operatively

- Template material (non-stick dressing material, surgical cottonoid, foil suture wrapper, or other material that allows the creation of a template or pattern for the flap). This can also be done sterilely on the operative field.

- Local anesthetic

- Surgical scrub/preparation solution

Intra-operatively

- A scalpel with #15 blade

- Toothed forceps

- Curved iris scissors, preferably serrated (to thin fat from flap if indicated)

- Shea or other fine dissecting scissors

- Skin hooks

- Suture (4-0 or 5-0 absorbable sutures and 5-0 or 6-0 non-absorbable suture)

- Gauze

- Electrocoagulation device

- A standard soft tissue or flap tray may be required for larger flaps such as the deltopectoral

- Doppler ultrasound to identify perforators/pedicle (many authors opt not to use this, but it can be helpful).

Post-operatively

- Non-adherent petrolatum-soaked gauze ribbon dressing (to place on the raw surface of the pedicle)

- Fluffed gauze or other absorbent material for post-op bulky dressing

- Adhesive dressing material or tape with elasticity

# Personnel

Interpolation flaps can generally be performed with one surgical assistant, primarily to help manage bleeding and cut suture.

# Preparation

We find that it is very helpful to show patients (and their families) illustrations when discussing interpolation flaps prior to surgery. Otherwise, it can be difficult for patients to understand what is about to happen in the surgery and in its aftermath. Serial postoperative photographs can help allay concerns and help patients understand that the final result will take time. It is also essential to explain that minor revisions or "touch-up" procedures may be indicated in the weeks or months after the initial procedure to obtain optimal results.

# Technique or Treatment

**Forehead Flap (Paramedian Forehead Flap, PFF)**

The PFF technique first was used in India as early as 700 BC. For many years, a broad midline flap was popular. In the 1960s Menick introduced the PFF, which had a much more narrow and mobile pedicle based on the supratrochlear artery. The PFF uses tissue from the forehead to repair larger, deeper defects on the distal nose (fig. 1a), and sometimes provide nasal lining.

The distal nasal defect is examined prior to designing the PFF. A template of the final defect is made, and the location and course of the supratrochlear artery can be identified by using Doppler ultrasonography or anatomic landmarks. The supratrochlear artery runs toward the scalp within 3 mm of a line drawn up from the medial canthus. Other authors have demonstrated the safety of simply taking a pedicle from the glabellar midline to 1.2 cm lateral to the midline.

**Melolabial Flap**

First used in India in about 600 BC, the medial cheek skin is an excellent color and texture match for defects on the caudal third of the nose (fig. 2a). Based superiorly, the cheek interpolation flap can be based on a cutaneous (fig. 2b) or a subcutaneous pedicle (fig. 2c). The subcutaneous pedicle has greater mobility and vascular supply than the cutaneous pedicle. For small-to-medium alar defects, an inferiorly based flap can also be used to avoid the transfer of facial hair. The cheek interpolation flap is a random flap, but it receives an ample blood supply from the perforating branches of the angular, nasal, and superior labial arteries. Small-to-medium, deeper defects on the nasal ala and nasal tip can be repaired by using the cheek interpolation flap.

**Postauricular Flap**

First described by Lewin in 1950, the postauricular interpolation flap provides good coverage and cosmesis in medium-to-large defects on the helix and adjacent antihelix, with or without the loss of small amounts of cartilage (fig. 3a). Branches of the posterior auricular, superficial temporal, and occipital arteries supply the broad pedicle of this flap. Although it is a random flap, it is rarely affected by vascular necrosis. This flap uses skin from the posterior ear and retro-auricular sulcus and retro-auricular skin to repair defects of the middle third of the auricular helix and adjacent skin.

**Deltopectoral Flap**

The deltopectoral (DP) flap was first described by Aymard in 1917

# Complications

Potential complications common to all skin surgery include infection, scarring, bleeding and disfigurement. In addition, pedicle necrosis is possible but infrequent.

# Clinical Significance

Interpolation flaps provide a method of repairing surgical defects that otherwise would be difficult, if not impossible, to repair with other reconstructive techniques.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

The surgical team should pay particular attention to control and prevention of postoperative bleeding, which is most commonly experienced in the first 24-28 hours after surgery. Salient points are outlined below.

The paramedian forehead flap is especially prone to postoperative bleeding, most commonly from the proximal flap pedicle in the glabella/brow area. This is best managed as follows:

- Careful, precise electrocoagulation must be performed at the end of the procedure.

- Apply hemostatic agents such as cellulose gel mesh and/or Monsel's ferric subsulfate solution at the base of the flap.

- When dressing the surgical site, apply extra gauze or other absorbent materal near the flap base, being careful to not apply excessive pressure (avoiding stangulation of the flap)

- Have the patient return to the office in 1-2 days for dressing change. If excessive drainage is not present, the next bandage may remain in place until next visit in 5-7 days.

Cheek interpolation flaps are not as prone to heavy bleeding, but do tend to ooze in the early postoperative period.

- Thorough, but precise electrocoagulation should be administered prior to dressing the surgical site.

- Postoperative visit in 1-2 days is preferred if possible.

- Any minor bleeding may be addressed on that visit. If no significant bleeding is noted, a less bulky dressing can be applied at that time.

Postauricular transposition flaps, when they bleed, are particularly challenging due to being located in the tight quarters behind the ear, which is draped with a flap. Prevention is key to success.

- Meticulous electrocoagulation must be applied at the end of surgery. Once hemostasis has been obtained, it is often a good idea to vigorously rub the wound with gauze to "battle test" one's work. Any additional bleeding can then be treated prior to placement of the flap.

- The unsutured portion of the pedicle is wrapped with petrolatum-saturated gauze ribbon, followed by application of non-adherent surgical dressing and then fluffed gauze over the entire surgical site. Elastic adhesive bandage is then applied to run in an anterior to posterior direction, thus pulling the ear toward the head. This takes tension off the interpolation flap and also helps apply pressure to minimize risk of bleeding.

Deltopectoral flaps and waltzing flaps can bleed from the large, wide exposed pedicles

- Tubing of the pedicle minimizes exposed raw surfaces prone to bleeding.

- Meticulous hemostasis with bipolar electrocautery at the time of elevation is essential
