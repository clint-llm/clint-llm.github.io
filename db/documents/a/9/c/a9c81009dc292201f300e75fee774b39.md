The incidence of PCG varies widely across different ethnic groups. Studies from western countries have reported incidence ranging from 1/10,000Â to 30,000 live births.

The higher incidence in particular countries and ethnic groups is related to the higher prevalence of consanguineous marriages. Approximately 65 to 80% of cases are bilateral.
