The male urethra is an area of clinical significance because of its role in both the urinary and reproductive systems. By understanding the dual role played by the male urethra, health care providers are better able to take care of their patient as a whole. Understanding that a urinary tract infection may cause pain during urination is only part of the whole patient care picture. Going further and considering that it may increase susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections or affect the ability to conceive ensures that complete patient care and counseling take place. Though a commonly overlooked organ, the male urethra is a dynamic and vital structure that is of immense clinical significance due to both its direct physical and indirect integration with multiple systems of the body.
