NMDAR is an excitatory glutamate receptor that, when activated, allows the passage of sodium and calcium ions through the channel. Activation occurs by the removal of magnesium plug, leading to glutamate and glycine binding to their respective sites.

Evidence suggests that these antibodies are produced in the CNS by antibody-producing cells that cross the blood-brain barrier.

Iizuka et al.Â postulated that NMDAR is present in high density in the frontotemporal area, which atrophies in anti-NMDAR encephalitis leading to changes in behavior, learning, and memory.
