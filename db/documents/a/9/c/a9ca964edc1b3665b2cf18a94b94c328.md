The bladder wall, which consists of three interlacing muscle layers, prevents bladder herniation during any sudden rise of the intracystic pressure. Any disturbances in its arrangement or composition will lead to the development of the bladder diverticulum. Several congenital syndromes have been linked to the development of bladder diverticula, such as Menkes syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and fetal alcohol syndrome. They usually present with multiple lesions, and chromosomal testing is advised.

On the other hand, acquired bladder diverticulum is caused by a bladder outlet obstruction, whether it is due to benign or malignant causes. These include prostate conditions, bladder neck hypertrophy, and urethral stricture.
