Previously, clinicians used fatty meals to ascertain the status of gallbladder function, however, it had its limitations and did not give the same evidence as a 60-minute infusion of CCK gives.

Despite all the guidelines and research, knowing the actual value of a GBEF in a diseased patient is not clear. All values used to defineÂ abnormal GBEF are based on healthy individuals.
