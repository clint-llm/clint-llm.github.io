The gastrocolic reflex is essentially the colonic response to food ingestion. Through a series of coordinated signals via the enteric nervous system and neuropeptides, the colon is stimulated via muscarinic pathways to contract, resulting in colonic migratory motor complexes or high amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs) which usually occur in bursts and often after food intake.
