Antipsychotic and antiemetic agents are among the most commonly described causative agents of acute dystonic reactions. Other agents including anti-malarial, antidepressants, antihistamines, and anticonvulsants have also been implicated in cases of acute dystonic reaction. Antipsychotic agents with a dopamine-blocking mechanism are commonly used to treat acute psychosis, acute agitation, bipolar mania, and many other psychiatric conditions. All currently known antipsychotic medications carry a risk of causing an acute dystonic reaction. First-generation antipsychotics including haloperidol and thioridazine are associated with a higher risk of acute dystonic reaction. Second-generation antipsychotics including olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine are associated with a reduced risk of dystonic reaction which is postulated to be due to more rapid dissociation of the drugs from the D2 receptor sites. The antiemetic agents metoclopramide and prochlorperazine are also common agents leading to an acute dystonic reaction, even leading some practitioners to co-administer diphenhydramine.
