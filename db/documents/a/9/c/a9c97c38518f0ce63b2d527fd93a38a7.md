In the United States, it is estimated that more than 300000 Latin American immigrants are currently infected with Chagas disease.T. cruzi.

The presence of T. cruzi in blood donors from U.S. samples is about 0.02%. If transfused with infected blood, approximately 10% to 20% of recipients will contract Chagas disease.T. cruzi. Trypanosoma cruzi infection can also be transmitted from organs transplanted from an infected individual.  Transmission rates vary on the organ transplanted and are approximately 18% to 19% for the kidney and 29% for the liver. A heart transplant from infected donors is contraindicated. T. cruzi reactivation can occur in up to 20% of HIV-infected patients.
