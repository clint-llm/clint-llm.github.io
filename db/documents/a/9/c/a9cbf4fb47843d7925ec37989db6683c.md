The area postrema, along with the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and the nucleus tractus solitarius form the dorsal vagal complex, where many afferent vagal nerve fibers terminate. Although damage to the area postrema may prevent vomiting in response to most emetic drugs, it does not play a significant role in vomiting induced by motion or through activation of vagal nerve afferents. There is remaining controversy regarding its role in radiation-induced vomiting. Activation of the structure leads to nausea and vomiting as it projects signals to the adjacent nucleus tractus solitarius. Therefore, this nucleus may serve as a common pathway by which various emetic inputs trigger vomiting.
