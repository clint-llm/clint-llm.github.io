Adaptive optics helps in non-invasive cellular imaging of the retina. Image acquisition and interpretation require trained personnel to capture good-quality images and interpret them. Image acquisition is time-consuming but has been reduced to 2 seconds in newer machines.

Nurses and ophthalmic photographers play a pivotal role in helping the patient maintain fixation and remain comfortable throughout the procedure. Training of allied ophthalmic personnel may also reduce the burden on treating physicians. It is necessary that all professionals involved in the process of image acquisition are educated and aware of the clinical significance of adaptive optics.
