The primary etiology of a late declaration is found to be uteroplacental insufficiency.  Decreased blood flow to the placenta causes a reduced amount of blood and oxygen to the fetus.

Some of the maternal and fetal conditions which can cause late decelerations are maternal dehydration, anemia, hypoxia, hypotension from epidural analgesia, uterine tachysystole, and placental abruption.
