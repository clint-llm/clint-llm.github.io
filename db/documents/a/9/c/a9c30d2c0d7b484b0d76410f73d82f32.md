Healthcare providers must comprehensively understand oxygenation, which involves calculating the Alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (A-a gradient) and comprehending its implications for individuals and potential diseases. Differentiating between arterial hypoxemia and hypoxia and identifying associated conditions and appropriate treatments are vital skills. Additionally, the risks associated with hyperoxemia and hyperoxia will be emphasized to highlight the potential harm caused by excessive oxygen administration.

The activity will also provide an overview of theÂ 3 common dyshemoglobinemias, with a particular focus on carbon monoxide poisoning, a condition frequently encountered in clinical settings. Furthermore, participants will learn about pulse oximeters, including their purpose and how they differ from co-oximeters, enabling healthcare providers to make informed decisions regarding oxygenation monitoring.

By engaging in this activity, healthcare providers can enhance their competency in understanding and managing oxygenation-related issues, enabling them to deliver optimal care and improve patient outcomes.
