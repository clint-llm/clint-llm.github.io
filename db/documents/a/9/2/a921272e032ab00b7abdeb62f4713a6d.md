Any woman can have vaginal bleeding. It is helpful to think of vaginal bleeding in terms of whether the patient's vaginal bleeding is normal (in other words, a woman of childbearing age) versus abnormal (pre-menarchal children and post-menopausal women). For patients of childbearing age with vaginal bleeding, it is critically important to determine the patient's pregnancy status,Â as the differential diagnosis and workup of the pregnant patient with bleeding are different from that of the non-pregnant one.
