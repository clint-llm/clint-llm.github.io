Entamoeba histolytica continues to be an important global health issue being the third leading cause of death from parasitic infections.E. histolytica infections are asymptomatic, nearly 50 million people become symptomatic, with up to 100,000 deaths yearly.Entamoeba are mostly colonized by either E. histolytica or E. dispar. E. histolytica is the pathogenic form and can cause amoebic colitis and extraintestinal amoebiasis.  E. dispar is considered to be nonpathogenic and causes no signs of disease.

Infection occurs worldwide, with a higher prevalence in countries of low socioeconomic status and poor public health. Countries with a high rate of infections include India, Africa, Mexico, and Central and South America. For example, a three-year study conducted in Bangladesh showed that 2.2% of dysentery cases were caused by E. histolytica in preschool children.

Amoebic colitis generally affects males and females of all ages equally. There are reports of increased risk of infection from gay or bisexual males due to the risk of fecal-oral contamination through oral and anal sex.
