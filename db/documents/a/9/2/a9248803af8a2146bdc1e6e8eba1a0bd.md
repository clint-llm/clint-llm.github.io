Since Turcot syndrome can present first with either polyposis of the colon or primary brain tumor, the differential list depends upon what presents first. Polyposis of the colon can be familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Fewer precancerous polyps present at an early age can be hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Mutations of the APC gene can sometimes present with cafe au lait spots, which may resemble the neurofibromatosis syndromes.
