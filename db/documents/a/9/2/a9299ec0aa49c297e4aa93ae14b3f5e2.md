Lacerations are a pattern of injury in which skin and underlying tissues are cut or torn. Healthcare providers encounter lacerations regularly. It was reported in 2005 that nearly 12% of all ER visits, or 13.8 millionÂ visits occurred for laceration care.

The clinical presentation of lacerations can be highly variable based on location, depth, width, and length. Due to this highly variable presentation, the healthcare team must have a strong understanding of the critical history and physical exam items each laceration requires.
