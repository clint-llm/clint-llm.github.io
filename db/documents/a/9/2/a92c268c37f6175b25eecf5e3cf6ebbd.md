The side effects of caloric testing are generally mild and temporary. Some patients may experience a feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear and a slight increase in dizziness or vertigo. These symptoms typically subside within a few minutes of test completion. Rarely, some patients may experience more severe side effects such as vertigo, nausea, or vomiting. Long-term sequelae are not commonly associated with caloric testing.
