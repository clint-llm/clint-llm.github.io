The primary management of chorioamnionitis is antibiotic therapy. The most common antibiotics used are ampicillin and gentamicin. Alternative antibiotics include clindamycin, cefazolin, and vancomycin in women allergic to penicillin. After delivery, the current recommendation is to administer one additional dose with a cesarean section but no additional antibiotics for vaginal deliveries. Additional broad-spectrum antibiotics may be required, depending on the clinical status.
