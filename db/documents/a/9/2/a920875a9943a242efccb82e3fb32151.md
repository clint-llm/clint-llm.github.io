The 2012 TSC consensus recommended that patients undergo lifetime surveillance to monitor for common manifestations.

As discussed, the follow-up for TSC should be comprehensive, and it commonly presents a wide variety of multi-systemic complications. The dermatologic evaluation may aid in early recognition of angiofibromas that may eventually cause cosmetic disfigurations, which may require laser therapy or surgical removal.

For renal angiomyolipomas larger than 3.5 cm, arterial embolization is recommended to avoid total nephrectomy and decrease the incidence of renal complications. Despite this effort, however, the incidence of complications, including chronic kidney disease, is similar in TSC patients who undergo partial versus complete nephrectomy.

As recommended by the 2012 consensus for tuberous sclerosis, treatment of acutely symptomatic subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA) is surgical resection.

For patients with lymphangiomyomatosis, some sources recommend follow-up with an annual pulmonary function test to monitor for lung function deterioration.
