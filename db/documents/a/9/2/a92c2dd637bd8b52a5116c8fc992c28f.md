Proper ethical approval is obtained before the collection of the lung tissue. The lung is identified, dissected en-block, weighed, and labeled. Later the lung is perfused with 10% formalin through the trachea to the physiological peak inspiration level. Underinflation or over inflation should be prevented. This helps in proper assessment without any artifacts and over/under the judgment of the tissue structure. All the lobes of the lungs are identified searched for any lesions. The tissue is washed well, fixed in formalin for almost 24 hours. Once the tissue processing is completed, it is taken to the next level of tissue embedding. The lung organ should be placed in the tissue cassette with the ventral side facing the tissue cassette. The dorsal side of the lung will be facing the open/upper side. This position guarantees the appropriate tissue section level. Post fixation tissue trimming is a crucial component to get the best sections. If the identified lesions are too big or small, they can be isolated and embedded separately. It is essential to include the sections of related lymph nodes for histological evaluation, which will help in turn to understand the extent of metastasis of the lung tumors
