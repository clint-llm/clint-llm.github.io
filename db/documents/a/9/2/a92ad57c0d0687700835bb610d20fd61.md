In reports from large cohorts of corneal graft recipients, the proportion experiencing rejection at some stage post-transplant ranges from 18% to 21%. In those graft recipients in whom rejection occurs, reported rates of successful reversal of the rejection episode range from 50% to 90%.

Subepithelial rejections have an incidence of 1%Â  and are the least common type. Endothelial rejection is the most common, with an incidence of 50%. The incidence of mixed rejection is approximately 30%. In deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty, the reported incidence of stromal immune rejection is 1-24%. As per the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) reports, the average incidence of primary graft failure in Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK) is 5%, and the incidence of mean endothelial rejection rate is 10%.

As per the AAO report of 2017, the incidence of graft rejection in Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty was 0-5.9 %, with a mean of 1.9%. The incidence of primary and secondary graft failure was 1.7% and 2.2,% respectively. Jonas et al., in their analysis, found that approximately 14% has immunologic graft rejection secondary to loose sutures and vascularization preoperatively and postoperatively.
