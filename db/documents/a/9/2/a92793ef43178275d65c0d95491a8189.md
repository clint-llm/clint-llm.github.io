Researchers have attempted to classify the stage or severity of the injuries as mild (15%), moderate (13%), and severe (70%). The results of the classification reveal some disturbing findings.

- Even mild abusive head injury causes disability greater than a severe burn.

- Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) is the sum of years of productive life lost to disability plus life-years lost to premature death. It has an estimated lifetime burden of 4.7 DALYs for mild abusive head trauma, 5.4 for moderate abusive head trauma, 24.1 for severe abusive head trauma, and 29.8 for deaths from abusive head trauma.

- On average, DALY loss for those who survived at least 30 days was 7.6 years of lost life expectancy and 5.7 years for those that lived with disability.

- The estimated abusive head trauma toll in the United States is over 70,000 DALYs.

Four variables predict abusive head trauma with 98% accuracy.

- Acute respiratory compromise before admission

- Bruising of the ears, neck, and torso

- Bilateral or interhemispheric subdural hemorrhages

- Skull fractures other than of a single, unilateral, nondiastatic, linear, or parietal variety
