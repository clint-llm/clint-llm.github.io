Chronic headache and facial pain syndromes can lead to significant disability, decreased functionality, and an increase in healthcare costs. An interprofessional approach to these patients is most effective and involves management by neurology, psychology, as well as pain management.

Diagnosis and appropriate patient selection for sphenopalatine ganglion blockade is essential. The role of identifying appropriate candidates for the procedure is generally fulfilled by neurologists and headache specialists. Additionally, the mental health implications of living with chronic pain must be considered, as well. In these patients, psychological screening is appropriate. When needed, a referral to a pain psychologist for additional support is prudent. Moreover, nursing providers play an important role during the performance of a sphenopalatine ganglion block by helping ensure patient comfort and aiding in monitoring for adverse events. Adverse events should be properly documented by the treating provider.
