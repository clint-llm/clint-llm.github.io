Acute musculoskeletal pain is one of the most prevalent complaints in inpatient and outpatient settings. Many patients receive pharmacologic treatment for these complaints. Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) allows providers to have another treatment option that is easily accessible. OMT involves manual manipulation of muscles and fascia to reduce pain and tension and help facilitate the body's own restorative functions.

Somatic dysfunction is defined as an imbalance within the musculoskeletal system. Osteopathic physicians are often taught to look for such imbalances through tissue texture changes, spinal alignment asymmetry,  limited joint range of motion, or tenderness.

Chronic findings can include ropy texture and cool skin. These findings on the physical exam can correlate to viscero-somatic reflexes, which are visceral dysfunctions presenting as a somatic finding. A typical example of this is in cholecystitis; there are typically spinal changes around the region of T5-9 due to irritation of the gallbladder. These reflexes have been extensively studied and have now been mapped out for the entire spine. Some regions of note include T1-5 for the head and neck, T2-7 lungs, T5-9 gallbladder, and small intestine. Understanding how the viscero-somatic reflexes occur gives osteopathic providers a clue where to look for somatic dysfunctions based on the patient's symptoms.

OMT involves multiple techniques to help treat symptoms and restore proper body functions. There are direct techniques such as muscle energy that require more physical force and active patient participation. Yet, there are also indirect techniques that are more gentle.

Technique choice should depend on both the provider's experience as well as the patient's demographics and clinical picture. Older patients or patients with more co-morbidities tend to respond better to indirect techniques. The overall goal of using OMT for patients is to allow the body to regulate itself, decrease pain, and improve joint mobility.

Headaches are a common complaint that could benefit from OMT, specifically suboccipital release. Headaches are amongst the leading health problems in the world. The majority of headaches are primary, which include tension and migraine headaches. Tension-type headaches have been hypothesized to be due to compression of the greater occipital nerve. These types of headaches are best treated with NSAID medications.

Migraines are also common headaches characterized by pulsating pain, which is unilateral and lasts up to three days. Migraines classicly are accompanied by nausea, light sensitivity, and noise sensitivity.

There has also been research performed on using local anesthetics to treat acute headaches. The most commonly studied is the greater occipital nerve block. This includes injecting lidocaine or bupivacaine into the greater occipital branch of the suboccipital nerve. This has been shown to decrease the intensity of acute headaches and improve patient comfort.

Neck pain is also one of the most commonly treated conditions using OMT. Neck pain is often non-traumatic and non-specific. It is estimated that upwards of 70% of adults will experience neck pain in their lifetime. Neck pain can range from musculoskeletal strain and age-related structural changes in the spine to a symptom of a system-wide neurologic condition. Since most patients with neck pain are seen by primary care physicians, it is imperative to have multimodal treatment options. It has been recommended to try conservative treatments such as NSAIDs, heat, ice, and strengthening. Therefore, OMT allows for another non-invasive treatment option for patients with this complaint.

The suboccipital release is a relatively easy technique for providers to use to help with musculoskeletal complaints such as neck pain and headaches. This technique is also versatile and can help regulate the autonomic system in the body due to manipulation of the occipital-atlanto region. This technique has been noted to regulate the parasympathetic system rather than the sympathetic system, which is targeted by the majority of osteopathic treatments. Studies have shown that this technique has improved the range of motion and balance in lower extremities of healthy and patients with pre-existing conditions due to the connection of the fascia along the entire body.
