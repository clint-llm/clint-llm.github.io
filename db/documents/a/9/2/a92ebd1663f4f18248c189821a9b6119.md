Myopia is characterized by the inability to see distant objects. Myopia results when parallel rays are focused in front of the retina when the accommodation is relaxed (figure). The global burden of myopia is rapidly increasing. In 2010 approximately 27% of the global population, or around 1.45 billion people, were affected.

Myopia can be broadly classified as pathological and spontaneous onset childhood myopia.

This rapid increase in myopia causes a large number of degenerative changes in the retina, choroid, and sclera. Thus it is termed pathological myopia. On the contrary, school-age myopia is the most common type. It has a slow course and usually stabilizes by the age of 20 years.
