Patients receiving initial (first-timeÂ­) IVIG infusions and high-risk categories should be monitored carefully for any infusion-related reactions or adverse effects. The slowest initial infusion rates are necessary to prevent any undesirable situation. The infusion should be carried out in the presence of an expert physician and in a setting well equipped to tackle any adverse reaction swiftly. Concomitant medications of the patients should be reviewed before starting IVIG therapy, for example, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).

IgG levels in blood serve as an essential yardstick to guide IVIG therapy. It is also used to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and helps to modify the IVIG course and frequency. Measuring IgG levels at different times to evaluate the peak plasma levels and trough levels can assess response to therapy. Trough levels are crucial in replacement therapy, as maintaining constant plasma level are necessary for this life-long therapeutic strategy. However, the clinical scenario dictates the true response to IVIG therapy in all circumstances.

Patients with blood types A, B, or AB should be monitored carefully for hemolytic transfusion reaction during high-dose therapy as they may contain anti-A or anti-B blood group antibodies. These patients should be followed up with a hemoglobin workup two days after the therapy.
