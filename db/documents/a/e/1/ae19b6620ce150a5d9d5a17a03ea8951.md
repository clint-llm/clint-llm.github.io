N-acetylcysteine can be administered orally, intravenously, and topically in a nebulized form. Though the topical route offered the advantage of activating the mucociliary clearance mechanism along with inducing a cough reflex, the oral route offers much better tolerability.

The recommended dose for dornase alfa is 2.5 mg administered in nebulized form 1 to 2 times a day for patients with cystic fibrosis.

Carbocisteine is administered as an oral preparation, with dosages ranging from 750 mg twice a day to 4.5 g once a day. Evidence suggests that a higher concentration of active compounds was achieved via nocturnal administration of the drug.

Erdosteine is administered orally, and the doses can range from 600 to 900 mg. However, the dose should be titrated carefully in elderly patients with chronic liver disease as an increased plasma concentration, and elimination half-life have been reported in these cases.
