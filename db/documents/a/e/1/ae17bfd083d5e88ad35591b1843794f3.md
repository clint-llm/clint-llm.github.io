There are very few contraindications for pelvic sonography. Transabdominal sonography (TAS) can be deferred or avoided in case of discomfort due to a full bladder. Transvaginal sonography (TVS) should be avoided in patients with an imperforated and intact hymen, no history of vaginal intercourse, vaginismus, significant vaginal atrophy, vaginal obstruction, secondary vaginal stenosis, recent vaginal surgery, and in cases when the patient denies consent. Sonohysterosalpingography should be avoided in active and heavy menstrual bleeding in case of suspected infection and pregnancy.
