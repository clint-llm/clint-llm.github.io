Although additional studies regarding the mechanism of action of topical corticosteroids are still necessary, topical corticosteroids, including halobetasol cream, generally have the same mechanism of action to exert their anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive and anti-mitogenic effects. Corticosteroids alter the behavior of epidermal cells, dermal cells, and leukocytes that take part in skin diseases that are proliferative and inflammatory.

Corticosteroids bind to glucocorticoid receptor proteins in the cytoplasm of a cell to form a steroid-receptor complex. In the unbound state, the receptor is cytoplasmic, but in the bound state, the complex moves into the cell nucleus and binds to DNA, changing mRNA transcription. Through this modification, corticosteroids can either increase or decrease the synthesis of proteins involved in the inflammation cascade and the immune response. Corticosteroids increase the synthesis of lipocortin, which acts to reduce the activity of phospholipase A2, which releases arachidonic acid from phospholipids and thus decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins. Corticosteroids also suppress mRNA responsible for interleukin-1 formation. Together, these actions produce anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and anti-mitogenic effects.
