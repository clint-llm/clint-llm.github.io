The incidence of T-cell lymphoma increases with advancing age. Geographic location and ethnic variability have an impact on the distribution of the disease. The usual age group of PTCL is between 55Â to 74yrs at the time of diagnosis and are more common in males. PTCL-NOS more common in North America, whereas EBV-associated lymphomas in Asia, Central, and South America.

Adult T-cell lymphoma is endemic to Japan and the Caribbean islands. ETAL is found to have an association with HLA DQ2 and DQ8, which in turn is related to celiac disease. ALK-positive ALCL and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma can be seen in younger people.
