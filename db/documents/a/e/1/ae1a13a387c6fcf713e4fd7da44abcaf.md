The coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is the treatment of choice for severe left main and multivessel coronary artery disease.

Because of the poor long term outcomes associated with SVG, other arterial conduits, including the right internal thoracic artery, right gastroepiploic artery, right inferior epigastric artery, and radial artery, came into consideration. The use of bilateral internal mammary graft has been discouraged because of its association with increased sternal infection.

The radial artery graft is easy to harvest and can be bypassed to reach the major coronary arteries; it has now gained popularity as the preferred option after the left internal mammary artery. Carpentier and his colleagues in 1973 first used the radial artery as an arterial conduit.

With modification in surgical technique and utilization of antispasmodic agents, the radial artery graft patency rate is more than 90% at both one year and five years.
