Abducens nerve palsy is a relatively common presentation. Patients often present with horizontal diplopia. However, there may be other symptoms associated with the diplopia, depending on the cause. Because of the numerous causes of this eye disorder, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, ophthalmologist, neurosurgeon, and radiologist. The ophthalmology specialty-trained nurse should assist with any surgical interventions and provide patient education regarding their condition and treatment. When a patient with horizontal diplopia is seen, prompt referral should be made to a neurologist by the nurse practitioner or primary caregiver. The overall outcome depends on the cause.
