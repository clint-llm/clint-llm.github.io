**General Laboratory Testing**

Patients with gastrointestinal tuberculosis are noted to have lower hemoglobin levels, lower serum albumin, and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.

**Mycobacterium-specific Testing**

- Gastrointestinal tuberculosis is a paucibacillary disease. Acid-fast bacilli may not be isolated from clinical specimens.

- Quantiferon testing (the standard interferon-gamma release assay test) may be false-negative in patients with extrapulmonary TB.

- The commercially available interferon-gamma release assay is reported to have better sensitivity and specificity than the traditional tuberculin skin test in the diagnosis of GI TB.

- Adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels in the ascitic/peritoneal fluid have been reported to be a good diagnostic marker.

- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for M. tuberculosis on clinical specimens can be used as an adjunct for initial diagnosis but should not be used for follow-up.  This is because it cannot differentiate between living and dead M. tuberculosis. Thus, it can remain positive even after the completion of anti-TB treatment and the death of the bacteria.

- Another new molecular technique involves a real-time assay using fluorescence resonance energy transfer hybridization probes. In patients with clinical and radiological suspicion of TB but negative AFB smear and culture, it was reported to have a positivity index of 36%.

- A molecular probe detects mutations in genes associated with rifampicin (rpoB gene) and isoniazid resistance (katG and inhA genes). In one study, it was found to have ≥99% sensitivity and specificity for detecting multidrug resistance (MDR) TB resistance, with faster results and positive results even in AFB smear-negative samples.

- The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends a test that amplifies the genomic DNA by PCR assay for diagnosis of TB, with results provided within 2 hours. It combines a nested PCR technique with automated amplification and detects M. tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance gene. The rifampicin resistance gene functions as an accurate surrogate marker for MDR TB. Initial studies reported high sensitivity and specificity, with one meta-analysis showing no difference in performance with either fresh or frozen samples.

Thus, to summarize, most of the mycobacterial-specific testing modalities for GI TB have high specificity but low sensitivity.

**Imaging**

1. Computed  tomography (CT) scan:

CT scan is the modality of choice in evaluating the extent and type of GI TB.

Ascitic fluid has high protein and cellular content, creating areas of high attenuation on CT imaging. Other manifestations of peritoneal TB include plastic/fibrous type, which is seen as mesenteric and peritoneal thickening with loculated ascites. Another type is nodular/dry peritoneal TB, characterized by mesenteric nodular thickening and fibrous adhesions with a carcinomatosis appearance.

CT enterography is a newer, non-invasive technique for diagnosis and to assess the healing of TB lesions.

2. Ultrasound

Ultrasound-guided aspiration may help in the diagnosis of solid-organ lesions.

**Gastroenterology Procedures**

Colonoscopy may detect asymptomatic cases when performed for other reasons.

**Therapeutic Trials**

In some cases, when diagnostic testing is unyielding, but the clinical suspicion is high, patients are started empirically on antituberculosis therapy (ATT). Response to therapy is proposed as a criterion for the diagnosis of GI TB.

The accuracy of therapeutic trials, as reported in different studies, has varied between 16% to 29%.
