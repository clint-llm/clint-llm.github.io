Hypercalcemia is a common metabolic abnormality seen in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Depending on the serum calcium levels, hypercalcemia is categorized either as mild when levels are between 10 to 12 mg/dL, moderate when levels are between 12 to 14 mg/dL, or severe when levels are more than 14 mg/dL. Approximately 40% to 45% of the serum calcium is attached to albumin, and serum calcium levels may fluctuate based on the serum albumin levels. Therefore, ionized or free calcium levels should be measured when hypercalcemia is suspected. This activity describes the pathophysiology of malignancy-related hypercalcemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of malignancy-related hypercalcemia.
- Review the presentation of a patient with malignancy-related hypercalcemia.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for malignancy-related hypercalcemia.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with malignancy-related hypercalcemia.
