The underlying cause of hypoxic blackouts is usually multifactorial. It generally stems from poor situational awareness, inadequate safety measures, and poor technique. The average person can hold their breath for between 30 to 90 seconds.

Additionally, hypoxic blackout directly links to hyperventilating or taking a series of short breaths before going underwater.
