The prognosis of patients with restrictive lung disease varies greatly depending on the etiology of pulmonary restriction. Patients with pulmonary restriction from a pleural effusion should experience resolution of symptoms upon drainage, and pregnant patients should also recover upon delivery. Intrinsic pulmonary restriction from cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is associated with excellent long term outcomes when treated. Patients diagnosed with IPF have a median survival of 3-5 years after diagnosis.****Due to the diverse nature of restrictive lung disease, all efforts should be made to obtain a specific diagnosis once pulmonary restriction has been confirmed.
