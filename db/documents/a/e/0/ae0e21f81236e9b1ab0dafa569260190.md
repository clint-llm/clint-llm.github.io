A practitioner should take a patient's history and focus on the following:

- Onset and distribution of lesions

- The severity of pruritus (e.g., keeping patient awake at night)

- Family and/or personal history of the atopic triad

- Presence of contact allergens

- The presence of triggers including allergens (e.g., dust mites, animal dander), hot showers/sweating, soaps, fragrances, food hypersensitivities, and synthetic fabrics such as polyester.

Classic physical exam findings depend on age group. Infants develop edematous papules and plaques that may have vesicles or crust on the scalp, face, and extensor extremities. Infants rarely have atopic dermatitis lesions affecting the diaper area but may be susceptible to other causes of diaper dermatitis such as candida or seborrheic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis children classically have less exudative patches and plaques on antecubital and popliteal fossae; adults have chronic lichenified (enhanced skin markings) lesions that have a predilection for hands. Individual lesions may also be further classified into acute (edematous, erythematous papules and plaques and/or vesicles/crusting), subacute (erythema, scale, variable crusting), or chronic (thick plaques with lichenification and scale) stages.
