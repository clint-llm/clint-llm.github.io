Many factors can interfere with various methods of diagnosis of alpha-thalassemia. They can be broadly categorized as pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical factors. Any lapse in following standard protocols during collecting, transporting, or storingÂ various samples like blood or chorionic villi samples can interfere with the method and affect the results. During analysis, the buffers, reagents, or stains used, if not properly stored at their optimum temperature, can yield false results. The levels of various Hb variants can decrease in the blood sample if kept for long storage, especially at high temperatures, and can affect the results of HPLC or CE analysis.

Techniques like NGS, allele-specific PCR, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification are not feasible for widespread use in diverse populations due to their high cost, need for greater maintenance, etc.
