**Skin**

**Epidermis**

- Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is best treated with shave excision at the junction of the dermis and epidermis.

- Dermatosis papulosa nigra (DPN). These lesions are often observed as removal may cause scar formation and dyspigmentation. When treated, snip excision, light curettage or electrodesiccation, and laser treatment are all options that reduce the risk of dyspigmentation. Cryotherapy is not recommended as it increases the risk of hypopigmented scar formation.

- Inverted follicular keratosis is best treated with biopsy and complete excision. It is likely to recur if the lesion is not completely removed.

- Verruca vulgaris recommended treatment is surgical excision or cryotherapy.

- Molluscum contagiosum treatment options include excision, cryotherapy, or curettage. Home treatments such as salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide are not recommended to be used close to the eye. The secondary follicular conjunctivitis resolves after these virus shedding lesions are removed from around the eye.

- Squamous papilloma (acrochordon or skin tag) is removed by surgical excision or shave biopsy.

- Epidermal inclusion cysts (epidermoid cysts). Excision or marsupialization. Milia, which are small epidermal inclusion cysts, are often surgically removed with a "deroofing" technique using a needle to remove the epidermis directly above the cyst.

- Cutaneous dermoid cyst. Treatment is similar to epidermal inclusion cysts.

- Keratoacanthoma is best excised with 4 mm margins due to the association with squamous cell carcinoma. In cosmetically sensitive areas, larger lesions should be removed using  Mohs micrographic surgery.

- Cutaneous horns need to be removed using a complete excisional biopsy so that malignancy of the underlying cause can be ruled out.

Melanocytic: Much research has been done to estimate the risk of malignant transformation of melanocytic skin lesions. Risk is assessed based on the patient history and pathophysiology of the lesion. The risk for scarring and a poor functional or cosmetic outcome is higher on the eyelids than elsewhere on the body. This is why it is recommended to refer to an oculoplastics specialist for evaluation and possible biopsy. If a biopsy is done, the histopathology of the lesion will determine whether additional treatment is needed.

- Ephelis (freckles) and solar lentigo lesions are not thought to transform into melanoma. However, these lesions are a sign of increased light exposure and, as such, indicate an increased risk of light-induced skin malignancies.

- Lentigo simplex is not thought to have malignant potential and can be observed or removed with chemical peels, surgical excision, skin laser, or cryotherapy.

- Solar lentigo is not thought to have an increased rate of skin malignancy and can be observed or treated with skin lightening agents such as Cysteamine 5% cream as well as skin laser or cryotherapy. These treatments can leave scars.

- Nevi
- Large congenital nevi (over 20 cm in size) have an estimated 4 to 20% risk of malignant transformation.
- Acquired

- In one study of 144 patients with Spitz type nevi, 6 developed melanoma over nine years (0.5% annual incidence).
- Melanocytic nevus. Treatment of junctional, intradermal, and compound nevi is not indicated as the transformation rate to melanoma is low. If removed, junctional nevi are less likely to recur as the nevus cells are more superficial than intradermal and compound nevi.

- Non-dysplastic nevi (junctional, intradermal, and compound) have a relatively low risk of transforming melanoma. One study reported a rate of transformation of 1 in 200,000 of any non-dysplastic nevus for men and women under the age of 40 years. However, over 40, the risk of transformation goes up, and by age 80, the risk of any mole converting to melanoma is 1 in 3000 for males and 1 in 11,000 for females.
- The presence of dysplastic nevi is a strong risk for melanoma. In one study, subjects with one dysplastic nevus had a 1.6 increased odds ratio of melanoma, while patients with over four nevi had a 10.5 odds ratio. The risk of a single dysplastic nevus transforming is still quite low and estimated to be about 1 in 40,000 for females and 1 in 30,000 for males.

**Adnexal Lesions**

- Internal and external hordeolum is best treated with hot compresses and topical and oral antibiotics such as cephalosporins and sulfonamide/folic acid inhibitor combination drugs. The presence of visible purulent material within the lesion, also called a "point" or pustule, significant pain, and eyelid edema and erythema (indicating a concomitant preseptal cellulitis) require the use of an oral antibiotic to avoid further spread and prevent orbital cellulitis. In the case of a recalcitrant hordeolum, a referral within 2 or 3 days for incision and drainage is indicated. External hordeola are often at the base of an eyelash. In this case, epilation of the lash may allow for the draining of the lesion. The practitioner is cautioned against trying to express a hordeolum, especially when a clear point is not visible, as this is extremely painful and may cause preseptal cellulitis.

**Hair Follicles**

- Trichoepithelioma: different treatments have been reported that include laser treatment, skin transplantation, electrodesiccation, imiquimod, and retinoic acid application.

- Trichofolliculoma is recommended to be removed using simple surgical excision.

- Trichilemmoma is recommended to be removed using a shave biopsy to provide a better cosmetic outcome.

- Pilomatrixoma is recommended to be surgically excised with wide surgical margins to avoid recurrence.

**Sweat Glands**

- For apocrine and eccrine hidrocystomas, electrocautery, trichloroacetic acid, and excision are preferred over incision-and-draining as removing the cyst wall is necessary to prevent a recurrence. For multiple lesions, CO2 laser and, in one report, botulinum toxin A injection were used.

- Trichilemmal cysts are recommended to be completely excised to avoid recurrence.

- Syringoma can be removed with a CO2 laser, excision, dermabrasion, trichloroacetic acid, electrocautery, electrodesiccation, and cryotherapy. Since the lesion is deep in the dermis, it often can not be treated completely, and recurrence is common.

- Pleomorphic adenoma is recommended to be completely excised with a few millimeters of margin to avoid recurrence.

- Eccrine spiradenoma is recommended to be surgically excised. Multiple lesions can be removed with a CO2 laser.

**Accessory Lacrimal Glands**

- Complete excision of pleomorphic adenoma and oncocytoma is recommended.

**Sebaceous Glands**

- Chalazion and internal hordeolum are best treated with hot compresses, lid hygiene, topical and oral antibiotics including azithromycin and doxycycline, and antimicrobial lid wipes containing hypochlorous acid or tea tree oil, steroid injection, and surgical excision. In one study, 85 % of patients received non-surgical treatment; incision and curettage were performed in 15% of eyes and intralesional steroid injection in 0.55% of eyes.

- Cyst of Zeis, sebaceous cyst, sebaceous gland hyperplasia, and sebaceous gland adenoma are all best excised and sent for histopathological analysis.

**Stromal Lesions**

Xanthelasma: Surgical excision, CO2 laser, topical 100% trichloroacetic acid. The recurrence rate is high. One study determined a 40% and 60% recurrence rate after primary and secondary excision, respectively.

**Vascular Lesions**

- Up to 90% of pyogenic granulomas can be treated with topical corticosteroids. Topical beta-blockers such as timolol have also been shown to be effective in causing regression of the lesion. If the lesion is small enough to be observed, it may spontaneously regress. For those lesions that do not respond to topical steroids, a referral for complete excision is recommended.

- To determine the extent of the capillary hemangioma, imaging in the form of ultrasound, CT, or MRI imaging when deeper lesions are suspected should be done. Capillary hemangiomas can be associated with Kasabach-Merrit syndrome, Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, PHACES syndrome, and Maffucci syndrome. A referral for evaluation for these syndromes is indicated. When a capillary hemangioma causes mechanical ptosis, treatment for amblyopia may need to be implemented. Testing for exophthalmos and strabismus should be performed as well. Since, in 80% of cases, the hemangioma will have regressed by age 8, management is often to avoid sequelae such as amblyopia, strabismus, optic nerve compression, and tissue necrosis as well as cosmetic considerations. First-line treatment is systemic beta-blockers or oral and intralesional corticosteroids. Surgical treatment can include CO2 and other laser photocoagulation treatments for more superficial lesions. Radiation and surgical excision are options as well.

- Treatments for angiofibromas of the face include superficial ablation and vascular ablation with lasers, as well as shave excision and electrodesiccation. Sirolimus ointment has been used successfully in reducing the severity of facial angiofibromas. If angiofibromas are associated with tuberous sclerosis, referrals to the appropriate specialists will be necessary.

- Nevus flammeus (port-wine stain) in the case of Sturge Weber syndrome (SWS), the patient needs to be evaluated for ocular sequelae associated with SWS that includes glaucoma and choroidal hemangiomas. Eye findings to look for are Haab striae, corneal edema, buphthalmos, tomato-catsup fundus, skin-, conjunctival-, episcleral- and choroidal-hemangiomas, heterochromia irides, retinal vascular tortuosity, and arteriovenous communications. In young patients, this may require an evaluation under anesthesia. Medical and surgical glaucoma treatment may need to be implemented, and pulsed dye laser photocoagulation for cosmesis, as this has shown a marked increase in quality of life for affected individuals.

**Neurogenic**

- Patients with plexiform neurofibroma of the eyelid will need eye exams at least every six months until the age of eight to evaluate for rapid worsening of the eyelid ptosis, glaucoma, strabismus, proptosis, amblyopia, optic nerve edema or atrophy, visual field loss, afferent pupillary defect, and exposure keratopathy. Amblyopia is the most significant concern for vision loss in these patients. The frequency of evaluations after the age of 9 can be less than every six months, depending on the severity of the disease. Communication with other specialists in the medical team is essential. The timing of surgical intervention depends on the level of ophthalmic complications.

- Solitary neurofibroma management includes testing for neurofibromatosis and observation or surgical excision if medically indicated.

- Schwannoma surgical management consists of complete excision with a clear margin to allow histopathological analysis and prevent a recurrence. Recurrence of incompletely excised lesions has been more aggressive. Since vestibular schwannoma is associated with neurofibromatosis type 2, a referral for testing for neurofibromatosis may also be made.

**Lipomatous**

- Lipomas can be observed or surgically removed when needed. Care should be taken to remove the whole capsule to reduce the chance of recurrence.
