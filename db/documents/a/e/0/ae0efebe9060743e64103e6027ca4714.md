Infection with Mycobacterium avium complex may be asymptomatic. Colonization of the pulmonary tract without infection is unproven in the nontuberculosis mycobacterial species diseases. Contamination of a sputum sample is possible therefore more than one sputum sample is required. Symptoms are non-specific, and the differential diagnosis is wide, microbiologic isolation is required to make the diagnosis. As per recommendations of the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), a minimum evaluation of a patient suspected of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection should include a radiologic, microbiologic and clinical evaluation. Clinically exclusion of pulmonary tuberculosis is important. Clinical evaluation of underlying diseases, risk factors for mycobacterial diseases, and the ability to tolerate prolonged multidrug therapy should be undertaken.

While the Mycobacterium avium complex is not a part of the microbiome of the lung, there is no need to treat all patients with sputum positive for Mycobacterium avium complex. Selecting patients for therapy is a clinical calculus combining, microbiologic, radiologic and clinical criteria. The therapy is long, and there is significant potential for adverse drug reactions.
