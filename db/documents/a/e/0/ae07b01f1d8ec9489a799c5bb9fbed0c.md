Ophthalmia neonatorum is a type of conjunctivitis seen in the neonatal period, occurring in 1% to 12% of neonates. This condition commonly gets transmitted during vaginal delivery, and it correlates with severe complications such as corneal ulceration and perforation, which can potentially result in permanent blindness. Due to the significant morbidity of this disease, new guidelines were issued by the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force regarding antibiotic use in all newborns to prevent ophthalmia neonatorum. These guidelines were put in place to reduce vertical transmission of gonococcal infection, which can occur in up to 50% of the cases when prophylaxis is not given.

In 2010, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed the guidelines for the management of sexually transmitted infections, in which prophylaxis with erythromycin ointment (0.5%) or azithromycin solution 1% (if erythromycin not available) is recommended as a part of the routine newborn care for ophthalmia neonatorum prevention, considering that is effective and inexpensive. In these guidelines, routine screening and appropriate treatment, including the partners of all pregnant women during the first trimester is also a recommendation. During the third trimester, screening follow-up for those women considered high risk (multiple sex partners, 24 years of age or younger, etc.) is advisable. Silver nitrate effectively prevents gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum; however, its use has been discontinued due to the high risk of developing chemical conjunctivitis in approximately 50% of the cases.
