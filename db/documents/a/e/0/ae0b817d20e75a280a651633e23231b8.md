Patients should be instructed to avoid caffeinated beverages for at least 12 hours before the study. This is because caffeine interferes with the action of vasodilatory medications that may be administered during the study. Caffeine also affects cerebral blood flow and can negatively influence cerebral SPECT imaging. The patient should also avoid dipyridamole and other phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitors for at least 48 hours to avoid a synergistic vasodilatory effect, which may produce an unsafe drop in blood pressure.
