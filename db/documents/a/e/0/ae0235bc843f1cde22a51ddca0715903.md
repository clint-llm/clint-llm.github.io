**Surgical Correction of Ptosis Aims to Achieve the Following**

- correct positioning of the eyelid as determined by the preoperative assessment.

- the symmetry of both eyelids

- minimal or no lagophthalmos

- minimal or no corneal exposure

**Timing of the surgery:**If there is no risk of amblyopia, it is reasonable to wait until the child is 3 to 4 years old. This will allow a better assessment of the levator function. In the presence of significant ptosis, which interferes with visual development and in the presence of bilateral ptosis, surgical correction should be undertaken promptly.

**The levator function mainly decides the choice of the type of surgery required for the correction of ptosis**.

A levator advancement should correct a mild degree of ptosis (1-3 mm) with good levator function (10 to 15 mm ). The Fasanella Servat procedure, where a part of the conjunctiva and the tarsal plate are resected, is less frequently used because of the destruction of normal tissues (tarsus and conjunctiva).

In cases where the levator function is very poor (<4 mm), frontalis sling surgery is the surgery of choice. The eyelids are suspended directly from the frontalis muscle with autogenous or non-autogenous materials. This procedure allows the upper eyelids to be lifted indirectly with brow elevation.

Indications of frontalis surgery

- Severe ptosis with poor levator function (less than 4 mm levator function)

- Severe Marcus Gunn jaw winking syndrome

- Blepharophimosis syndrome

- Oculomotor palsy

- Traumatic levator injury with levator function less than 4 mm

Materials used to perform a frontalis sling:

- Autogenous fascia lata

- Banked fascia lata

- Silicon rods

- Mersilene mesh

- Assorted suture materials like Goretex

When the levator function is good (6 mm to 10 mm), levator resection is the treatment of choice.

- Everbursch Approach: An anterior skin approach to the levator aponeurosis and muscle.

- Blaskovics Approach: The levator is approached via the conjunctiva.

In mechanical ptosis cases, removal or correction of the mechanical component that is depressing the upper eyelid should be performed.

Aponeurotic advancement is performed in the presence of aponeurotic dehiscence.

**Marcus Gunn Jaw-Winking Syndrome**

The ideal treatment for the complete elimination of the jaw-winking syndrome is bilateral excision of the levator muscle followed by bilateral frontalis suspensions. When frontalis slings are inserted without the levator muscles' extirpation, the procedure is sometimes called the "Chicken-Beard procedure."
