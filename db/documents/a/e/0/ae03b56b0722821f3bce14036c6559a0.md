The inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), the most distal branch of the abdominal aorta before its bifurcation, ends as the superior rectal (hemorrhoidal) arteries. This artery supplies the rectum and upper third of the anal canal. The rectum receives additional vascular contributions from the middle rectal artery, which is a branch of the internal iliac artery, supplying the distal rectum and proximal anal canal. The inferior rectal artery comes off the internal pudendal artery, which is also a branch of the internal iliac artery. Collaterals between the inferior and superior hemorrhoidal arteries exist at the level of the dentate line, making the incidence of rectal ischemia low.

Venous drainage of the rectum accompanies the arterial supply. Blood drains from the rectum in either the systemic or portal system. The majority of blood from the rectum drains into the superior rectal vein that drains into the portal system through the inferior mesenteric vein. The distal portion of the rectum and anal canal has drainage through the middle and inferior rectal veins into the internal iliac veins via the pudendal vein.

The lymphatic drainage of the rectum follows the arterial supply as well. The rectum drains into the superior rectal lymphatics to the retroperitoneal inferior mesenteric lymph nodes. Additionally, the middle and inferior hemorrhoidal vessels have lymphatic drainage into the internal iliac nodes. Below the dentate line in the anal canal, the lymph drains to the inguinal nodes.
