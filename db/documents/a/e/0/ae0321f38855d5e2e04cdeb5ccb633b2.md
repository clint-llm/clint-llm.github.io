Even though fosinopril is a relatively safe and commonÂ means to treat hypertension, monitoring the treatment and reporting any adverse reactions under an interprofessional healthcare team is essential. Clinicians that tend to prescribe this class of ACE inhibitors include but are not limited to primary care clinicians, internal medicine specialists, and cardiologists. Before using fosinopril, the patient should be aware of all the possible side effects and receive instructions to avoid high potassium diets. To ensure the patient is maximizing their benefits from fosinopril, clinicians should schedule regular follow-ups and document the patient's response. A pharmacist should have involvement at the outset of therapy, verifying appropriate dosing and dose titration, checking for potential interactions, and counseling the patient on possible adverse effects. Nursing will follow up with the patient, monitor therapy progress, and answer patient questions, alerting the prescriber to any concerns. With these interprofessional strategies, fosinopril's use can achieve better patient outcomes with fewer adverse effects. [Level 5]
