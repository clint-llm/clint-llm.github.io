2-octyl cyanoacrylate is one of the most commonly used commercially available wound adhesives. Current indications include any easily approximated surgical incision wound or properly cleaned lacerations from trauma in dry areas and have minimal friction. Additionally, 2-octyl cyanoacrylate is approved for use in combination with subcuticular sutures for deeper or higher tension wounds, though its use in higher tension areas should be limited to immobilized areas. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, administration, and adverse effects of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate for wound closure and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the effective use of this substance.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications and contraindications for the usage of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate.
- Explain how to use 2-octyl cyanoacrylate for wound closure.
- Summarize the risk of wound infection associated with 2-octyl cyanoacrylate for wound closure with that of suture repair.
- Review how an interprofessional approach to care can improve the application of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate and render therapy more efficient and effective.
