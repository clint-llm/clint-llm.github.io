The practice of management skills applied in the healthcare setting indirectly affects the patients. When healthcare managers manage the teams of the organization well, positive work culture (and work climate) become reinforced. In turn, the motivated staff at all levels of the organization increase their work performance as reflected through the optimal clinical (or health) services they provide to their patients. Therefore, the belief is that well-managed staff can lead to well-managed patients. Hence, sound management (and leadership) skills can impact positively on patients’ health outcomes.

The evolving healthcare system has been indicating that there is an increasing requirement for cultivated interprofessional relationships spanning across all health professions and subspecialties.  Physician-Hospital alignment strategies have been receiving increasing levels of attention in the literature given the already identified critical nature of optimizing these relationships.
