Severe hypoglycemia may induce seizures, coma, or other neurological impairments and requires immediate hospitalization and medical attention.

Hypoglycemia without loss of consciousness may present with drowsiness, confusion, profuse sweating, agitation, abdominal pain, and tachycardia.

Intentional overdose in large quantities may be managed with activated charcoal if caught exceptionally early. In the asymptomatic patient, a watch-and-wait approach with repeated blood glucose measurements for 24 hours may suffice. It is important to note that despite the short duration of action, overdose with repaglinide may lead to more prolonged hypoglycemia.

In unintentional excessive ingestion, prompt feeding may be sufficient to alleviate symptoms. In more severe cases, glucagon subcutaneous or intramuscular injection is recommended (1 mg for weights greater than 25 kg). Failure to respond to glucagon should be addressed with a 20% glucose intravenous infusion.
