Portal hypertension is increased pressure within the portal venous system. It is determined by increased portal pressure gradient (the difference in pressures between the portal venous pressure and the pressure within the inferior vena cava or the hepatic vein. This pressure gradient is normally less than or equal to 5 mmHg. A pressure gradient of 6 mmHg or more between the portal and hepatic veins (or inferior vena cava) suggests the presence of portal hypertension in most cases. Portal hypertension is the most frequent cause of hospitalization, variceal bleed, liver transplantation, and death in patients with cirrhosis. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of portal hypertension and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the most common causes of portal hypertension.
- Review the complication caused by portal hypertension.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for portal hypertension.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure patients affected by portal hypertension receive appropriate management and education thereby improving their outcomes.
