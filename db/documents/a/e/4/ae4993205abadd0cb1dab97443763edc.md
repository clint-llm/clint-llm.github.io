Zinc is an important cofactor in the body and is essential for normal function; however, increased levels of zinc can become toxic. There are three types of exposure that can lead to toxicity: inhalation, oral, and dermal. Most cases are acute toxicity, so treatment plans are minimal such as chelation therapy or prescribed medication. This activity outlines the evaluation of zinc toxicity and explains the role of the interprofessional team in treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the typical presentation of a patient with zinc toxicity.
- Describe the management considerations for patients with zinc toxicity.
- Outline the treatment options for patients with zinc toxicity.
- Summarize the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with zinc toxicity for the best patient outcomes.
