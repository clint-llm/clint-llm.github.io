Peritoneovenous shunt placement is performed as a long- term treatment for chronic refractory ascites. The shunt used most commonly is the Denver shunt, comprised of two silastic tubes connected by a compressible pump. This activity reviews the treatment of refractory ascites and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for peritoneovenous shunt.
- Describe the technique of performing peritoneovenous shunt procedure.
- Outline the potential complications of the peritoneovenous shunt.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the peritoneovenous shunt procedure and improve outcomes.
