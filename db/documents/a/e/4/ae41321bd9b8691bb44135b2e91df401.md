Vitreous hemorrhage may present with symptoms of floaters, mild haziness, which patients often tend to ignore initially. They usually present when vision has considerably deteriorated, when surgery remains the only option. Early consultation with an ophthalmologist or optometrist may reduce the risk of unnecessary complications and surgery. In cases where observation is decided, the patients need to understand the need for maintaining a strict head end elevated position and be compliant. Very often, the cause is some uncontrolled systemic disease. Educating the patient regarding the need for proper control of disease is necessary.
