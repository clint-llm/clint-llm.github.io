The deep peroneal nerve has both motor and sensory components. The motor component is responsible for innervating the anterior compartment of the lower leg which includes the tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, and peroneus tertius muscles.

The deep peroneal nerve has 2 sensory components that innervate small portions of the dorsal foot. An articular branch of the lateral terminal branch is responsible for providing sensory information to the ankle joint and the sinus tarsi. The medial terminal branch of the deep peroneal nerve provides sensory information to the web space between the first and second toes.
