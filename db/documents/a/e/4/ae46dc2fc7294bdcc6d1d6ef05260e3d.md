**Classifications of Bursae**

Bursae are primarily synovialÂ bursae that are constant in their location and predictable. They tend to form during embryonic development. The other, less common type is the adventitious bursa, which tends to form in response to repeated forces or friction originating within the body or from outside the skin.

**Adventitious**

The adventitious bursae exist in soft tissues as a way to relieve repeated friction from natural movements or unusual and damaging pressure; this is the only bursa that is non-native. These bursae cover bony prominences throughout the body and are commonly called accidental bursae. An example of an adventitious bursa that develops relative to hallux valgus on the inner big toe base is a bunion.

They are histologically characterized by mucoid and myxomatous degeneration of connective tissue and do not have the true endothelial intima lining.

**Synovial**

The most bursa in the human body are synovial bursae, which are most common near large joints in the extremities, are located between tissues, and are defined as thin, synovial membrane sacs.

Their lining is a cellular intima layer, which secretes the lubricating fluid.
