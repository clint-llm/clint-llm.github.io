The clinical significance of phthalate toxicity depends largely on the type of individual phthalate, route of exposure, the quantity of exposure, and temporal duration of continued exposure. Phthalates and phthalate metabolites have been detected in most bodily fluids, including serum, urine, breast milk, and semen. Phthalate toxicity is most closely tied to developmental dysfunction of the endocrine and reproductive systems; however, multiple other organ systems are also affected.

Once in the bloodstream, phthalates are capable of transplacental transition, which can lead to dysfunction of fetal development and other toxic effects on the embryo.

**Testicular Function**

Phthalate toxicity leading to testicular dysfunction has been demonstrated in rat cell cultures, showing apoptosis of both Sertoli and Leydig cells after exposure to DEHP and dibutyl phthalate (DBP). Prenatal exposure of rats to phthalates also resulted in malformed seminiferous tubules, dysgenesis of the testes, and abnormal morphology of Leydig cells, ultimately resulting in reduced testosterone biosynthesis.

**Ovarian Function, Fertility, and Gestational Effects**

Ovarian dysfunction from phthalate exposure has been demonstrated in rodent cell cultures, disrupting the normal follicular growth pattern, early reproductive senescence, and more rapid depletion of ovarian reserve.

Various phthalates have also been demonstrated to cross the placental barrier and reach the umbilical cord and amniotic fluid, thus having a potential effect on the developing fetus.

**Metabolic Effects**

Phthalates have also been studied to be associated with insulin resistance, a known risk factor leading to the development of type-2 diabetes mellitus.

Another mechanism by which phthalates disrupt the endocrine and metabolic axis is through interference with the protein sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Exposure to various phthalates has been associated with lower SHBG levels, with one study showing lower SHBG concentrations in pregnant women using cosmetics and hair products compared to those not using these products.Â Specifically, high exposure to MEP, a metabolite of DEP, was shown to be a prominent factor related to low SHBG levels. Although the exact mechanism has not been elucidated, it is hypothesized that phthalates may directly bind SHBG, in addition to disrupting the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis that plays a role in regulating sex hormone levels and steroidogenesis in the body.

Thyroid function was also shown to be affected by phthalate exposure, which may affect metabolic function and contribute to obesity. Higher concentrations of phthalate metabolites have been associated with decreased free and total thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). One study in mice showed that exposure to the phthalate DEHP induced hypothyroidism, leading to increased adipogenesis and weight gain.

Various studies have linked phthalate exposure to obesity, including one study showing the exposure of LMWP to be associated with obesity in male children, as well as HMWP exposure to obesity in all adult groups. In this study, reverse causation could not be ruled out since those with increased fat mass may store higher amounts of phthalates, resulting in increased urinary excretion.

**Risk of Breast Cancer**

There have been controversial data regarding the relationship between phthalate exposure and the risk of breast cancer. One meta-analysis that analyzed urinary metabolites of many phthalates showed a possible association between exposure to the phthalates mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) and mono-2-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) with breast cancer. All other phthalate metabolites analyzed showed no statistical association.

**Respiratory Effects**

The effect of phthalates on the respiratory system showed one urinary phthalate metabolite, MBzP, to be associated with the prevalence of childhood self-reported asthma. Further studies are needed to determine the extent of the significance of these findings.
