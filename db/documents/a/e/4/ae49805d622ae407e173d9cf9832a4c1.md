Managed care penetration in the US is associated with higher rates of preventive services utilization, such as vaccinations and disease screenings in the general population. Also, Managed care penetration linked with a reduction in utilization of inpatient procedures, especially among Medicare Advantage (MA) beneficiaries, resulted in lower inpatient complications and reduced mortality rates. American Hospital Association conducted a cross-sectional study to examine the effect of Managed Care among Medicare patients and privately insured patients vs. fee-for-service patients.

The results showed that among managed care privately insured patients, declining inpatient mortality rates were observed for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure (CHF) compared to FFS patients. However, patients in Medicare managed care had similar outcomes when compared to Medicare FFS. Among state-wide Medicaid programs, 77% of Medicaid patients were enrolled in some form of managed care, and results shown were better quality outcomes in preventive services, maternity care, patient experiences when compared to Medicaid programs without managed care plans. The effect of managed care penetration on overall hospital costs turned out to be cost-effective as per previous studies. For instance, in California, with 40% of managed care penetration in market share, there was an evident 25% slower growth rate in hospital costs.
