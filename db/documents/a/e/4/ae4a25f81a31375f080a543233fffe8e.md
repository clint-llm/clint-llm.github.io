In severe cases, where patients have an atypical or severe presentation of the disease, they may benefit from a neurologist evaluation. Radiologists and pathologists may assist in diagnosing, as imaging and ultimately nerve biopsies may help clarify ambiguous presentations or rule-out other potential etiologies. In conjunction with these specialists, primary care physicians, endocrinologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, neuromuscular/physiatry specialists may aid in recognition, recovery, physical therapy/rehabilitation, tight glycemic management, orthotic device procurement, and patient education, to ultimately provide an interprofessional approach to improve patient outcomes.
