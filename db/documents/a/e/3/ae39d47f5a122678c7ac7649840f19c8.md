Syncope is the most common symptom, usually experienced during exercise and high emotions (50% of the genetic variant). Syncope during swimming, including immediately after diving into the water, appears to be relatively specific for LQT1. Other presentations include near-syncope, cardiac arrest, or seizures. In 10% to 15% of individuals, death is the first sign. Also, certain types of Long QT syndrome have an additional non-cardiac phenotype. For example, hearing loss is present in Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. Skeletal abnormalities, such as short stature and scoliosis are present in LQT7 type (Andersen syndrome). Also, cognitive and behavioral problems and immune dysfunction may be seen in those with LQT8 type (Timothy syndrome).
