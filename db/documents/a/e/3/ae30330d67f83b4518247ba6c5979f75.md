Patients typically present with elbow pain and swelling following a fall. If the fracture is displaced there may be marked deformity at the elbow with a palpable gap. The hallmark of an olecranon fracture is the inability to extend the elbow against gravity.  The examiner must ensure that the patient is not using gravity to mimic active elbow extension. This is typically done by abducting the shoulder to 90 degrees, supporting the upper arm, and asking the patient to straighten their elbow from this position.

It is important to examine the entire involved extremity for associated injuries or lacerations suggestive of an open fracture.

Associated injuries of the coronoid process, radial head, or proximal radioulnar joint (Monteggia fracture) may be present and evaluated for on radiographs.

The examiner should palpate the elbow as well as the adjacent joints. A complete upper extremity neurovascular examination of the involved extremity should be conducted. The ulnar nerve is most at risk due to its superficial position on the medial aspect of the elbow.  When the injury occurred secondary to a high-energy mechanism, the practitioner should be vigilant to avoid missing injuries that may be unrecognized by the patient due to the distracting nature of the olecranon fracture.  It is prudent to question the patient about other sources of pain and examine all four extremities for crepitus, deformity, or pain with range of motion.
