The toxicity of corticosteroids accounts for one of the most common causes of iatrogenic illness in patients on chronic therapy.  No specific reversal agent exists for corticosteroids. Their effect in excess is manageable by gradual taper and addressing the particular complication (e.g., hyperglycemia, infection, hypertension). If steroid therapy is in place for less than one week, patients can usually stop without tapering. For dosing lasting one to three weeks, tapering should depend on the clinical conditions for which the patient took the medication. Rapid and complete withdrawal can lead to adrenocorticotropic hormone suppression and flare of the underlying disease. Courses over three weeks should have a quick taper to physiologic doses, then slow weaning should follow while evaluating the adrenal function. Long-term, high-dose suppressive therapy can lead to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis for as long as nine to twelve months following withdrawal.
