Presentation of acute mitral regurgitation is typically quite dramatic with sudden clinical and hemodynamic decompensation from discrete etiology such as papillary muscle rupture from myocardial infarction, blunt trauma to the chest,Â perforation of the mitral leaflet, etc.

The majority of patients suffering from chronic MR are asymptomatic, but serial quantitative assessment and follow-up of a patient with asymptomatic MR have shown a significant impact on the survival and clinical outcome.
