Heterotopic ossification (HO) is defined as the formation of mature, lamellar bone in soft tissues where bone does not normally exist. HO is commonly seen following trauma or surgical intervention in periarticular soft tissue and is commonly associated with injury to the hip. The three primary causes can be grouped into traumatic, neurogenic and genetic etiologies.

HO from trauma includes fractures, dislocations, and operative procedures such as open reduction-internal fixation (ORIF) or total hip arthroplasties (THA). The compartment of the hip most involved is the abductor compartment

Neurogenic causes include spinal trauma and head injuries and again occur around major joints. The relationship between neurohumoral factors and the development of HO is poorly understood but is centered around stimulation of osteoblasts to lay down ectopic bone

The last main etiology includes genetic disorders, such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, progressive osseous heteroplasia, and Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. These are rare conditions that lead to the development of HO early on in life, resulting in debilitating morbidity
