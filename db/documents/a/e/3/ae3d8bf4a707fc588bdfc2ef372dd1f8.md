The involvement of the pituitary becomes significant in Sheehan syndrome, which is related to ischemic pituitary necrosis as a result of massive postpartum hemorrhage. The pituitary gland, during pregnancy, has increased volume because of the lactotroph hyperplasia. However, this enlargement takes place in the limited space of the sella turcica, and as a result, the pituitary gland is susceptible to ischemia. There are also suggestions that specific antibodies contribute to the pathogenesis of Sheehan syndrome. In these cases, the onset of symptoms takes place many years after postpartum hemorrhage.
