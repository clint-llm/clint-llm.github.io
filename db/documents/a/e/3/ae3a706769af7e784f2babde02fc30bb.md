A 26-year-old male with a history of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and previous suicide attempts intentionally ingested 90 tablets of an unknown substance. His wife found him and called EMS. He had several witnessed tonic-clonic seizures and also vomited en route to the emergency department (ED). He was endotracheally intubated. Despite standard treatment with benzodiazepines and a propofol infusion, he continued to seize and was transitioned to a midazolam infusion. His seizures ceased. He also required dexmedetomidine for additional sedation and persistent tachycardia. Per the patient's wife, the patient was not taking any prescribed medications and did not have any recent injuries or infections.
