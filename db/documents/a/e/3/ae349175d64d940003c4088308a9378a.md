Patients with hypertensive urgency are at increased risk for long-term morbidity and mortality. The one-year mortality for those experiencing an episode of hypertensive urgency is approximately 9%. Untreated hypertension is notorious for increasing mortality risk and is often described as a silent killer.

The long-term prognosis of patients with hypertensive urgencies or emergencies is not favorable. A retrospective study done on 670 adults who presented with severely raised blood pressure showed that 57.5% suffered from hypertensive emergencies. 98% of patients with hypertensive emergency and 23.2% with hypertensive urgency were hospitalized. Median survival was found to be 14 days for those who had neurovascular emergencies and 50 days for patients who had cardiovascular emergencies.
