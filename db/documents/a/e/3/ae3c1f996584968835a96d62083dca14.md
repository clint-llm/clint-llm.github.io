Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH) is a benign, rare condition that was initially used to describe the skin eruptions observed in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients receiving systemic chemotherapy. It can be considered a reactive disorder and is commonly associated with malignancies that include other leukemias, Hodgkin lymphoma, and solid tumors. Since its introduction in 1982, neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitisÂ is frequently described with other neutrophilic dermatoses. these are a group of skin disorders characterized by normal neutrophilic infiltrates in the predominantly dermal portion of the skin, with no identifiable source of infection.
