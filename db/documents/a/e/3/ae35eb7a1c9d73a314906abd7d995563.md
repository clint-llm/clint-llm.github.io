Substance P is a neuropeptide in the tachykinin peptide family and contains 11 amino acids, H-Arg1-Pro2-Lys3-Pro4-Gln5-Gln6-Phe7-Phe8-Gly9-Leu10-Met11-NH2.

Substance P is an amphiphilic molecule that appears to interact with the phospholipid bilayer of plasma membranes. However, research has found no cellular process linked to its amphiphilic nature.
