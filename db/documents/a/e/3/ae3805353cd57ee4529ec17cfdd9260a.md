Selenium deficiency can present with many varying symptoms.  Selenium deficiency is also more likely to be prevalent in a community as a whole, rather than just sporadic cases. Typically if it is suspected, either serum or “scalp hair” or nail selenium levels may be checked, and there is a good correlation between the 2 levels. The advantage of using the latter is that in endemic regions, it is easier to collect scalp hair samples by unskilled workers, rather than to try to collect blood samples to check for selenium levels. The other parameters that can be checked are the G-Px activity in plasma (G-Px3), in erythrocytes (G-Px1), in thrombocytes (G-Px1), or whole blood (G-Px1 and G-Px3). The concentration of selenoprotein P (SePP) is also a good laboratory gauge of selenium status in patients.
