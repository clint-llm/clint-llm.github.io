Research has recognized over 300 catalytically active zinc metalloproteins and more than 2000 zinc-dependent transcription factors involved in the gene expression of various proteins.

Zinc can treat acute and chronic diarrhea by inhibiting three out of the four main intracellular pathways of intestinal ion secretion, including cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), calcium, and nitric oxide.

The biochemical, immunologic, or virologic basis for the mechanism of action of zinc in the treatment of the common cold remains unclear. A leading hypothesis is that Zn2+ is a competitive inhibitor of ICAM-1 in both rhinovirus particles and the nasal epithelium.

Zinc aids wound repair by acting as a cofactor in several transcription factors and enzyme systems (i.e., zinc-dependent matrix metalloproteinases) that augment auto-debridement and keratinocyte migration. Zinc protects against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins through the anti-oxidant activity of cysteine-rich metallothioneins.

Zinc decreases the concentration of copper by inducing the synthesis of a copper-binding ligand in mucosal cells; this sequesters copper, making it unavailable for serosal transfer in the GI tract.
