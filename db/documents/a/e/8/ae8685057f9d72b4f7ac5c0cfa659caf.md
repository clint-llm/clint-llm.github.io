Urticaria is characterized by pruritic pink-to-red papules and plaques typically with central pallor. These can vary in size and shape as the plaques coalesce together. Urticaria is fleeting, and each wheal remains for fewer than 24 hours without any residual ecchymosis or pigmentation.

Secondary changes from scratching may be evident on examination of the skin, including excoriations, erosions, and hemorrhagic crust.

Concurrent angioedema occurs in up to 40%, characterized by subcutaneous or submucosal edema affecting non-dependent areas, most commonly lips, peri-orbital, genitals, and extremities. Patients complain of discomfort or pain rather than pruritus. This may take longer to resolve - up to 72 hours - and is the primary manifestation of CSU in 10% of patients.
