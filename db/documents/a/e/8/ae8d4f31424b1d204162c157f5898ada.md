Management options for patients will need to be highly individualized based on a number of factors; the cause of the glottic insufficiency; whether the patient’s glottic insufficiency is likely to improve with time (for example unilateral vocal cord paralysis will improve in many cases which may negate the need for surgical intervention); the patient’s social and occupational factors. For example, a vocal cord palsy patient may be trialed on voice therapy, or have temporizing vocal cord injection augmentation as a first intervention while a professional voice user with a large glottic gap may require the more permanent option of laryngeal framework surgery. These factors are complex, and management of patients with glottic insufficiency is challenging. As such it requires an inter-professional and holistic approach to optimize patient management. As well as the involvement of specialist laryngologist and voice therapist in the patient’s care, other health professionals whose expert knowledge may be necessary for the patient’s care include neurologists, dieticians, nutritionist, nursing staff, psychologists and pharmacists.
