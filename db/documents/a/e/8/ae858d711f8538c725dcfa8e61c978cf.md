The most frequent long-term complication in patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia is a chronic lung disease, with bronchiectasis being the most common condition. According to a study, 46% of patients with XLA were suffering from chronic lung disease. And its prevalence was age-related, being higher in patients above 20 years of age.

Patients with XLA can handle childhood viral infections due to preserved T cell function, but they are still more prone to certain enteroviruses, namely Polio, Coxsackie, and Echo viruses. These viruses can cause chronic meningoencephalitis leading to slowly progressive neurological impairments such as ataxia, paresthesia, loss of cognitive skills, developmental regression, and sensorineural hearing loss. In other cases, it presents with fever, headaches, seizures, and/or paralysis. Enteroviral infections involving muscles and skin may cause dermatomyositis like syndrome, presenting as an erythematous rash with peripheral edema.

Patients with XLA have a lower risk of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases in comparison to other primary immune deficiency disorders. They present with symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, etc. Long term survivors also have an increased rate of malignancy with a 30 times higher incidence of colorectal cancer.

There is also a risk of malignancy, such as lymphoproliferative disorders, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer.
