Screening for ROP is of crucial importance for premature or low birth weight (BW) infants. Guidelines from the American Academy of Ophthalmology, American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus state that infants born ≤30 weeks gestational age (GA) or ≤1500 g BW should be screened for ROP. Depending on the clinical course, larger infants May benefit from screening as well.
