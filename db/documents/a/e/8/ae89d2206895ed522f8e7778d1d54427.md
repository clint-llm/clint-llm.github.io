Etanercept is a biologic TNF inhibitor commonly used to control ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Etanercept is a soluble receptor that binds both TNF-alpha and TNF-beta to inhibit the inflammatory response in joints and skin that is characteristic of these autoimmune disorders. The drug can be used as a monotherapy or taken with other immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate.

Clinicians can use etanercept for both approved and off-label indications.
