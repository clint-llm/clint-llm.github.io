Acute pain in the chest and thoracic region that often results from local trauma or surgical procedures may result in significant morbidity and mortality.

Anesthesiologists are often consulted to manage interpleural analgesia for acute pain. Coordination between the consultant and the consulting physician is important in the management of these patients. Cardiothoracic or trauma surgeons may need to be involved in the management of these patients if complications from the procedure have developed. Additionally, the radiologist may be able to provide further insight into the pathology that is causing the pain and determine if complications occur, for example, pneumothorax, hemothorax, among others. Nurses also play a crucial role in routinely monitoring these patients for acute changes in clinical condition, assessing the adequacy of pain control, and observing for development of complications from interpleural analgesia. Nonetheless, management of interpleural analgesia requires impeccable communication between all involved clinical personnel, including physicians, nurses, and pharmacists.

After a comprehensive review of current literature, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, and the American Pain Society established a clinical practice guideline for the management of postoperative pain. The guideline did not recommend the use of interpleural analgesia for the management of pain after thoracic surgery.
