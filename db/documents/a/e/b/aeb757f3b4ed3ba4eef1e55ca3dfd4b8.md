Though the most common manifestation of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is the rash exanthema subitum, also called roseola infantum, HHV-6 has been known to establish a more threatening infection in immunocompromised individuals. Interprofessional team members should recognize that further evaluation for this condition is warranted when an immunocompromised patient presents with behavior changes with or without a rash. Early recognition will lead to expedited treatment, improved patient care, and prevention of adverse outcomes. This activity reviews the diagnosis, management, and treatment of human herpesvirus 6 and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of human herpesvirus 6. 
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with human herpesvirus 6.
- Summarize treatment guidelines for patients affected by human herpesvirus 6 infection. 
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients infected with human herpesvirus 6, especially those at risk for a more severe infection.
