Studies have shown that dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans demonstrates the chromosomal translocation t(17;22)(q22;q13)  between chromosome 17 and chromosome 22, which is thought to be key in the tumor’s pathogenesis. The chromosomal translocation leads to the fusion of platelet-derived growth factor-beta polypeptide gene (PDGFB) and collagen type 1A1 gene (COL1A1). The gene rearrangement upregulates PDGFB, resulting in overproduction of PDGF, continuous autocrine activation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRb), cellular proliferation, and tumor formation. This chromosomal translocation is present in over 90% of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. In cases without the COL1A1/PDGFB translocation, a different chromosomal translocation still involving PDGFB on chromosome 22 has been demonstrated.
