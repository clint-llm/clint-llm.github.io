The goal of treatment is the prevention of complications associated with infection (e.g., PID, infertility), to decrease the risk of transmission, and the resolution of symptoms. Treatment for uncomplicated urogenital chlamydia infection is with azithromycin. Doxycycline is an alternative, but azithromycin is preferred as it is a single-dose therapy. Other alternatives include erythromycin, levofloxacin, and ofloxacin.

Chlamydial infection and gonococcal infections often coexist. In men, the co-treatment for urogenital gonococcal infection should occur on the basis of the detection of the organism on NAAT or gram stain. In women, the gram stain is less helpful due to the possibility of normal Neisseria species colonization within the vaginal flora. Therefore, co-treatment should be dependent on an assessment of individual patient risk and local prevalence rates.

Patients should have partners identified and tested. They should also be counseled on high-risk behaviors, avoid sexual activity for one week after initiating therapy, and should consider testing for HIV.

Verification of cure should occur three weeks after treatment completion, and retesting should be performed three months after treatment.

If symptoms persist after treatment, consider coinfection with a secondary bacterium or reinfection.

Follow up culture is not recommended in most people but may be considered in a pregnant female.
