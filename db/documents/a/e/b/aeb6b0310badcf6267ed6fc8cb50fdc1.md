Children with ECC need to be examined in detail. Poor dental health often extends beyond the oral cavity. As caries can affect the childâ€™s mastication and phonetics, the ability to eat, drink, speak, or gain acceptance of peer groups may impact their physical, mental, and psychosocial development.A thorough dental examination is carried out with intraoral periapical radiographs or a panoramic x-ray. Pulp status should also be established to develop an appropriate treatment plan. Clinicians may also require other investigations like a complete blood count (CBC).
