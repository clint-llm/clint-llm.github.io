As medicine advances, more critically ill patients are surviving longer ICU admission. Many of these patients will have difficulty weaning off the ventilator or will complain of profound weakness after extubation despite appropriate treatments and medical intervention. Although not often performed, the gold standard for the diagnosis of critical illness myopathy remains electrodiagnostic testing, which includes nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography. This activity outlines and reviews the importance of electrodiagnostic testing in the evaluation of critical illness myopathy (CIM) and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for electrodiagnostic testing in critically ill patients.
- Describe the nerve conduction study findings in a patient with critical illness myopathy. 
- Review the electromyographic findings in a patient with critical illness myopathy. 
- Outline the importance of communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with critical illness myopathy.
