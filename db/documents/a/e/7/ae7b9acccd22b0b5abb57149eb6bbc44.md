After applying a sterile dressing over a closed eye and copious ultrasound gel, the high-frequency ultrasound transducer should be placed over the eye with little to no contact with the sterile dressing in the transverse plane. The sonographer's hand should be placed on a non-compressible surface (the patient's nose, midface, or forehead) to avoid direct globe pressure, discomfort, and distortion of anatomy. Small movements nasally and temporally followed by caudad and cephalad should be executed to capture the optic nerve sheath in the same plane as the AC, PC, and lens to avoid obliquing the image. Once the anechoic streak posterior to the optic disc is visualized, the image should be captured, and measurements can be taken from the saved image. The optic nerve is relatively cylindrical and symmetric, theoretically making a single view acceptable for measurement.

However, the dogma of "one view is no view" should be applied in all ultrasonographic studies, and another image should be captured in the sagittal plane. After measuring 3 mm posterior to the globe, use electronic calipers to measure the distance of decreased echogenicity between the hyperechoic demarcations of the sheath. A large discrepancy between images captured in separate planes should alert the sonographer to possible artefactual or off-axis errors, and they should rescan in both planes. Once optimal images are captured in two planes, the mean should be determined to estimate the true ONSD. Both eyes should be scanned, and bilateral measurements should be considered.

If difficulty in acquiring an image during the ultrasound study is encountered, one should try to center the focal ultrasound beam transversely through the plane of the lens. The contralateral eye can be assessed to estimate the location and orientation of the pupil on the studied eye. Increasing the volume of an ultrasound gel buffer can improve the quality of the image. Increasing the gain can help enhance discernment between the actual nerve sheath and nerve. Color Doppler can help visualize the retinal artery near the posterior globe as a reference point.

Once the optic nerve sheath diameter is determined, it requires evaluation in the overall clinical context. Earlier studies have most commonly used a cutoff of 5.0 mm with excellent sensitivity as well as positive and negative predictive values, but cutoffs correlating to elevations of ICP greater than 20 mm Hg have varied from less than 5 mm to greater than 6 mm in different papers. One meta-analysis of 12 studies that compared optic nerve sheath values to CT evidence of elevated ICP yielded a specificity of 92.3% and a sensitivity of 95.6% utilizing a 5 mm cutoff in adult patients.

**A-mode Vs. B-mode Scan**

A-mode scan is ideally advocated owing to the 'blooming' artifact during the B-mode scan.

**Point of Measurement of ONSD**

Three millimetersÂ posterior to the globe corresponds to the bulbous (wide) portion of the optic nerve and is the site of maximum pressure changes within the nerve.

The basic steps in measuring ONSD using ocular ultrasound can be summarized as follows:

- Supine positioning of the patient.

- The high-frequency linear probe (which allows better contrast between the nerve and the retro bulbar fat) is placed on the closed upper eyelid after applying a gel.

- Acoustic output needs to be adjusted ALARA ('as low as reasonably achievable) principle to protect the lens and retina.

- The probe needs to be adjusted to display the entry of the optic nerve into the globe.

- ONSD measurement needs to be ideally taken 3 mm behind the eye globe. The point where the optic nerve and the ophthalmic artery cross is also recommended.

- Multiple values for each eye and then averaged to reduce the risk of deviation.****

- Same equipment, methodology, window, contrast, and brightness are advocated.****
