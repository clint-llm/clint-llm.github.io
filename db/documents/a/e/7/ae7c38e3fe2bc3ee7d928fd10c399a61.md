LHBT instability almost always occurs in association with other shoulder pathologies. In the chronic stages of LHBT tendinopathy, the soft tissue pulley system can become compromised, which can eventually lead to LHBT subluxation and/or dislocation. While this would be the closest clinicalÂ entity considered as primary LHBT instability, the consensus in the literature attributes LHBT instability to primary injury to the soft tissue pulley system (including the subscapularis and/or supraspinatus) or secondary to proximal humerus fractures that compromise the osseous integrity of the bicipital groove itself.
