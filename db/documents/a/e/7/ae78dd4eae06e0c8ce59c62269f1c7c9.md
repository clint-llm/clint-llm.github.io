Acral erythema is also known as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia, hand-foot syndrome (HFS), or Burgdorf reaction. It is caused by classic chemotherapeutic agents and newer molecular targeted therapies and characterized by intense, painful erythema of the palms and soles that can progress to vesicles or bullae. This activity discusses the proper identification of the condition and adequate management. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia.
- Describe the exam findings typically seen in patients with palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia.
- Describe the potential complications of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia.
- Describe the modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia.
