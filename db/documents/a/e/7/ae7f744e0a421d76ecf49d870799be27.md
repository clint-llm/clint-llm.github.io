There are no contraindications to this procedure. Various factors limit the usage of adaptive optics in routine practice.

A small area of the retina is imaged, and the time required for imaging is significantly more. It may be difficult for uncooperative and anxious patients. Incorporating eye-tracking software may help acquire better quality information in these patients. Analysis of acquired images is manual and may be laborious and time-consuming. Automated interpretation or development of artificial intelligence software may simplify grading. The enormous cost of the equipment and size has limited its location in research labs. More compact hardware will make its installation and operation practical.
