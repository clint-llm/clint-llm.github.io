Dapsone is indicated for a variety of conditions, both dermatologic and non-dermatologic. The FDA-approved indications are leprosy and dermatitis herpetiformis. The non-FDA-approved indications include a wide range of dermatoses and malaria and Pneumocystis (carinii) jiroveci prophylaxis and treatment. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of dapsone, pertinent for interprofessional team members in treating conditions where dapsone is indicated.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanisms of action of dapsone.
- Summarize the indications for dapsone, both FDA and non-FDA approved.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of dapsone.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve patient outcomes for whom dapsone is appropriate to treat their condition.
