The Hoffman-Tinel sign is one provocative test that can help clinicians diagnose entrapment neuropathies as well as peripheral nerve regeneration following nerve injury. While the Hoffmann-Tinel sign is a valid measure in clinically diagnosing nerve entrapment, it should not supplant a thorough patient history and further clinical evaluation. Electrodiagnostic testing, such as electromyography and nerve conduction studies, can be used to confirm objectively quantify the diagnosis of a compression neuropathy or nerve injury.  If the clinical exam and electrodiagnostic testing are not definitive, magnetic resonance imaging can be an option to visualize nerve pathology in detail.  Given the cost, time, and quality of other diagnostic tests, MRI use is rare for this purpose.
