Dental anxiety is the most common reason patients opt for or undergo conscious sedation. This sedation can also be used to provide safe treatment for those with medical conditions exacerbated by stress, such as epilepsy or hypertension. Treatment for patients who suffer from conditions causing dyskinesia, such as Parkinson disease, can be challenging for both the operator and the patient. Sedation can be an effective way of controlling involuntary movements. Further indications are increased surgical complexity and the age of the patient.
