The true incidence of metabolic diseases is difficult to determine given the lack of uniform, universal screening at birth. Individual incidence of specific GSD types is further complicated due to overlap in symptoms and the lack of standardized specific testing in most areas of the world. A study evaluating the incidence of inborn errors of metabolism in British Columbia in the 1990s reported that the incidence of these diseases was approximately 30 cases per 100 000 live births.
