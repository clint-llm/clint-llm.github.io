Vemurafenib is a potent, highly selective inhibitor of mutated BRAF V600E. Inhibiting the kinase activity of BRAF prevents signaling from the mitogen-activated pathway (MAP) kinase pathway and blocks the proliferation of malignant cells that harbor this specific mutation. The medication does not have activity in wild-type BRAF cells, unlike other drugs like sorafenib which can block both wild-type and mutated BRAF.
