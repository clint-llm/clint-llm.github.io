Determining gestational age is one of the most critical aspects of providing quality prenatal care. Knowing the gestational age allows the obstetrician to provide care to the mother without compromising maternal or fetal status. It allows for the correct timing of management, such as administering steroids for fetal lung maturity, starting ASA therapy with a history of pre-eclampsia in previous pregnancies, starting hydroxyprogesterone caproate (Makena) for previous preterm deliveries.
