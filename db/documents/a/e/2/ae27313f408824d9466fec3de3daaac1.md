Anthrax is an infectious disease caused by an encapsulated, spore-forming, gram-variable bacteria called Bacillus anthracis. This commonly presents with nonspecific prodromal symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting, and sweats which progress to dyspnea and ultimately respiratory failure and hemodynamic collapse. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of anthrax and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of anthrax.
- Describe the pathophysiology of inhalational, cutaneous, gastrointestinal and injection anthrax.
- Summarize the use of vaccines in the management of anthrax.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to be vigilant in evaluating the possibility of bioterrorism in multiple patients presenting with the symptoms of anthrax.
