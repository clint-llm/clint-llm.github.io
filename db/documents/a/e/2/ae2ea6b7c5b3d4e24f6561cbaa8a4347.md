Autoimmune hepatitis can present in a variety of ways from an asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes noted on routine lab tests to fulminant hepatitis. Clinical manifestations of autoimmune hepatitis depend on how acute liver disease is at presentation, the stage of inflammation, or the complication of liver cirrhosis. The most common features of autoimmune hepatitis are fatigue, malaise, jaundice, abdominal pain, and sometimes, arthralgias.

Features of a failing liver such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal hemorrhage are a rare initial presentation of autoimmune hepatitis. Only a few patients present with acute liver failure. Autoimmune hepatitis may present concurrently with other autoimmune diseases like Graves disease, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, type I diabetes, ulcerative colitis, hemolytic anemia, and immune thrombocytopenia. Specifically, autoimmune hepatitis is present in approximately 10% of individuals with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1.

About 25% of patients with autoimmune hepatitis are asymptomatic. The most common physical findings in autoimmune hepatitis are hepatomegaly (78%) and jaundice (69%) in patients with severe disease. Another common physical finding is splenomegaly with or without cirrhosis.
