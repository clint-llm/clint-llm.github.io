The prognosis is excellent for patients with mild transient hyperkalemia if the inciting cause is addressed and treated. Sudden onset, extreme hyperkalemia can cause cardiac arrhythmias that can be lethal in up to two-thirds of cases if not rapidly treated. Hyperkalemia is an independent risk factor for death in hospitalized patients.
