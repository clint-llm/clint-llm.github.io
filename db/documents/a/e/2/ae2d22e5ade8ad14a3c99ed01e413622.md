Histologic diagnosis is an important component of a cancer diagnosis. Adenocarcinoma requires evidence of neoplastic gland formation, pneumocyte marker expression in the form of TTF-1 with or without napsin, or intracytoplasmic mucin. The majority of neoplastic gland formation includes acinar, papillary, or micropapillary, leptic, or solid growth pattern.

As previously described, large cell carcinoma is a diagnosis of exclusion and can demonstrate squamous, glandular, or neuroendocrine differentiation in 90 percent of cases. Poorly differentiated carcinoma is only defined as large cell carcinoma if it does not demonstrate defining IHC markers that would preclude the disease to another subtype of lung cancer.
