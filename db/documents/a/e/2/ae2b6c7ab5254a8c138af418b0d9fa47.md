Adult T cell leukemia is primarily caused by HTLV-1 infection that usually remains asymptomatic. Transactivator protein (tax) and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ), the two viral oncoproteins, play an essential role in the development of disease and progression. Tax protein expression takes part in the onset of neoplastic transformation. HBZ protein is expressed on all infected malignant cell lines, whichÂ is responsible for the proliferation of leukemic cells.
