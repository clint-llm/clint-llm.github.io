The main mechanism of action of digitalis is on the sodium-potassium ATPase of the myocyte. It reversibly inhibits the ATPase resulting in increased intracellular sodium levels. The build-up of intracellular sodium leads to a shift of sodium extracellularly through another channel in exchangeÂ for calcium ions. This influx of intracellular calcium assists with myocyte contractility. Digoxin also has direct effects on conduction through increased vagal tone. Digoxin stimulates the vagus nerve leading to prolonged conduction through the sinuatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes. Overall, digoxin slows the conduction and increases the refractory period in cardiac tissue by enhancing vagal tone. These actions of digoxin can result in almost every type of arrhythmia possible such as:

- Extrasystole

- Nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia

- Ventricular fibrillation

- Premature ventricular contractions

- Atrial fibrillation and flutter

- Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia

- SA and AV node block

The major electrolyte complication in acute digoxin toxicity is hyperkalemia.
