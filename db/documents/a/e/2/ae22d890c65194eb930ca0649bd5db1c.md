The clinical symptoms associated with refeeding syndrome are highly varied. Symptoms reflect biochemical changes as cell membrane potentials and cellular functions are compromised by electrolyte changes. Consequently, patients present with multisystem complaints ranging from nausea to hypotension. Clinically, it has been observed that a patient's first described feeling of nausea can be interpreted as a precursor to hypotension.

Reported cardiovascular changes include arrhythmias, hypotension, cardiomyopathy, shock, bradycardia, tachycardia, and cardiac arrest. Renal changes such as acute tubular necrosis, renal failure, and metabolic acidosis have been reported due to sodium and phosphate alterations. Respiratory manifestations in refeeding syndrome include respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, and hypoventilation. Several musculoskeletal manifestations have been reported as well and they include rhabdomyolysis, weakness, myalgias, fatigue, muscle twitching, and diaphragm weakness. Gastrointestinal symptoms have been linked to hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia in refeeding syndrome and include diarrhea and constipation, nausea and vomiting, and paralytic ileus.

Of note, many refeeding syndrome patients have comorbidities such as electrolyte and vitamin deficiencies that may be exacerbated in the setting of alcohol use disorder.
