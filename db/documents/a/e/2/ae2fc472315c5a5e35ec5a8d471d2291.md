The pathophysiologic underpinning of infective endocarditis involves the following steps: bacteremia (spontaneous or hospital-acquired) that delivers the pathogen to the surface of the valve, adherence of the circulating pathogen to the prepared valve surface and ultimately the invasion of the valvular leaflets. Circulating pathogens do not adhere to the normal endothelium. Injury of the valve alters the architecture of the endothelial cells rendering them susceptible to colonization with bacteria.
