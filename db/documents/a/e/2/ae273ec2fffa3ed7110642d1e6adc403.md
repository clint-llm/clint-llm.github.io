The UCL measures 12-14 mm X 5-8 mm and originates from the head of the metacarpal. It inserts into the medial aspect and base of the proximal phalanx of the thumb. When the UCL is stressed, it can avulse the bone fragment at the insertion site- leading to the gamekeeper's thumb.

Injuries to the UCL are caused either by chronic repetitive valgus stresses, such as originally described in gamekeepers or by an acute hyperabduction trauma. Common causes include skiing injuries when the skiers fall on the abducted thumb with the ski pole in hand (skierâ€™s thumb), or injuries in other sports such as hockey, soccer, handball, basketball, and volleyball.

The one disorder associated with the gamekeeper's thumb is rheumatoid arthritis.
