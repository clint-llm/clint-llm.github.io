Foot deformities of congenital origin are prefixed as **talipes**, while that of acquired origin are referred to as **pes**.

A few terminologies related to foot deformities are as follows.

**Equinus:**Foot is fixed in plantar flexion.

**Calcaneus:**Foot is fixed in dorsiflexion, so having a prominent heel.

**Varus:**Foot is fixed in an inverted position, and the forefoot is adducted.

**Valgus:**Foot is fixed in everted position, and forefoot is abducted.

**Cavus:**Increase the height of the longitudinal arch of the foot.

**Planus:**Flattened / Decreased height of the longitudinal arch of the foot.

**Talipes equinus:**Congenital deformity of the foot in which the foot is plantar flexed, so the patient walks on toes with the heel raised.

**Talipes calcaneus:**Congenital deformity of the foot in which the foot is dorsiflexed, so the patient walks on heels with the forefoot raised.

**Talipes varus:**Congenital deformity of the foot in which the foot is inverted and abducted, so the patient walks on the outer border of the foot.

**Talipes valgus:**Congenital deformity of the foot in which the foot is everted and abducted, so the patient walks on the inner border of the foot.

**Talipes equino-varus / Club Foot**

It is one of the commonest musculoskeletal congenital anomalies. It includes four components equinus hindfoot, varus calcaneus, cavus midfoot, and adduction of the forefoot.

Conservative treatment is considered the best choice for managing clubfoot, including serial manipulation, casting, and bracing following the Ponseti method. While surgical methods may include soft tissue release, osteotomies, or arthrodesis. Ultimately, all treatment methods aim to obtain a pain-free, plantigrade, functional foot with no mobility issues.
