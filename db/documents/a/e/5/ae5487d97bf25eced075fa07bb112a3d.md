The bilobed flap is a local transposition flap used primarily for the reconstruction of small to moderate-sized cutaneous nasal defects, although it can be applied to other areas of the body. It was first described in 1918 by Esser for use in nasal tip reconstruction. The original flap used a rotational arc of 180 degrees and based the second lobe superiorly, towards the glabellar region. In 1989, Zitelli went on to describe limiting the total rotational arc to between 90 and 110 degrees; this variant is the most common modification in use today. This overview of the bilobed flap will describe the relevant anatomy and the situations in which the bilobed flap is most effectively employed, and it will describe in detail how to plan and execute this versatile flap.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the technique of bilobed flap transposition.
- Identify the indications for bilobed flap transposition.
- Review the potential complications of bilobed flap transposition.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in order to advance the use of bilobed flaps for reconstruction of nasal defects and to improve outcomes.
