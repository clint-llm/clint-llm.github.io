The complete blood count may show macrocytosis in non-megaloblastic macrocytic anemias. Reticulocyte count will help distinguish between two primary conditions. If reticulocytosis is present, hemolytic anemia and acute hemorrhage are the two main conditions for which the clinician must look. If a reticulocytopenia is present, the underlying conditions may be evident in some cases, such as hypothyroidism, alcoholism, liver dysfunction, and certain drugs. In other cases, one should perform bone marrow aspiration provided that the investigations to exclude vitamin B12 or folate deficiencyÂ are carried out. Indeed, myelodysplastic disorders and sideroblastic anemia can manifest as refractory megaloblastic anemia.
