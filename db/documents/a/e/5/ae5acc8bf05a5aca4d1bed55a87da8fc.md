Standard dosing for adults is 100 mg or 400 mg oral tablets. However, in children, it varies between 15-20mg/kg of their body weight.

Ethambutol should not be used stand-alone in initial treatment or re-treatment. It should be used in conjunction with another antituberculosis drug. Current first-line therapy for tuberculosis is a quadruple therapy of isoniazid(INH), rifampicin(RMP), pyrazinamide(PZA), and ethambutol(EMB) for two months, followed by a 4-month continuation of isoniazid and rifampicin and/or ethambutol.

**Initial Treatment**

Initial treatment for patients who have not received previous tuberculosis therapy should be administered with 15 mg/kg of body weight once orally every 24 hours along with isoniazid.

**Re-treatment**

Recurrent tuberculosis is still a global issue. There has only been one reported re-treatment with ethambutol in a patient who previously recovered from ethambutol-induced optic neuropathy. The patient's initial treatment consisted of 22 mg/kg/day of ethambutol along with rifampicin, clarithromycin, and ciprofloxacin that eventually developed into ethambutol induced optic neuropathy. After she discontinued ethambutol, her visual acuity recovered while she continued to finish her regimen. However, ten years later, the patient was diagnosed with tuberculosis again. The patient was treated with rifampicin, clarithromycin, and ethambutol at 25 mg/kg/day three days a week. With the supplementation of copper at 2mg daily, the patient did not show significant signs of visual change after a 14-month course regimen.

There have been recent studies to assess the administration of a dry powder inhaler (DPI) using EMB-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles(SLNs). The DPI formulations consisted of spray drying EMB-loaded SLNS with and without mannitol. The encapsulation efficiency was higher than 98%, and the particle size was sub-100 nm. Results have shown that EMB-loaded SLN DPI has high potential in the future direct treatment of TB.
