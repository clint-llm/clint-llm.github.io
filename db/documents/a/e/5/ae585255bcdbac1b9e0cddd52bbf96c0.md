Improving the outcome of enteral feeding requires an interprofessional approach. Enteral feeding involves coordination among the nutritional support team.

The nutrition support team is made up of the following:

- Clinician

- Nutrition nurse specialist

- Dietician

- Pharmacist

The clinician coordinates and directs the care related to enteral feeding. The clinician determines the optimal feeding regimen for the patient. A nutrition nurse specialist is primarily responsible for educating the patient on using the feeding tube. The nurse also supervises the care of the tube and notifies the clinician if any complications develop. The dietician manages the evaluation of the nutritional requirements, including the calculation of the daily caloric need and the optimal fluid requirements. The pharmacist provides the enteral feed and can mix and compounds parenteral nutrition. The pharmacist advises on the compatibility of nutrients and interaction. Other ancillary staff includes the social worker, physical, occupational and speech therapists, and a case manager to help arrange home supplies.

Care coordination, open communication, and accurate patient record-keeping are all aspects of the interprofessional care model which will drive optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
