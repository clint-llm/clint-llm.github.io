The prognosis of papillomas caused by HPV infection is usually good in immunocompetent individuals, but recurrences may occur. Some subtypes of HPV may cause vulvar intraepithelial dysplasia, cervical dysplasia, and cervical cancer. Although these subtypes don't typically cause papillomas, they are commonly present side by side with genital papillomas.

In immunocompromised individuals, papillomas often increase and spread more rapidly, and there is a higher risk of papillomas transforming into malignancy.
