Seborrheic keratoses are the most common type of benign skin lesions. They grow slowly, and they can become thicker over time. Depending on the location of these lesions, they can become irritated and cause pain and discomfort for the patient. Additionally, large numbers of these lesions can make the detection of other malignant skin lesions more difficult.
