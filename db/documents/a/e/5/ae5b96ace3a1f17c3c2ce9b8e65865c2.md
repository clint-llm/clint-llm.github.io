Although triptans are relatively safe drugs, some contraindications do exist. Cardiovascular disease should be screened for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking history, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of coronary artery disease (CAD), and menopause before initiation of therapy. Prinzmetal angina and CAD are absolute contraindications due to the risk of coronary vasospasm.

OCPs should not be given to patients who are older than 35 years and smoke cigarettes, have two or more risk factors for CAD or known ischemic heart valve disease, hypertension, history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), thrombogenic mutations such as antiphospholipid disease or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), history of stroke, breast cancer, or migraine with aura.

NSAIDs are contraindicated in patients with peptic ulcer disease or at risk for gastroduodenal disease due to blocking prostaglandin, which protects the gastric mucosa. Patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease may be restricted to NSAID use due to reduced prostaglandin I2 production by vascular endothelium with limited inhibition of prothrombotic platelet thromboxane A2 production, putting patients at higher risk for embolism. Patients with renal disease should avoid NSAID use due to the blockage of prostaglandins, which promote renal vasodilation and maintain renal perfusion.
