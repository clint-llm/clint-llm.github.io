Autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) and chronic idiopathic neutropenia (CIN) are relatively rare conditions, which can sometimes present as primary hematological disorders, and that's why referred to as "primary" or "isolated" neutropenia. According to a U.S. study, the prevalence of isolated neutropenia was reported to beÂ 0.44% among Mexican-Americans, 0.84% among whites, and 4.5% among black participants. According to the same study, the prevalence of chronic severe neutropenia was estimated to be 5 cases per million in the Washington state of the USA.

In children, the primary AIN lasts for 3 to 5 years, with an average of 17 months. The frequency of primary and secondary autoimmune neutropenia is 12.85% and 3.84%, respectively, in preterm babies, according to a study done in Italy. At the time of analysis, 74.9% of primary AIN and 7.7% of secondary AIN had recovered from neutropenia. So the study concluded that primary AIN is benign and occurs in children less than 2 to 3 years of age, and secondary AIN is more severe and occurs after 5 years of age with a greater tendency to be chronic.

A study concluded striking predominance of females to males as evidenced by an 8:1 ratio, while in children, more male predominance was seen. The patients with CIN or AIN enrolled in the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry in North America (SCNIR) suggested an early childhood peak with female predominance was seen.
