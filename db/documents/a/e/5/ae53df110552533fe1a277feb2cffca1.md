The exact epidemiology of intracranial hypertension depends on its etiology. However, of special note is idiopathic intracranial hypertension where up to 90% of affected individuals are women of childbearing age. Individuals with chronic hypertension or obesity are also at an increased risk for developing intracranial hypertension. A frequency of occurrence has been established to be 1.0 per 100,000 in the general population, 1.6 to 3.5 per 100,000 in women, and 7.9 to 20 per 100,000 in women who are overweight.
