Patients with HNPCC and colon cancer have a better prognosis than patients in the general population with colorectal cancer (sporadic colon cancer). In patients with HNPCC, the 5-year survival rate is estimated at approximately 60%, while sporadic cases have 40-50%.

It is also found that MSI-positive tumors are associated with improved survival rates.
