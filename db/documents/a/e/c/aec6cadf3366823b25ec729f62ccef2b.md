As per the data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 150,000 pregnant women have contracted COVID-19 in the United States of America (USA) as of December 2021. The CDC publishes data related to the same on its website and a dedicated Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). The last dedicated pregnancy-related documents published were in November 2021.

Among these, as per available data, about 25,000 women required hospitalizations, and about 600 needed intensive care admissions. About 250 women were reported to have succumbed to the disease. The largest number of women with reported infections belonged to the age group of 25 to 29 years, closely followed by the 30 to 34 years age group. White, non-Hispanic women and Hispanic women, in that order, were the largest ethnic sub-groups in the infected population.

From the available data of about 38000 live births, about 4000 were preterm births. Where data from testing infants born to women with COVID-19 was available, about 150 of nearly 3300 infants had tested positive for COVID-19 during their birth hospitalization.

Nearly 40% of the surveyed pregnant women were fully vaccinated with either the two-dose series of mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 or the single-dose regime of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.

Results synthesized from international publications, which included some data from the USA, show that preterm birth was the commonest adverse outcome worldwide.
