Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) is a spectrum of clinical manifestations seen in neonates due to withdrawal from intrauterine drug exposure. It is more commonly associated with maternal opioid use. The incidence of NAS has increased fivefold in the past decade, increasing hospital expenses. There is significant long term neurodevelopmental morbidity and mortality among NAS babies. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of NAS and highlights the healthcare team's role in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of neonatal abstinence syndrome.
- Describe the typical presentation, evaluation options, and assessment tools for neonatal abstinence syndrome.
- Outline the management models, treatment options and long term outcomes for neonatal abstinence syndrome.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by neonatal abstinence syndrome.
