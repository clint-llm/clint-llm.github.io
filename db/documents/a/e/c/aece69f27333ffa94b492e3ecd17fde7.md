Myxomas are the most common primary cardiac tumor. It is estimated that more than 75% of myxomas originate in the left atrium either at the mitral annulus or the fossa ovalis border of the interatrial septum; 20% arise from the right atrium while 5% stem from both atria and the ventricle. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of atrial myxoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of atrial myxoma.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of atrial myxoma.
- Outline the management options available for atrial myxoma.
- Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance atrial myxoma and improve outcomes.
