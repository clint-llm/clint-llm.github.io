**1) Preparation and Patient Positioning**

Patients are placed under general anesthesia. Intravenous preoperative antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis are given prior to the start of the procedure. Patients are placed in the supine position with split legs position. Both arms are out to the side. The patient will be secured with straps and tape in order to prevent patient movement with table positioning. Sequential compression devices will be placed on the patient's legs. The patient will then be prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.

**2) Entrance**

A 15 cm Veress needle is introduced at palmers point (left subcostal area) to create 15mm HG pneumoperitoneum. A 5 mm or 10 mm optical trocar is placed under direct vision two fingerbreadths below the xiphoid process for the camera. A 12 mm port is placed at the left and right flanks. A 5mm port is placed at the epigastrium for the liver retractor. A 5mm port is placed in the left upper and left lower quadrant.

**3) Mobilization of the stomach and Duodenal Dissection**

Dissection is begun by opening the gastrocolic ligament at the level of the gastric body. This is done using an ultrasonic scalpel. The greater curvature of the stomach is then mobilized from the antrum to the angle of His. In super obese patients who have a short mesentery and adhesions, sleeve gastrectomy may be performed as a first stage operation.

The pylorus is then identified and dissected free. The peritoneum is opened at the inferior and superior edges of the duodenum. The patient's antrum will be pulled to the left to visualized the duodenum better. The common bile duct will be identified on the superior aspect of the duodenum. This can be used as a landmark for further dissection. The duodenum can then be mobilized by the inferior or posterior approach. For the inferior approach, the gastrocolic ligament is divided using the harmonic. The pyloric artery is controlled. A posterior dissection is continued for the first 3 to 4 cm of the duodenum. The gastroduodenal artery is a marker for the limit of the posterior dissection. The duodenum will be divided using a 60 mm linear stapler at this point.

The posterior approach, a window is created 3 to 4 cm distal to the pylorus. Blunt dissection is performed to find the plane between the duodenal wall and the pancreas. Careful dissection is required to avoid small venous branches to the pancreatic head from the gastroduodenal artery. After being fully mobilized, the duodenum will be divided using a 60mm linear stapler at the first portion of the duodenum proximal to the gastroduodenal artery.

**4) Sleeve Gastrectomy**

Gastric transsection is started from 5 to 7 cm from the pylorus. A linear stapler with 60mm loads is used. The gastric transfection proceeds towards the fundus. A 32-40 french esophagogastric bougie is usually placed for guidance. Hemostasis on the staple line is controlled using clips or a 3-0 absorbable suture. The gastrectomy specimen is placed in a plastic bag and removed through one of the 12 mm trocars.

**5) Small Bowel Transection**

The patient is placed in the Trendelenburg position with the left side down. The ileocecal junction is identified, and any intrabdominal adhesions between the ascending colon and greater omentum are divided. The length of the metallic part of the laparoscopic bowel graspers (5 cm) is used to measure the alimentary limb. The small bowel is measure 100cm from the ileocecal junction. Then the small bowel is run another 150cm and transected at that level using a 60mm linear stapler. The small bowel mesentery may be opened a few centimeters in order to reduce tension on the duodenal anastomosis.

**5) Duodenoileal Anastomosis**

The alimentary limb is brought to the right upper quadrant in an ante colic fashion and brought to the transected portion of the duodenum. The omentum is mobilized from the ascending colon to relieve tension on the anastomosis. A handsewn or stapled end to side anastomosis is created. The anastomosis can be tested by insufflating air through the nasogastric tube. Repair sutures can be placed if there is a leak.

**6) Ileoileal Anastomosis**

The ileoileal anastomosis is then created at 100cm from the ileocecal valve. Following the completion of the anastomosis, the mesenteric window (Petersen window) is closed to prevent an internal hernia. After this has been completed, a routine cholecystectomy and liver biopsy may be performed if warranted.

**7) Skin Closure**

The trocars are then removed, and the fascia layers of the abdomen are closed at the larger port sites. The skin is then closed with absorbable sutures, and topical skin adhesive or sterile dressings are applied.
