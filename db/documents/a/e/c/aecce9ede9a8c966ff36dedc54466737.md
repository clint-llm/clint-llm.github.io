**Boxed Warning**

- **Cardiovascular Events:**In randomized controlled studies, there was a higher rate of cardiovascular deaths and non-fatal myocardial infarctions and strokes in the febuxostat-treated group compared with the allopurinol-treated group. Based on this new information, the FDA is limiting the use of febuxostat to patients for which allopurinol is not efficacious or patients who experience severe adverse effects with allopurinol, and there is now a boxed warning of cardiovascular death.

**Warnings and Precautions**

- **Gout Flares:**An increase in gout flares frequently occurs after the initiation of febuxostat.

- **Hepatotoxicity:**In randomized controlled studies, liver function abnormalities were reported, including transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal.****Although this effect has not demonstrated that it is clinically significant, recommendations include a liver test panel, including serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, before initiating febuxostat treatment as a baseline measurement as well as periodically during treatment and in patients experiencing any signs of hepatic injury.

- ****Severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR):****Severe hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia & systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been attributed to febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if severe skin reactions are suspected and initiate prompt treatment.

**Drug-Drug Interactions**

- Antacids such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide delay absorption by approximately 1 hour, but the extent of absorption is not affected. Therefore, febuxostat may be administered without regard to antacid use.

- Administration of febuxostat with theophylline increases the concentration and absorption of theophylline. These differences were not deemed statistically significant in the study. However, there was a 400-fold increase in 1-methylxanthine (a metabolite of theophylline) excreted in urine due to xanthine oxidase inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of chronic long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been assessed. Caution is advised when febuxostat is administered with theophylline.

- Concurrent administration of repaglinide with febuxostat can cause severe hypoglycemia. Febuxostat inhibits CYP2C8, resulting in delayed elimination and increased concentration of repaglinide.

- Febuxostat inhibits the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and concomitant administration of febuxostat increases methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity by inhibiting hepatic BCRP.

- Rosuvastatin is a BCRP substrate; febuxostat increases rosuvastatin exposure by inhibiting its BCRP-mediated efflux in the small intestine.
