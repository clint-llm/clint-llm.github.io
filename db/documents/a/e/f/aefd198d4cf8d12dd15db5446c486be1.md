A clinical diagnosis of acute graft rejection is confirmed by a finding of lymphocytic infiltration of the renal cortex on fine-needle aspiration. If transplantation is unsuccessful, retransplantation surgery should be considered. The following tests should be done:

- Blood group testing: Both donor and recipient must be compatible with the blood type. Group O is the universal donor.

- Serum crossmatch: Donor cells and recipient serum are mixed. If there are antibodies against the graft they will attack and destroy the donor cells, which is a positive test, and the transplant surgery cannot be performed.

- HLA typing: It must test for histocompatibility between donor and recipient. The most critical loci are HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR.
