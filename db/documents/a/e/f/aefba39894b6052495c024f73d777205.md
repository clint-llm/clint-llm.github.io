**Laboratory Analysis**

The initial evaluation should include basic labs to access levels of complete blood count, serum electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, total protein, renal, and liver function. Also, thyroid function and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels should be obtained. Based on the abnormalities detected in basic labs, patients should have additional tests to evaluate for diseases like celiac disease, malignancies, and multiple myeloma. Disorders of calcium and vitamin D malabsorption should be considered. Hormone imbalances like Cushing syndrome and parathyroid hormone abnormalities are also very important in the evaluation of osteoporosis.

**X-ray**

Plain X-ray report of low bone density is a strong predictor of osteopenia or osteoporosis but not diagnostic. Changes in plain radiograph showing osteopenia, wedging in vertebrae can be a clue of underlying fracture risk.

**DEXA Bone Density Scan**

The most common test used for the measurement of bone health and osteoporosis is the DEXA bone density scan (Dual-energy x-ray Absorptiometry). It is a radiological diagnostic test and is universally classified by T and Z scores. T score is the measurement of bone density compared to younger people and estimates the risk of fracture, whereas Z score measures the bone density of the comparable age group. Most guidelines use T score as a standard approach for estimating fracture risk assessment and treatment. T score above -1 is Normal, a score of -1.0 to -2.5 is classified as osteopenia, and anything less than -2.5 is osteoporosis. These numerical values are the standard deviations of comparison.

**Imaging**

Besides the DEXA scan, other radiological tests could be used to support and differentiate the cause of fracture, including pathological and secondary fractures from malignancies. These include conventional radiography, CT (computed tomography (CT) scans, MRI, and bone scan (scintigraphy). Recently, the use of bone turnover markers was introduced as part of monitoring treatment failures or responses. They are not used in isolation as some results are nonspecific, but they could be helpful in complex patient assessments where DEXA scans alone might not be sufficient for decision making. These include serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone-specific ALP. Serum osteocalcin (a specific marker for osteoblastic function), serum type 1 procollagen, or serum carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) (a marker for bone resorption) are used as treatment response markers.

**Biopsy**

Bone Biopsy, although very specific in identifying the mineralization and microarchitecture of the bone is rarely used for diagnosis of osteoporosis, but are nevertheless included when determining the effects of treatment, bone structure, and turnover in certain clinical contexts. They can establish the safety and efficacy of new treatment modalities if clinically appropriate.
