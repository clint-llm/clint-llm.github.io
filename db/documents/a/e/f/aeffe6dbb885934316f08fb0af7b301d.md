- HO is a common rehabilitation complication after joint arthroplasty, TBI, stroke, SCI, and burns.

- Prevention should be a priority in those with a high amount of identifiable risk factors.

- Risk factors include spasticity, older age, pressure ulcer, the presence of DVT, having a tracheostomy, long bone fractures, prior injury to the same area, edema, immobility, long-term coma and severity of the injury.

- Evaluation: Triple-phase bone scan is most sensitive. Plain film radiograph is specific, but may not show up until the bone has matured in up to 6 weeks.

- Prevention with ROM, control of spasticity, NSAIDs (indomethacin, COX-2 inhibitors), bisphosphonates (etidronate) and external beam radiation in joint replacement.

- Treatment with ROM, NSAIDs (SCI population), Bisphosphonates (SCI and THA), and surgery (TBI population)

- Absolute treatment with surgery only after HO has fully matured, which can take up to 12 to 18 months.

- Current pharmacological treatment options are limited, unsafe, and only prevent the progression of the disease. The bone that has already formed can already limit a person's function and still need surgical revision despite ROM exercises and pharmacological intervention. There is limited research on effective options for prophylaxis/treatment, when to start treatment, and continued research on the effectiveness of novel treatments in specific patient populations.
