Volar splinting is often done by therapists, emergency department physicians, orthopedic nurses and surgeons. It is a invaluable technique to stablize injuries of the hand and the digits. At each visit, the splint can be removed and the hand visualized. The key to good outcomes is patient education on keeping the splint clean and knowing when to return to the hospital.
