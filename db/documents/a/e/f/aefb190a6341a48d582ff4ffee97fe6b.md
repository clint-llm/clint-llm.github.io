Most of the toxic effects of methylprednisolone and other glucocorticoids are predictable from their impact on the body's physiology. Some are life-threatening and include metabolic effects (growth inhibition, diabetes, muscle wasting, osteoporosis), salt retention (although less common with methylprednisolone), and psychosis.

Methods for minimizing these toxicities include local application, alternate-day therapy (to reduce pituitary suppression), and tapering the dose promptly after attaining a therapeutic response. Additional "stress doses" may be necessary during serious illness or before major surgery to prevent adrenal insufficiency in patients who have received long-term treatment with methylprednisolone.
