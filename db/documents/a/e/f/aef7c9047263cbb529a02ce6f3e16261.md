Apart from the morbidity and mortality associated with severe infections caused by GAS, the one major complication that can result from even minor infections is acute rheumatic fever. This is an autoimmune response typically to GAS pharyngitis. This leads to illness typified by joint pain and/or swelling, fever, chorea, skin and subcutaneous changes, and cardiac valvular regurgitation. The symptoms of acute rheumatic fever can be severe, with significant edema due to heart failure, severe joint pain, high fevers, and choreiform movements that prevent the normal performance of activities of daily living.

This diagnosis typically requires management in the hospital for evaluation of the extent of symptoms with an echocardiogram, etc. First, the mainstay of treatment is the eradication of GAS from the body with antibiotics. Subsequently, in severe disease, corticosteroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications may be employed. In cases of chorea, antiepileptics may be needed, and aggressive management of heart failure symptoms may be necessary for those experiencing fluid overload due to valvular regurgitation. The valvular regurgitation associated with acute rheumatic fever may be permanent and, in some cases, is severe enough to require definitive surgical management with valve repair/replacement.
