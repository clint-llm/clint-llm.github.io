**Key Points**

- VFS is a common adverse reaction seen with intravenous vancomycin use.

- The increased use of vancomycin will likely cause an increase in the number of VFS reactions.

- Healthcare providers should be aware of this common reaction, its signs and symptoms, and how to manage cases when they occur.

- The rapid infusion of vancomycin should be avoided as this most often is a rate-related adverse drug reaction.

- Facilities should establish infusion protocols to limit infusion rates of vancomycin to 1 gram/hour or slower at 10 mg/min.
