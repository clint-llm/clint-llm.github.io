Cholecysto-cutaneous fistulas are rare today but like any cutaneous fistula need proper drainage and skin protection, while at the same time managing the primary cause. Specialized would care nurses usually provide day to day management of cholecysto-cutaneous fistulas in the same manner as any cutaneous fistula by recording the amount of drainage, characteristics of the drainage and at the same time providing skin protection. The results should be reported to the surgeon. If abnormal, such as slow drainage, pus, or signs of infection, the surgeon should be contacted immediately. The nurse should monitor the patient and provide family support including ongoing education of the patient and family. The prognosis for benign causes is good as long as the primary condition is managed. However, in patients with a malignant cause, the prognosis is guarded and the fistula may not be treatable. It is important for healthcare workers to know that any chronic wound that is left untreated can develop malignant changes after 10-20 years, hence close monitoring by the interprofessional team is necessary The best outcomes are achieved by interprofessional teamwork in treating these challenging cases.
