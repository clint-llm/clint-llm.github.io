Pulmonary regurgitation has bimodal prevalence. The first peak appears in young individuals who underwent surgical repair of the valve for congenital heart diseases. This condition is also prevalent in the adult population with pulmonary hypertension due to various reasons. The exact prevalence is hard to predict as there is a multitude of causes for pulmonary hypertension, which in turn can lead to PR. No racial or ethnic predilection exists. The differing frequency of PR between women and men corresponds to the specific etiology resulting in this condition.
