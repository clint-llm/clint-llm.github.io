The pathophysiology of GERD is multifactorial and is best explained by various mechanisms involved, including the influence of the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter, the presence of a hiatal hernia, esophageal mucosal defense against the refluxate and esophageal motility.

**Impaired Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) Function and Transient Lower Esophageal Sphincter Relaxations (TLESRs)**

The LES is a 3-4 cm tonically contracted smooth muscle segment located at the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and, along with the crural diaphragm forms the physiological EGJ barrier, which prevents the retrograde migration of acidic gastric contents into the esophagus

**Hiatal hernia**

Hiatal hernia is frequently associated with GERD and can exist independently without causing any symptoms. Nonetheless, the presence of hiatal hernia plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of GERD as it hinders the LES functionet al.Â demonstrated the presence of hiatal hernia in 94% of patients with reflux esophagitis

**Impaired esophageal mucosal defense against the gastric refluxate**

The esophageal mucosa comprises various structural and functional constituents that function as a protective defense barrier against the luminal substances encountered with GERD

**Defective esophageal peristalsis**

Normally, the acidic gastric contents that reach the esophagus are cleared by frequent esophageal peristalsis and neutralized by salivary bicarbonateet al., 21% of patients with GERD were noted to have impaired esophageal peristalsis leading to decreased clearance of gastric reflux resulting in severe reflux symptoms and mucosal damage
