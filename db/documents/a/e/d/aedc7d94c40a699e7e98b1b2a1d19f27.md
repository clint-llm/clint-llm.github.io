Cheyne-Stokes respiration is characterized by alternating apnea and hyperventilation during sleep, mostly in the N1 and N2 sleep, and also when awake. This can be clinically observed and documented with a cyclic variation of breathing pattern with a change in saturation from 90% to 100%. Minute ventilation is not routinely monitored during sleep studies. The hyperventilation is documented by rising and falling chest excursions and the tidal volume. If the patient is on a ventilator, then the cyclical change in tidal volume and minute ventilation can be graphed together. The apnea/hyperpnea cycle is around 45 minutes to 75 minutes. This cycle is longer than other causes of central sleep apnea cycle, which typically have a cycle length of 30 to 45 minutes. Cheyne-Stokes respiration is worse in the supine position or moving from supine to lateral body position. This type of respiration can be associated with increased blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Home sleep apnea testing with a type 3 portable monitor can be useful in identifying Cheyne-Stokes respiration and apneic events in adults with chronic heart failure.
