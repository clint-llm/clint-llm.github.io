As mentioned, research seems to suggest that GLAD lesions can be linked to episodes of anterior shoulder instability. One study, for example, identified that GLAD lesions were associated with higher rates of failure in arthroscopic Bankart repair.

Another study demonstrated a correlation between GLAD lesions and reduced glenohumeral stability on a cohort of cadaveric shoulders â€“ suggesting that the lesion may represent a biomechanical risk factor in shoulder instability. One hypothesis is that the GLAD lesion reduces the depth of the normal joint concavity, already limited, and therefore compromises concavity-compression and hence stability within the glenoid fossa.

It has also been postulated that patients may be at risk of osteoarthritis (OA) following a GLAD injury. This hypothesis is based on trends seen following labral repair within hip surgery and knee meniscectomy - and the analogous anatomy and physiology between these three joints.
