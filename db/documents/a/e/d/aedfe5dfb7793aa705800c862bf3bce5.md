One class of drugs that has been implicated in serious adverse drug reactions for many decades is oral anticoagulants, especially warfarin. There are countless case reports indicating the use of oral anticoagulants is more likely to require hospital admission, and prolonged hospital stays from adverse events such as bleeding. Oral anticoagulants have been classified as high alert medications according to the Institute of Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) because they have the potential for harm when used clinically. This activity reviews anticoagulation safety and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who need anticoagulants

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of anticoagulation related bleeding.
- Describe the differences between warfarin and novel oral anticoagulants.
- Identify the treatment and management options available for anticoagulation associated bleeding.
- Discuss how the interprofessional team can invoke strategies for improving the evaluation and management of patients with anticoagulation related bleeding.
