Rodenticides or "rat poisons" are mixed compounds used to eradicate rodents. They are one of the most toxic agents commonly found in households. Historically, heavy metals such as arsenic were the first agents used to control rodent populations, but the most common rodenticide used in the twenty-first century is anticoagulants. When a clinician suspects rodenticide poisoning, every effort should be made to identify the substance, including package information (i.e., brand name, chemical name, signal word, presence of skull or crossbones on the label) and description (odor, appearance, color). This step may involve staff returning to the point of potential exposure where the patient was last seen and searching for evidence of the rodenticide. In cases of serious ingestion, poison control and/or a medical toxicologist should be contacted. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of various types of rodenticide poisoning. It also highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing rodenticide toxicity patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of different types of rodenticide toxicity causing different medical conditions and emergencies.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of rodenticide toxicity.
- Outline the management options available for rodenticide toxicity.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in managing rodenticide toxicity and improving outcomes.
