With over 1.4 billion adults worldwide categorized as overweight or obese and an increase in obesity-related health conditions, a need for effective treatment and management modalities is crucial. Intragastric balloons serve as a minimally invasive tool to combat the obesity pandemic. There are multiple intragastric balloons approved for the United States and European markets. Indications in the USA include a BMI of 30 to 35 kg/m^2 but a BMI of 27 to 35 kg/m^2 in Europe. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and pathophysiology of intragastric balloons and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Discuss the history and development of the intragastric balloon.
- Describe the pathophysiology of intragastric balloon therapy.
- Review the risks and benefits of intragastric balloon therapy.
- Identify indications and contraindications for a patient to undergo placement of an intragastric balloon.
