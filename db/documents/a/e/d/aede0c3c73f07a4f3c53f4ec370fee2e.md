The most common presentation in Eisenmenger syndrome is a patient with known congenital heart disease (CHD) presenting with worsening exertional dyspnea. Other common complaints may include swelling, volume retention, syncope, worsening cyanosis, palpitations, or hemoptysis. Due to the increase in red blood cell volume from chronic hypoxemia, patients also may present with polycythemia/viscosity-type symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, vision changes, end-organ damage, stroke.

Digital clubbing is often seen in these patients. Digital clubbing that is more pronounced in the lower extremities can occur in the setting of shunt physiology associated with patent ductus arteriosus and the delivery of unoxygenated blood distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. Dermatologic manifestations associated with Eisenmenger's syndrome may include plethora, livedo reticularis, profound acrocyanosis, urate depositions, ecchymosis, and ischemic skin ulcerations. Ascites and right upper quadrant tenderness, as a result of hepatic congestion and gallbladder pathology, may be present on abdominal exam.
