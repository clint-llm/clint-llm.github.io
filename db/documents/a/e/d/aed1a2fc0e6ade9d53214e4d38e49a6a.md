Differential diagnoses include the infectious process or dermatologic manifestation of another disease. Although infectious processes do not cause oral mucositis, the local infection can complicate the presentation of oral mucositis and require adjuvant treatment. Viral infections such as herpes simplex virus and fungal infections such as candidiasis can be superimposed. Dermatologic manifestations of systemic inflammatory diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis can also cause oral ulcers. Oral squamous cell carcinoma may also present similarly. Nutritional deficiencies such as zinc deficiency can cause oral lesions, for which nutritionists often prescribe zinc supplementation.
