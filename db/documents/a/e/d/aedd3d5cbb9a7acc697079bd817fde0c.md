A useful and detailed way to classify the adverse effects of insulin is by separating and organizing them by organ systems:

- Cardiovascular side effects include peripheral edema

- Dermatologic side effects include pruritus and erythema at the injection site

- Hypersensitivity side effects include hypersensitivity reaction and anaphylaxis

- Local injection site adverse effects include lipoatrophy and hypertrophy

- Endocrine and metabolic side effects include hypokalemia, weight gain, and hypoglycemia

Regarding hypoglycemia, if insulin is administered notÂ with meals or inappropriate dosage, it can be life-threatening. Untreated hypoglycemia can cause seizures, coma, and even death, especially in elderly patients.

Insulin causes a potassium shift from the extracellular space to the intracellular space and can cause profound hypokalemia and result in muscle cramps, lethargy, cardiac arrhythmias, and even death.
