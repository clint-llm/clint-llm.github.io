Patients on rivastigmine, and other anticholinergic medications, should have close follow-ups with the primary clinician taking care of them. Clinicians (MDs, DOs, PAs, NPs) should work closely with nurses to keep a proper follow-up on patients to ensure optimal therapy and be aware of the potential for adverse effects. Clinicians can also work closely with pharmacists to help optimize treatment and prescribe the best regimen to their patients to achieve optimal therapy for their diagnoses; the pharmacist can consult on whether rivastigmine is best suited for the patient at hand or not. Nursing and pharmacy must emphasize the importance of strict compliance to patients, as a lack of compliance can be devastating to therapy and, subsequently, their lives.

Concerns about compliance need to be brought to the prescribing clinician's attention immediately. All members of the interprofessional healthcare team are responsible for providing the best care to their patients and being on the lookout for adverse effects. An interprofessional team employing strategies like those outlined here will result in the best outcomes. [Level 5]
