Type four hypersensitivity reaction is a cell-mediated reaction that can occur in response to contact with certain allergens resulting in what is called contact dermatitis or in response to some diagnostic procedures as in the tuberculin skin test. Certain allergens must be avoided to treat this condition. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of type four hypersensitivity reactions and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of type four hypersensitivity reactions.
- Summarize the pathophysiology of type four hypersensitivity reactions.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with type four hypersensitivity reactions.
- Review the importance of collaboration and care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients with type four hypersensitivity reactions.
