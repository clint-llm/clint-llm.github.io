In most situations, mastectomy may be done safely and easily if medically indicated. There are a few crucial factors that merit consideration as contraindications for surgery. These can often be broken down into two separate categories: systemic and locoregional. Mastectomy may be contraindicated in patients with proven distant metastatic disease. Also, frail or elderly patients with significant medical co-morbidities or systemic organ dysfunction may not be candidates for surgery due to the burden of their overall health and poor performance status. Patients who have a predicted high risk of mortality associated with surgery or anesthesia are not candidates for surgery. For patients with advanced locoregional disease, mastectomy may be relatively contraindicated at the time of diagnosis if there is skin or chest wall involvement and concerns regarding the ability to close the surgical wound or obtain a negative surgical margin. In these circumstances, neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy, radiation, or endocrine therapy may be of benefit to reduce the volume or extent of local disease and open the door for surgery.
