Odontogenic cysts are usually identified on routine exams and are generally classified as inflammatory or developmental. Radiographically, they present as a unilocular or multilocular radiolucent lesion with distinct borders; however, they cannot be differentiated radiographically. In addition, odontogenic cysts may share similar radiographic appearances with aggressive odontogenic tumors.

Inflammatory odontogenic cysts are classified as:

- Periapical cyst

- Residual cyst

- Paradental cyst

Developmental odontogenic cysts are classified as:

- Dentigerous cyst

- Eruption cyst

- Lateral periodontal cyst

- Gingival cyst

- Odontogenic keratocyst (OKC)

- Orthokeratinizing odontogenic cyst

- Glandular odontogenic cyst
