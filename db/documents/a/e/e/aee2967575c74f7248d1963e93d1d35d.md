Oral mucositis is a severely debilitating condition characterized by erythema, edema, and ulcerations of the oral mucosa.

In severe oral mucositis caused by chemotherapy, the dose in the subsequent chemotherapy cycle may have to be decreased or delayed, affecting patients' quality of life and worsening prognosis.
