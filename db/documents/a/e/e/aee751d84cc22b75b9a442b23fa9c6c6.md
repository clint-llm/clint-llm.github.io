The innervation of the scrotum derives from the branches of the following four nerves: genitofemoral, pudendal, posterior femoral cutaneous, and ilioinguinal nerves.

**Anterior Innervation:**

The cremaster muscle and anterior scrotum receive their innervation by the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve.Â This nerve arises from the L1-L2 segments of the lumbosacral plexus and then travels through the inguinal canal to supply the anterior skin of the scrotum.

**Posterior Innervation:**

The posterior scrotum is innervated by branches of the pudendal nerve and by the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve.

The ilioinguinal nerve also aids the genitofemoral nerve in the innervation of the cremasteric muscle.

**Cremasteric Reflex:**

Both the ilioinguinal and the genitofemoral nerves provide a sensory synapse that activates the motor neurons responsible for the cremasteric reflex.
