All healthcare workers, including the primary care provider and nurse practitioner who prescribe nitrofurantoin, should know its indications, duration of treatment, and adverse drug reactions. The drug has been around for decades and has a good safety profile. ItsÂ pulmonary toxicity is overstated and is, in fact, very rare. Nitrofurantoin lacks a broader tissue distribution; hence, nitrofurantoin should not be prescribed to treat pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses.

In addition, healthcare providers should recognize that although nitrofurantoin is associated with reduced eradication rates, there is an increased risk for antimicrobial resistance and toxicity when other broad-spectrum antibiotics are used. Hence, the knowledge of antimicrobial stewardship is necessary.
