A systematic literature review by Abecassis and colleagues found the incidence of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) ranging from 1.12 to 1.42 cases per 100,000 person-years.

Risk factors associated with a higher risk of AVM rupture include prior hemorrhage, deep AVM location, exclusively deep venous drainage, and associated aneurysms.

When deep location, deep venous drainage, and prior hemorrhage are all present, a study by Stapf and colleagues reported an annual rupture rate as high as 35.5%.
