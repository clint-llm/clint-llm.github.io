The diagnosis of the biceps tendon ruptureÂ sometimes is challenging. The investigator should bear in mind that proximal biceps tendon injury usually coexists with rotator cuff disorders and shoulder girdle instability.

Differential diagnosis includes:

- Rotator cuff disease

- Shoulder dislocation/instability

- Impingement syndrome

- Humeral/radial head fracture
