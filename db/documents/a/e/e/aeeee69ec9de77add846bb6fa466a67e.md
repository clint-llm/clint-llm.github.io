Salmonella infection can be difficult to diagnose at first due to nonspecific symptoms. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by culture, followed by treatment with supportive care and/or antibiotics. Usually, treatment is completed by an inpatient team, which consists of at least the physician and nurse. The nurse and physician take care of and manage the patient while hospitalized. The laboratory and personnel are also involved with blood work, follow up of culture results, and antibiotic susceptibility during the hospitalization. The pharmacist assists in medication decisions and dosage for the patient. In addition to the primary hospital team, an infectious disease physician may be consulted to assist in treatment, management, and follow-up of the patient after the hospital admission. This physician may also coordinate with public health services to prevent Salmonella spread in the community. Public health services and prevention may be the next step to lower Salmonella infection rates. Many groups have worked on vaccines to prevent infection. Besides the two known vaccines, a Vi tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine has been studied and has shown promise in preventing infection in randomized control trials.
