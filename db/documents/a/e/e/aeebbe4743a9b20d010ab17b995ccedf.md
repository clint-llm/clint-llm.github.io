Congenital smooth muscle hamartoma probably results from an aberrant development, mainly of the arrector pili muscle, during the mesodermal maturation. Hypertrichosis is suggested to be after the stimulation of the epithelial cells of the bulge by the CD34 positive dermal dendritic cells situated in the hamartoma.

Congenital smooth muscle hamartoma is a sporadic condition. Recently, familial cases have been reported suggesting a possible genetic predisposition.

Diffuse forms of congenital smooth cell hamartoma are extremely rare and result in folding of the skin. It is reported to be a manifestation of the Michelin tire baby syndrome and could be associated with systemic involvement.
