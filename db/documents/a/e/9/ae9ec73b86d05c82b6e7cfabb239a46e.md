Orbital pseudotumor, also known as orbital inflammatory pseudotumors (OIP), idiopathic orbital inflammation (IOI), orbital inflammatory syndrome (OIS), Â idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor (IOIP), or nonspecific orbital inflammation (NSOI) is a benign, space-occupying, and non-infectious inflammatory condition of the orbit but may extend in the peri-orbital area.

Orbital pseudotumor is rare in children. The most common ophthalmic findings are periorbital edema and blepharoptosis. A palpable mass may be present. On orbital radiography, common findings are dacryoadenitis, orbital mass, or myositis.
