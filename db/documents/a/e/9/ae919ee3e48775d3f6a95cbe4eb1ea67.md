Nasal septal perforation is a full-thickness defect of the nasal septum. Bilateral mucoperichondrial leaflets and a structural middle layer comprise the three-layer divider between the right and left nasal cavities. Septal perforation occurs most commonly along the anterior cartilaginous septum. Symptoms can include nasal obstruction, whistling, epistaxis, crusting, pain, rhinorrhea, chronic rhinosinusitis, or foul smell. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of septal perforation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline etiologies of nasal septal perforation.
- Identify the steps in the workup for causes of nasal septal perforation.
- Summarize the surgical treatment options available for nasal septal perforation.
- Review the importance of interprofessional care coordination when treating nasal septal perforation.
