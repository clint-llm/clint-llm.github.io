Patients with Lafora disease are usually managed by the neurologist and pediatrician. Unfortunately, there is no cure available for Lafora disease. Management is only supportive, targeting seizure control and improving the patient's functional status. Given the diversity of seizure types, including generalized tonic-clonic seizures, wide-spectrum antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as levetiracetam, sodium valproate, topiramate, and benzodiazepines are usually considered. The pharmacist should assist the team by educating the caregiver on the adverse effects of these agents and the need for compliance. Patients should be encouraged to follow up regularly to ensure that the drugs are effective; nursing staff will be instrumental during these followups, verifying patient compliance, looking for adverse drug reactions, and informing the clinicians of their findings. A ketogenic diet has been reported to help some patients but there are no solid clinical data to back up these claims. A dietary consult may be offered to the family should they be willing to try out a ketogenic diet but at the same time, the family has to be warned about the complications associated with such a diet. A geneticist should be involved to counsel the family on screening on other siblings.
