Whether respiratory or metabolic, alkalosis is usually compensated by the body's innate buffering mechanisms in the acute and subacute phase. When the alkalosis is uncorrected or chronic, the buffering mechanisms may become overwhelmed, potentially leading to a poor prognosis. Prognosis depends on associated problems of volume depletion, electrolyte, and hormonal disturbances and varies based on the primary etiology of the alkalosis.

Patients with metabolic alkalosis have been found to have increased ICU duration of stay, more days on mechanical ventilation, and higher hospital mortality. An increase of 5-mEq/L in the serum bicarbonate level over 30 mEq/L correlated with an odds ratio of 1.21 for hospital mortality. The association between metabolic alkalosis and mortality occurs independently of the etiology of alkalosis.
