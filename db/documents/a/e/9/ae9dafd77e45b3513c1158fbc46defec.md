Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is a rare, autoimmune-mediated mucocutaneous disease that is almost always associated with an underlying neoplasm. Pemphigus comprises a group of IgG-mediated autoimmune bullous diseases in which autoantibodies react with desmosomes, the cell-to-cell adhesion structures between keratinocytes, resulting in painful skin erosions and blisters. Researchers have identified three significant forms of pemphigus: pemphigus foliaceus, pemphigus vulgaris (most common type), and paraneoplastic pemphigus.

Paraneoplastic pemphigus typically presents with painful mucosal erosions and dusky patches on the skin that later desquamate. A variety of lesions with differing morphologies, ranging from flaccid blisters to widespread lichenoid eruptions, have been seen in paraneoplastic pemphigus patients. However, shared by all patients is the presence of widespread, and often severe, mucosal lesions that can be the earliest presenting symptom of the disease.
