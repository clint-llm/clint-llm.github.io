The histological appearance of primary cutis verticis gyrata can show significant variation from case to case. Histological features range from essentially normal skin architecture to thickened connective tissue with hypertrophy or hyperplasia of adnexal structures with or without an associated increase in collagen fibers and trapping of the apocrine and eccrine glands.
