Poikilocytosis is diagnosed with a blood smear examination.

Not all RBCs will take on an abnormal shape. Patients with poikilocytosis have some normally shaped cells RBCs mixed with abnormally shaped poikilocytes. Sometimes, many different types of poikilocytes are present in one patient's blood smear in conditions like iron deficiency anemia, megaloblastic anemia, etc.

In addition to the blood smear, other tests are done to determine the etiology of abnormally shaped RBCs. Examples of other commonly used diagnostic tests include serum iron levels (iron studies), complete blood count (CBC), vitamin B-12, folate, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and liver function tests. Choosing the right test(s) can depend on determining the right morphology.
