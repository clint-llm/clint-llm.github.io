Ataxia is a neurological sign that manifests in a lack of coordination in the movement of different muscles in the body.

Ataxia can also subdivide into sporadic (patients have no family history of ataxia and manifestÂ in adulthood), hereditary (caused by a defect in a gene and manifesting in childhood), and acquired (due to structural or demyelinating conditions, toxicity, paraneoplastic, inflammatory or infections, and autoimmune conditions).
