Upper limb arterial variants have been reported as occurring in around 25% of the general population.

Furthermore, there is a well-recognized physiologic variation in the branching pattern from the axillary artery. This typically manifests as a common origin for the lateral thoracic (LTA) and subscapular arteries (SSA), anterior (ACHA) and posterior (PCHA) circumflex humeral arteries, or thoracoacromial (TAA) and lateral thoracic arteries (LTA).
