**Prevention Strategies**

**Meticulous Maintenance of Oral Hygiene:**As dental caries cannot progress without the presence of microorganisms present in dental plaque, daily removal of dental plaque with tooth brushing and flossing is considered to be the best preventive method.

**Topical Fluoride Application:**Fluoride inhibits dental caries by inhibiting demineralization and enhancing remineralization of tooth structure by the formation of acid-resistant fluorapatite crystal. Various methods that incorporate fluoride in daily life include fluoridated water supply, use of fluoridated toothpaste, use fluoridated mouth rinse, and application of different professional fluoride gels and varnishes.

**Application of Pit and Fissure Sealants:**Pits and fissures pose a non-cleansable morphology and hence are the most susceptible site for the initial development of caries. Application of the pit and fissure sealants provides a mechanical barrier that deprives the microbes of sugars and hence halts the progression of dental caries.

**Xylitol:**The main dietary culprit in the formation of dental caries is sucrose. Nowadays, sucrose is getting replaced by xylitol, an artificial sweetener that is not only non-cariogenic but also anti-cariogenic.
