Antihypertensives are a broad group of medications, and health care workers are recommended to have special caution in monitoring adherence and possible adverse reactions to these medications. Treatment of HTN is essential in preventing cardiovascular disease, and choosing the precise class of drugs is critical to achieving the appropriate control with fewer side effects.

An interprofessional team of clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists is required to monitor patients on these medications. The clinician starts the antihypertensive regimen; this should be followed by special attention from the pharmacies to check on the drug-drug interactions, patient adherence to treatment, and perform medication reconciliation. The nurse plays a vital role in monitoring the patient's adherence and determining barriers to good response to the treatment, including monitoring diet and activity levels and evaluating the home environment. Home visiting nurses will monitor blood pressure and heart rate response to the treatment and identify early adverse reactions. Both pharmacists and nurses should inform the clinician of any possible concerns of adherence, adverse reactions, or home environmental changes. This comprehensive interprofessional team effort helps achieve the maximal benefits of the regimen and the best care delivery to the patient and family. [Level 5]
