There are no specific guidelines existing for post-treatment surveillance. Many oncologists follow patients every 3 to 6 months for patientâ€™s high risk for recurrence for about 5 years. Surveillance endoscopy is recommended after local resection every six months for two years and then annually for an additional 3 to 5 years. The utility of frequent CT scans for surveillance is less clear.
