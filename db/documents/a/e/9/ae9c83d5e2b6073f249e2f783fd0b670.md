Third-degree heart block is often a straightforward diagnosis on the 12-lead ECG. It is characterized by the presence of a complete AV-dissociation, with an atrial rate being faster than the ventricular rate. It is crucial to differentiate complete heart block from AV dissociation related to other causes, such as in idioventricular rhythms where the ventricular rate is faster than the atrial rate. Sometimes, second-degree heart blocks and high-degree AV blocks may masquerade as complete heart blocks. Repeating ECGs or longer rhythm strips are often helpful in making such a distinction.
