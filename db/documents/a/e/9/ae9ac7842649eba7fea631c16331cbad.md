**Treatment**

In a drug overdose, initiate supportive therapy as per the patient's condition. Consider the possibility of multiple drug overdose and drug-drug interactions. Ensure patient's airway, support ventilation, and hemodynamic stability. Monitor for serum electrolytes, blood gases, and patient's vitals. Consider giving activated charcoal to decrease the absorption of the medicine from the stomach before it reaches peak plasma concentration.
