The etiology of Pellegrini-Stieda is thought to be an insult to the medial collateral ligament causing damage and acute inflammation that sets into motion a process of delayed ossification. This insult has been classically described as a macrotrauma, whether direct or indirect, causing valgus stress with disruption of the MCL fibers. When initially described by Kohler in 1903 the ossification was particularly associated with sports activities. However, some reports from physiatrists have suggested micro-repetitive trauma from therapeutic manipulation of a restricted knee joint or post-surgical rehabilitation to be possible etiologies of Pellegrini-Stieda Disease with new-onset medial knee pain, edema, or restricted range-of-motion in an actively rehabilitating patient.
