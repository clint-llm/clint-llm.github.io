The most feared complication of FBAO is hypoxia resulting in respiratory arrest, anoxic brain injury, and death. Long term complications of undiagnosed airway foreign bodies are atelectasis, pneumonia, or bronchiectasis, occasionally requiring lobectomy or segmentectomy. It is also not uncommon for the treatment of FBAO to have deleterious side effects. Complications of the Heimlich maneuver include injury to the abdominal or thoracic viscera and regurgitation of stomach contents. For patients requiring bronchoscopy, potential complications include bleeding, infection, airway perforation, and pneumothorax.
