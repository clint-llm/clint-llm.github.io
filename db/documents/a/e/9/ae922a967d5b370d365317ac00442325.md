Anatomically, the umbilical hernia could occur either through a potential weakness present at the exit site of involuted umbilical vessels, most importantly the umbilical vein or through weakened umbilical fascia (Richet's fascia)

Chronic abdominal wall distension with increased intra-abdominal pressure like in pregnancy, patient with ascites or peritoneal dialysis, stretching of the abdominal muscles fibers, and the weakness of connective tissue may be responsible for the occurrence of umbilical hernia

Umbilical herniaÂ may contain preperitoneal fat tissue, omentum, and small intestine or a combination of those can take part
