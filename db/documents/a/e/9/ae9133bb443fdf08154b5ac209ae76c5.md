Hypertensive emergencies are unusual, with a projected incidence of 1 to 2 cases per million per year. However, a recent investigation showed that the estimated number of visits due to this condition and the rate per million per adult emergency department (ED) visits have more than doubled from 2006 to 2013. Few examples include eclampsia (2%), cerebral infarction (39%), and acute pulmonary edema (25%).
