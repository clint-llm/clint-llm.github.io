Patients with the benign form of acanthosis nigricans have few or no skin complications,Â good prognosis, and potential of resolution with treatment. Complications can stem from the underlying disease like diabetes and insulin resistance. Prognosis in patients with the malignant form of acanthosis nigricans is poor as the malignancy is advanced usually at the time of diagnosis in these patients.
