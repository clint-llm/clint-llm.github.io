The P602L mutation in ATP2A2 leads to an inability to transport calcium in the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase.

The same gene is affected in Darier disease.

RecentlyÂ patients with Darier disease and acrokeratosis verruciformis of Hopf have had lesions evaluated with a polymerase chain reaction. HPV-17 is detectable in the lesions, and the L1 capsid showed expression in the cytoplasm in areas of hypergranulosis, which suggests susceptibility to HPV in these patients.
