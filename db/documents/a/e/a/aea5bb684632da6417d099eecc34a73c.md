The receptive field of a peripheral sensory nerve (peripheral nerve field) crosses over different dermatomes. A dermatome is an area of skin supplied by a single spinal nerve. Therefore, the map of peripheral nerve fields over the body differs from the dermatomal distribution since individual peripheral nerves are composed of multiple nerve roots. Physicians use these known fields to map sensory deficits and localize lesions.
