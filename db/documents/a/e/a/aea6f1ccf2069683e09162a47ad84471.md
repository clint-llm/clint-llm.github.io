Intestinal ischemia can affect the small intestine or the colon. Whereas, “colonic ischemia” refers to ischemia that affects the colon, “mesenteric ischemia” refers to ischemia that affects the blood vessels of the small intestine. It can be secondary to occlusive or nonocclusive obstruction of the arteries or can be caused by obstruction of venous outflow.

- Acute mesenteric ischemia is the sudden onset of small intestinal hypoperfusion. Patients usually present with sudden-onset abdominal pain. They are at high risk of deterioration and need emergent surgical intervention.

- Chronic mesenteric ischemia is seen in patients with mesenteric atherosclerosis. It causes intermittent intestinal hypoperfusion that usually worsens with eating.
