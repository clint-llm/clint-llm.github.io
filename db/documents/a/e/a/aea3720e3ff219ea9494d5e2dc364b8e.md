Most cases are sporadic. However, both autosomal dominant and X-linked dominant inheritance has been recorded. Isolated cases reports have suggested a Xp11.23 deletion containing PORCN to be one of the possible causes of angioma serpiginosum. However, this was later contradicted by some other workers. The view that angioma serpiginosum represents a mild form of focal dermal hypoplasia (FDH), which can be associated with PORCN gene mutations, has also been opposed by later reports.
