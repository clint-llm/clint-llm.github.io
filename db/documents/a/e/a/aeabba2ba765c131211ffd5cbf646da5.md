Persistent Mullerian duct syndrome is a type of male pseudohermaphroditism defined by the presence of female internal genitalia and male internal and external genitalia.Â This condition can also result from a mutation in the gene encoding MIF or a mutation in the MIF receptor. A mutation in the MIF gene will result in the lack of production of MIF. A mutation in the MIF receptor will result in the insensitivity of the Mullerian ducts to the hormone.
