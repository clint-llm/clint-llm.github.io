The lingual artery is accompanied by the dorsal lingual vein, while the deep lingual vein lies near the mucous membrane of the inferior surface of the tongue.

Generally, the length of the lingual artery is 75% of the length of the tongue, from the dorsal portion up to the tip.Â The path of the artery has a lateral and inferior direction for about three-quarters of its length.
