The skin is highly vascularized and is supplied by plexuses found between the reticular and papillary layers of the dermis. The blood supply originates from an extensive network of larger blood vessels and capillaries that extend from regional branches of the systemic circulation to local sites throughout subcutaneous tissue and dermis, respectively.

An extensive lymphatic framework runs alongside many of the skinâ€™s blood vessels, particularly those attached to the venous end of the capillary networks.
