The most common cause of peripheral edema in patients over 50 yrs of age is venous insufficiency. It is related to aging, but many other underlying comorbid conditions like heart failure, renal failure, liver failure, and trauma can affect any age group. Peripheral edema can also be commonly observed in pregnancy.
