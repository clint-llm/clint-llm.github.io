As previously discussed, an interprofessional approach should be taken to manage this complex patient group. Physiotherapists play a crucial role in the post-operative care of patients with hip fractures. Dietician input is required to optimize nutrition to meet metabolic demands as well as to promote wound healing. Patients often require a lot of nursing care, both pre and postoperatively, and therefore nursing staff should be adequately trained and supported to manage this high demand patient group.

Input from elderly medicine physicians is crucial both pre and postoperatively to optimize patients for surgery, manage acute medical pathologies, assess falls risks, investigate for osteoporosis, and aid with patient’s on-going medical needs while rehabilitating. The orthopedic surgeon really only plays a small roll in the management of patients with an acute hip fracture.
