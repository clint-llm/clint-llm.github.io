Neurosurgical consultation is a crucial part of the work-up and management of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the CNS.

Overall, medical condition, age, vascular anatomy, associated cerebral aneurysms, history of hemorrhage, and other risk factors all merit consideration during clinical decision-making. Risks and benefits of available treatment options (sole medical management, radiosurgery, endovascular embolization, surgical resection, or a combination of interventions) are unique to each patient and AVM and require discussion on a case-by-case basis. Clinicians and nurses need to work together to educate patients and their families regarding the management of potentially life-threatening diseases.
