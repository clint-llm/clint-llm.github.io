Enterobacter is a genus belonging to the family of Enterobacteriaceae that is associated primarily with healthcare-related infections. There are currently 22 species of Enterobacter. However, not all species are known to cause human disease. Enterobacter species are responsible for causing many nosocomial infections, and less commonly community-acquired infections, including urinary tract infections (UTI), respiratory infections, soft tissue infections, osteomyelitis, and endocarditis, among many others. Certain species of this bacterium can be part of the microflora of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, while other Enterobacter species can be present in human skin surfaces, water, certain foods, soil, and sewage.

Starting in the 1970s, it was acknowledged that the Enterobacter species could cause nosocomial infections. According to the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System, Enterobacter is a common pathogen discovered from respiratory sputum, surgical wounds, and blood found in isolates from intensive care units (ICU).

Enterobacter has become increasingly resistant to many previously effective antibiotics. In 2017, the World Health Organization issued a list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in which carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) was in the critical priority group for an urgent need to develop new antibiotics.
