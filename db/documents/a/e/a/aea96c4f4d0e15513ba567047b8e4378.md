While evaluating a patient with oliguria, the following differential diagnosis must be kept in mind, and evaluation should be done accordingly:

- Pre-renal azotemia: (hemodynamic status of the patient, urine analysis, and doppler based renal resistive index).

- Acute glomerulonephritis: (Renal biopsy, complement levels)

- Oliguric acute tubular necrosis: (urine analysis)

- Non-oliguric acute tubular necrosis: (urine output measurement, urine analysis)

- Urinary tract obstruction: (urine sediment, renal ultrasonography, non-contrast CT scan)
