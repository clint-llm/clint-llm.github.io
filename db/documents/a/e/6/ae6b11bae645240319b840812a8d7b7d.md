PAS-2  is diagnosed by occurrence in the same patient of at least 2 out of 3 manifestations including primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease), autoimmune thyroid disease-causing Grave disease or hypothyroidism and T1DM. Other endocrine and non-endocrine manifestations of PAS-2  are primary hypogonadism, myasthenia gravis and celiac disease, alopecia, vitiligo, pernicious anemia, idiopathic heart block, Stiff-man syndrome, Parkinson disease, IgA deficiency, serositis, dermatitis herpetiformis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia, and hypophysitis.[1][2]

Diagnosis of Addison disease or primary adrenal insufficiency is based on a  morning serum cortisol level less than 6.0 mcg/dl or a serum cortisol less than 18 mcg/dl at 60 minutes after ACTH stimulation test using 250-mcg intravenous or intramuscular bolus of cosyntropin.[6] The presence of 21-hydroxylase or 17-hydroxylase autoantibodies can confirm autoimmune adrenalitis.

Diagnosis of hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease can be made by evaluation of TSH and T4 for the former and TSH, T4, and T3 for the latter. In euthyroid patients, the presence of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, thyroid microsomal antibodies and thyrotropin receptor antibodies (Graves' disease) can detect patients at risk of thyroid disease in the future.

Diagnosis of T1DM can be made with classic symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia associated with elevated serum glucose level (fasting greater than 125 mg/dl and random over 200 mg/dl and or elevated HbA1c, greater than 6.4%). Standard guidelines should be used for the diagnosis of individual organ dysfunction. These patients can be tested for anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies (GAD), anti-islet cell antigen 2 and anti-Zn transporter 8 antibodies. Also following a challenge with glucagon (1 mg) the plasma C-Peptide is less than 0.6 ng/ml.

A timely diagnosis of PAS-2  requires knowledge of the complete spectrum of this disease. A complete history and thorough physical exam may give important clues. In many cases, the diagnosis of PAS-2  may be delayed due to the heterogeneous presentation. It is uncommon for these patients to have dysfunction of all 3 major endocrine organs simultaneously and there is usually a latent phase between the endocrinopathies.

Patients with PAS-2  and their family members should be monitored long-term due to the risk of development of organ-specific dysfunction over time. Family members who are not affected with PAS-2 should watch for symptoms related to adrenal, thyroid and endocrine pancreatic dysfunction. Asymptomatic carriers should be followed on an annual basis.[1]

Organ-specific antibodies like 21-hydroxylase antibody for Addison disease, an antibody against GAD 65 for type 1 diabetes, thyrotropin receptor antibody, and TPO antibody for autoimmune thyroid disease can be assayed for making a diagnosis. Transglutaminase antibodies are useful for the diagnosis of Celiac disease. However, the presence of autoantibodies to thyroid, adrenal, and islets does not predict glandular failure.

PAS-2  can be differentiated from PAS-1 due to late-onset on clinical manifestation mostly after age 20, different patterns of disease combination with no mucocutaneous candidiasis, and polygenic inheritance versus monogenic.

Delay in diagnosis can cause significant morbidity and mortality in these patients due to the risk of severe hypothyroidism, adrenal crisis, and diabetic ketoacidosis.

Thyroid ultrasound is an excellent noninvasive tool to evaluate thyroid disease. The diffuse or multifocal hypoechoic pattern is commonly seen in autoimmune thyroid disease.

CT scan and MRI of the adrenal gland is often normal, but sometimes there is a decrease in the volume of the gland suggestive of atrophy.

Unfortunately, there is no reliable imaging technique which can indicate endocrine pancreatic disease.
