All interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and dieticians, need to be aware of vitamin D deficiency (level < 30 ng/mL) and insufficiency (level between 20 to 30 ng/mL) are a problem across the globe. Pregnant women, African Americans, Hispanics, obese adults, and children are at high risk for vitamin D deficiency. In the United States, 50% of children ages 1 to 5 and 70% of children ages 6 to 11 have vitamin D deficiency. Experts attribute this fact to an increase in the incidence of obesity, a decrease in milk consumption, and the use of sun protection. The interprofessional healthcare team needs to examine all these factors when assessing the patient.

Very few foods are a natural source of vitamin D. These include oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines. Foods fortified with vitamin D are milk and orange juice, and some bread and cereals. An important source of oral vitamin D is vitamin D supplements, which are available both over the counter and through prescription. These are available in strengths of 1000 IU, 2000 IU, 5000 IU, and 50,000 IU, which are available only through prescription.
