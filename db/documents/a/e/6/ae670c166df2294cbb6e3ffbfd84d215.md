Histologically, a dense hyalinized matrix with scanty colloid and a characteristic eosinophilic cell infiltrate can be seen. No malignant or giant cells are present. Fine-needle-aspiration has a limited value in the diagnosis of Riedel thyroiditis. However, the following characteristics may suggest the diagnosis of Riedel thyroiditis. The smear is significant for moderately cellular and revealed fragments of fibrous tissue and spindle cells dispersed and formed small clusters. The spindle cells vary from bland-appearing fibroblasts with a uniform pale nucleus to myofibroblasts-like cells. The plump myofibroblast-like cells are scattered in small groups of maximal three cells. The myofibroblast-like cells have abundant basophilic cytoplasm, plump oval nuclei, and visible nucleoli on Papanicolaou stain. Occasional large myofibroblast-like cells are unremarkable for mitoses or increased the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio. Scattered inflammatory cells consisting of a mixed population of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils are present. The background of the smears showed no necrosis or malignant diathesis. Neither germinal center cells nor Hurtle cells should be identified to support the diagnosis of a fibrosing variant of Hashimoto thyroiditis.
