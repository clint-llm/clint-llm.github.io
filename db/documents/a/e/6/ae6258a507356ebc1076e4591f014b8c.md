**Hantavirus**

- Symptom intensity often drives patients to seek medical attention, but lack of significant findings necessitating admission often results in supportive care for discharge.

- Despite appropriate treatment in intensive care units (ICU), around one-third of patients will die in the first 48 hours after admission.

- Almost half of the patients admitted with hantavirus will not require mechanical ventilation via intubation if appropriately managed with judicious fluids and close monitoring.

- Treatment is providing supportive measures.

- Ribavirin has been proposed as a treatment option with possibly some benefit to inhaled ribavirin, but overall is ineffective in hantavirus.

- Respiratory failure can be severe, with around 40% of cases requiring mechanical ventilation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a possible treatment strategy for those patients not improving with mechanical ventilation. Still, it is complicated by a lack of controlled trials, follow-up data, and iatrogenic complications.

- Fluid balance with goals of maintaining normal-high filling pressures for cardiac output and minimizing pulmonary edema will likely be difficult.

- Inotropic agents such as dobutamine are encouraged early.

- Death is often associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation, which includes frank hemorrhage and drastic leukocytosis.

- Should patients improve in the first few days, there is a good probability of extubation within the first week, and often there are no major long-term complications.

- Subjective complaints of dyspnea, fatigue, and myalgias may occur.

**HFRS**

- Similar treatment strategies apply to HFRS with regards to supportive care.

- Hemodialysis may be utilized during the oliguric phase due to transient renal function insufficiency.

- Clinical studies in China suggest that giving the patient ribavirin in the first 5 days after symptom onset has significant mortality reduction.
