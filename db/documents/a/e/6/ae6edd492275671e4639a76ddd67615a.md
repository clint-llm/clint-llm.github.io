Vestibular neuritis is thought to be the result of inflammation of the vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve and classically presents with vertigo, nausea, and gait imbalance. It is considered a benign, self-limited condition that typically lasts several days, but can take weeks to months for all vestibular symptoms to completely resolve. Vestibular neuritis is a clinical diagnosis, and itâ€™s the clinician's task to differentiate this benign self-limiting disease from other central causes such as cerebrovascular syndromes. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of vestibular neuritis and examines the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of vestibular neuritis.
- Review the evaluation of vestibular neuritis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for vestibular neuritis.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis and treatment of vestibular neuritis and improve outcomes.
