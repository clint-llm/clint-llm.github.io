The condition is often asymptomatic and frequently diagnosed during routine clinical evaluation or as part of pregnancy workup. The presentation of congenital versus acquired RN in children might help explain the differences in the clinical presentation of RN in adults, with males presenting mostly with hypertension, proteinuria, and progressive renal failure as compared with females who present mostly with recurrent UTI and usually carry a favorable outcome.

Some of the risk factors for RN include:

- The severity of VUR

- Recurrent UTI

- Bladder-bowel dysfunction.

- Younger age

- Delay in the treatment of UTI

Based on the age of presentation, the patients may have the following:

- History of recurrent childhood UTIs

- Prolonged bedwetting

- Complicated urinary infection: Acute pyelonephritis in infants and children

- History of surgical reimplantation of the ureters into the bladder

- Hypertension on presentation

- Abnormal renal function with elevated serum creatinine and reduced eGFR

- Episodes of fluctuating renal function

- Mild to moderate proteinuria

- Severe or nephrotic proteinuria may be from secondary FSGS, which can be confirmed by renal biopsy

- Urinary calculi

- Asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy

- In pregnancy: Urinary infection, hypertension, and preeclampsia

- Approximately 20% of women with reflux nephropathy will develop UTI in pregnancy, with around 6% of these from acute pyelonephritis

- Small kidneys with thinned cortices on renal ultrasonogram (USG) in asymptomatic young patients with hypertension

- Bilateral hydronephrosis on the renal USG

- UTIs may be more common in adults who have had the surgical management of VUR
