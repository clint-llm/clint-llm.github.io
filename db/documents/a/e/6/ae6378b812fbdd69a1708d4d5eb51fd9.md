The iris sphincter muscle receives its parasympathetic innervation via the short ciliary nerves which lead to pupillary constriction (miosis) and accommodation.

Reciprocal function is largely the responsibility of sympathetic innervation, which comes from the superior cervical ganglia. The sympathetic fibers help promote sphincter muscle relaxation, which is critical for periods of low-light or night vision. Sympathetic innervation from the superior cervical ganglion project to the dilator muscle of the iris via long ciliary nerves to control pupil dilation. The sympathetic and parasympathetic systems work in opposition to constantly adjust the pupillary aperture.
