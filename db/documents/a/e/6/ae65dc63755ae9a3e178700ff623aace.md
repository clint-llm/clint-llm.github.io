Giardiasis is an enteric infection caused by the protozoa Giardia duodenalis. A common disease in low-resource settings, it often presents with flatulence and watery diarrhea. In the United States, the disease is most often seen in international travelers, wilderness travelers, and daycare workers. Though often asymptomatic, patients may have severe enough symptoms to result in dehydration and weight loss. Treatment with a nitroimidazole or antihelminthic medication is often rapidly curative.
