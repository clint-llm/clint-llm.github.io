The differential diagnosis for a postoperative patient who has not urinated and is having abdominal pain should include:

- Hypovolemia + postoperative pain (A bladder scan demonstrating a full bladder should rule this out)

- Iatrogenic bilateral ureteral injury or unilateral injury in a patient with a solitary kidney (A bladder scan demonstrating a full bladder should rule this out)

- Iatrogenic bladder injury (A bladder scan showing a full bladder should rule this out)
