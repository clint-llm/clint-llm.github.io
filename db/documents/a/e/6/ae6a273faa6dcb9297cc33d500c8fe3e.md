An extensive neurological evaluation is not needed in most patients with isolated fourth nerve palsy. The majority of casesÂ are congenital, and documentation of long-standing head tilt and facial asymmetry helps to rule out an acquired etiology. In cases of acquired palsy, the absence of association with head trauma or the presence of any associated neurological findings mandates neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging).

Rarely, conditions like myasthenia gravis may mimic trochlear nerve palsy. Suspected cases should be investigated for anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody, computed tomography of the chest to look for thymic mass, and nerve conduction studies.
