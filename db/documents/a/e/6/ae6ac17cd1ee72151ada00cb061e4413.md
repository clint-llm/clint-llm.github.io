Mediastinal trauma is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an anesthesiologist, thoracic surgeon, cardiac surgeon, trauma specialist, intensivist and ICU nurses. It is important to assess all organs of the mediastinum for injury with imaging studies. No healthcare worker should perform an emergency room thoracotomy without having knowledge of anatomy and/or prior surgical experience-otherwise the mortality rates are close to 100%.

The outcomes for patients with mediastinal injury depend on the age of patient, severity of injury, number of organs involved, associated head trauma and presence of hypotension on arrival.
