Early contact with a Poison Control Center or medical toxicologist is essential to guide the management of specific exposure. Obtaining zinc, copper, and ceruloplasmin levels is the first step when suspecting zinc poisoning from any source. Workup for acute toxicity caused by ingestion includes liver function tests such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), pancreatic lipase, complete blood count for platelet count, creatinine and BUN for renal function.
