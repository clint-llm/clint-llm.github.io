Traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation results in various injuries to the shoulder joint (glenohumeral joint). Soft tissue injuries, such as glenoid labrum tears, capsular tears, glenohumeral ligaments, and rotator cuff injuries, may occur.

Abnormal translation of the head of the humerus during dislocation results in excessive loading and stretching of the labrum and capsuloligamentous structures.

Burkhart studied the effect of a change in shape and reduced surface area of the glenoid on recurrence.Â The recurrence rate was higher in the groups with significant bone loss at the glenoid.

In engaging Hill Sachs, the long axis of the bone defect is parallel to the anterior glenoid rim; hence it will engage with the glenoid rim.
