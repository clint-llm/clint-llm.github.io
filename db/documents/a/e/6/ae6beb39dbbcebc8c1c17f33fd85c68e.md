All symptomatic patients with suspected ricin exposure should be admitted. The treatment of ricin toxicity is supportive and includes management of shock, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, respiratory support, and treatment of seizures. Patients exposed to ricin by inhalation may require airway management and positive-pressure ventilation. Activated charcoal can be given to patients who have ingested ricin if vomiting has not yet occurred and the patient's airway has been secured. Gastric lavage can be used if the patient ingested ricin within the past hour. Electrolytes, coagulation studies, renal function, and liver function should be monitored; coagulopathies and electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. There is no ricin antidote available for humans.
