In the cortex, when a neurotransmitter is released, the postsynaptic endplate of the adjacent dendrite is stimulated, leading to the formation of an endplate postsynaptic potential (EPSP). Consequently, an electrical dipole is established across the soma of the neuron with positive charges internally and negative charges externally. This dipole then rapidly moves along the axon of the neuron as an action potential. The EEG measures the summation of EPSPs that is a net result of both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials from groups of synchronously firing pyramidal cells.

The synchronization between different cerebral functions is related to the dynamic interactions of segregated brain regions.
