The pathophysiology is dependent upon the underlying condition causing a buildup of unconjugated bilirubin. Crigler-Najjar syndrome, Gilbert syndrome, hemolytic disorders, and decreased ability to conjugate bilirubin in neonates are the most common conditions.

The circulating unconjugated bilirubin, which is lipid-soluble, passes the blood-brain barrier and enters neuronal and glial membranes. In the brain, bilirubin has a special affinity for the globus pallidus, the hippocampus, and the subthalamic nucleus. Many other structures, including the striatum, thalamus, cranial nerve nuclei, inferior olives, and dentate nuclei of the cerebellum, are less frequently affected. Bilirubin attaches to cell membranes and is toxic to neurons and oligodendroglia. It damages the mitochondria, inhibits oxidative phosphorylation, and causes calcium release promoting apoptosis. It also affects axonal and dendritic growth in the central nervous system.
