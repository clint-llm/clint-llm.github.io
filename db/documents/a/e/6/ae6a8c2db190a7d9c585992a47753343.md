Osteoprogenitors can self-proliferate and self-renew. They participate in osteogenic differentiation and play a role in regulating angiogenesis.

Neuropeptide Y is a potent regulator of osteogenesis, and recent studies have confirmed that osteoprogenitor cells originating from hypothalamic Y2-/- mice have enhanced osteogenic activities.
