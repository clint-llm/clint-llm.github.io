Most commonly, USGIVs are used when traditional palpation-based techniques fail. Some facilities have developed policies requiring a certain number of attempts without ultrasound before attempting a USGIV. As long as efforts are made to utilize distal superficial vessels, ultrasound may be used for initial attempts at venous cannulation.Â Encouraging learners to practice the ultrasound technique on superficial forearm vessels may help develop hand-ultrasound coordination. Once learned, these skills can be extrapolated to help cannulate deeper vessels.
