Following its relatively recent birth in the 1700s from the pioneering work of Dr. Bernardino Ramazzini, occupational medicine has grown to encompass an array of respiratory conditions. One such condition is byssinosis, a collection of respiratory symptoms elicited by exposure to raw non-synthetic textiles during their manufacturing process. Over the years, byssinosis has been referred to as cotton worker's lung, brown lung
disease, Monday fever, and mill fever.

In 1978, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) published a mandatory standard regarding exposure to cotton dust in the workplace which both improved both the detection and prevention of byssinosis.

Byssinosis is more common in people who work in the textile industry where cotton fabrics are made. In the United States, the disease is most common in Georgia, North and South Carolina, and Maryland.
