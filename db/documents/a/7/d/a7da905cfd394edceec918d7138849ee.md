Classification and stages of hypertension as defined in recent American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines are as under

- Normal: SBP less than 120 and DBP less than 80mmHg;

- Elevated: SBP 120 to 129 and DBP less than 80mmHg;

- Stage 1 hypertension: SBP 130 to 139 or DBP 80 to 89mmHg;

- Stage 2 hypertension: SBP greater than or equal to 140 mmHg or greater than or equal to 90 mmHg.

White coat hypertension is an office BP 130/80 mmHg or more but less than 160/100mmHg which comes down to 130/80mmHg or less after at least 3 months of anti-hypertensive therapy. Ambulatory or home blood pressure measurement is usually necessary for this diagnosis.

Masked hypertension is an elevated office systolic BP 120 to 129mmHg, and diastolic BP less than 80mmHg but raised BP on ambulatory or home measurements (130/80mmHg or more).

The ACC classification came out in 2017, received an endorsement from the ASH, and recommended for individuals aged 20 years and above.

The recent ESC/ESH guidelines came out in 2018 and defined Hypertension as under

- Optimal: SBP less than 120mmHg and DBP less than 80mmHg

- Normal: SBP 120 to 129mmHg and/or DBP 80 to 84mmHg

- High normal: SBP 130 to 139mmHg and/or DBP 85 to 89mmHg

- Grade 1 hypertension: SBP 140 to 159mmHg and/or DBP 90 to 99mmHg

- Grade 2 hypertension: SBP 160 to 179mmHg and/or DBP 100 to 109mmHg

- Grade 3 hypertension: SBP greater than or equal to 180mmHg and/or DBP greater than or equal to 110mmHg

- Isolated systolic hypertension: SBP greater than or equal to 140mmHg and DBP less than 90mmHg (further classified into Grades as per above ranges of SBP)

ESC/ESH recommendations also shed light on home (HBPM) and ambulatory BP measurements (ABPM) and following cut-offs were given

- Daytime (or awake) mean  SBP greater than or equal to 135mmHg and/or DBP greater than or equal to 85mmHg

- Night-time (or asleep) mean SBP greater than or equal to 120mmHg and/or DBP greater than or equal to 70mmHg

- 24 hr mean SBP greater than or equal to 130mmHg and/or DBP greater than or equal to 80mmHg

- Home BP mean SBP greater than or equal to 135mmHg and/or DBP greater than or equal to 85mmHg

The ESC/ESH recommendations applied to individuals aged 16 years and above.

The 8th report of Joint National Committee (JNC) came out in 2014 and received heavy criticism across the globe, did not address the definition of hypertension but put forward its recommendations based on previous definitions put forward by JNC-7.

- Normal: SBP less than 120mmHg and DBP less than 80mmHg

- Pre-Hypertension: SBP 120 to 139mmHg and DBP 80 to 89mmHg

- Stage 1 Hypertension: SBP 140 to 159mmHg and DBP 90 to 99mmHg

- Stage 2 Hypertension: SBP greater than or equal to 160mmHg and DBP greater than or equal to 100mmHg

The JNC-8 recommendations were exclusively for individuals aged 18 years and above.
