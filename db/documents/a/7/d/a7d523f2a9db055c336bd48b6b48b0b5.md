Recovery after Richter hernia repair is centered around modifying risk factors for recurrence. Patients should be advised to refrain from smoking and heavy lifting. Continued attention to weight is a strong recommendation, as obesity is a risk factor for the development of hernias. An abdominal binder can be used in the postoperative period for comfort but is not necessary.
