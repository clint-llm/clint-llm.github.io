Radial head dislocation is not an uncommon pathology seen in the emergency department. However, the key is prompt reduction; otherwise, the patient usually has a significant deformity and future arthritis. Because of its high morbidity, the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that plays a role in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up.

The emergency department physician, orthopedic nurse practitioner, or physical therapist usually performs elbow reduction. Nursemaids' elbow is common and is reducible without any sedation, and no splinting or immobilization is necessary if adequately reduced. However, follow-up is required to ensure that the reduction was successful.

Fractures and dislocations in children, although rare, will require sedation and splinting and are usually managed by the orthopedic surgeon. If unsuccessful, open surgical repair is warranted. Most adult fractures will require surgical repair. Although long-term outcomes are poor, radial head dislocation may be well tolerated for several years.

Because some patients present late, clinicians must have a high level of suspicion for a radial head dislocation to prevent long-term sequelae.

In rural areas where primary care providers and nurse practitioners run the outpatient and urgent clinics, it is important to refer the patient with recurrent elbow dislocation or a chronic elbow dislocation to an orthopedic surgeon promptly. The greater the delay in treatment, the worse the outcome.

Given that isolated radial head dislocation is uncommon, it is important that healthcare providers be able to identify signs and symptoms, mechanism of injury, and help provide optimal management for this injury.

The interprofessional team must work together to diagnose and treat this condition, especially inasmuch as early detection significantly improves outcomes. Primary care providers or ED physicians are often the first to encounter these patients, and they need to decide if orthopedic intervention is necessary. Nurses can assist in taking the history and triage efforts, particularly in the ED. Pharmacists may not have a direct role in initial management, but in the event, pain medication becomes part of the treatment plan, they are tasked with communicating back to the healthcare team regarding dosing and potential drug interactions and adverse effects. In post-surgical cases, the pharmacist will play a role in pain management strategies and medication reconciliation, and since surgical cases are typically adults, there is a greater need for medication reconciliation. Physical therapists will handle the bulk of the rehabilitative duties, and report back to the managing clinician regarding progress and/or setbacks.

All these members of the interprofessional team need to communicate and collaborate effectively to both diagnose and manage this condition to achieve optimal outcomes. [Level 5]
