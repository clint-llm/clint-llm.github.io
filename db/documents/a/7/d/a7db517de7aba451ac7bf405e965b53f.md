Early diagnosis and timely intervention are the key components for successfully managing patients with primary congenital glaucoma. The entire healthcare team needs to be aware of their roles whenever they come in contact with these patients. A high level of suspicion by the optometrists, staff nurses, and general physicians in any patient with enlarged eyeballs or excessive watering, hazy corneas, abnormal congestion, photophobia, high myopias in infancy or early childhood should be maintained.

There should be a relatively lower threshold maintained in referring these children to ophthalmologists for confirmation of diagnosis. It is also important to educate parents about the need for immediate referrals and that delay in treatment can lead to significant ocular co-morbidities and visual compromise lifelong. Ophthalmologists play an important role in diagnosing and treating these cases. An evaluation under anesthesia should be planned for investigating and any surgical intervention if needed. Close interprofessional communication for examination by pediatrician, anesthetist, and ophthalmologist with the help of staff nurses, the counselor will be needed for successful outcomes in these patients.
