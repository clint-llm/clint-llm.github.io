Muscle consists of individual cells known as muscle fibers, which form from bundles of myofibrils. The myofibril is divided further into individual sarcomeres consisting of thick filaments and thin filaments. The thin filaments contain actin, tropomyosin, and troponin, whereas myosin forms the thick filaments, which is stabilized by a protein called titin. Muscle contraction occurs when myosin forms cross-bridges with actin and utilizes the energy provided by hydrolysis of ATP to generate active tension by pulling on actin. Tropomyosin is complexed with troponin and prevents cross-bridge formation by blocking myosin-binding sites on actin. Troponin consists of three subunits: 1) troponin T, which anchors the complex to tropomyosin, 2) troponin I, which binds to actin and blocks the myosin-binding sites, and 3) troponin C which binds to calcium. When calcium binds to troponin C, the tropomyosin-troponin unit changes its conformation leading to exposure of these binding sites, which allows contraction to occur.
