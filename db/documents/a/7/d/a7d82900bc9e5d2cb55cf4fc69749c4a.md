Even though lifestyle modification via diet, exercise, and behavioral therapy is considered the primary treatment of obesity, most people cannot achieve or maintain weight loss without the help of pharmacotherapy or surgery. Since 2013 many professional societies for Internal Medicine, Obesity, Endocrinology, and Cardiology have endorsed pharmacotherapy for patients with a BMI of ≥30 or ≥27 with obesity-related complications who were struggling to achieve their weight goals with diet and exercise. However, this guideline was promptly furthered in 2016 to endorse pharmacotherapy as a first-line treatment for weight loss in patients with severe obesity-related comorbidities, even without the criteria of failing lifestyle modification.

Based on the 2007 FDA guidelines, any drug marketed for the treatment of obesity must produce a ≥5% weight reduction in at least 35% of the subjects studied in the trial with actual reduction of body fat measured by dual-energy absorptiometry and simultaneously demonstrate cardiovascular safety with improvements in metabolic parameters, such as lipid profile and blood pressure. In addition, all drugs have to undergo pre-marketing testing to ensure that they do not increase cardiovascular disease risk. The weight lost at the 12-week mark is considered an indicator of response to a particular drug. If adherence to the drug can be ensured and weight loss of 5% is not achieved in 12 weeks, the dose of the drug can be increased, combined with another drug, stopped altogether, or a new drug can be started. Obesity must be considered a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment as most patients who stop pharmacotherapy are prone to rebound weight gain. If lifestyle modification and drug therapy fail, bariatric surgery must be considered a sustainable weight loss option.

**I) Drugs of historical significance/withdrawn from the market for the treatment of obesity**

Thyroid hormone, dinitrophenol, amphetamines, aminorex, phenylpropanolamine, and ephedra alkaloids were used in the past for weight loss but subsequently withdrawn by the FDA for this specific indication due to side effects of sympathetic overactivity. Fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine were banned due to their association with heart disease. Rimonabant, a cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonist/inverse agonist, was also banned as it was associated with depression and suicide. Sibutramine was associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Lorcaserin was the latest drug to be withdrawn from the market by the FDA in February 2020 after the CAMELLIA-TIMI 61 trial showed that patients who were treated with lorcaserin long-term were at high risk of pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancers.

**II) Drugs approved by the FDA for a short term, i.e., ≤12 weeks for treatment of obesity**

These drugs are amphetamine analogs that increase central adrenergic and dopaminergic activity to induce weight loss. Unfortunately, they have multiple potential side effects of sympathetic overactivity, including agitation, irritability, hallucinations, nausea, and vomiting. They are contraindicated in patients with hypertension and hyperthyroidism as well as pregnant women. Amphetamine analog examples include phentermine (the most prescribed weight loss drug in the USA) at a dose of 15 to 37.5mg per day, diethylpropion 25 mg three times daily or 75mg extended-release daily, phendimetrazine 17.5mg to 70 mg two to three times a day, and benzphetamine 25mg to 50mg once to three times per day.

**III) Drugs approved by the FDA for the long-term treatment of obesity**

The FDA approved 5 drugs for the long-term treatment of obesity in the general population, as listed below. All five drugs have been studied in detail with multiple trials for efficacy, safety, and cardiometabolic benefits as per the FDA mandate. Below is a detailed mechanism of action, year of FDA approval, important trials that proved their benefits, approximate weight loss, dosing, contraindications, precautions, adverse effects, and important facts related to each drug.

Interestingly this trial excluded patients with a history of diabetes.

**IV) The FDA has approved 2 drugs exclusively for patients with specific genetic conditions causing obesity. These are:**

**1. Setmelanotide**

- Mechanism of action: Melanocortin 4 receptor agonist acting on the hypothalamus downstream of the leptin signaling pathway; increases satiety and decreases food consumption

- Year of FDA approval: November 2020

- Specific population: Patients with deficiencies in POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR genes (deemed pathogenic variants or variants of uncertain significance, confirmed on genetic testing) or with patients with Bardet Biedl syndrome

- Dosing: SQ 2mg daily (maximum dose 3mg daily)

- Contraindications: Patients with other causes of obesity, polygenic obesity, or benign variants of the genetic mutations

- Adverse effects: Hyperpigmentation, vomiting, nausea

**2. Metreleptin**

- Adult dosing for weight ≥40kg: SQ 2.5mg daily for males and 5mg daily for females (maximum dose 10mg/day)

- Contraindications: Partial lipodystrophy, established metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes with lipodystrophy, HIV related lipodystrophy

- Adverse effects: It can cause pancreatitis, generation of leptin neutralizing antibodies, abdominal pain, and headache. Hence it is monitored under the REMS program.

**V) Of note, certain medications FDA approved for other indications (depression, seizure disorder, and type 2 diabetes) can cause weight loss as a side effect**

These include fluoxetine, zonisamide, pramlintide, lixisenatide, dulaglutide, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, remogliflozin, sergliflozin, metformin, exenatide, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, octreotide, mirabegron, tadalafil, or bupropion alone. These are not to be prescribed routinely to patients for the indication of weight loss.

**VI) The newest drug awaiting FDA approval for the indication of obesity:**

**1. Tirzepatide**

- Mechanism of action: Commonly known as the "twincretin" due to its dual agonistic action on the incretins-Gastric Inhibitory Peptide (GIP) and GLP-1, which increase insulin response to oral glucose

- Important trials: SURPASS trials, which have compared tirzepatide to placebo, metformin, semaglutide, dulaglutide, other oral anti-hyperglycemic agents, and Insulin in various combinations, SURMOUNT-1 trial.

- Controversies surrounding the drug and trials: Some studies have shown that GIP is, in fact, obesogenic and there have been GIP antagonists developed to tackle obesity. GIP itself can contribute to hyperglycemia because of the stimulation of glucagon and can inhibit the effect of GLP-1 on decreasing food intake. Hence at least per laboratory data, using a GIP agonist is of limited utility. However, the trial investigators argue that GIP contributes more to the incretin effect than GLP-1, and GIP-induced weight loss is via glucagon's anti-lipogenic and anorexic action. Thus having a dual agonist was more effective than a single agent. Another criticism is that the dose of GLP-1 agonists used in the SURPASS trials to show superiority is suboptimal compared to the dose currently being studied to treat obesity.

- Weight loss: With the 15mg dose weekly, tirzepatide has shown 5.1kg weight reduction in Phase-1 trials and 11.3kg weight reduction in phase-2 trials. In the latest data published by Eli Lily, the SURPASS 2 trial comparing once-weekly SQ tirzepatide and a 1mg dose of SQ Semaglutide in addition to Metformin showed a weight reduction from baseline of 8.5% with the 5mg dose of Tirzepatide, 11% with the 10mg dose, and 13.1% with the 15mg dose which were all statistically significant over Semaglutide 1mg group.

- Dosing: SQ 5 to 15mg weekly. (In the SURPASS-2 trial, the drug was started at 2.5mg and titrated up 4 weekly to the desired dose)

- Adverse effects: Hypoglycemia with higher doses, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting

**Bariatric Surgeries for the Treatment of Obesity**

Bariatric surgeries provide a greater and more sustained weight loss than drug therapy. Bariatric surgery can also lead to a longer life expectancy, as shown in a recent study.
