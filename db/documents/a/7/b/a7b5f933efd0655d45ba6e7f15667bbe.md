This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of Pompe disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of glycogen storage disease II.
- Identify the physical exam findings associated with glycogen storage disease II.
- Outline the treatment and management of glycogen storage disease II.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by glycogen storage disease II.
