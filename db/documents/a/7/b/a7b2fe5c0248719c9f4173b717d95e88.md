Complications of a C2 fracture treatment include nonunion, malunion, and pseudoarthrosis formation. This risk is higher in those treated with the conservative approach. In patients treated with conservative therapy after initial therapy who present with nonunion, surgical correction is warranted.

Other complications of this disease are inherent with any surgical procedure, such as infection, especially osteomyelitis. Other complications include hardware failure and neurovascular injury.

In patients undergoing an anterior surgical approach, there is a risk of airway compromise that may lead to prolonged endotracheal intubation.
