Apical periodontitis is the local inflammation of the periapical tissues that originate from pulp disease.

Apical diseases can manifest with various clinical presentations, ranging from no obvious clinical signs or symptoms to severe destruction of the underlying bone, with or without a draining abscess. Therefore, proper identification, diagnosis, and treatment of apical diseases can prevent severe clinical signs and symptoms.
