Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)Â is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory arthritis and extra-articular involvement. It is a chronic inflammatory disorder caused in many cases by the interaction between genes and environmental factors, including tobacco, that primarily involves synovial joints.

There is no pathognomonic laboratory test for rheumatoid arthritis, which makes the diagnosis of this disease challenging in the early stages. A comprehensive clinical approach is required to make the diagnosis and prevent debilitating joint damage.
