FED usually manifests around the fourth decade of life and can be divided into four stages, which span 20 to 30 years. In the early stages, the majority of patients with FED are asymptomatic,

Stage 1 is indistinguishable from central corneal guttata (without FED), and it is therefore only identified after the patient progresses to later stages of the disease. In the second stage, the cornea decompensates, and corneal edema occurs. Patients may present with complaints of painless blurry vision and glare that is worse upon waking up in the morning, due to increased corneal hydration that occurs overnight from closed eyelids.

Slit-lamp examination is used to assess the extent of guttata, the confluence of guttata (indicating later stages of disease), and the degree of corneal edema, which becomes present at severe stages.

Slit-lamp examination in FED can also reveal anterior corneal epithelial changes that correlate with disease progression. In stage 2, microcysts will appear on the corneal surface that may be visualized with topical fluorescein and cobalt blue lighting. In stage 3, as extracellular fluid collects beneath the epithelium, epithelial defects may be seen. Subepithelial scarring occurs, and connective tissue pannus forms in stage 4. Over time, the peripheral cornea becomes vascularized, and stromal and epithelial edema decline.

In the few cases of non-guttate FED, guttata will not be present on slit lamp exam; however, marked edema and bullous keratopathy may be apparent.

Pachymetry measurement of central corneal thickness (CCT) is often used to aid in decision-making, as a CCT greater than 640 micrometers generally indicates corneal edema. However, patients with physiologically thinner corneas may present with advanced FED and CCT less than 600 micrometers.
