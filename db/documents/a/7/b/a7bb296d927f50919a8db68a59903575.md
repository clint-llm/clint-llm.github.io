Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid hormone. It is secreted by the zona glomerulosa, the outermost layer of the Adrenal cortex. Excess production of aldosterone is referred to as hyperaldosteronism. Hyperaldosteronism can initially present as mild or severe to refractory hypertension but can often go undiagnosed. HyperaldosteronismÂ can be of primary or secondary origin, presenting similarly but differentiated by a set of lab values and diagnostic studies. Treatment is specific to the individual causes of hyperaldosteronism.
