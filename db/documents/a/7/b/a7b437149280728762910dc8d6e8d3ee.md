Hyperthyroidism presents with relatively nonspecific signs and symptoms such as palpitations, increased frequency of bowel movements, and weight loss, among others. Therefore, other pathologies should be ruled out as possible explanations for the patient’s symptomatology.

For etiologies of hyperthyroidism, differential diagnoses can be made based on the physical findings of the thyroid gland. Palpation of a normal thyroid gland in the context of hyperthyroidism can be due to Graves disease, painless thyroiditis, or factitious hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis factitia). Graves disease can also present as a non-tender, enlarged thyroid.

Palpation of a tender enlarged thyroid may indicate De Quervain thyroiditis (subacute thyroiditis). Palpation of a single thyroid nodule is likely indicative of thyroid adenoma, and palpation of multiple thyroid nodules strongly indicates toxic multinodular goiter.

Other differential diagnoses include euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia (in which serum total T4 and T3 are elevated, but the TSH level is within normal limits) and struma ovarii.
