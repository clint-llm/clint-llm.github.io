Prevalence depends on the method of screening and the population evaluated. The risk of thyroid nodules is higher with increasing age, female gender, iron deficiency, and history of thyroid radiation.

In the adult population, physical examination alone may show a prevalence of 5% to 7% of thyroid nodules. Ultrasound shows a prevalence of 20% to 76% in this same population, which correlates to autopsy findings.

Thyroid nodules are approximately 4 times more common in women than men andÂ occur more often in individuals living in iodine-deficient geographic areas.
