The human respiratory tract is susceptible to microbial proliferation whenever the pathogens overcome the host defense mechanisms (mechanical barrier by hair and mucus, chemical opsonization by the secreted proteins, and immune action by alveolar macrophages).

The extracellular infectious form of Chlamydiae, the elementary body (EB), which is metabolically inactive, enters the respiratory tract via inhalation and then attaches to the mucosal surface. The EB enters the cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis differentiating into a reticulate body (RB) in the inclusion. RBs are metabolically active, capable of modifying host cell pathways, and replicating within 24 hours post-infection.

After about 48 to 72 hours, the RBs are finally released as EBs outside the cells by cell lysis and infect the neighboring cells, thus continuing the infection. The organism can escape the endocytic-lysosomal pathway of host cells to remain persistent within tissues under stressful conditions and reactivate when favorable condition resumes. This attributes to the chronic inflammatory state in the host that is often present in C. pneumonia infections.

Patients reinfected with C. pneumonia are reported to have less severe illness than those with evidence of primary infection.C. pneumonia causes patchy consolidation of the lung parenchyma as the exudate consisting of RBCs, neutrophils, and fibrin gathers in infected areas.
