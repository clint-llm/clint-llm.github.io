Labyrinthine fistulas are difficult to diagnose and are best managed by an interprofessional team approach. The most common presenting symptoms are hearing loss and vertigo, which can easily be misdiagnosed. It is important for the primary healthcare professional to get a detailed history and physical exam in order to properly differentiate a perilymph fistula from other similar diagnoses.

Otolaryngologists should be consulted on all suspected cases and be involved earlier in the disease process and assessment, especially when hearing loss is involved. If a neurotologist is available, they would be able to assess the candidacy of the patient for surgical intervention. If symptoms present in the hospital, nurses can be vigilant on whether the patient has an altered gait or if the patient has difficulty hearing or understanding what is being said to them. Although perilymph fistulas lead to increased mortality, prompt diagnoses of and proper treatment would improve morbidity and overall quality of life of the patient.
