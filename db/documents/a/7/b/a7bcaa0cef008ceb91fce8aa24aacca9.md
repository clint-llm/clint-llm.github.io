The MCL is innervated by the medial articular nerve, a branch of the saphenous nerve. Innervation is greatest in the epiligament and near the insertions. The ligament can perceive pain and process proprioception through specialized sensory mechanoreceptors like Ruffini endings, Pacinian corpuscles, Golgi receptors, and bare nerve endings. Complete MCL tears will completely disrupt the pattern of innervation.
