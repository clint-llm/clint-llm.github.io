Parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum. This is a non-enveloped, single-stranded, DNA virus belonging to the Parvoviridae family.

The virus has a tropism for red cell progenitor cells. While the virus is usually acquired from inhaling infected droplets, it can be passed vertically from the mother to the fetus and by transfusion of blood/blood products.
