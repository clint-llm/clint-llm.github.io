Weight-loss dietary supplements are widely used and available worldwide. Patients considering these supplements should talk to their healthcare providers. The entire healthcare team must understand the ingredients, risks, and potential benefits of supplements and assess patients accordingly.

Healthcare providers must consider what is known and unknown about each ingredient in a product before recommending its use. Manufacturers market supplements with a variety of claims, many of which have not been substantiated. Some preparations contain multiple ingredients that can cause harm by interacting with medications or causing organ dysfunction. Patients with hypertension, diabetes, cardiac, renal, and liver disease should consult their physicians before using any supplement, especially those marketed for weight loss.

Clinicians should complete a thorough history of prescription and over-the-counter medications and dietary supplements at all patient encounters. This list should be updated regularly and documented in the medical record. Patients should be encouraged to lead a healthy lifestyle with nutritious dietary choices and regular exercise to enhance their weight loss efforts. The interprofessional healthcare team should support the patient's weight loss journey to improve clinical outcomes. [Level 2]
