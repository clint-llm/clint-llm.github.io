**Transportation**

Proteins, produced on ribosomes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, are transferred to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum to be processed into vesicles for intracellular transport. Proteins are also responsible for targeting the vesicles through a series of interactions, which include receptor and substrate interactions. The Golgi apparatus is made up of the cis, medial, trans, and trans-Golgi network. James Rothman proposed in the 1980s that proteins processed by the Golgi apparatus are transported from one sac to the next in vesicles. This concept is important because it was not well understood how proteins could stay and act as Golgi specific enzymes, especially since virtually all Golgi enzymes are membrane proteins. This proposal led to three different theorized pathways by which proteins are processed and transported.

The three pathways are:

- Secretory

- Lysosomal

- Regulated

Secretory Transport

Constitutive secretion is a continuous pathway that takes place in all cells. It is thought to be how cells produce new plasma membranes. It's also how exocytosis occurs. Vesicles in the cytosol fuse with the plasma membrane. Fluid membranes facilitate membrane fusion because of the principle that "like dissolves like." This theory asserts that a signal and a complement receptor (which is on the Golgi) are necessary for sorting in the Golgi. This theory derives from the well-established concept that a signal and its complement receptor are fundamental components of all intracellular vesicular sorting.

Lysosomal Transport

Defined as the constitutive lysosomal pathway, this theory asserts that transport vesicles containing lysosomal enzymes form a lysosome when intracellular vesicles fuse vesicles formed from the plasma membrane during endocytosis. The lysosome is the site within a cell where macromolecules degrade into their respective monomers. (e.g., proteins, polysaccharides, polynucleotides, and lipids. These are the basic building blocks: amino acids, monosaccharides, nucleotides. There is no single building block for lipids, but fatty acids come closest. The cell reuses building blocks to make new macromolecules.

Regulated Transport

This regulated secretory pathway only takes place in cells specialized for secretion. (e.g., B lymphocytes secrete antibodies). Vesicle containing specialized proteins for secretion bud off of the trans-Golgi network region of the Golgi apparatus. The secretory vesicle then remains in the cytosol. The ligand binds to a ligand-binding site on the extracellular matrix facing transmembrane receptor protein. After binding to a ligand (e.g., neurotransmitter or hormone), this causes the receptor to undergo a conformational change, thus activating the signal transduction pathway. The signal transduction pathway could cause an increase in intracellular calcium levels. The extracellular concentration of calcium is 1x10(^-3). Intracellular calcium concentration is 1x10(^-7). Calcium influx activates the cell once intracellular concentration reaches 5x10^(-6)M. The cytosolic secretory vesicles then move to the plasma membrane for exocytosis.

Peptide Bonds

Peptide bonds form when the carboxyl group of the amino acid on the left attacks the amino group of the amino acid on the right. The amino terminal is always to the left. The carboxy-terminal is always to the right. The polarity of each amino acid is due to its R-group. A peptide bond has three features: plantar, restricted mobility, and trans configuration. Restriction enzymes are often utilized in laboratory procedures to sequence-specific proteins. The history of protein sequencing is beyond the scope of this article.

Disulfide Bonds

These are also known as disulfide bridges; these bonds form by nearby cysteine residues within the protein. The cysteine residue has a non-polar R group, more specifically, a sulfhydryl group. This bond is approximately 60 kilocalories per mole of energy. These strong covalent bonds result from chemical interaction associated with proteins that fold in the rough endoplasmic reticulum - this is because reducing agents break disulfide bonds, and the relatively high concentration of reducing agents in the cytosol break sulfur-sulfur bonds as soon as the bonds form. The main reducing agent in the cytosol is a tripeptide called glutathione. The classic Anfinsen's experiment is the basis of this understanding. The experiment utilized ribonuclease, a functional representation of a mature structure with numerous disulfide bonds. The experiment treated ribonuclease with reducing agents that denature the protein, specifically urea, which breaks all weak chemical bonds in the protein. Beta-mercaptoethanol was another reducing agent utilized. The result was a protein with no biological activity because it no longer had an active site. It is said to be a denatured form of the ribonuclease protein. The protein was then placed in water with the denaturing agent and a dialysis tubing. They replaced the external dialysis medium several times to remove as many denaturing molecules as possible. After dialysis, they found that the ribonuclease renatured into 100% functional status, which led to the conclusion that the primary structure determines the tertiary structure.

Biochemical Reactions

The most important proteins in the body are those that help with reactions. These are called enzymes, and their main job is to help the body generate energy. Reactions are always possible but not always favorable. Approximately 90% of the reactions that occur in the body would not operate at the appropriate speed required for life. Enzymes, therefore, act as "catalysts." Approximately 80% of reactions in the body would not occur if not for an enzyme being present to catalyze the reaction. Enzymes make reactions more probable by making them easier to occur. They bring substrates together in space and time. Enzymes lower the free energy of activation, which translates to less energy needed for a reaction to occur. Enzymes also stabilize the high energy substrate intermediate within a reaction and are not consumed in the reaction. An enzyme can be classified as globular if it's a highly folded polypeptide that often exhibits a spherical shape and is stabilized by weak chemical interactions.

Sources

Protein is a vital part of the human diet and is present in various foods, like eggs, meats, dairy, seafood legumes, nuts, and seeds. Irrespective of the source of the protein consumed, it gets broken down in reformed into new proteins in our bodies. These proteins do everything from fighting infections to helping cells divide. The L-isomer of each amino acid is usually the more biologically relevant form as compared to the D isomer.

Classification of Amino Acids

While there are hundreds of amino acids in nature, humans use only 20 of them. One way to further classify them is by defining which ones healthy bodies can and cannot make.

The three classes of proteins are:

- Non-Essential

- Conditionally Essential

- Essential

**Non-Essential Amino Acids**

There are five amino acids termed non-essential because they can be obtained from foods and also generated within the body.

The non-essential amino acids are:

- Alanine

- Asparagine

- Aspartic acid

- Glutamic acid

- Serine

**Conditionally-Essential Amino Acids**

There are six amino acids termed conditionally-essential because healthy bodies can generate them under normal physiologic conditions. They become essential under certain conditions lIke starvation or inborn errors of metabolism.

The conditionally essential amino acids are:

- Arginine

- Cysteine

- Glutamine

- Glycine

- Proline

- Tyrosine

**Essential Amino Acids**

There are nine amino acids termed essential because they cannot be generated within the body. Dietary protein, therefore, provides these amino acids, which are needed to make certain hormones and other important molecules.

The essential amino acids are:

- Histidine

- Isoleucine

- Leucine

- Lysine

- Methionine

- Phenylalanine

- Threonine

- Tryptophan

- Valine
