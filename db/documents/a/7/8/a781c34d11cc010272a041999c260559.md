First described by Andral and Cruveilhier in 1830, Melanosis coli is a condition associated with the deposition of lipofuscin (not melanin as the name might imply) in the lamina propria of the large intestines. Historically, laxatives, primarily from the anthranoid group (i.e., senna and rhubarb derivatives), are the main culprits. As these laxative supplements pass through the colon, they become active and cause cell death and apoptosis in the lining of the colon, eventually causing dark pigmentation of the colon. This activity reviews the cause of melanosis coli and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of melanosis coli.
- Describe the presentation of melanosis coli on colonoscopy.
- Summarize the treatment of melanosis coli.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by melanosis coli.
