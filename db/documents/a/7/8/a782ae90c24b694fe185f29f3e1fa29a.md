Vaginitis is a global problem in teenage and adult females. The three common causes include bacterial, vaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. While many cases are asymptomatic, thousands of women go to their primary health care provider regularly for treatment; in addition, many more self-treat themselves with over the counter products. In view of these statistics, besides the primary healthcare provider, the role of the nurse and pharmacist is invaluable in education. These two health professionals should educate women on safe sex practices and STD counseling. Pharmacists should also verify the medication selected and appropriate dosing for the specific condition, and alert the prescriber if there are any concerns. Pharmacists also counsel on appropriate administration, reinforcing nursing counsel. To prevent recurrent infections, they should be taught proper toileting and wiping techniques. Patients should be reminded that douching also increases the risk of vaginitis. The pharmacist should educate women on the proper use of over the counter products and when to see a healthcare provider.

**Outcomes**

In most women, vaginitis has an excellent outcome and cure is possible. However, recurrence is common and can lead to excoriations, chronic irritation, and scarring. In addition, these symptoms also lead to low libido and a decline in sexual function. Both emotional stress and psychosocial issues are not uncommon.
