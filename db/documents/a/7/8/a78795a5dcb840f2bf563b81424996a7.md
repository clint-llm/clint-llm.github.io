The anterior and lateral aspects of the abdomen are supplied by the superior and inferior epigastric arteries, vertically, and the lateral segmental arteries (branching from the intercostal and lumbar arteries), horizontally. These superficial abdominal vessels are found deep to the Camper's fascia and superficial to the Scarpa's fascia. These structures mark an important landmark for surgery, as to avoid damaging the vessels and lymphatics running through this area.
