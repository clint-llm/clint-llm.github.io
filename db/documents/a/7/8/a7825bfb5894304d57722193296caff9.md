Practitioners should check the patient's lipid profile within 4 to 8 weeks of starting treatment with follow-up checks every 6 to 12 months to monitor the effectiveness of therapy.

In 2006, The National Lipid Association's Statin Task Force stated that routine monitoring of liver enzymes in asymptomatic patients is not recommended as the risk of severe liver injury is uncommon.

Moderate-intensity therapy is expected to result in an LDL reduction of 30% to 50% from baseline, while a high-intensity regimen can result in a reduction of more than 50% from baseline.

When combining ezetimibe with statins or fenofibrate, monitor LFTs and signs of cholelithiasis. The recommendation is to discontinue the use of ezetimibe if ALT elevations are greater than three times the upper limit of normal persist.

Fibrate use requires monitoring with liver function tests, renal function tests, and CBC due to the risk for pancytopenia.

Nicotinic acid needs monitoring of blood sugar, coagulation profile, and liver function.
