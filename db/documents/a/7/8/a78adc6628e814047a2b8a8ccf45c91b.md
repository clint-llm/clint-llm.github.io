The upper urinary-collecting system consists of the kidneys of which the renal papillae are the first gross structure of the upper urinary tract. These papillae are individually cupped by the minor calyx, which then goes to the infundibulum and combines to form the major calyces. The major calyces then come together to form the renal pelvis. Urine then flows from the renal pelvis into the bilateral ureters, which consist of fibromuscular tubes and terminate in the bladder. The ureters are narrowest at the ureteropelvic junction, ureterovesical junction, and when they cross the common iliac vessels, which will be clinically important. The lower urinary tract system consists of the bladder and urethra. The urethra connects with the bladder neck and is the final destination for urine to flow through before exiting the body.

The histological anatomy of the urinary tract is composed of a specialized epithelium called urothelium (transitional epithelium), which is characterized by proteins known as uroplakins. However, recent research suggests that different parts of the urinary tract have distinctive epithelium. Some areas, such as the ureters, contain fewer amounts of uroplakins and cytoplasmic fusiform vesicles than bladder urothelium. The bladder, in particular, contains a large number of ‘umbrella cells,’ which are large, multinucleated luminal cells that can form large urothelial plaques. Urothelial stem cells are believed to reside within the basal cell layers. The bladder is also mostly composed of smooth muscle and collagen.
