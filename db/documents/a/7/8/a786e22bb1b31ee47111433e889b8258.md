Factor XIII, also known by the name fibrin stabilizing factor, is a key clotting factor in the coagulation cascade known for stabilizing the formation of a blood clot. The plasma form of Factor XIII is a protein heterodimer of A and B subunits expressed by bone marrow and mesenchymal lineage cells remarkable for its function as a transglutaminase of catalyzing cross-linkage peptide reactions.
