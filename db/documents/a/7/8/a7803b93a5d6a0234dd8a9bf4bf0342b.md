Patients seek an ally in the clinician, but it is important not to accept the delusion as it eventually results in confusing the patientâ€™s reality and leads to distrust.

Perceptions: Usually no abnormal perceptions are present. Auditory hallucinations may be present in some.

Thought: This is the primary abnormality in delusional disorder. The delusions are not bizarre and are clear as well as systematic for example a cheating spouse, persecutory delusions. It is essential to check the patient's belief before concluding it to be a delusion. Some patients are verbose and circumstantial when describing their delusions. Bizarre delusions more likely correlate with schizophrenia.

Cognition: Memory and cognition are usually intact, and patients are oriented unless there is a specific delusion about person, place, or time.
