Two tests exist forÂ detecting the levels of CA 125. The original test is a radioimmunoassay using OC 125 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the antigenic determinants on the CA 125 glycoprotein. The second-generation CA 125 test uses two antibodies; OC 125 and M 11.

These tests are made available by different commercial manufacturers in different versions, such as immunoradiometric assay (IRMA)and enzyme immunoassay (EIA), etc. When using these tests to monitor patients longitudinally, the tests conducted should preferably be of the same manufacturer, and the same version as different kits and versions can result in different absolute values and test sensitivity.
