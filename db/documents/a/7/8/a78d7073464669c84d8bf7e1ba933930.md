Cancer may also arise from proto-oncogenic genes, which then mutate to become oncogenic or tumor-promoting genes. Mismatch repair during DNA synthesis in the cell cycle is an important mechanism that can halt continuation in the cycle for base pairs to be replaced before cell division. Proteins calledÂ Mismatch repair proteins are a group of 7 proteins that are important in repairing these mismatched sequences to prevent excessive growth. These proteins play a crucial role in DNA stabilization and can often lead to genetic instability, causing forms of the colon or rectal cancers that form on the right colon.

Additionally, cancer may also form from a lack of control during DNA sequence breaks. When DNA is damaged, and double-stranded breaks occur, most commonly from UV stress; ATM and ATR proteins can stop cell division until the strand is repaired. If the stand break occurs during the S phase of the cycle, several different proteins can find the homologous strand of the chromosome and use that as a template to reform the damaged DNA. If no similar strand is available, as in other phases of the DNA cycle, a nonhomologous repair can still occur but at the risk of forming a mutation from the newly repaired DNA.
