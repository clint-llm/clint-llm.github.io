PLD is a progressive disease, and only a small subset of patients develop severe symptoms. Supportive management with as-needed analgesics is the first-line treatment in PLD patients with acute or chronic abdominal pain. The primary aim of PLD treatment is focused on the reduction in liver volume to improve symptoms and quality of life.
