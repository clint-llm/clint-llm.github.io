**Initial And Symptom-Oriented Treatment**

Owing to the simulation of symptoms of acute intermittent porphyria by several abdominal, metabolic, and neuropsychiatric conditions, establishing a confirmed diagnosis forms the core of the management of AIP.

Avoidance of precipitants, especially drugs, requires extreme emphasis, ingraining it in the patient and relatives' psyche. (vide infra)

When a patient with confirmed AIP presents with an acute attack, the usual first approach is to load the patient with a high carbohydrate diet or intravenously administered dextrose to inhibit hepatic ALAS1 transcription. Administration of 10% dextrose in 0.45% saline should start immediately. If the patient does not present with weakness, vomiting, or hyponatremia, a trial of a high carbohydrate diet for 48 hours before starting specific treatment is the current recommendation.

For pain, parenteral opiates are the best option (morphine, diamorphine, and fentanyl). Nausea and vomiting are controllable with prochlorperazine, promazine, and ondansetron.  These symptoms usually start abating in 72 to 96  hours.

**Specific Treatment**

Intravenous administration of heme is the specific therapy. It replenishes the hepatocyte heme pool and down-regulates ALAS1, resulting in reduced production of porphyrin precursors and corresponding improvement in symptoms.

Owing to the delayed effect of heme therapy on reducing plasma ALA and PBG levels, intravenous heme therapy (IHT) should be administered without delay in severe acute attacks and maintained for four days (3 to 4 mg/kg of heme/day). A response usually appears on the third day with a decrease of urine and serum PBG. Panhematin administration should be through a large peripheral vein or central line due to the risk of phlebitis in small veins, a risk also reduced by preparing it with human albumin instead of water. Other complications are an increase in prothrombin time during the first 2 hours and increased iron production in the liver. Patient discharge can take place when parenteral opioids can stop, and they can tolerate oral drugs.

Excepting occasional complaints of headache or pyrexia, IHT is well tolerated. However, there are inherent risks associated with recurrent treatments with IHT, of which every caregiver should be cognizant.

**Risks Associated With Recurrent IHT**

The following enumerates the significant issues associated with recurrent IHT - the need to replace the venous access to prevent thromboembolic disease, risk of liver fibrosis, hepatic iron overload, and development of therapeutic 'tolerance' to heme infusion. Research has shown that heme infusion can induce the expression of hepatic heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1, EC 1.14.99.3, HGNC: 5013).

Currently, the only established cure for acute intermittent porphyria is orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) with a reported survival rate of around 80%.

Some studies are looking for other alternatives. These are in different phases of clinical trials, and this CME chapter at present, only seeks to inform the readers of these potential and futuristic therapies:

**Potential/Experimental Therapies For AIP**

**Enzyme Replacement Therapy [ERT]**- Based on the experience of administering doses of recombinant human HMBS/PBGD (rhPBGD) protein in a mouse model of AIP that reduced plasma PBG accumulation during an acute attack induced after phenobarbital challenge, in 2002 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted recombinant human HMBS/PBGD an orphan designation (EU/3/ 02/103). Researchers conducted clinical trials in healthy subjects, asymptomatic HMBS-deficient subjects with increased porphyrin precursor excretion, and AIP patients with repeated attacks.

**Liver Gene Therapy**- Clinical trials using two strategies, HMBS-gene therapy and interference RNA for ALAS1 gene inhibition, are being conducted in patients with AIP. The two strategies include  - the delivery of the HMBS gene to the hepatocytes using a viral vector. The other option is a small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against aminolevulinic acid synthase, with the objective of reducing delta ALA production. Both of them are still in the trial phase and await approval, pending larger trials that would hopefully provide consistent efficacy and safety.
