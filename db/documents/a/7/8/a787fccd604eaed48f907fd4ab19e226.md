The prognosis of non-diabetic hypoglycemia varies, depending on the cause. Hypoglycemia secondary to IEM needs lifelong treatment and follow-up. Hypoglycemia secondary to hormone deficiency responds well to replacement. Drug-induced or factitious hypoglycemia requires stopping the offending medication.

The prognosis of insulinoma is dependent on staging. Most patients with benign insulinomas have favorable outcomes with surgical resection. However, the prognosis is variable in patients with malignant insulinoma.

The prognosis of hypoglycemia due to bariatric surgery is variable and may require reversal of the procedure.
