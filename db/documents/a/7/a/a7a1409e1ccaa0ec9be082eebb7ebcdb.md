The utilization of peripheral ultrasound-guided nerve blocks helps provide a viable alternative to procedural sedation, which has potential risks and is both labor and time-intensive to both patients and physicians. The use of ultrasound has been classified as Level 1b evidence for faster block onset and higher rates of block success by the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine. An ultrasound-guided radial nerve block, alone or combined with other treatments, represents a therapeutic resource for treating multiple different types of pain and clinical entities.
