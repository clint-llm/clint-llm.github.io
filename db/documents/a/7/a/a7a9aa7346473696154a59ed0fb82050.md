The primary inciting infection involves streptococci. Most facial infections are due to Group A streptococcus while non-group A streptococcus involves more of the lower extremity. In a prospective study in Norway, researchers concluded that beta-hemolytic streptococci were the leading cause of facial cellulitis.

There is little supporting evidence that staphylococcus plays a role in erysipelas.

Risk factors for erysipelas include the following:

- Excising the saphenous vein for bypass

- Lymphatic edema (major risk factor)

- Lymphatic obstruction

- Arteriovenous fistula

- Status post-surgeryÂ (eg mastectomy)

- Nephrotic syndrome

- Immunocompromised state
