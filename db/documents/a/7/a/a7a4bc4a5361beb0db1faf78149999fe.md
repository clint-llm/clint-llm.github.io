Type I PS has a relatively good prognosis for the intellectual outcome. The prognosis for types II and III is very poor due to neurodevelopmental complications, with death in childhood common.

A patient’s prognosis depends on the severity of the syndrome, but craniofacial appearance usually improves with age. More recently, Robin et al. reviewed a clinical course of seven children with Pfeiffer syndrome type III and found that, while the children had severe manifestations, they had favorable outcomes with aggressive medical and surgical management.
