While the histology is well-described, the etiology of adenomyosis is not known definitively. Researchers have postulated several theories. The most commonly accepted theory is that adenomyosis results from a disrupted boundary between the deepest layer of the endometrium (endometrium basalis) and the underlying myometrium. This process leads to a cycle of inappropriate endometrial proliferation into the myometrium with subsequent small vessel angiogenesis as well as adjacent myometrial smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Data demonstrating a higher prevalence of adenomyosis following dilation and curettage and cesarean section support this theory.

A second theory proposes an embryologic mechanism whereby pluripotent Mullerian stem cells undergo inappropriate differentiation leading to ectopic endometrial tissue. This theory has support from evidence demonstrating altered expression of specific genetic markers, in addition to case reports of endometrial tissue found in women with Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome (Mullerian agenesis).

Other less well-accepted theories propose altered lymphatic drainage pathways and displaced bone marrow stem cells to explain the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue.
