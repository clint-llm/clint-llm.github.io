HTLV-1: Definitive diagnosis of viral infection is with a range of serological tests; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is often employed as a screening test followed by a Western Blot as a confirmatory study to identify antibodies produced to the specific gag and env proteins of HTLV-1. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is advantageous in its ability to quantify proviral load and to differentiate between HTLV-1 and HTLV-2.

ATLL: A significantly raised white blood count is usually present on presentation. Examination of peripheral blood cells and bone marrow is necessary for diagnosis and sub-classification of ATLL. Pathognomic morphological features of leukemic ATLL lymphocytes include dense chromatin with lobulated nuclei, which have the appearance of a cloverleaf and are sometimes referred to as “flower cells.”

Several markers have been identified to be predictive of disease progression, including serum CD25, thymidine kinase, and neuron-specific enolase though these tests are rarely available outside of specialist centers.

**HAM/TSP:**The World Health Organisation produced diagnostic criteria for HAM/TSP in 1988 comprising clinical, imaging, and laboratory tests, though, in clinical practice, newer techniques such as PCR quantification of HTLV-1 viral load in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is usually incorporated into a new diagnosis.

It is important to note that there is potential for significant confusion regarding the nomenclature of other human T cell lymphotropic viruses. HTLV-3 was the name initially given to the virus we now recognize as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). HTLV-4 was previously used synonymously with HIV-2. This confusion has been demonstrated in clinical practice where more than 90% of diagnostic HTLV test requests were intended for HIV diagnosis.
