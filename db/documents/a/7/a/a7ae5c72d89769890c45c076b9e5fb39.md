Due to the limited predictive power of Ann Arbor staging for both HL and NHL, clinical prognostic models are developed to help clinicians in conveying prognostic information to patients. Several models have been developed, which include HL international prognostic score, international prognostic index (IPI) for DLBCL, and FL international prognostic index (FLIPI) for follicular lymphoma. Low IPI score predicts a better outcome and high IPI a worse outcome.
