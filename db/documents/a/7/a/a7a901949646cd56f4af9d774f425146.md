The most common adverse events associated with bumetanide include hyperuricemia (characteristic of all loop diuretics), hypochloremia, hypokalemia, azotemia, and hyponatremia. Other, less common adverse effects include hyperglycemiaÂ and increased serum creatinine. muscle weakness, and hearing impairment.

Rare but significant or potentially life-threatening adverse reactions include hypotension (including orthostatic hypotension), encephalopathy (in instances of pre-existing hepatic disease), and renal failure.

All loop diuretics exhibit potent diuresis capabilities, and excessive amounts can lead to significant diuresis with fluid and electrolyte loss; close medical supervision is necessary when administering these agents.
