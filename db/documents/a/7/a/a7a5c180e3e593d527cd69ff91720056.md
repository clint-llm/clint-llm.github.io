Thalassemias are a common cause of microcytic anemia and are due to impaired synthesis of the globin protein component of hemoglobin. Beta-thalassemia is an inherited disease with a wide phenotypic severity of the disease. Manifestations of the disease occur in the form of chronic anemia as well as significant pathology associated with bone marrow expansion and extramedullary hematopoiesis. This activity reviews the evaluation and management principles of beta-thalassemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of beta-thalassemia.
- Explain the evaluation of beta-thalassemia.
- Summarize the treatment options available for beta-thalassemia.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with beta-thalassemia.
