Abdominal surgeries associated with afferent loop syndrome are relatively more complex procedures and can cause multiple early and late complications. During the early postoperative period, abdominal pain and nausea are both nonspecific and relatively common. In addition to ALS, clinicians should consider postoperative ileus, anastomotic leak, transient partial obstruction at the anastomosis secondary to edema/inflammation, bile reflux, acute iatrogenic pancreatitis, and postoperative fluid collections. Nausea and vomiting may be related to analgesia or metabolic disturbances. Patients reporting severe abdominal pain or progressive symptoms should undergo imaging evaluation. Chronic ALS presents with likewise non-specific symptoms that may present with internal hernias and adhesions without obstruction, mesenteric ischemia, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, chronic pancreatitis, biliary colic, and gallstone-related disease.
