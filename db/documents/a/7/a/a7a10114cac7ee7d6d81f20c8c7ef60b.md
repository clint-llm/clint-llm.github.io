Complications associated with the inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) vary in severity. Mucosal tearing during the progression or withdrawal of the needle may cause pain and trismus.

Facial paralysis is a rare but reported complication of the IANB. This paralysis may be immediate or delayed.

Immediate facial paralysis occurs soon after the injection and resolves within approximately three hours.

Delayed facial nerve paralysis occurs within several hours to days after IANB, and the recovery time may range from 24 hours to several months.

Paralysis of the lingual nerve, paresthesia, or dysesthesia has also been reported. Other infrequent complications include ptosis, extraocular muscle paralysis, skin necrosis over the chin, diplopia, and abducens nerve palsy.
