- Mantle cell lymphoma is a rare and conventionally aggressive B-cell lymphoma with a heterogeneous disease profile.

- Cases are typically diagnosed with diffuse cyclin D1 positivity by immunohistochemistry or FISH for t(11;14).

- Rare cases that are negative for cyclin D1 for t(11;14) are positive for SOX11 by immunohistochemistry.

- High Ki67 proliferation index and p53 mutations are adverse prognostic findings and likely imply the need for more prompt treatment and clinical trial enrollment if no good response.

- Chemoimmunotherapy is conventionally the choice as front-line therapy among patients necessitating treatment with a potential role of targeted therapies in the salvage setting.

- The role of autologous and allogeneic bone marrow transplant and stratifying patients as transplant eligible and ineligible in choosing the treatment choices are elucidated.

- The role of second-generation drugs in improving outcomes and the side effects of these drugs are discussed.

- Investigational new drugs alone and in combination are described.  Risk-adapted approaches in the pipeline for improving the care of mantle cell lymphoma patients discussed.
