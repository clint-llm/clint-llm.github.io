**Reduction Technique**

For simple lateral dislocations (most common), many dislocations will spontaneously reduce. A non-analgesic reduction attempt is encouraged. Calm and reassuring education can easily prepare the ideal patient. This education requires only a brief explanation of the presumed diagnosis, a description of the rapid reduction process, and the dramatic reduction in pain upon completion. The patient is placed in a supine, seated position. The patient should have their hips in slight flexion, helping to avoid contraction of the patellar tendon.

For lateral dislocations, passively extend the knee into slight hyperextension while applying gentle medial pressure to the lateral edge of the patella. For a one-person reduction, maintain one supporting hand near the posterior ankle, giving weighted leverage to the patient’s leg. This technique seems to allow both better leverage and monitoring/sensing for resisting quadricep tension development which can make reduction more challenging. More challenging patients or patients with increased anxiety/pain may require a small analgesic to accomplish the same above method.

Post reduction views should include AP, lateral, and sunrise/merchant views to ensure successful reduction and assess for patellar avulsion or osteochondral injury of the lateral femoral condyle.
