Colestipol is a bile acid sequestrant used for various indications. It is FDA-approved as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia who do not respond to diet alone. It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with a statin, niacin, or ezetimibe. Doses of 4 to 16 grams per day are associated with a 12 to 24% reduction in LDL cholesterol, respectively.

Combination therapy with simvastatin is associated with a 52% reduction of LDL cholesterol.

**Other Clinical Applications**

- Colestipol may be used in the treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Although it is effective for this indication, it is poorly tolerated due to gastrointestinal side effects.

- Pruritus associated with cholestasis, particularly in primary sclerosing cholangitis, may be treated with colestipol.

- A prospective, controlled trial with 92 patients performed by Hagag et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of colestipol as an adjunct therapy to methimazole for treating hyperthyroidism.

- In a study of 141 patients evaluating the role of bile acids in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), treatment with colestipol improved IBS symptoms (IBS severity scoring system 220 +/- 109 vs. 277 +/- 106).

- Colestipol has been successfully used to treat digoxin toxicity in patients taking this drug. Colestipol interrupts the enterohepatic circulation of digoxin and increases its fecal excretion. One case report by Payne et al. reported a reduced half-life of elimination of 55 hours compared to a predicted half-life of elimination of 85 hours.
