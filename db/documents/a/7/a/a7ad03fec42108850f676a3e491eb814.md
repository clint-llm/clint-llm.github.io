DM is associated with increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and treating blood pressure, statin use, regular exercise, and smoking cessation are of great importance in ameliorating risk. The overall excess mortality in those with T2DM is around 15% higher but varies widely. The prevalence of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy in the United States is about 4.4% among adults with diabetes, while it is 1% for end-stage renal disease. Today, with pharmacotherapy for hyperglycemia, as well as lowering LDL cholesterol and managing blood pressure with ACE/ARB therapy, with otherÂ antihypertensive medications and aspirin in secondary prevention, vascular complications can be managed adequately, resulting in a reduction in morbidity and mortality.
