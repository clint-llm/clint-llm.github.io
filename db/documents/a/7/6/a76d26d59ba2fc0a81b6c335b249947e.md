**Children**

Children rarely require treatment for pes planus. Foot orthotics are indicated for foot pain secondary to pesÂ planus alone or combination with leg, knee, and back pain.

**Adults**

In adults, treatment is based on etiology. Foot orthotics and NSAIDS are sufficient for pain. The patient should be counseled on proper footwear. Patients with pes planus could benefit from motion control shoes. Obese patients should be counseled to lose weight through diet and exercise. For posterior tibial dysfunction, treatment initially consists of rest, NSAIDs, and orthotics. Surgery is reserved for cases resistant to therapy.
