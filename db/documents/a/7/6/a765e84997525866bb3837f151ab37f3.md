Clinical features of hookworm infections are usually non-specific and could be misleading. Proper understanding of the epidemiology, clinical features, and laboratory findings is crucial in diagnosis.

Stool microscopy is the mainstay tool for diagnosis but with some limitations. It is useful in identifying and quantifying hookworm eggs. In hospitals, labs tend to use egg concentration techniques, while for screening and public health control, simple tests as Kato-Katz techniques are options; those are usually used in epidemiological studies because they provide an indirect measure of worm burden. Precision is limited by variations in egg production, especially with less severe infections. IgG4 assay might identify recent infection but remains non-specific.

Eosinophilia raises suspicion of hookworm infection but non-specific. Systemic and mucosal eosinophilia is widely present in hookworm infections. It is detectable in the blood even before reaching the intestine and peaks after adult worms reach intestinal mucosa.

Capsule endoscopy might show parasites, but it is rarely used to diagnose infection. Computer-aided detection of hookworms on capsule endoscopy images is still challenging; the ultimate goal is to use automatic detection models to assist diagnosis more accurately than experienced endoscopists.
