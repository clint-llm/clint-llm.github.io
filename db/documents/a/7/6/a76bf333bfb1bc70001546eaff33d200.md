Vaginal atrophyÂ occurs in conditions causing a diminished estrogen state. Estrogen typically stimulates exfoliation of vaginal epithelial cells, causing increased levels of glycogen in which vaginal flora lactobacilli convert into lactic acid. This process allows for the replacement of older vaginal epithelium, keeping the typical acidic pH of the vaginal canal. As estrogen levels decrease, this process is hindered, and the vaginal epithelium becomes atrophic with diminished secretions and a less acidic environment (pH >5).
