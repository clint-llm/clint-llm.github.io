Computed tomography (CT) utilizes helically acquired x-rays and postprocessing techniques to generate cross-sectional images. Modern CT scanners receive x-ray attenuation data in a nearly isotropic manner, which allows the generation of voxels that can be reconstructed in coronal, sagittal, and three-dimensional formats. As with the limitations of plain radiographs, the brain soft tissues are poorly evaluated on routine CT examinations because the attenuation characteristics of the brain soft tissues and many pathologies are similar. Iodinated intravenous contrast can highlight the vascular structures of the brain or areas of disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Seizure activity may result in increased cortical enhancement due to increased cortical perfusion but is typically an unanticipated observation in patients that are not suspected of seizures rather than a sought out diagnostic finding. As such, CT plays a limited role in the imaging workup of patients considering epilepsy surgery.
