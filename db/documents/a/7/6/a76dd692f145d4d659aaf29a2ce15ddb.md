Patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis that go untreated into adulthood can have a rate of progression that is approximately 0.5 to 1 degree per year once the patient has reached a 50-degree coronal angle. Furthermore, in gross generalization, curves in adulthood tend to be much stiffer and more rigid than in the adolescent cohort requiring more aggressive and invasive surgical techniques.

Long term studies report a higher rate of arthritis and poor perception of body image in patients with scoliosis, irrespective of treatment. Further, if the surgical correction involves chest wall invasion, it may also result in pain and decreased lung function.
