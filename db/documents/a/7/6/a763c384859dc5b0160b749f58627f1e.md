The three ossicles are derived from the neural crest of the first and second pharyngeal arches during the sixth week of development. The malleus and incus are predominantly derived from the first arch from a structure called Meckel's cartilage. The stapes is formed from the second arch from a structure called Reichert's cartilage. Interestingly, outer portions of the stapes footplate are derived from the mesoderm. Throughout the fetal period, the ossicles fully ossify through a process of endochondral ossification. This process of ossification occurs initially with the incus at 16 weeks, malleus at 16-17 weeks, and the stapes at 18 weeks. Ossification continuesÂ for up to 26 weeks.
