A significant component of an assessment for a patient who presents with signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease is history and physical exam. These should include vital signs (respiratory rate, blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate), review of the patient's medication list, and an electrocardiogram. During their evaluation, the patient should have an assessment for any underlying or comorbid valvular heart disease or heart failure.

A healthcare provider should consider thyroid function testing, pulmonary function testing, routine blood work, including cardiac enzymes, chest X-ray, and echocardiography as part of their initial evaluation. If the initial assessment and evaluation are performed on an urgent basis, intravenous access should be obtained and, if no contraindication exists, the patient should be administered aspirin (162 to 325 mg) and nitrates. If available, patients should be placed on a cardiac monitor and should be assessed with pulse oximetry for the need for supplemental oxygen.
