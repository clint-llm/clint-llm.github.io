**Early Team Discharge in Patients with STEMI after PCI**

In low-risk patients with ST-elevation MI, who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention, early discharge (defined as discharge at 72 hours) had shown improved outcomes.

One study used the Zwolle risk index and classified two-third of its patients at low risk of 3 or less [classified as a low risk]. Mortality for these patients was 0.1% at 2 days and 0.2% from 2 to 10 days post; therefore, it was suggested that such patients could be discharged safely after 48 hours of PCI.

PAMI-2 Trial had low-risk patients after PCI assigned to accelerated care or traditional care. Patients with accelerated care received a discharge on day 3. They showed a significant cost reduction. There was no difference in mortality, unstable angina, reinfarction, stroke, and heart failure between the 2 groups at 6 months.
