Anetoderma has been classified into five different subtypes, including primary (idiopathic) anetoderma, secondary anetoderma from a preceding dermatosis, drug-induced anetoderma, familial anetoderma, and prematurity associated anetoderma. The primary type occurs in areas of previously normal skin, and this type is historically subdivided into the Jadassohn-Pellizzari type and the Schweninger-Buzzi type. The Jadassohn-Pellizzari type of anetoderma develops after preceding inflammatory or urticarial lesions transpire, while the Schweninger-Buzzi type develops in normal-appearing skin with no foreshadowing skin changes. The two primary types are identical histologically and have a similar disease course,Â and so these terms are now antiquated.

The secondary type of anetoderma develops in areas of pathologic skin. The most common associated dermatoses are thought to be acne vulgaris and varicella but have also occurred with other disorders such as syphilis, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, leprosy, Lyme disease, mastocytosis, prurigo nodularis, urticaria pigmentosa, granuloma annulare, insect bites, xanthomas, pilomatricomas, cutaneous B or T-cell lymphomas,

Penicillamine is the sole medication linked to drug-induced anetoderma. Penicillamine is thought to inhibit aldol-cross-linking, which is important for elastic fiber formation.
