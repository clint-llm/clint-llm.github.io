There are major changes that occur at all levels of the skin that characterize the histology of sunburn, particularly in the epidermis and dermis. In the epidermis, loss of Langerhans cells and vacuolated keratinocytes were noted in sunburned skin cells. The dermis experienced vascular changes that could be seen within thirty minutes of exposure to radiation that included enlargement of endothelial cells and edema caused by mast cell degranulation. Histamine and prostaglandin E2 levels rose 4-fold after the exposure of UV radiation, providing evidence that histamine plays a role in a sunburn reaction of the skin. This was all reversed after 24 hours from the exposure of UV radiation.
