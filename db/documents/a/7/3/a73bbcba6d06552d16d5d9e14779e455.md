Predicting which patients with TB infection will developÂ tuberculous meningitis is difficult. Children with MTB, especially that aged 0 to 4, have a higher incidence of TBM. This infection is more prevalent in the developing world, with a higher incidence of MTB in children. By contrast, in the developed world, TBM is more often seen in adults who experience the reactivation of TB. Other immunocompromised states like chronic steroid use, diabetes mellitus, and chronic alcoholism carry the same risk of developing TBM.
