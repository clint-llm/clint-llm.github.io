Unlike breast carcinoma, phyllodes tumors start outside of the lobules, and ducts, in the breast’s connective tissue, called the stroma, including the ligaments and fatty tissue surrounding the lobules, ducts, lymph, and blood vessels in the breast. In addition to epithelial cells from the ducts and lobules, phyllodes tumors can also contain stromal cells.

**Molecular Features**

Recent studies have focused on defining a molecular classification of phyllodes tumors. Comparative genomic hybridization studies showed recurrent chromosome imbalances, including +1q, −6q, −13q, −9p, −10p, and +5p. Although currently no chromosomal aberrations were found to be specific to phyllodes tumors, some authors reported that low-grade and high-grade (borderline/malignant) phyllodes tumors segregate in two genetic groups based on genomic alterations, with high-grade phyllodes tumors consistently showing 1q gain and 13q loss and low-grade phyllodes tumors showing few or no alterations.
