If adenoiditis is left untreated, the patient may develop chronic infection of the adenoids, which in some cases can lead to the development of a biofilm. The adenoids may then serve as a nidus of infection for other closely related structures and lead to rhinosinusitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and otitis media.

**Adenoid Hypertrophy**

Adenoid hypertrophy is responsible for some of the more common complications related to disease of the adenoids. As the adenoids enlarge, the tissues can create a significant obstacle to the flow of air through the nasopharynx. This enlargement can cause mouth breathing, snoring, and OSA. OSA can be a life-threatening disease if left untreated and can interfere with cognitive, emotional, and behavioral development in children.

Enlarged adenoids may also obstruct the opening of the Eustachian tubes in the nasopharynx. Without proper function of the Eustachian tube, negative pressure can escalate in the middle ear, which can lead to tympanic membrane retraction and development of an effusion in the middle ear and/or mastoid cavity, which can cause conductive hearing loss and speech problems, as well as serve as a nidus for bacterial infections.

Long-standing adenoiditis with subsequent adenoid hypertrophy can lead to the development of what is known as adenoid facies or long-face syndrome. Enlarged adenoids can obstruct the nasopharynx and result in obligate mouth breathing, which may, in turn, lead to craniofacial abnormalities, including a high-arched palate and retrognathic mandible.
