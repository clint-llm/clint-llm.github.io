Advances in computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and other specialized imaging techniques have created great improvements in the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), benign renal neoplasms, and in characterizing the level of aggressiveness of RCC subtypes, which informs management decisions in these tumors. However, renal leiomyosarcoma is rare and does not have known specific imaging characteristics. Unlike other retroperitoneal tumors, CT is limited in the evaluation of renal LMS. The most important differential of renal LMS is renal cell carcinoma, which cannot be reliably differentiated with any radiological technique.
