- In patients under 50 years of age, the main entity on differential diagnosis is demyelinating optic neuritis and antibody-mediated (Aquaporin-4 and anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody) optic neuritis.

- Typically patients with**demyelinating optic neuritis**have pain on eye movements (present in over 94%), have no peripapillary hemorrhages (present in only 5% of patients with demyelinating optic neuritis), and most importantly, visual function recovers in the vast majority of patients as opposed to patients with NAION where visual acuity and visual field defect remain unchanged.

- Patients with **myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-associated optic neuritis**often do have swollen optic nerve with hemorrhages on presentation, but they also have a good visual prognosis with majority recovering visual function as opposed to patients with NAION.

- All patients should also be asked about their use of **amiodarone**as well as erectile dysfunction medications as amiodarone can present with simultaneous or sequential optic neuropathy that resembles NAION but can improve the following discontinuation of the drug.

- Use of **phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDI)**has been linked with the development of NAION, but this association remains unclear, and recommendation on stopping the use of these medications in patients with NAION should be made individually (i.e., has the onset of NAION been directly linked with PDI, the visual status of the patient, etc.).

- In patients over the age of 50, the main entity on the differential diagnosis is giant cell arteritis, and all patients over the age of 60 presenting with a swollen optic nerve should have the inflammatory markers checked in order to rule out this potentially treatable condition.

- Patients with **compressive optic neuropathies**can sometimes present with a swollen optic nerve, but they typically have a slow onset of visual loss rather than an acute one, as seen in NAION.
