Immune thrombocytopenic purpura can be divided into two classifications; acute and chronic. The acute form presents in childhood, affects both sexes, and may be prefaced by a viral infection. Most children (85%) have a benign course and do not require treatment. They can spontaneously recover within three months. The chronic form affects individuals between ages 20 to 50 years; there is a female/male ratio of 3 to 1, and It is usually not preceded by a viral infection. The female preponderance is thought to have some relationship to the increased prevalence of autoimmune disease in women.
