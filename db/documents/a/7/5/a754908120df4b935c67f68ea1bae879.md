The prognosis for Cogan syndrome is generally poor when ear, eye, and cardiovascular involvement occur. In contrast to corneal disease, ear disease has a poor prognosis in the long term as deafness will be irreversible.

Complete hearing loss was noted in one ear in 18 percent and both ears in 52 percent of 60 patients who received care at Mayo clinic between 1940 and 2002. At the final follow-up, most patients had normal or near-normal eyesight in this study. A retrospective study on Cogan syndrome from France showed higher relapse rates from patients at Mayo clinic (78% during 7.1 years of follow-up) than relapse rates (13 and 31 percent of patients relapsed at 5 and 10 years, respectively).

Both groups were uniformly treated with high doses of glucocorticoids. However, the patients from the French study had more use of immunosuppressive agents than those managed at the Mayo Clinic. In the French study, ten patients were treated with infliximab which was only approved in late 1998. Deterioration of auditory performance after cochlear implants have been noticed by Bovo et al. due to the progression of new bone in the cochlea, which separates the electrode from neural structures.
