The classical presenting complaint in the typical IFN retinopathy is a defective vision, but many patients may be asymptomatic. Characteristic ocular findings include cotton wool spots, and retinal hemorrhages in the posterior pole, particularly around the optic disc.

Atypical ocular side effects have presented in some patients. These include central retinal artery occlusion, central retinal vein occlusion, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, optic disc edema, neovascular glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like disease, retinal detachment, subconjunctival hemorrhage, optic disc edema, and panophthalmitis.

Most authors claim that there is no difference in the clinical features of patients receiving different types of IFN.
