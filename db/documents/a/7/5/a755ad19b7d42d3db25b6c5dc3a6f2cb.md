The diagnosis relies mostly on clinical presentation and history, and exclusion of other causes for a rash.

Laboratory investigations are performed to exclude systemic involvement (such as cytopenia, hepatic or renal involvement), but are otherwise not necessary for the diagnosis of SDRIFE.

Patch tests, lymphocyte transformation tests, and drug provocation tests (DPT) can be useful for diagnosis, but the outcomes of these tests are highly variable.

Skin patch tests are usually the preferred means of testing - applied to the previously affected areas. According to previous reports, a patch test gives a positive reaction in only up to 50% of patients.

Controlled drug-provocation testing is considered as the gold standard clinical test, and gives a positive result in most patients with SDRIFE.
