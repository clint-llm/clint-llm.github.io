Preoperative preparation for the patients undergoing adrenalectomy is of the utmost importance. Workup should include biochemical workup to determine if a nodule or mass secreting aldosterone, cortisol, or catecholamines is present.

In cases of increased catecholamine secretion (pheochromocytoma), patients should be initialed on alpha-blockade until orthostasis is achieved, with the addition of beta-blockade as needed. Preoperative hydration and electrolyte repletion should also be done through a high-sodium diet and increase fluid intake the week prior to surgery. Patients with hyperaldosteronism on biochemical workup should undergo adrenal venous sampling to confirm lateralization of the affected adrenal gland as preoperative imaging can be misleading in many cases.
