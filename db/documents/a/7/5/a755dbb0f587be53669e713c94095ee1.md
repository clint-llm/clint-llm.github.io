The differential diagnosis for glycol ether toxicity includes ingesting similar toxic alcohols such as methanol and isopropyl alcohol. Toxic ingestions of these compounds would produce a metabolic acidosis similar to glycol ether toxicity; however, the lethal dose and toxicokinetics may vary. In addition, drug overdoses may also present similarly (i.e., neurological and metabolic derangements).
