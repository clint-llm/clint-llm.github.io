The differential diagnosis for this condition should be considered in the context of the anatomy of the infant heart. When evaluated with 2-D echo during pregnancy, the diagnosis may not always be apparent initially. Though not always cyanotic at birth, dyspnea and cyanosis can present in many of the other cardiac congenital heart diseases including the following:

- Coarctation of the aorta

- Tetrology of Fallot

- Truncus arteriosus

- Ebstein anomaly

- Tricuspid valve atresia

- Pulmonic valve atresia

- Transposition of the great arteries

- Hypoplastic left heart syndrome

- Anomalous pulmonary venous return
