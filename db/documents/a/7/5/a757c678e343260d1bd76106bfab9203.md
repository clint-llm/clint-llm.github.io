Spinal cord stimulators are designed to treat chronic pain. The implantable device offers a nonpharmacological approach to various pain conditions. Stimulators have been used for the treatment of both neuropathic and ischemic pain. Spinal cord stimulator implantation is usually reserved for patients who have failed various forms of conservative and pharmacological treatment options. After a percutaneous trial, a permanent stimulator is installed. Patients can have long-lasting pain relief following the procedure. There are various indications for implanting a stimulator, but it is most commonly done following failed back surgery. Although severe complications following the installation of a spinal cord stimulator are rare, they can be significant. Various types of stimulators and electrical impulses are used to provide pain relief.

Further research will determine if one type of stimulator is superior compared to another. Many insurance companies require psychological screening before the placement of the stimulator. Mental healthcare disorders are associated with worse outcomes after spinal cord stimulator implantation.
