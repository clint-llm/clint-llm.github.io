One of the important aspects of care in varicose vein surgical management is the compression dressing application following the surgery. Notwithstanding the significance of compression therapy in the management of varicose veins, still, the recommendation is equivocal. Accordingly, inÂ venous ulceration treatment, 40 and less than 20 mmHg pressure in peri-malleolar and below the knee are recommended.

The prescription of compression stockings after surgical or laser ablation interventions for varicose vein disease is standard practice; however, the consensus regarding the necessity and preferred duration of compression therapy is lacking.

The optimal duration of compression therapy after endo-venous laser ablation (EVLA) with a 1470-nm diode dual-ring radial fiber laser was evaluated.
