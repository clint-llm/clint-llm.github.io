Procaine penicillin is a combination of an injectable antibiotic and local anesthetic. Indications for use are quite varied but include the treatment of all stages of syphilis, mild to moderate pneumococcal pneumonia, and as an adjunctive in the treatment of diphtheria along with intramuscular (IM) antitoxin. Additional indications published include but are not limited to the treatment of infections with Listeria monocytogenes and various Treponema and Actinomyces species, as well as conditions including scarlet fever, rat-bite fever, and tonsillitis. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of procaine penicillin, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating infections for which it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of procaine penicillin.
- Summarize the indication, both approved and off-label, of procaine penicillin.
- Outline the potential adverse event profile of procaine penicillin.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance procaine penicillin, where it is indicated and can improve patient outcomes.
