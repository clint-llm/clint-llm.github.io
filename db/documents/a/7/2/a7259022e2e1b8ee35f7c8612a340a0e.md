This syndrome is caused due to a lesion at ventral part of the pons that involves the fibers of cranial nerves VI, VII, and corticospinal tract fibers. Corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts are in the central region of the ventral pons. The medial lemniscus lies posteriorly on each side of the median raphe. Nuclei of abducens (VI) and facial (VII) nerves are found in a dorsal portion of the pons, and their fibers pass through the pontine tegmentum and emerge anteriorly at the cerebellopontine angle. The spinothalamic tract is located in the anteromedial tegmentum, medial to the descending tract and nucleus of trigeminal (V) nerve.[3] MGS lesion involves the ventromedial part of the pons which contains the corticospinal tract and fascicular intrapontine portion of the VII nerve, causing ipsilateral paralysis of the facial nerve and contralateral hemiplegia. Classical cases of MGS sometimes involve fibers of the VI nerve. The medial lemniscus and spinothalamic tract are typically spared in this syndrome, thus explaining the absence of the sensory symptoms.
