The etiology of inferior vena cava syndrome (IVCS) depends on the interrupted blood flow location. The pathogenesis of IVCS is divided into two events, including the vena cava obstruction and compression by adjacent structures. The obstruction of the IVC is mostly caused by a primary thrombotic event

Malignancies of organs near the IVC, such as renal cell carcinoma

In pregnancy, the distended uterus can compress the IVC which leads to obstructing the blood flow to the heart and causes increased venous congestion or pooling.

IVCS can also be due to congenital malformations such as May-Thurner syndrome or Budd-Chiari syndrome. May-Thurner syndrome is a chronic condition in which anatomical variations of vessels in the iliocaval region cause blood flow obstruction.

IVCS can also be caused by iatrogenic processes such as IVC filter placement and venous catheters, which promotes thrombosis

It has been observed that using Broviac central venous hyperalimentation catheters in pediatric children and teens who need IV therapy usually for an extended period can develop IVC syndrome.
