Often the initial history and physical examination lead to the identification of life- or limb-threatening conditions that can be stabilized promptly, ensuring better patient outcomes. The sooner the patient is correctly assessed, the more likely a life-altering condition is recognizable, nursing diagnosis formulated, appropriate intervention or treatment initiated, and stabilizing care rendered. Physiological abnormalities manifested by changes in vital signs and level of consciousness often provide early warning signs that patient condition is deteriorating; thus, requiring prompt intervention to forego an adverse outcome, decreasing morbidity and mortality risk. In the fast-paced, resource-challenged healthcare environment today, thorough assessment can pose a challenge for the healthcare provider but is essential to safe, quality care. The importance of a head-to-toe assessment, critical thinking skills guided by research, and therapeutic communication are the mainstays of safe practice.

Assessment findings that include current vital signs, lab values, changes in condition such as decreased urine output, cardiac rhythm, pain level, and mental status, as well as pertinent medical history with recommendations for care, are communicated to the provider by the nurse. Communicating in a concise, efficient manner in rapidly changing situations and deteriorating patient conditions can promote quick solutions during difficult circumstances. Healthcare providers communicate and share in the decision-making process. The SBAR model facilitates this communication between members of the healthcare team and bridges the gap between a narrative, descriptive approach and one armed with exact details.

**Communication using the SBAR Model**

- Situation

- Background

- Assessment

- Recommendation

**Assessment Tools**

- Activities of daily living scale

- Cough assessment

- Health questionnaires such as those that address recent travel and exposure risks

- Waterlow or Braden scale for assessing pressure ulcer risk

- Glasgow coma scale/AVPU for assessment of consciousness

- Pain scales such as the Faces Pain Scale (FPS), Numeric Rating System (NRS), Visual Analogue Scales (VAS), Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBS), and the (MPQ) McGill Pain Questionnaire

- CAGE assessment/CIWA scoring

- Morse Fall Risk

- Standard vital sign flow charts for different age groups

- NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS)

- Dysphagia Screen

- 4AT Assessment for Delirium

**Equipment**

- The nurse should be familiar with the otoscope, penlight, stethoscope (bell and diaphragm), thermometer, bladder scanner, speculum, eye charts, cardiac and blood pressure monitors, fetal doppler and extremity doppler, and sphygmomanometer

- Stretcher or bed for proper positioning during a physical exam

- Hand hygiene products, personal protective equipment if required

- Alcohol swabs, sanitizer, or soapy water to clean equipment after use, such as with stethoscopes, to decrease the likelihood of cross-contamination of pathogens from inanimate objects (follow any manufacturer guidelines or institutional policies)

- Computer or paper chart to document findings

- Calculation devices for BMI, conversion from pounds to kilograms, kilograms to pounds, Celsius to Farenheight
