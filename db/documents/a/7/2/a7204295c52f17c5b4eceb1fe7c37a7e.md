**Black Box Warning**

Isotretinoin was a pregnancy category X drug under the previous FDA system and is contraindicated in pregnant women or who may become pregnant. There have been severe, documented congenital disabilities when pregnant women have taken isotretinoin. To prescribe and receive isotretinoin, the Food and Drug Administration requires prescribers and patients to register with the iPLEDGE program. iPLEDGE ensures the fulfillment of appropriate requirements before dispensing isotretinoin to prevent the use of this medication during pregnancy. These requirements include negative pregnancy tests and documented abstinence or the use of birth control before and while taking isotretinoin.

Isotretinoin is contraindicated in patients who have hypersensitivity to any of its components, including vitamin A and preservatives within the gel capsule.
