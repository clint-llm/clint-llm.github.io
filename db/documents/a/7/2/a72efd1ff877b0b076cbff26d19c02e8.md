According to the National Safety Councilâ€™s statistics, foreign-body airway obstruction (FBAO) is the fourth leading cause of unintentional death, resulting in 5,051 documented deaths in 2015. In children under the age of 16, foreign-body airway obstruction is one of the leading causes of accidental deaths. Due to the prevalence and rapidity of unconsciousness and death associated with choking, all persons, including those outside of the health field, should have a basic understanding of how to care for a choking victim. Simple maneuvers taught to laypeople such as the Heimlich maneuver have been proven to save lives. This activity reviews presentation, causes, and evaluation of foreign-body airway obstruction (FBAO) and highlights risk factors and interventions that should be used by an interprofessional team to recognize and manage patients presenting with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors causing a foreign body airway obstruction.
- Describe the range of presentation and physical exam findings of a patient with a foreign body airway obstruction and explain other possible diagnoses.
- Explain the evaluation and treatment of complete and partial foreign body airway obstruction.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients suffering from foreign body airway obstruction.
