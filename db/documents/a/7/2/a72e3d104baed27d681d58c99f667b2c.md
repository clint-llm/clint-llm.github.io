Early PVE occurs as a result of direct intraoperative contamination or due to hematogenous spread to the valve in the first days to weeks of the surgical procedure. Paravalvular abscess formation is common in both mechanical and bioprosthetic valves.

In the first two months after the surgical intervention, Staphylococcus aureus accounts for the highest number of PVE cases, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci, these are followed by gram-negative bacilli and Candida species. In the period of 2 months to 12 months of the surgical intervention, streptococcus, staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus are the most common pathogens, these are followed by enterococcus.

Late PVE occurs due to community-acquired infection, and pathogens are similar to native valve endocarditis. The most frequent pathogens are streptococci and S. aureus, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. Mortality in late PVE is high in patients with multiple comorbidities who acquire the endocarditis when admitted to hospitals for other reasons.

Culture negative endocarditis may occur with both early and late PVE. Other etiologies of PVE can be related to nontuberculosis mycobacteria ( Mycobacterium chimera) and enterovirus.
