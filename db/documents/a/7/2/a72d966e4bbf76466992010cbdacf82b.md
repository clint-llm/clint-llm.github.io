The arteries of the lower limb are prone to atherosclerotic plaques, which may lead to decreased arterial blood flow to areas of the leg or the foot. Â Most times, balloon angioplasty and stenting can open the artery to improve perfusion or revascularization of the ischemic leg or foot. Sometimes, for example in diabetic patients, a bypass using the DPA as a distal target, is an operation used to treat arterial insufficiency for limb preservation.
