Sudden and unexplained deaths and mysterious and suspicious deaths should be reported to the concerned legal authority. In such circumstances, there should be no issue of a death certificate (cause of death certificate) without a formal medicolegal death investigation by the legal authority. Deaths that appear to be non-criminal deaths at first can turn out to be criminal-deaths on further investigation.
