Other medications known to cause drug-induced myopathy include colchicine, antimalarials, and antiretrovirals. Drug-induced myopathy should be considered mainly for patients taking two myopathic agents such as hydroxychloroquine and glucocorticoids for inflammatory disorders.

In contrast to corticosteroid-induced myopathy, these present with elevated muscle enzymes, worsening muscle weakness with discontinuation of steroids, systemic signs of muscle breakdown and inflammation, and characteristic "early recruitment" findings on EMG.

Additionally, myositis may present as a manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, scleroderma, and rheumatoid arthritis; these organic causes of myopathy should be considered when diagnosing corticosteroid-induced myopathy.
