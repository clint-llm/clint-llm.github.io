Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo occurs due to the displacement of calcium-carbonate crystals or otoconia within the fluid-filled semicircular canals of the inner ear. These otoconia are essential to the proper functioning of the utricle of the otolithic membrane by helping deflect the hair cells within the endolymph, which relays positional changes of the head, including tilting, turning, and linear acceleration.

Approximately 50% to 70% of BPPV cases occur with no known cause and are referred to as primary or idiopathic BPPV.

Ménière disease is estimated to be associated with BPPV in 0.5% to 31% of cases.

Migraines have also been found to have a close association with BPPV. Ishiyama et al. observed an increased occurrence of migraine in patients suffering from BPPV and higher recurrence of BPPV after having done positioning successfully in patients with migraine. It has been postulated that the spasm of the arteries of the inner ear may be the underlying causative mechanism, as vasospasm is frequently seen in migraines.

Secondary BPPV is also reported after inner ear surgery. The underlying mechanism is possibly associated with utricular damage causing the release of otoconia.
