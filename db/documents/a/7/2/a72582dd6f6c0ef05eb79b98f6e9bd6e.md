All interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists,Â who look after patients with diabetes mellitus, should be familiar with metformin. It is the drug of choice for patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus. The drug is very safe, is cardioprotective, and enables weight loss. More importantly, the drug is relatively cheap. At the same time, the clinicians should encourage patients with diabetes mellitus to discontinue smoking, eat healthily, and participate in regular exercise. While it is a safe and well-tolerated drug, the nurses still need to monitor its use, be aware of contraindications and interactions, and document any potential issues. Pharmacists should verify dosing, perform medication reconciliation, and counsel patients. If there are any concerns, clinicians should be informed, so all team members have the same information and are operating from the same page, optimizing therapeutic outcomes. [Level 5]
