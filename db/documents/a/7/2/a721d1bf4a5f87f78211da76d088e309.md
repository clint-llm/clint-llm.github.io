The management of BP is best with an interprofessional approach including a team of dermatologist, gynecologist, urologist, primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and a GI specialist. BP may develop malignant characteristics; therefore a long term evaluation is recommended by a dermatologist, every 3 to 6 months. Thus, the gynecologist should perform a careful cervical and anal cytologic screening of female patients as well as of sexual partners of the male patient. The urologist should examine patients with urethral involvement. And patients with perianal involvement should be examined by a GI specialist. Furthermore, smoking cessation is strongly advised.
