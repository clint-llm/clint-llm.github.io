The diagnosis of BS is based on the typical natural history and examination during the acute and quiescent stages. It is important to rule out other conditions by forming a comprehensive differential diagnosis. Although in some cases, blood tests and imaging might be performed, they are mostly to rule out other conditions, because the results of the complementary tests in BS are normal. Skin biopsy is usually not needed to make a diagnosis, although it may help by showing the typical loss of the dermis elastic fibers.
