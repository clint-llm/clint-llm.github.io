Patients intubated in the field will need some form of artificial ventilation started. BVM ventilation is unreliable and inconsistent and requires a dedicated provider to continue ventilation. Using mechanical ventilators in the prehospital environment allows for precise control of ventilation, particularly in areas with longer transport times. Understanding basic respiratory physiology and ventilator settings is essential to start mechanical ventilation safely and correct the underlying respiratory derangement. Improper ventilator management can worsen the acute disease process and set off an inflammatory cascade causing worsening lung injury.
