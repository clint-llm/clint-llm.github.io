Developmental milestones are markers of a childâ€™s development from infancy on into childhood. They are used to help determine if a child is undergoing typical development versus if a child has delayed in a given area or over multiple areas in the process of aging development. Milestones are categorized into social/emotional, gross and fine motor, language, and cognitive. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in assessing developmental milestones.
