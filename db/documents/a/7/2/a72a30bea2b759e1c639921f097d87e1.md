- Central line insertion kit, which is usually manufacturer-specificÂ should contain the all the equipment for the central line and Seldinger technique, including a central venous catheter, guidewire, syringe, an introducer needle, a scalpel, a silk suture (on a Keith or curved needle) and a skin dilator

- Sterile gloves and gown

- Hat and mask

- Drape or sterile towels to create a sterile barrier (to protect equipment and materials from becoming contaminated)

- Antiseptic agent for skin preparation

- Proper caps for each lumen port

- Dressing to cover the insertion site

- Local anesthetic (1% to 2% lidocaine is supplied in most commercial kits) with a syringe and needle to instill the medication

It is also helpful to ask if any specific additional items are needed per your institutional protocols (such as antibiotic sponges). If an ultrasound-guided technique is used, a sterile probe cover should also be available.
