Oral mucositis results in severe pain and the subsequent decrease in oral intake can lead to a significant deterioration in patient quality of life as well as nutritional status. This can also interrupt the chemotherapy treatment cycle, potentially worsening cancer outcomes. Mucositis also results in a breakdown of the protective mucosal barrier and thus increasing the susceptibility of the patient to infections. Therefore, chemotherapy protocols that increase the risk of oral mucositis have a prophylactic oral regimen and antibiotics built into them to prevent the development of oral mucositis and subsequent septicemia.
