A study conducted on healthy people and patients with gastrointestinal (GI) diseases showed an increased incidence of achlorhydria and hypochlorhydria in women, but the results were not significant. In patients younger than 60 years of age, the incidence of achlorhydria and hypochlorhydria were 2.3% and 2%, respectively, whereas, in older patients, it increased to 5%. That is an increase of almost 3-fold. Another study on autoimmune causes showed an age-related incidence of parietal cell autoantibodies. Their prevalence increases with age, for example, from 2.5% in the third decade to 12% in the eighth decade. Autoimmune gastritis is frequently found in association with other autoimmune conditions. It is also a component of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3. No association has been found between pernicious anemia and HLA types.
