Optimal treatment in heatstroke patients relies on early recognition and expedition of rapid cooling. If expecting a heatwave, a designated area with equipment for multiple patients should be available in the emergency department. The physician should understand what resources are available for cooling patients, as each facility may use evaporative, ice-bath, or other methodology depending on its protocol. Careful coordination with nursing staff is necessary as close monitoring of patients with either a continuous rectal or esophageal temperature probe is necessary with careful communication to stop cooling measures at the desired 38 to 39Â°C. The physician should identify patients requiring cardiac monitoring and additional consultants, including intensivists, should be contacted early in the management if other end-organ damage has occurred. The use of dantrolene has been shown in several small trials to be ineffective and is not a reocmmendation in the treatment of heat stroke (Class 1).
