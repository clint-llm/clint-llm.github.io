The involvement of the patient in every step of the decision-making process is vital for a successful outcome. Education to the patient and family members should be provided regarding pathology, etiology, diagnosis, and severity of the disease process. Handouts and specific instructions should include home exercise programs, skincare, and brace maintenance.

The clinician needs to be able to reach out to the orthotist in between medical visits for maintaining functional braces since all braces eventually wear out and need replacement and maintenance. Follow-up instructions should be provided so that any future adjustments in therapy, bracing, or further diagnostic testing can be monitored.
