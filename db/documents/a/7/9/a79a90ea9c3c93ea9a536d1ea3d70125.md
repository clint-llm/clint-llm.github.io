Aniridia may be complicated by:

- Glaucoma - Around 50% to 75% of patients with aniridia develop glaucoma, which, however, is usually not seen at birth. It usually occurs after 10 to 20 years of age likely due to blockage of theÂ trabecular meshwork by the contracting iris strands of the rudimentary iris tissue or maldeveloped angle of the anterior chamber (goniodysgenesis). Glaucoma is the predominant cause of blindness in aniridia. The treatment of glaucoma is complicated, and the glaucoma is often resistant to both medical and surgical treatment. The prognosis of glaucoma associated with aniridia is guarded.

- Aniridic fibrosis syndrome

- Painful or painless blind eye

- Systemic associations including Wilms tumor
