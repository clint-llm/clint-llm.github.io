Exercise has been the mainstay of treatment for mechanical low back pain. All healthcare professionals involved in the care of back pain must be able to identify mechanical back pain due to lumbar instability and provide validated exercise protocols to correct the same.

Family practitioners, physiotherapists, and orthopedic surgeons should be able to communicate to patients the benefits of involvement in a regular exercise program in the treatment and prevention of lower back pain secondary to mechanical instability.

Pharmacological analgesia should only be a supplement of the good rehabilitation regime. There is no role for surgical intervention in mechanical low back pain.
