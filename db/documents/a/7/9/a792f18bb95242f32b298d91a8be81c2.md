There have been many proposed staging systems, but the most widely accepted staging system is the Lugano staging system. The Lugano staging system was developed to incorporate measures of distant nodal involvement.

- Stage I: Involvement of a single lymph node region or lymphoid structure such as the spleen, thymus, or Waldeyer's ring.

- Stage II: Involvement of two or more lymph node regions or lymph node structures on the same side of the diaphragm.

- Stage III: Involvement of lymph node regions or lymphoid structures on both sides of the diaphragm.

- Stage IV: Lymphoma has spread to several organs (for example, the lungs, liver, bone marrow, or solid bones), with or without lymph node involvement.
