The monospot test is meant to deliver simplistic results and therefore is either positive or negative.  Positive results indicate the presence of heterophile antibodies in a patient with symptomatology consistent with IM.  A negative result is intended to indicate the lack of heterophile antibodies and should lead clinicians to pursue other causes of the patient’s symptomatology.
