Piaget's theories, specifically those regarding the stages of cognitive development, are pertinent to clinicians as they can help guide expectations when evaluating patients within distinct age groups. Before adolescence, thought patterns are simplistic and dogmatic; as cognition matures, the child becomes less egocentric, and more empathic, with less fixation on the self. Thus, when examining a 6-year-old, the clinician will not be alarmed that the child is unable to grasp abstract concepts, whereas, one would understandably be concerned in the event that an adolescent demonstrates the inability to understand others’ viewpoints or engage in hypothetical situations. Furthermore, the maturing adolescent moves from understanding himself as an object with a set of defined properties to the awareness that they are dynamic. However, they may become anxious, hypersensitive, and narcissistic, unrealistically presuming the focus of others is honed in on them. Countless vignettes could be further elucidated regarding the implications of Piaget's theories; such is the indelible significance he has left on the fields of both psychology and psychiatry.
