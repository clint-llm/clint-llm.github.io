Urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse are common bothersome among women. There are lots of treatments to manage these diseases, including medication and surgeries. Clinicians consider Kegel exercises, designed for pelvic floor muscle strengthening, as the first-line therapy for patients as there are few reported few side effects. Currently, there is no fixed protocol for Kegel exercises, but the critical point is that the patients should contract the pelvic floor muscle rather than abdominal, buttock, or inner thigh muscles.
