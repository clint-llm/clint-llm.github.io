Complications associated with gastric mucosal atrophy can typically be:

- Achlorhydria (loss of acid production results in hypergastrinemia)

- Macrocytic anemia (intrinsic factor in autoimmune gastritis)

- Chronic iron deficiency anemia (due to loss of iron absorption)

- Duodenal/gastric ulcer

- Benign strictures of the pylorus

- Hemorrhagic gastritis

- Gastric adenocarcinoma

- Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)

- Gastric carcinoid tumor (enterochromaffin cell hyperplasia)
