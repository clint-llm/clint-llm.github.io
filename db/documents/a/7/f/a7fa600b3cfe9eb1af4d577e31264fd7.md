Initial evaluation with a fasting lipid profile should be completed. Increased total cholesterol and increased triglyceride levels should raise suspicion. Levels of total cholesterol and TG levels are usually within the range of 300-1000 mg/dL with an approximate similar range or disproportionally high triglyceride or low LDL-C levels compared with TC.

Three methods to diagnosis familial dysbetalipoproteinemia either by apoB/TC ratio < 0.15 g/mmol, or apoB less than 1.2 g/l, triglyceride at least 1.5 mmol/l, triglyceride/apoB less than 10 and TC/apoB at least 6.2, or use of polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, which shows small VLDL and IDL. An IDL-range AUC/LDL-range AUC ratio of > 0.5 all these methods yield relatively high sensitivity and specificity.

Genotyping with an evaluation of ApoE with E2/E2 genotype. If negative autosomal dominant variant may be present. May require full APOE sequencing to diagnose autosomal dominant.
