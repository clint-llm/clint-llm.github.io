Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a syndrome that arises in non-acclimatized individuals who ascend to high altitudes. It is a form of acute altitude illness that occurs due to decreased atmospheric partial pressure of oxygen as the altitude increases, inducing hypoxia. This condition typically occurs at an altitude of >2500 meters; however, it can occur at lower elevations in high-risk individuals.
