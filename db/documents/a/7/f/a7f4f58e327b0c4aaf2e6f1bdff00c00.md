**History**

**Onset and Duration**

The case history should begin by asking about the onset and duration of jaundice. The onset of jaundice within 24 hours of life is always pathological, whereas it can be physiological after 24 hours of life.

**Family History**

It is essential to ask about any family history of anemia or jaundice since birth or in adulthood. This history gives an idea about conditions like Gilbert syndrome, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, G6PD deficiency, sickle cell disease, and spherocytosis.

**Social History**

A detailed social history should be asked, outlining any harmful practices in the mother, such as alcoholism or drug use. Antenatal history should be noted down to determine any pre-existing conditions in the mother, like TORCH infections or diabetes mellitus.

**Birth History**

This should be assessed to rule out any injuries leading to cephalhematoma, subgaleal hemorrhage, or any bleeding manifestations which can cause hyperbilirubinemia.

**Postnatal History**

Congenital infections in infants can present with jaundice due to decreased glucuronidation or increased hemolysis. A baby born to a mother with diabetes is usually large for gestational age, which indicates a higher number of red blood cells with an increased rate of turnover leading to jaundice.

A detailed history is a stepping stone to diagnosing the etiology of kernicterus as it aids in eliminating the cause of hyperbilirubinemia, thus alleviating the symptoms and the resulting neurologic damage.

**Physical Examination**

The physical exam should be comprehensive, with special attention to the neurological exam. The child's level of consciousness should be assessed. The presence of icterus and yellowish discoloration of the body might be evident. The infants are usually not febrile. Vital signs may be significant for tachycardia, dyspnea, and impaired oxygen saturation. The fontanelles should be examined to check for any increase in intracranial pressure. Increased intracranial pressure leads to bulging fontanelles with the separation of suture lines. The setting sun sign is also an indication of increased intracranial pressure. The enlarged third ventricle puts pressure on the upward gaze center in the midbrain, causing a tonic downward eye deviation.

The neurologic abnormalities associated with hyperbilirubinemia are known as bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND).

- Acute bilirubin encephalopathy can be further divided into three phases:
- Weakness, lethargy, and poor feeding are seen in this phase. These are not specific to this condition and are seen in a variety of diseases, thus making it difficult to identify the condition at this stage. Prompt administration of treatment at this stage will stop the progression of the condition.
- Extensor hypertonia, retrocollis, opisthotonus are generally seen in this phase.
- Hypotonia is typically seen in infants aged more than one week.

- Chronic bilirubin encephalopathy will progress slowly over several years and include:
- Hypotonia
- Hyperreflexia
- Delayed achievement of milestones
- Visual and auditory defects
- Choreathetoid cerebral palsy

The abdominal examination might show hepatomegaly or splenomegaly indicative of a hemolytic cause.
