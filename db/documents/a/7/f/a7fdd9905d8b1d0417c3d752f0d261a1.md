Duodenal atresia is a congenital intestinal obstruction that can cause bilious or non bilious vomiting within the first 24 to 38 hours of neonatal life, typically following the first oral feeding. It is associated with in-utero polyhydramnios and is one of the most common causes of fetal bowel obstruction. If duodenal atresia is not diagnosed antenatally, then the diagnosis can be made radiographically with a plain abdominal x-ray as the first step in evaluation. This may be followed by a controlled contrast exam if needed. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and presentation of duodenal atresia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of an infant with duodenal atresia.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient suspected of duodenal atresia.
- Sumamrize the treatment options for duodenal atresia.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by duodenal atresia.
