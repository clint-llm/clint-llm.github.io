**Whole-brain Radiotherapy**

Several issues can be associated with the use of WBRT.

Acute adverse effects include skin erythema, alopecia, fatigue, altered sense of taste and smell, and serous otitis media. Memory loss, confusion, and leukoencephalopathy are late adverse effects. A higher burden of brain metastasis, higher integral dose to the calvarium, and use of WBRT are associated with an increased risk of development of leukoencephalopathy in long term survivors.

The benefits of whole-brain radiotherapy are conditional upon the fact that it may lead to a short term deterioration in the HRQoL, temporary hair loss, and fatigue, the potential for accelerated cognitive loss, and the requirement for multiple hospital visits. The possible risks of bone marrow toxicity, enteritis, and mucositis preclude the use of cerebrospinal radiotherapy in adult solid tumor patients with leptomeningeal metastasis, up to one-fifth of patients who received concomitant intrathecal methotrexate, dexamethasone, and focal radiotherapy presented with grade 3-4 adverse effects.

**Stereotactic Radiosurgery**

Concerning SRS, local effects must be distinguished by acute and late-onset toxicities.

**Local Effects**

Pin site trauma, bleeding, and infection due to head frame placement.

**Systemic Effects**

Acute (within two weeks):

- Headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and worsening neurological deficits, etiologically related to edema, are usually responsive to steroids.

Late (months to years):

- Hemorrhage, necrosis, and treatment-related changes (increase in contrast enhancement, necrosis, edema, and mass effect). These may be difficult to distinguish from disease progression and require additional imaging techniques for diagnosis. Modalities used in the treatment of radiation-induced necrosis include steroids, hyperbaric oxygen, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody (bevacizumab), and surgical resection.

Late effects also include the potential risk of cranial neuropathies, including optic neuropathy, radiation necrosis, and vascular injury. Serious late toxicities of SRS are low.
