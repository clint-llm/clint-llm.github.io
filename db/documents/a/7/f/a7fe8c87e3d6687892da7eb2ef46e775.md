**Non-operative**

Non-operative management for these fractures is rarely the treatment course. It is only potentially useful for non-ambulatory, comfort care, or extremely high-risk patients.

**Operative**

Young patients with femoral neck fractures will require treatment with emergent open reduction internal fixation.

Non-displaced fractures are treated typically with percutaneous cannulated screws or a sliding hip screw. However, there a higher rate of avascular necrosis (AVN) with the use of a sliding hip screw (9%) compared to cannulated screws (4%).

With displaced fractures of the femoral neck in elderly patients, the treatment depends on the patient's baseline activity level and age. Less active individuals may receive a hemiarthroplasty.

**Summary of Operative Methods**

**Young Patients (less than 60)**

- Open-reduction internal fixation

**Elderly Patients**

Non-displaced

- Percutaneous cannulated screws or sliding hip screw

Displaced

- Hemiarthroplasty-less active patients

- Total hip arthroplasty-active patients
