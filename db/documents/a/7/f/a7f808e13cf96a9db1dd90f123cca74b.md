The contraindications for PVB are similar to those for other surgeries. Many patients with peripheral vascular disease have other comorbidities, including cardiac and respiratory dysfunction. Patients with a history of previous cardiac intervention (stenting, angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass) or low ejection fraction have high perioperative mortality. The same holds for patients with respiratory illnesses, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Thus, any patient undergoing PVB should have and thorough cardiac and respiratory workup before surgery.
