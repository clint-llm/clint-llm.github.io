The diagnosis and management of subaortic stenosis is best accomplished with an interprofessional team that consists of a pediatrician, cardiologist, radiologist, cardiac surgeon, neonatologist, and specialty trained nurses. Management requires assistance of a specialty trained nurse to assist with patient monitoring, coordination of care, and family education. The follow up of these infants is usually by the primary care provider and nurse practitioner. Surgical resection of the membrane is the only treatment for subaortic stenosis. The surgery is palliative as in most cases, the membrane will recur later in life, making another open-heart procedure necessary. Most infants have a good outcome after surgery, provided that they do not have other congenital problems. Life long follow-up is necessary as many will require REDO surgery to resect the membrane again later in life.
