Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) encompasses several imaging techniques based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) developed for studying the arterial and venous systems. The benefits of an MRA in comparison to traditional angiography is that it is noninvasive, it lacks ionizing radiation exposure, it has the potential for a non-contrast examination, and it has the ability of high-resolution volumetric images. The MRA gadolinium contrast material is less likely to cause an allergic reaction than the iodine-based contrast materials used for computed tomography scanning. In this review, the different techniques for MRA are discussed, and the indications for different pathologies are disclosed.
