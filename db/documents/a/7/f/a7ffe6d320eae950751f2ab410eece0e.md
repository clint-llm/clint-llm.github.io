Although the manufacturers have listed no contraindications, adalimumab has not been adequately studied in patients who are younger than four years of age and weighing less than 15 kg. Clinicians should avoid using it in this age group as a precautionary measure.

Clinicians must also avoid adalimumab in cases of hypersensitivity, patients with underlying foci of infection, congestive cardiac failure, or hepatic dysfunction.

Concomitant administration of live vaccines is contraindicated. Also, the risk of serious infections increases significantly in the co-administration of abatacept and anakinra.
