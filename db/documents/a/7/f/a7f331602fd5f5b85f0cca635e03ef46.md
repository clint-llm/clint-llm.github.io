After direct contact with infected bodily fluids or direct contact with an infected animal or person, MARV enters the body through skin breaks or mucosal membranes.

The virus first infects monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. It then moves to the liver, lymph nodes, and spleen for early replication and further dissemination. Due to the extensive involvement of antigen-presenting cells (APC), an inflammatory response involving the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and lymphoid depletion in the spleen occurs. Systemic inflammation plays a critical role in the disease process. The release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as prostacyclin and nitric oxide, triggers coagulation cascades.

MARV glycoprotein (GP) is the most important attachment factor on the viral surface responsible for mediating binding and entry into host cells. GP has two components: the GP surface unit (GP1), which binds to cellular receptors, and an internal fusion loop (GP2), which inserts into the cell membrane.

Following attachment, endocytosis occurs, GP1 is cleaved by endosomal proteases, and the virus binds to an endosomal cholesterol transporter called Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1).
