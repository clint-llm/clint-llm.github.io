All interprofessional healthcare team members (clinicians, nurses, dieticians, pharmacists) should encourage healthy nutrition for their patients. Thiamin deficiency is not common in North America but can occur in certain high-risk populations, and the interprofessional team needs to be alert to the signs of potential thiamin deficiency. Thiamin plays a very critical role in the human body. Therefore, deficiency can lead to a very serious, life-threatening clinical condition, including irreversible brain damage.

Thiamin therapy should be recommended by interprofessional healthcare teams. The outcome of patients with thiamin deficiency can be improved by early recognition of the disease and early initiation of the treatment before severe neurological and cardiac manifestations develop.
