The original description of Balint syndrome was a triad of symptoms occurring from lesions in bilateral parietal lobes, but over the years there have been numerous case reports wherein the lesions involved parietooccipital or temporooccipital areas, with similar clinical presentations. Furthermore, individual components of Balint syndrome can occur as a result of other lesions involving parts of the brain other than the parietal and occipital lobes. Further studies are needed to analyze the specific neuronal pathways that are responsible for the clinical presentations described commonly with Balint syndrome.
