Triggers for PACs can be caused by a myriad of reasons and are commonly idiopathic. Idiopathic PACs, in the absence of structural cardiac disease, frequently originate from the pulmonary veins. Identifiable causes of premature atrial contractions can be stratified into structural, chemical, or as a sequela of other conditions.

Structural causes of PACs typically include coronary artery disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left atrial appendage aneurysms, left ventricular hypertrophy, valvular heart disease, septal defects, and congenital heart malformations.

Chemical-based causes for PACs include beta-agonists, digoxin, chemotherapeutic agents, tricyclic antidepressants, sympathomimetics amines, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

A higher incidence of PACs is associated with many conditions and chronic states. Medical pathologies with associations for increased PACs include myocardial infarctions, congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, a chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, Coxsackie virus, and an overall higher CHA2DS2-VASC score.
