Although subclavian artery trauma is rare, this injury can result in devastating outcomes for the trauma patient. Management of subclavian artery trauma requires rapid diagnosis and quick technical skills by the surgeon. Strong knowledge of anatomy and operative exposure will help to augment diagnostic modalities and facilitate operative versus endovascular management.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the anatomic differences of the right subclavian and left subclavian arteries.
- Identify which trauma patients are at high-risk for subclavian artery injury.
- Describe operative and endovascular approaches for the management of subclavian artery trauma.
- Summarize the importance of early recognition of subclavian artery trauma and principles of resuscitation, control of bleeding, and definitive treatment.
