Hyperaldosteronism occurs due to the excess production of aldosterone from the adrenal gland. Hyperaldosteronism can initially present as essential and refractory hypertension and can often go undiagnosed. This disorder can be of primary or secondary origin, both presenting similarly but differentiated by a set of lab values and diagnostic studies. This activity reviews the cause of hyperaldosteronism and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Recall the causes of hyperaldosteronism.
- Describe the laboratory features of
hyperaldosteronism. 
- Summarize the treatment of
hyperaldosteronism. 
- Explore modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by hyperaldosteronism.
