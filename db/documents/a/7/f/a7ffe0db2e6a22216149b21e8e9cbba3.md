Epidermoid cyst, also known as a sebaceous cyst, is a benign encapsulated, subepidermal nodule filled with keratin material.  Although most commonly located on the face, neck, and trunk, epidermoid cysts can be found anywhere including the scrotum, genitalia, fingers, and cases within the buccal mucosa. Cysts may progress slowly and remain present for years. The term sebaceous cyst is commonly used; however, the term is a misnomer in that it does not involve the sebaceous gland. Epidermoid cysts develop within the infundibulum. Other common synonyms include infundibular cyst, epidermal cyst, and epidermal inclusion cyst. Although these cysts are recognized as benign lesions, rare malignancy can arise.
