There is a growing body of evidence and concern that field triaging has lead to the overuse of spinal immobilization methods and that some patients are potentially coming to harm

Potential problems with spinal immobilization:

- Discomfort and distress for the patient

- Lengthening the prehospital time with a potential delay of important investigations and treatment in addition to interfering with other interventions

- Restriction to respiration by the straps in addition to poorer respiratory function in the supine position compared to an upright position. This is especially important in the case of chest trauma either blunt or penetrating

- The case of patients with Ankylosing spondylitis or preexisting spinal deformity where actual harm could be caused by forcing the patient to conform to the predetermined position of a rigid cervical collar and backboard

A new Scandinavian literature review which was carried out to review the available evidence for spinal movement restrictions

**Hard Collar**

The hard collar has been used since the mid-1960s as a way of stabilization of the cervical spine with low-quality evidence to support its positive influence on the neurological outcome of cervical spine injury with potential negative effects with a significant rise of intracranial pressure and dysphagia

**Hardboard**

The original spinal longboard has been used in conjunction with the hard collar, blocks, and straps to achieve immobilization of the spine. There is currently evidence of the potential harm especially pressure sores over the sacrum

**Blocks**

Blocks have been part of the inline mobilization strategy for stabilization of the spine it seems to be effective when strapping the patient on a spinal board of achieving a degree of immobilization with no added benefit of using the hard collar in conjunction

**Vacuum Mattress**

When comparing the vacuum mattress with hardboard on their own that mattress offers more control and less movement during application and lifting compared to the hardboard

**Clearing the Spine**

The NEXUS criteria: an alert person not intoxicated without having any distracting injury has a very low probability of injury in the absence of midline tenderness, neurological deficiency. This seems to be a sensitive screening tool with 99% sensitivity and 99.8% negative predictive value
