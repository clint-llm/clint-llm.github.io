The Society for Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT) has recommended that, at a minimum, a 64-slice CT scanner be used for CCTA. Dual-head power injection pumps should be utilized to take advantage of biphasic and triphasic injection protocols. Digital images should be stored in the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format. A Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) should be available to allow review of the entire image set obtained during the scan.
