CO poisoning is not rare at all. This colorless and odorless often presents with a headache, confusion, coma, and even death. Even though hyperbaric oxygen can lower the morbidity of the toxicity, a significant number of survivors end up with residual neurological and psychiatric deficits. In the majority of cases, CO poisoning can be prevented. Besides physicians, the roles of the pharmacist and nurse are important. The nurse is usually the last professional to see the patient before discharge and thus has a great opportunity to educate the family on the use of home CO detectors. The pharmacist gets the opportunity to see consumers regularly and should recommend cessation of smoking and ensuring that the family has a CO alarm at home. Also, both these professionals should educate the family on the use of proper heating appliances during winter and having the home checked regularly for safety.

**Outcomes**

The prognosis for patients with CO poisoning depends on the severity of the poisoning and clinical status at presentation. Patients who arrive at the ER in a coma or cardiac arrest usually have a poor outcome. In addition, patients who have a demonstrated abnormality on the MRI also tend to have residual neuropsychiatric deficits.
