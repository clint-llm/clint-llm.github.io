Friedman originally established the labor curve for the first stage of labor; however, it has since been contemporized by Zhang et al.

The pathophysiologic etiology of abnormal labor is otherwise poorly understood. There is likely a multitude of pathophysiologic etiologies, which is why current management and intervention are limited and at times unsuccessful. It is possible that treatment options that target the specific underlying pathophysiologic etiologies may be more successful in treating labor abnormalities. Additional knowledge of diagnostic tools and individualized therapies may lead to new clinical opportunities in the future.
