Opioid withdrawal syndrome is a life-threatening condition resulting from opioid dependence. Opioids are a group of drugs used to manage severe pain and include morphine, heroin, oxycontin, codeine, methadone, and hydromorphone. Opioids are sometimes misused, as they can assist with mental relaxation and pain relief and can produce a sense of euphoria. Chronic opioid use can lead to the development of potentially incapacitating dependence. This activity describes the evaluation and management of opioid withdrawal and highlights the interprofessional team's role in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of opioid withdrawal syndrome.
- Summarize signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal syndrome. 
- Explain the management of opioid withdrawal syndrome. 
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with opioid withdrawal syndrome.
