The annular ligament can demonstrate significant anatomic variation in its overall morphology. Multiple MRI-based studies and cadaveric dissection reports demonstrate the annular ligament appearing as a bi-lobed structure. Other studies demonstrate a morphologically broad annular ligamentous structure spanning superior to inferiorly at its attachment sites. In the instances that the ligament is bilobed, the anterior component remains its own separate, single band, while the posterior component demonstrates a fenestrated morphology. The latter can be seen as its own superior and inferior subdivisions, creating a funnel-shaped appearance.

There are many variants of the synovial fold of the annular ligament. Not all people have a synovial fold. The synovial fold is its own distinct structure attached to the proximal end of the annular ligament, extending into the radiocapitellar joint capsule and blending with the common extensor tendon; this forms a single enthesis at the lateral epicondyle. The synovial fold can appear “meniscus-like” but is not a true meniscus. This fold can vary in thickness and can be an underlying cause of chronic, recalcitrant elbow pain syndromes.
