In 2017, the Brazilian guidelines for the clinical management of paracoccidioidomycosis were published, including a detailed discussion of outpatient treatments, severe disease forms, disease prevalence among special populations, and outlined below.

Paracoccidioidomycosis infections have a high incidence in Central and South America, however robust evidence regarding treatment efficacy is still lacking. PCM has been treated with antifungal agents including ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, terbinafine, and amphotericin B.

**Itraconazole**

Itraconazole is the treatment of choice in mild to moderate cases due to its high response rate.

**Voriconazole**

Voriconazole 400 mg twice daily on the first day and 200 mg twice daily thereafter was shown to be as effective as itraconazole for chronic PCM in a small open-label comparative study of 53 patients.

**Ketoconazole**

Ketoconazole has a cure rate of 85% to 90% and a relapse rate of less than 10% in small observational studies. The dose used was 5 mg/kg/day in children or 200 to 400 mg/day in adults for a course of 6 to 18 months.

**Amphotericin B**

Amphotericin B deoxycholate is reserved for severe PCM. It is the treatment of choice in patients with PCM sepsis. Lipid formulation of amphotericin B has demonstrated efficacy with lower adverse side-effects when used to treat severe cases of PCM. Observational studies with a small number of cases show high efficacy (greater than 95%) in patients with severe PCM.

**Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole**

A second-line medication is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 160/800mg twice daily, which has a lower cure rate than itraconazole (51% versus 86%, respectively). The median treatment time is 23 months with TMP/SMX, as compared to 12 months for itraconazole.

**Sulfadiazine**

Sulfadiazine is another alternative, the maximum dose is 4 g/day in adults and should be given until clinical and mycologic response is noted. Then the dose can be reduced by half and maintained over a period of 3 to 5 years. Cure rates of 70% are expected, but relapse rates may be as high as 30%.
