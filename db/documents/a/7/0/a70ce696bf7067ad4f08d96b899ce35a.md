As with all traumas, the initial evaluation is to ensure airway, breathing, and circulation is intact. Active venous bleeding should be controlled with direct pressure, while arterial bleeding will typically necessitate consult services. The examiner should explore the wound for foreign bodies such as broken teeth, claws, dirt, and plant material. When analyzing the wound, underlying structures require assessment for potential damageÂ as well. During exploration, the patient should range the underlying structures through a full range of motion to ensure no injuries to those underlying structures.
