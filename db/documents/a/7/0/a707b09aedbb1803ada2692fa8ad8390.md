Patients who have benign mesothelial proliferations may present endorsing abdominal masses or abdominal fullness, abdominal pain, chest pain with or without pleural effusions, or unexpected weight gain, among other non-specific symptoms. Importantly, if the patient does present with a pleural effusion, and it turns out to be a hemorrhagic pleural effusion, as regards mesotheliomas, this greatlyÂ weighs in favor of a malignant process as opposed to a benign process.
