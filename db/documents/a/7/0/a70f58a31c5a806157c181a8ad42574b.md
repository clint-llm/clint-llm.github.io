Managing early onset scoliosis is a major challenge. The child is still growing and any intervention is only temporary. Bracing is of little use in this population. Treatment of early-onset scoliosis is a team-based interprofessional care approach. This includes pediatric, genetic, pulmonology, cardiology, anesthesia, surgeon, social work, and physical therapy experts. In certain cases, it can include the pediatric intensivist if anticipating a stay in the intensive care unit following surgery. Consultations with these specialists should include a pre-operative meeting to maximize the medical status of any patient undergoing a complex spinal deformity procedure. The surgical complications should be discussed with the caregiver. Overall, despite the numerous procedures available to manage scoliosis, optimal results are seen in very few patients.
