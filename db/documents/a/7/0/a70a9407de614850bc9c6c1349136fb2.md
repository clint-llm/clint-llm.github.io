The factors which can cause dermatitis herpetiformis includeÂ the following:

**Genetics**

Studies have documented a close association between dermatitis herpetiformis and certain HLA types, particularly HLA-DQ2, and to a lesser extent, HLA-DQ8. Other non-MHC genes have been linked to GSE in genome-wide association studies including myosin IXB, IL-12, IL-23, and CCR3, though their role in dermatitis herpetiformis is still unclear.

First degree relatives of patients with GSE or dermatitis herpetiformis are characteristically more likely to be affected by one or other disorder. Thus family screening may be indicated. Monozygotic twins have a disease concordance rate of over 0.9.

**Environmental Factors**

The principal environmental factor involved in the pathogenesis of the disease is dietary gluten and its constituent gliadin. Interestingly, tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is responsible for the modification of gliadin in the gut mucosa into a more immunogenic form. Other environmental factors causing dermatitis herpetiformis include iodine exposure (which can precipitate flares of the disease) and tobacco smoking (which can improve the condition).
