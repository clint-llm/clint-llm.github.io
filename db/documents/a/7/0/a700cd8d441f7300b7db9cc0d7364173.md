Smoking duration is the strongest risk factor in AAA development. Elevated risk of development also is seen with increasing age (males older than 50, females older than 60), male sex, white race and a positive family history. Additional associations are found with vasculitides, infectious aortitis, a low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) variant, and rarely, Marfan syndrome. Factors specifically linked with high rupture risk include AAA greater than 6 cm, female gender, current smoking, uncontrolled hypertension, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, AAA growth greater than 0.5 cm per year, and multiple family members with AAA.
