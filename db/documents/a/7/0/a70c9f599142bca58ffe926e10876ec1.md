Discuss the procedural risks and benefits with the patient. Connect the patient to a cardiac monitor to detect arrhythmias that may occur as a result of wire access into the right atrium. Place the patient in a supine position with the arm abducted and externally rotated. Use ultrasound to identify and select the appropriate vessel for access. With the measuring tape, measure the distance from the antecubital fossa to the midclavicular line and turn the tape measure to reach the third intercostal space at the right border of the sternum. This will be the approximate measurement of the catheter. Prep the area with an antiseptic solution. Appropriately drape the patient with sterile draping material. Place the sterile cover over the ultrasound probe. Ensure supplies are arranged in a sterile and organized fashion for easy access. Ensure items are in the center of the sterile field. Flush all catheter lumens with normal saline and clamp them shut. Sedation may be given for the procedure.
