Breast cancer is increasing in incidence and is one of the leading types of cancer. Once thought to be mostly a disease of elderly females, there is an increase in the incidence of breast cancer in women during their third and fourth decades of life. With increasing awareness, screening has become more prevalent, which in turn has increased the overall number of positive findings and subsequent testing. This activity reviews the applications of mammoscintigraphy in medicine today and highlights its advantages and disadvantages in the management of patients with breast pathology on screening or initial diagnostic studies.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the indications for mammoscintigraphy.
- Describe the preparation and technique required for mammoscintigraphy.
- Outline potential complications of mammoscintigraphy.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination to advance mammoscintigraphy and improve outcomes.
