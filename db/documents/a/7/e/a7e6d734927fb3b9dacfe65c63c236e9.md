The epidural space is bounded by the dural meninges anteriorly, the ligamentum flavum posteriorly and the sides of the vertebral walls laterally. It extends from the foramen magnum to the sacral hiatus. Its contents are tiny arteries and lymphatics, epidural fat, and a network of small valveless veins (Batson plexus). The epidural "space" is more of a potential space; a series of discontinuous compartments that open up when injected with liquid or air.
