Before 1977, surgery was the only method of treatment for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. As the most common clinical presentations are recurrent epistaxis and hemoptysis, surgical resection was the best curative treatment to prevent future episodes and recurrence of hemoptysis.

Embolization treatment is a procedure in which the feeding arteries to a pulmonary AVM are occluded. Endovascular therapy of this type is an outpatient-based procedure with minimal invasiveness.

Literature is also available to show that redirection of hepatic venous flow and heart transplantation can help in the case of the Glenn operation, which is usually done inÂ complex congenital heart disease.

There is a minimal and sometimes an adjunctive role of medical therapy when it comes to the management of diffuse pulmonary AVMs.
