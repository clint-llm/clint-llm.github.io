Colposcopy is a dying art but is a necessary step in the fight to prevent cervical cancer from ever developing. This procedure can be learned by multiple types of clinical practitioners. In the US, colposcopic services are delivered in diverse practice settings, including academic and non-academic referral settings, primary care environments in urban and rural communities, and funded by private and public resources.

The training of the variety of practitioners should be fostered and continued as there are fewer patients available due to improved screening techniques and risk-based recommendations and consolidation of information by organizations like the ASCCP. Clinicians should adhere to recommended standardization of the procedure as well as documentation in order to improve patient care. Just as standardization of terminology for the pathologist has enhanced communication between practitioner and pathologist, standardization of procedure and documentation will do the same. Enhancements in technology may continue to improve the reliability and validity of the colposcopy procedure.
