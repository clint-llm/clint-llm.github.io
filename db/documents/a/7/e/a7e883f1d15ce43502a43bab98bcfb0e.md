Children do not act as a scaled-down version of adults. They are unique in terms of anatomy, physiology, and pathology. The biology can be different even within the same disease type. For similar pathology, age can also be a critical prognostic determinant. Radiation exposure is a concern in pediatrics compared to adults. It is felt that children depending on their age, might be slightly more radiosensitive. Additionally, some nuclear medicine procedures evaluate physiological changes in vivo and real-time as they occur through pharmacologic interventions.

In other cases, nonradioactive drugs are used to prepare the patient and optimize radiopharmaceutical uptake for a specific study. There should also be special attention to potential interfering drugs with the uptake mechanism of the radiopharmaceutical. Examples of non-radioactive medications used for the preparation or during the exam include furosemide, acetazolamide, phenobarbital, cholecystokinin analog, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, adenosine analogs, and dobutamine.
