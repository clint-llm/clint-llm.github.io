Healthcare professionals work to heal their patients so that they might return to independent functioning. Patient ability levels often vary, and many face challenges that they are unable to overcome with their base level of functioning. In many cases, a patient can still achieve independent functioning or increase their ability to function through the use of assistive devices. Assistive technology devices (ATDs) are any systems, items, or pieces of equipment that help individuals with disabilities improve their functioning with daily tasks.

ATDs can be high tech devices such as eye-gaze systems, augmented communication boards, and environmental control systems, or simple low tech devices like reachers, walkers, and ramps. An ATD can be commercially made, or they can be custom tools built in the patient’s own home. To maximize a patient’s functional outcomes, patients should be assessed for need of an ATD, assisted in the acquisition or making of the ATD, and given the appropriate training and follow-up to ensure that the assistive device meets their individual needs.
