Neutropenic enterocolitis is a serious condition that affects the bowel wall in affected patients. It mainly occurs in patients on intensive chemotherapy that causes suppression of the patientâ€™s immune system. The weakened immune system and bowel wall inflammation allow bacteria to translocate to the bowel wall and sometimes enter the bloodstream.

The condition usually starts with abdominal pain that progressively worsens. Associated symptoms include diarrhea that is often bloody and fever. Patients may also have weakness and malaise.

It is important for patients who have received intensive chemotherapy or have undergone a stem cell transplant receive emergent care as early recognition and treatment prevent complications and may improve outcomes.
