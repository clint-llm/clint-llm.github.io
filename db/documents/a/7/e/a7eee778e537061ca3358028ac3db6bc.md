The following complications may present with osteogenesis imperfecta:

- Hyperplastic callus formation is rare and managed by conservative, palliative radiotherapy (caution: secondary malignancy) and bisphosphonates

- Tumors: Osteogenic sarcoma

- Basilar invagination: Cranial nerve involvement, direct brain stem compression, altered cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics

- Malignant hyperthermia: both the surgeon and anesthesiologistÂ should keep in mind the possibility of malignant hyperthermia during anesthesia
