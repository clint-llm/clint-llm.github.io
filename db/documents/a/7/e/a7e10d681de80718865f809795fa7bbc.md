Studies have shown that the most commonly found deficiency allele in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is the PI*Z allele that has a higher prevalence in northern and western Europe, while PI*S allele variants have a higher prevalence in southern Europe. The prevalence of the PI*ZZ deficiency allele accounts for 0.1% of the world population, while PI*SZ heterozygous allele deficiency represents about 0.7% of deficiency genotypes worldwide. Despite the relatively common appearance of these deficiency alleles, AATD is highly under-diagnosed, with fewer than 10% of the expected number of cases reported in the United States. The mean age when the disease was diagnosed was 41.3 years. As in other rare diseases, it often takes several doctors and many years before the diagnosis is made.
