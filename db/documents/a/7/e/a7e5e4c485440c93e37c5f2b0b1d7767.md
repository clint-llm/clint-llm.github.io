The gold standard diagnosis of multiple system atrophy can only be carried out post mortem. It is based on the intracellular build-up of alpha-synuclein and accompanying neurodegenerative changes in the accompanying brain structures.Â The MSA diagnosis used in practice is, therefore, pieced together based on its clinical features. Formal diagnosis requires the presence of adult-onset (over age 30) parkinsonian or cerebellar ataxia, the presence of autonomic failure in the urinary or cardiovascular system, and one additional supporting feature of MSA.

MSA and Parkinson's disease parallel many of the same clinical symptoms but differ in their response to levodopa. A poor response to levodopa is found in MSA, while patients with Parkinson's respond well to levodopa. This distinction is useful clinically to separate the conditions and is often used as a supporting feature in MSA diagnosis.
