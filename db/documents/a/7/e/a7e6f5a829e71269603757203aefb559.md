Dermoscopy is vital in their evaluation, as it is a cheap, quick, non-invasive method that can provide the physician with very useful information in distinguishing CMN from other cutaneous lesions and in diagnosing early malignant transformation. Globular, cobblestone, and reticular patterns are the most frequently encountered. Useful features in diagnosing CMN include haloed and target globules, blotches, and perifollicular hypopigmentation.

On acral skin, CMN frequently combine a parallel furrow pattern (similar to the one seen in acquired melanocytic nevi) with dots on the crista, presenting a "peas-in-a-pod" appearance.

Whenever there is clinical suspicion of melanoma, an urgent biopsy with histopathological examination must be performed.

Patients with large or giant CMN, especially when satellitosis is present, should undergo prompt evaluation (within the first 4 to 6 months of life) with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to rule out neurological involvement. MRI can detect melanocytic deposits, which manifest as hyperintensities on T1-weighted images and hypointensities on T2-weighted images. The temporal lobe (especially the amygdala) is the most commonly affected brain region. Leptomeningeal involvement is also frequent.
