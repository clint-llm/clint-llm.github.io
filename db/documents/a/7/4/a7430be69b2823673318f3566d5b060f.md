A good, clean urinalysis (UA) specimen is vital to the workup. A clean catch specimen in non-obese women is preferred. Most obese women cannot give a clean specimen, and epithelial cells in the UA mean the urine sample was exposed to the genital surface and did not come directly out of the urethra. Get a clean sample with very few epithelial cells. This might require a quick catheterization. In-and-out catheterization of the bladder will cause UTI in uninfected women about 1% of the time. Men should start the urine stream to clean the urethra and then obtain a midstream sample. Urine should be sent to the lab immediately or refrigerated because bacteria grow rapidly when the sample is left at room temperature, causing an overestimate of the infection's severity.

Do not base the diagnosis of a UTI solely upon visual inspection of the urine. Cloudy urine can be aseptic; the cloudiness can come from protein or calcium phosphate debris in the sample, not necessarily from an infection. Crystal clear urine can be grossly infected. All urines undergo dipstick testing, which can be done at the bedside. Helpful dipstick values are pH, nitrites, leukocyte esterase, and blood. Remember that in patients with symptoms of a UTI, a negative dipstick does not rule out the UTI, but positive findings can suggest and help make the diagnosis. Look for the presence of bacteria and/or white blood cells (WBC) in the urine on microscopic urinalysis.

Normal urine pH is slightly acidic, with usual values of 5.5 to 7.5, but the normal range is 4.5 to 8.0. A urine pH of 8.5 or 9.0 often indicates a urea-splitting organism, such as Proteus, Klebsiella, or Ureaplasma urealyticum. An alkaline urine pH can signify struvite kidney stones, also known as "infection stones."

The nitrate test is the most accurate dipstick test because bacteria must be present in the urine to convert nitrates to nitrites; this takes 6 hours and is why urologists often request the first-morning urine for testing, particularly in males. The specificity of this test is greater than 90%.Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter.

Leukocyte esterase (LE) identifies the presence of WBCs in the urine. The WBCs release the LE, presumably in response to bacteria in the urine. This is why the dipstick LE is a secondary test with a specificity of only 55% for UTIs. LE is good at detecting WBCs in the urine, but WBCs can be in the bladder for other reasons, like inflammatory disorders.

Hematuria can be helpful because bacterial infections of the transitional cell lining of the bladder can cause bleeding. This helps distinguish UTI from vaginitis and urethritis, which do not cause blood in the urine.

In many labs, the presence of nitrites or leukocyte esterase will automatically trigger a microscopic evaluation of the urine for bacteria, WBCs, and RBCs. On microscopy, there should be no visible bacteria in uninfected urine, so any bacteria on Gram-stained urine under high field microscopy is highly correlated to bacteriuria and UTIs. A good urine sample with greater than 10 WBC/HPF is abnormal and highly suggestive of a UTI in symptomatic patients.

Urine cultures are not usually required in uncomplicated UTIs according to guidelines but are recommended due to increasing antibiotic resistance and to help differentiate recurrent from relapsing infections. Urine should be cultured in all men and all patients with diabetes mellitus, who are immunosuppressed, and women who are pregnant. Classic teaching on urine culture sets the gold standard for infected urine at greater than 10 colony forming units (CFU) per milliliter. Recent literature states that a patient who presents with symptoms and greater than 10 CFU/mL is diagnostic of a urinary tract infection. Urine cultures rarely help in the emergency department, except with recurrent UTIs, but can make subsequent treatment easier if patients do not respond to the initial antibiotic prescribed.

Collecting urine is critical. Midstream voided specimens are very accurate if the patient follows the correct technique. Lactobacilli and squamous cells indicate contamination, and a catheterized specimen may be necessary. In young children and those with spinal cord injuries, suprapubic aspiration may need to be done to collect a proper urine specimen.
