The goals of ART in HIV-2 are similar to those for HIV-1â€“prevention of transmission, immune restoration, durable viral suppression, and a reduction in morbidity and mortality.

Currently, it is recommended that all patients diagnosed with HIV-2 be started on ART as soon as possible after diagnosis.

The fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide also has no HIV-2 activity and should not be used. These drug resistance patterns result from natural polymorphisms in HIV-2 that result in ineffective or less effective binding to comparable drug target sites in HIV-1.

The initial monitoring of patients with HIV-2 should follow the same recommended guidelines set out for HIV-1 patients except baseline resistance testing. To determine treatment progress, clinicians can follow CD4 counts and HIV-2 viral loads if they are available. However, in patients with undetectable baseline viral loads, treatment failure should be suspected if disease progression or continued CD4 decline occurs.
