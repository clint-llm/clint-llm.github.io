Adapalene is a topical retinoid that is FDA-approved for the treatment of acne vulgaris and used off-label in the treatment of many conditions, including verrucae, molluscum contagiosum, Darier disease, Fox-Fordyce disease, Dowling-Degos disease, photoaging, pigmentary disorders such as melasma and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, actinic keratoses, and alopecia areata. The multidimensional acne global grading system, which incorporates primary acne lesions (comedones, papules, and nodules) and associated secondary changes (postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring), is useful in the comprehensive clinical evaluation of acne to guideÂ appropriate treatment choices.

Clinicians and specialists who prescribe this agent and pharmacists interacting with patients must be fully aware of its side effects and contraindications. Pharmacists will also perform thorough medication reconciliation. Due to the lack of epidemiologic data, clinicians should not prescribe adapalene to women during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
