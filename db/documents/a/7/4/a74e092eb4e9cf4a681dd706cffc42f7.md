The stage is the most important prognostic factor, followed by tumor rupture [indicates worse prognosis]. Large size (more than 15 cm) and bilaterality are unfavorable prognostic factors; however, the prognostic impact of size disappears when corrected for the stage. Mitotic activity or nuclear atypia do not correlate with clinical outcome. Homozygous FOXL2 mutation, higher FOXL2 mRNA expression, and chromosomal imbalance are associated with early relapse and worse outcomes.
