Peak bone density occurs approximately between the ages of 18 and 25. Bone remodeling is a part of the normal physiological activity where osteoclasts, assisted by transcription factors, degrade bone matrix, and osteoblasts are signaled to rebuild the bone. Osteoporosis is a degenerative pathway resulting from excessive bone resorption or inadequate formation of new bone and results in a decrease in cancellous bone density, thereby weakening itsÂ architecture and structure. Subsequently, a rapid increase in bone remodeling increases fragility to the point that low impact movement leads to compression fractures.

The spine acts to stabilize three forces of compression, distraction, and torsion.

Infection and other spine diseases cause erosion of the vertebral body. The spine begins to collapse, causing deformity and potentially resulting in a compression/burst type fracture affecting the anterior and middle columns.
