In optics, a prism is a device that uses refraction to change the direction of light. In nearly all applications, the refractive index of a prism (e.g. 1.49 for plastic) is higher than that of the medium it exists in (e.g. 1.00 for air). Therefore Snellâ€™s law of refraction dictates that the light is bent toward the base of the prism. This light deflection is the sum of the deflection at both interfaces, or sides, of the prism. The more light is bent, the more power a prism is said to have. Prism power is measured in prism diopter which is defined as the amount of light deflection in cm at a distance of 100 cm. For example, since a 45-degree angle is formed when light is deflected 100 cm away over a distance of 100 cm, 100 prism diopters correspond to 45 degrees.

The amount of deflection depends on both the refractive index of the material and the position the prism is held in. With a higher refractive index, glass prisms deflect light more than plastic prisms and are more prone to error.

Since prism power is due to refraction, the frequency of the light influences the amount of deflection from a prism. Higher frequency blue light gets refracted more than lower frequency red light; therefore, a prism will bend blue light more than red light. This fact can be exploited to allow for white light to be separated into its constituent colors by a prism.

In ophthalmology, prisms are used to measure the misalignment of the eyes, to induce misalignment to facilitate various tests and to treat misalignment. To treat misalignment, one must first measure the misalignment. This is done by holding prisms in front of one or both eyes until the eyes are aligned.

Complicating the discussion of prism power is the fact that glass and plastic prisms are calibrated for use in different positions. Plastic prisms are calibrated to be used in the position of minimum deviation. Glass prisms are calibrated such that the posterior surface is held perpendicular to the visual axis; this is known as the Prentice position. Finally, plastic prism bars are calibrated to be held perpendicular to the face; this is known as frontal plane position. In practice, the difference between the frontal plane and the position of minimum deviation is minimal. Because the position of the prism is crucial, one should not hold two prisms over the same eye in the same direction as the second prism will be out of position. Instead, the prisms can be split over each eye.

The position of least deviation is the most forgiving position. Since a prism mistakenly held outside the position of minimum deviation will have more effective power, any errors in holding a plastic prism results in falsely low measurements. Meanwhile, an error in holding a glass prism in Prentice Position could result in falsely high or falsely lower readings depending on which way the prism was out of position. Glass prisms are less frequently used.

Spherocylindrical lenses such as glasses and bifocals have prismatic power when looking outside the optical center. When observing a high myope, the side of their face can often appear shifted and directly behind their lens to an observer. This is an important consideration in diplopia induced by bifocals, especially in cases of anisometropia. In such cases of anisometropia, the prism can be added or removed from a portion of the lens to cancel out the prismatic power of looking outside the optical center. This is referred to as slab off or reverse slab off.
