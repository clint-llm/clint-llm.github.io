Complications from chest tube placement are significant and have the potential to create life-threatening iatrogenic injuries.

Have an increased concern for injury to any structures within the vicinity of the tube placement, including:

- Lungs

- Diaphragm

- Esophagus

- Heart

- Liver

- Spleen

It does not require much force to perforate the diaphragm and enter the abdominal cavity. Additionally, consider the potential complication from injuring a vessel during the procedure that could cause indolent or profound bleeding within the thoracic space. This could include injury to the:

- Great vessels

- Lateral thoracic artery

- Thoracoacromial artery

- Intercostal vessels

- Internal thoracic vessels

- Pulmonary vessels

Furthermore, if there is no resolution of the space-occupying lesion, consider that the tube placement may be outside the pleural space or that the loculated cavity has not been successfully decompressed.
