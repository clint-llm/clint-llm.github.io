Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G4 subclass designed to inhibit receptor signaling downstream of the JAK-STAT pathway by blocking interleukin-4/interleukin-13 (IL-4/IL-13) receptors.

As an IL-4RÎ± antagonist, dupilumab inhibits the signaling of pro-inflammatory cytokines, or interleukins, that induce inflammatory and immunological responses in several conditions, including eczema, asthma, allergic reactions, and rhinosinusitis.

By blocking this pathway, dupilumab affects three integral disease mechanisms of AD: the decrease of skin barrier function, the class switch to IgE, and the Th2-differentiation.
