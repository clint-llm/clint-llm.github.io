- Overcorrection: Surgical intervention in cases of trochlear nerve palsy may occasionally result in an overcorrection, and the hypertropia may be converted into hypotropia. The resulting diplopia may be incapacitating for the patient.

- Iatrogenic Brown syndrome: Deficiency of elevation in adduction can occur due to excessive tucking of the superior oblique muscle.

- The manifestation of trochlear palsy: In cases of bilateral masked palsy of the fourth nerve, the paresis in the other eye may manifest after surgery of one eye if initially misdiagnosed as a unilateral case.
