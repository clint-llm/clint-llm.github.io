Prophylaxis in newborns: Intramuscular injection of vitamin K is preferable in all infants due to increased efficacy over oral administration. If orally administered and the newborn vomits or regurgitates within 1 hour of dose, repeating oral dose is appropriate. Oral administration should be avoided in preterm infants, infants with cholestasis, or in infants with other intestinal maladies that may interfere with absorption. Additionally, oral administration should be avoided in infants whose mother was taking Vitamin K interfering medications such as anticonvulsants.

Treatment of minor bleeding and maintenance of vitamin K levels can utilize oral Vitamin K1, but in severe bleeding, an intravenous is the route of choice.

For adults with a risk or diagnosis of osteoporosis and fractures, there should be a consideration of vitamin K administration.
