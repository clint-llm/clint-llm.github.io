The treatment for PAN is dependent on the severity of the disease.

Over the past few years, the use of biological agents has increased in patients with recalcitrant disease.

Patients with associated hepatitis B or C infection also benefit from treatment with antivirals. For patients with mild PAN, treatment with antivirals should occur before any immunosuppressive medications are added. Patients with severe hepatitis B-associated PAN may benefit from short-term treatment with glucocorticoids and plasma exchange in addition to antiviral therapy.

Hypertension should be treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The hypertension in PAN is considered to be mediated through the activation of the renin-angiotensin system.

Surgery is often required to manage bowel perforation, cholecystitis, and aneurysms of blood vessels.
