Patient-centered interprofessional team-based care is vital in managing patients with metastatic melanoma. Well-implemented team-based care has the potential to improve the comprehensiveness, efficiency, effectiveness, coordination, and value of care in every step of management, from evaluation and diagnosis of the disease to management of complications related to disease or treatment, as well as regular follow-ups, and psychosocial support. This team will consist of clinicians (both physicians and mid-level practitioners), specialists (oncologists, system-specific specialists), oncology-specialized nursing staff, pharmacists (also preferable with oncology specialized training), and mental health professionals.

It is incumbent on all interprofessional team members treating patients with metastatic melanoma to contribute to the case from their specialized areas. Still, they must also work collaboratively as a team, using open information sharing and accurate record-keeping, and involving other team members as the patient's condition changes and in cases of therapeutic failure, medication adverse events, or any other concerns. In this way, all team members will have access to the same information regarding the patient's progress and can involve other team members as necessary to drive optimal patient outcomes and minimize the chances doe adverse events and treatment failure.
