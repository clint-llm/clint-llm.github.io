Measuring urinary cGMP might prove to be a diagnostic tool for kidney function. When examining the kidney, iodine-based radiocontrast agents are used for angiographic procedures. The use of such agents has drawn criticism for the potential risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). New biomarkers are under investigation to protect patients from this risk. Renal functions influence cGMP concentration in the urine, so studies have been done investigating the use of cGMP as an additional biomarker for renal function to predict major renal events. Research has found that urine cGMP/creatinine ratio greater than or equal to 120 micromoles/millimole before receiving contrast medium is an encouraging biomarker for dialysis along with all-cause mortality 90 days after contrast medium exposure in patients with preexisting diabetes or renal impairments.

Phosphorylated-vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (P-VASP) is the established marker for physiological cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling; this is because cGMP-dependent kinases primarily phosphorylate VASP.
