The term laceration implies the mechanism of injury; however, other things may present with a similar clinical picture of a deficit in the extensor mechanism function:

- Mallet finger (avulsion of the extensor tendon insertion from the distal phalanx, with or without the involvement of a bony fragment)

- Arthritis (chronic irritation to the tendon may resultÂ in damage to the extensor mechanism causing a classical deformity like boutonniere, swan neck or a simple tendon rupture near the joint affected)

- Trigger finger (will result in loss of passive extension as well as active)

- Posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) syndrome (patient will be unable to extend actively, but tenodesis will remain normal)
