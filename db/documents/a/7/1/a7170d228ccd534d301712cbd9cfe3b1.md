Primary tracheal cancers may present with signs and symptoms of upper airway obstruction (dyspnea, stridor, and wheezing), cough and hemoptysis from mucosal irritation, or symptoms related to invasion of adjacent structures and lead to dysphagia or hoarseness due to recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Squamous cell carcinoma usually presents with hemoptysis and is diagnosed within four to six months of symptoms onset, while adenoid cystic carcinoma is slowly growing and presents with dyspnea and wheezing, with a potential for delayed diagnosis.

Several factors play a role in missed and delayed diagnosis. First, non-specific symptoms like a cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and wheezing are also present in more common diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchitis, or other infections. Second, the tracheal lumen is usually large with a significant reservoir, and symptoms of obstruction do not occur until the mass occupies more than 50 to 75% of the lumen diameter.

A high index of suspicion for tracheal cancer should be raised when respiratory symptoms are not responding to initial medical therapy. Tracheal squamous cell carcinoma typically occurs more in men between the ages of 60 to 70 years and mostly in smokers. In contrast, tracheal adenoid cystic carcinomas have equal gender predisposition, occur between the ages of 40 and 50, and do not demonstrate any smoking association.
