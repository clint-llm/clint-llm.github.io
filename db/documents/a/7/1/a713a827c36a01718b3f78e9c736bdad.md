Although survival rates with cryoglobulinemia are 70 percent after 10 years of evident symptoms and approximately 50 percent after 10 years of post-diagnosis, it can lead to long-term renal and lymphoproliferative cell disorders. It is thus necessary to timely diagnose and manage appropriately those diagnosed with cryoglobulinemia. A high index of suspicion in-person presenting with symptoms related toÂ cryoglobulinemia and appropriate investigations can lead to better patient outcomes. Nurses need to be vigilant about a drop in hemoglobin and platelet and monitor renal function tests also look for symptoms related to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and uremia. It may also be essential to coordinate with a nephrologist if the patient develops acute renal failure and needs dialysis. Thus, a good patient outcome requires proper communication among physicians, nurses, pharmacists, nephrologists, and their teamwork.
