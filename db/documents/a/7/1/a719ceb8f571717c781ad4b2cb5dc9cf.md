Andexanet alfa is a recombinant modified Factor Xa protein approved by the FDA in May 2018 to reverse apixaban and rivaroxaban in patients with life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Anticoagulation reversal is often a critical need when therapy does not work as planned and bleeding ensues. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent to members of the interprofessional team to use andexanet alfa when factor Xa reversal is appropriate.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for the use of andexanet alfa.
- Review the dosing parameters for andexanet alfa.
- Summarize the mechanism of action of andexanet alfa.
- Explain the importance of anticoagulation monitoring and how it affects therapeutic strategy to improve care coordination among the interprofessional team when initiating andexanet alfa factor Xa inhibitor reversal to achieve the best outcomes.
