The pathophysiology of central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia is still not well understood. A study by Sperling and colleagues identified cytokeratin 75 expressions in unaffected and affected tissues.

Another theory suggested that CCCA may be a fibroproliferative disorder (FPD). These FPDs are characterized by persistent irritation and mild inflammation, which leads to end-stage fibrosis. Further immune histochemical studies are needed to identify other suspected acquired or heritable mutations that predispose certain particular populations to CCCA.
