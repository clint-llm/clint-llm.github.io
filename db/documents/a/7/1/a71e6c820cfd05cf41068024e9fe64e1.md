Exposure to various factors in adolescence and adulthood appears linked to the development of testicular cancer. Firefighters and aircraft maintenance personnel, and farmers exposed to organochloride pesticides appear to have an increased risk of developing testicular cancer. Case-control studies have revealed significant associations between seminoma and levels of cis-nonachlor, trans-nonachlor, oxychlordane, and total chlordane.

Ochratoxin A, a substance less well-studied, naturally occurs in theÂ mold in grains, coffee, nuts, and spices that have recently been linked to testicular cancer.
