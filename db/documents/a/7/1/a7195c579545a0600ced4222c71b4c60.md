Fever induction in humans occurs at a high metabolic cost, such that only a 1 C rise in body temperature requires a 10–12.5% increase in metabolic rate.

Metabolic effects associated with a febrile state:

- Increased oxygen demand

- Increased heart rate
- Increased respiratory rate

- Increased use of body proteins as an energy source

- Metabolism switches from utilizing glucose (an excellent medium for bacterial growth) to utilizing the breakdown products of protein and fat

- Enhanced immune function

- Increase in the motility and activity of white blood cells
- Stimulates interferon production and activation of T cells

- Growth inhibition of specific microbial agents

- Many microbial agents that cause infection tend to grow at normal body temperatures

A sustained, severely elevated fever can lead to lethal effects within multiple organ systems:

- Brain

- Acute neurologic and cognitive function may occur after an episode of hyperthermia, with approximately 50% of heatstroke survivors experiencing chronic neurologic damage. Specifically, the Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex are sensitive to heat damage, which can lead to long-lasting cerebellar dysfunction.

- Cardiovascular

- Acutely, a hyperthermic patient will tend to be hypotensive with a high cardiac output due to blood redistribution and nitric-oxide-induced vasoconstriction. In severe fever, such as heatstroke, an electrocardiogram may show T-wave abnormalities, QT and ST changes, and conduction defects. In addition, serum troponin I levels may be significantly raised.

- Gastrointestinal

- Above 40 C (104 F), there is a reduction in blood flow to the GI tract. In addition, oxidative stress, denatured proteins, and damaged cell membranes are evident, increasing the potential for releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, GI inflammation, and edema.

- Liver

- Elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT) are observed in individuals with body temperatures above 40 C, with severe cases leading to permanent hepatocellular damage requiring a liver transplant. It is important to note that liver function may continue to decline even after correcting hyperthermia. For this reason, a clinician should trend the patient's liver enzymes to ensure no ongoing liver damage exists.

- Kidney

- Patients with an increased body temperature are at a significantly greater risk for acute kidney injury (AKI). An increase in body temperature by only 2 C leads to a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which continues to fall with a further rise in temperature. Lab studies will show an increase in plasma creatinine and urea. Additionally, a hyperthermic state stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), leading to a subsequent reduction in blood flow to the kidney.

- Hemostasis

- Inhibition of platelet aggregation, spontaneous bleeding, increased clotting times, thrombocytopenia, and increased plasma fibrin degradation productions are classically seen in hyperthermic patients.
