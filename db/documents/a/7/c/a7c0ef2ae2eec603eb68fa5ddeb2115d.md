The exact pathogenic role of Malassezia spp. in skin disease is not entirely understood. Whereas PV is a superficial fungal infection that may involve high fungal load without significant inflammation, AD, Malassezia folliculitis, psoriasis, and SD are disorders inherently characterized by inflammation. The disease most likely occurs as a multifactorial process involving yeast enzymatic action on the skin, interaction with the host immune system, and environmental and genetic factors. Furthermore, Malassezia colonization can exacerbate existing dermatoses and act opportunistically in immunocompromised individuals.
