Renal osteodystrophy is one of the main complications of end-stage renal disease that leads to skeletal and extraskeletal manifestations. Although it may be unavoidable in patients undergoing hemodialysis, appropriate and timely interventions can help alleviate the symptoms experienced by the patients and also reduce the osteodystrophy-related comorbidities. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of renal osteodystrophy and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of renal osteodystrophy.
- Outline the physical findings of a patient with renal osteodystrophy.
- Describe the management considerations for patients with renal osteodystrophy.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by renal osteodystrophy.
