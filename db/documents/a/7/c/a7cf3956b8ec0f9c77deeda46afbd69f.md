**Ureteral Obstruction**

The most common indication for PoC US of the urinary system in the ED is concern for ureteral obstruction caused by nephrolithiasis. Patients classically present with sudden-onset, unilateral, colicky flank pain that may radiate anteriorly or to the groin, often with microscopic or gross hematuria, nausea, and vomiting.

The most specific finding indicating ureteral obstruction on ultrasound of the kidneys is hydronephrosis, which appears as an enlarged anechoic area within the normally hyperechoic collecting system. Hydronephrosis is categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. In mild hydronephrosis, the renal papillae – the point of transition between pyramids and minor calyces – are preserved while the major calyces are enlarged due to increased urinary volume and pressure. Sonographically, this appears as an anechoic triangle at the renal pelvis, tapering to the proximal junction with the ureter. Moderate hydronephrosis is characterized by further dilation of the calyces, obliteration of the renal papillae, and blunting and rounding of the pyramids. The sonographic appearance of moderate hydronephrosis takes the form of an anechoic “bear paw,” with the dilated calyces representing finger-like projections. Cortical involvement distinguishes moderate from severe hydronephrosis. In severe hydronephrosis, the calyces coalesce into a single, large, anechoic space. The renal cortex is the only remaining recognizable structure, and this too is compressed (its normal thickness is about 1 cm) due to increased pressure within the renal sinus. Without a known etiology, severe hydronephrosis should prompt further diagnostic testing.

In the setting of acute flank pain, mild or moderate hydronephrosis on PoC US supports the diagnosis of ureterolithiasis. However, hydronephrosis is also common in the setting of pregnancy and urinary retention. Ureteral obstruction occurs asymptomatically in more than 90% of pregnant women.

Care should be taken to avoid mistaking other anechoic structures for hydronephrosis. Examples include medullary pyramids, hilar vessels, parapelvic cysts, and an extrarenal pelvis. To ensure correct interpretation, scan through the entire kidney to delineate its architecture. Pyramids sit just below the cortex and are bounded by parenchymal tissue with the collapsed, hyperechoic collecting system medially. Hilar vessels display a branching pattern and, if uncertain, can be distinguished using color Doppler to demonstrate blood flow. Parapelvic cysts are uncommon, occurring in 1.25% to 1.5% of the population. They appear cystic, do not have branches, are located proximal to the hilum rather than within the parenchyma, and do not communicate with the renal pelvis.

In general, ultrasound is not helpful in visualizing ureteral stones because the ureters are usually obscured by acoustic shadowing from bowel gas. However, stones can sometimes be seen in 3 locations: (1) within the kidney; (2) at the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ); and (3) at the UVJ. They appear very hyperechoic with posterior acoustic shadowing. Stones within the renal parenchyma are a common finding but do not cause obstruction and should not cause pain at this location. UPJ stones cause obstruction proximally and can be seen medial to the kidney in a coronal view. UVJ stones can be seen on the posterior-inferior wall of the bladder in a transverse view. This is the most common site for an ureterolith to lodge since it is the narrowest section of the ureter.

**Urinary Retention**

Suspicion of urinary retention can be confirmed via ultrasound of the bladder. In the transverse plane, the width (W) and anterior-posterior dimension (depth [D]) are measured in centimeters at their largest point. In the sagittal plane, the largest superior-inferior dimension (height [H]) is measured. Bladder volume in milliliters can then be calculated with a correction factor as follows: Volume (mL) = 0.75 x W x D x H.

**Foley Placement**

Ultrasound can be used to confirm correct placement of a Foley in cases of urinary retention by visualizing the hyperechoic surface of the catheter balloon within the lumen. It may also be used to guide Foley placement in cases of challenging transurethral catheterization, especially in men.
