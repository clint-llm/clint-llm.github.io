Use of dantrolene for malignant hyperthermia: Dantrolene is the only known treatment for malignant hyperthermia and should be administered as soon as possible following the identification of the symptoms of the disease process.

Performing RCTs for malignant hyperthermia on humans would be unethical, given the known response and treatment with dantrolene and the known mortality if left untreated. Finally, it is crucial to understand that substantial evidence indicating the efficacy of dantrolene for malignant hyperthermia is lacking. Therefore, careful monitoring and care coordination between all members of the interprofessional team (clinicians, mid-level practitioners, anesthesiology specialists, nursing staff, and pharmacists) will optimize dantrolene therapy and administration to provide the needed therapeutic effects while preventing adverse reactions.
