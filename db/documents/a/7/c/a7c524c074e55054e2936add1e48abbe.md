In 2006, the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) adopted a TNM staging system for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

**Primary Tumor (T) Classification**

- T1 - Tumor with the greatest diameter less than 2 cm  and limited to the pancreas

- T2 - Tumor with the greatest >2 cm and limited to the pancreas

- T3 - Tumor growing beyond the pancreas without any involvement of the celiac trunk or superior mesenteric artery

- T4 - Unresectable tumor - Involves the celiac trunk or superior mesenteric artery

**Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**

- N0 - No regional lymph node metastasis

- N1 - Regional lymph node metastasis

**Distant Metastases (M)**

- M0 - No distant metastasis

- M1 - Distant metastasis

- Stage 1a - T1 N0 M0

- Stage 1b - T2 N0 M0

- Stage 2a  - T3 N0 M0

- Stage 2b  - T1-3 N1 M0

- Stage 3  - T4 N0-1 M0

- Stage 4 - Any T  M1

- Stage 1 - NA

- Stage 2A - NA

- Stage 2B - NA

- Stage 3A - NA

- Stage 3B - NA

- Stage 4 - NA

TNM staging by ENETS is:

**Primary Tumor (T) Classification**

- T1 - Tumor  less than 2 cm and limited to the pancreas

- T2 - Tumor 2-4 cm and limited to the pancreas

- T3 - Tumor  not growing beyond the pancreas, >4 cm, or growing into the duodenum or common bile duct

- T4 - Tumor growing into the adjacent structures including stomach, the wall of large vessels like the celiac trunk or superior mesenteric artery, adrenal gland, colon or spleen

**Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**

- N0 - No regional lymph node metastasis

- N1 - Regional lymph node metastasis

**Distant Metastases (M)**

- M0 - No distant metastasis

- M1 - Distant metastasis

- Stage 1a - NA

- Stage 1b - NA

- Stage 2a - NA

- Stage 2b - NA

- Stage 3 - NA

- Stage 4 - NA

- Stage 1 - T1 N0 M0

- Stage 2A - T2 N0 M0

- Stage 2B - T3 N0 M0

- Stage 3A - T4 N0 M0

- Stage 3B - Any T N1 M0

- Stage 4 - Any T Any N M1

The details of TNM staging by AJCC and ENETS show major differences between the two systems.
