- Catatonia was traditionally associated with schizophrenia. In the latest version of the DSM V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual V), it has its own category.

- When prominent negative symptoms and psychomotor symptoms are noted in a patient with schizophrenia, consider catatonic schizophrenia.

- Catatonic schizophrenia can be a medical emergency; the BFCRS must be used for early detection. Medical support is often warranted and necessary. Underlying medical and neurological causes must be ruled out.

- Treat medical complications first.

- A benzodiazepine challenge is warranted. Treat aggressively with IV benzodiazepines for at least 3-7 days. Clinical trials have shown the use of up to 24 mg IV lorazepam.

- Catatonic schizophrenia has a poor response to benzodiazepines and often responds better to ECT.

- These patients have a poor prognosis, and relapse and remission of symptoms are usually seen. Maintenance ECT is considered helpful.
