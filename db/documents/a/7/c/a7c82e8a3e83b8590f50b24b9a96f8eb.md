Platypnea is a symptom and not a disease, so once found, a careful history and physical examination should focus on finding the underlying disease that may predispose to it.

- Vital signs in orthodeoxia: Not responding to oxygen administration may be related to the presence ofÂ a right-to-left shunt.

- Assessment for spider nevi, palmar erythema, ascites, edema, etc. may be signs of chronic liver disease.

- Heart exam for any murmurs that may suggest a shunt.

- Lung exam for underlying lung disease (exam will vary based on disease, for example, velcro crackles in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis).
