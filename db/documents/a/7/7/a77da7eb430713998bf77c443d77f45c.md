The thoracodorsal nerve arises from the C6, C7, and C8 roots but its predominant root is C7.

The thoracodorsal nerve courses inferiorly and laterally to form the latissimus dorsi pedicle. In the pedicle, the thoracodorsal nerve is superficial to the thoracodorsal artery and vein.

The thoracodorsal nerve may be identified as posterior and lateral to the lateral thoracic vein, two centimeters from the confluence of the lateral thoracic vein and the axillary vein.
