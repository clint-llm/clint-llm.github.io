The plantar aspect of the tarsal joints is supplied by the lateral and medial plantar nerves whereas the deep peroneal nerve supplies the dorsal aspect of the joint.  The intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve gives branches to supply the joint between the lateral and intermediate cuneiform bones whereas the subtalar and calcaneocuboid joints receive innervation from the accessory deep peroneal nerve and the lateral dorsal cutaneous nerve.

The plantar aspect of the tarsometatarsal joint receives its nerve supply from the medial and lateral plantar nerves whereas the dorsal aspect is supplied by the deep peroneal nerve. The intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve supplies the cuboid-metatarsal joint and a similar but sparser supply is received by the intermetatarsal joints. The joint between the fourth and fifth metatarsal derives its nerve supply from branches of the intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve.

The metatarsophalangeal joints primarily receive its main supply from the plantar digital nerve, The innervation of the interphalangeal joints is from the medial dorsal cutaneous branch of the superficial fibular nerve and plantar interdigital nerves Occasionally, branches of the deep fibular, sural, and the intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve can also innervate these joints.
