The choriocapillaris supplies the outer layer of the retina including the fovea centralis, the area of the highest cone concentration in the retina.

The ophthalmic artery has branches that enter the eye (optic branches) and orbitalÂ branches. The orbital branches include:

- **Lacrimal Artery:**The second and largest branch of the ophthalmic artery. It enters the orbit and travels alongside the lacrimal nerve to supply the lacrimal gland. Its terminal branches supply the eyelids and conjunctiva.

- **Supraorbital Artery**: This artery travels medially, through the supraorbital foramen to supply the levator palpebrae superioris, frontal sinus, and skin of the forehead.

- **Posterior****Ethmoidal Artery**: Supplies the posterior ethmoidal sinuses and meninges.

- **Anterior Ethmoidal Artery:**Supplies the anterior/middle ethmoid and frontal sinuses.

- **Medial Palpebral Artery:**Creates two additional branches, superior and inferior medial palpebral arteries, all of which contribute to the eyelids blood supply.
