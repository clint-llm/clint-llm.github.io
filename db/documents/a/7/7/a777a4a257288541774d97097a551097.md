Patients with nail-patella syndrome can show decreased upper and lower extremity muscle mass resembling dystrophic muscular disease.

Similar to the nails, patients with NPS have absent, hypoplastic, or irregular patellae, which frequently sublux superolaterally, although the non-displaced position of the patella may be naturally lateral and superior.

Limited elbow joint range of motion in extension, pronation, and supination may be elicited. Skin contractures and superficial web-like membranes called pterygia at the elbow joint can be seen.

Extraskeletal systemic manifestations of NPS are notable for renal, ophthalmic, and neurological involvement. Renal involvement has been reported in 30-60% of patients with NPS, and the degree of severity is the dominant factor that influences mortality, as progression to renal failure can occur rapidly and in as much as 10% of patients.

The most common ophthalmic findings are open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension, which present earlier in patients with NPS compared to the unaffected population but are treatable and preventable with screening measures.

Common neurological symptoms can include numbness, tingling, and neuropathic pain in a non-peripheral nerve or dermatomal pattern, which affect the distal more so than the proximal limb.
