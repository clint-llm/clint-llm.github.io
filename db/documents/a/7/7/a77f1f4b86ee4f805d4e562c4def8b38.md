Unfortunately, treatment options for anhidrosis can be limited unless an offending agent can be discontinued. Providers need to stress the importance of maintaining a cool environment for the patient. The use of water spray bottles for purposes of cooling can prove helpful. For those disorders due to clogged sweat glands, frequent and gentle exfoliation is useful. Those with disorders of cornification and overheating, such as lamellar ichthyosis, should be treated aggressively and monitored closely.

Although there is no remarkable evidence to support the use of corticosteroids, many case reports recommend the administration of corticosteroids in the early stages of AIGA.

The cornerstone for the treatment of anhidrosis is the management of the underlying cause, such as treating lung carcinoma if that is causing Horner syndrome and resulting in anhidrosis.
