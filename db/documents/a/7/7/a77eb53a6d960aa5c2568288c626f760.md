Successful treatment of encopresis requires a team approach—family members, health care providers, and the patient work as a team for better treatment outcomes.

- The providers must explain that constipation often leads to a vicious circle that results in stool withholding, fecal retention, and eventually fecal incontinence.

- It is essential to clarify to the family that fecal incontinence is caused by rectal impaction and is beyond the child's control.

- Furthermore, parents need to understand that there is no quick solution to this condition. However, parents should be reassured that recovery is possible with adequate, often protracted treatment.

Treatment plans should include:

- Instructions for initial management, ongoing care, how to address relapses at home, and how/when to follow up for additional help and questions

- Behavioral interventions including sitting on the toilet after the same meal each day and trying 5 to 10 minutes to have a bowel movement (for toilet-trained children)

- Scheduled follow-up appointments, generally every 3 to 4 weeks until bowel movements normalized, then every 3 to 6 months and as needed

Nursing staff should be familiar with constipation plans and be able to access individual plans in patient charts and be able to answer questions related to these plans over the phone when families call.
