To evaluate adequately individuals suspected to have upper airway resistance syndrome, a full PSG is recommended. Home sleep apnea testing may underestimate the severity of SDB

Additionally, patients with UARS present with apneas or hypopneas and have fewer episodes of desaturation, but they have episodes of inspiratory flow limitation associated with arousals on PSG. UARS has often been overlooked because RERAs are underestimated and scored during PSG studies. Therefore, the PSG study for these patients may be interpreted as a normal or mild OSA. UARS can also be easily identified by measuring esophageal pressure (Pes) or supraglottic catheter, which is not commonly used in clinical laboratory settings.

Untreated UARS individuals can present a low quality of life and, over time, can develop cardiovascular consequences. Over time, these symptoms usually increase in untreated individuals with UARS. UARS could cause hypertension, cardiovascular, and metabolic consequences if left untreated. Prompt diagnosis and proper treatment should be offered to UARS patients as early as possible to avoid the consequences previously mentioned.
