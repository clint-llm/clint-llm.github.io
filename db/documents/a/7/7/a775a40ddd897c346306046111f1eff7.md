Orchitis alone is very uncommon and is usually accompanied by epididymitis, hence the true incidence is unclear. Current literature also does not suggest any predilection for any race or religion.

Orchitis develops in 14% to 35% of postpubertal patients with mumps. Symptoms develop 4 to 8 days after parotitis but can also occur in the absence of parotitis. Mumps virus is responsible for most of the cases of isolated orchitis.
