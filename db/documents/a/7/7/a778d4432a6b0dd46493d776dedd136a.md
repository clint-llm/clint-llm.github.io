The prognosis of reentrant arrhythmias depends on the origin of the arrhythmia. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are associated with a long-term risk of thromboembolism (stroke), even in the absence of other structural heart defects. Low-risk patients have less than one percent annual risk of stroke, while the high-risk group of patients has as high as 7Â to 10% annual risk of stroke if not anticoagulated properly.

Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia has an excellent prognosis, and 9=more than 95% of people remain free of arrhythmias after successful ablation and modification of the slow atrioventricular nodal pathway.

Reentrant ventricular arrhythmias are usually found in patients with cardiomyopathy and do not have a good prognosis. Ventricular arrhythmias in patients with cardiomyopathy lead to decompensated heart failure, recurrent hospitalization, impairs quality of life due to hospitalization and repeat implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock and even result in sudden cardiac death,
