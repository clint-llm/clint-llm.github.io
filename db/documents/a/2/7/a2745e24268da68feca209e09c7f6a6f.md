There are some identifiable and modifiable patient factors (BMI, diabetic control) that can help prevent postoperative wound infections. When surgery is offered and time allows, it is essential to optimize patients for surgery. This optimization is done to reduce the overall complication rate rather than to just focus on wound infections.

Most surgeries are a risk-benefit discussion between the healthcare team and the patient, especially when it comes to elective surgery. It is possible that due to patient risk factors, the risk to surgery is higher than the benefit of performing it, and the patient may be asked to lose weight, adhere to, or modify antidiabetic medications alongside a healthy diet and regular exercise. Smoking cessation is another essential step for optimization. A detailed look into immunosuppressive medications, including steroids, can help.

Measures taken by different healthcare providers vary largely both geographically and between specialties. A study on spinal surgery recommends HBA1C levels <8%, males over 60 to take alpha-blockers, serum albumin level over 3.5 g/dL, cardiac stress tests, and smoking cessation.
