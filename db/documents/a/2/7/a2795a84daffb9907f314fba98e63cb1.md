**Biopsy**

The gold standard of diagnosis for carcinoma in situ is a skin biopsy; a shave or punch biopsy can be used. Biopsy samples should be taken from the suspected carcinoma in situ and its surrounding tissues and then sent to a dermatopathologist for adequate pathologic analysis.

**Skin Examination**

A complete skin examination is mandatory for patients with suspected squamous cell carcinoma in situ. The examination should be on both sun-exposed and non-exposed areas.
