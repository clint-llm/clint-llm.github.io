For a patient with warfarin toxicity, treatment depends on the INR and the presence of bleeding.

If a more rapid reversal is necessary, the clinician can order fresh frozen plasma (FFP), though administration often takes several hours. If the clinician desires emergent reversal, four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (4F-PCCs) can be rapidly administeredÂ with a full reversal of coagulopathy within 15 to 30 minutes with less volume compared to plasma.
