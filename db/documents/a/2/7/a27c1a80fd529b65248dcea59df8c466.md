The HMP shunt is parallel to the glycolysis pathway and takes place in the cytoplasm. A 6-carbon sugar, glucose, may enter the glycolytic pathway or enter the alternative HMP shunt depending on the cellâ€™s individual needs at the time. Once the glucose enters the HMP shunt, it undergoes a series of reactions, broken down into the oxidative(irreversible) and non-oxidative phases (reversible). The oxidative phase is responsible for converting the intermediate glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconate, using the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme. The by-product of this reaction is the important molecule NADPH. 6-phosphogluconate then converts into ribulose-5-phosphate, and NADPH gets produced again as a by-product.

The non-oxidative phase of the HMP shunt involves the conversion of ribulose-5-phosphate to ribose-5-phosphate (R-5-P) through a series of independent reactions. It is important to note that no NADPH molecules get created in this part of the HMP shunt. R-5-P in this reaction can be returned to the glycolytic pathway as fructose-6-phosphate. This step requires the transketolase enzyme with the presence of the thiamine co-factor. Thiamine also participates in a plethora of other metabolic reactions throughout the body. It is used by enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate in the Krebs cycle, for the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase as well as branch-chained ketoacid dehydrogenase.

The HMP shunt pathway is under the regulation of the demands of NADPH in the respective tissue. The rate-limiting enzyme is G6PD and has allosteric inhibition directed by the presence of NADPH and allosteric activation via the presence of NADP+. Consequently, the activity of G6PD activity also increases in a fed state with a high carbohydrate diet, and conversely, decreases in a starving or a diabetic state.
