Cardiac echocardiography is a safe and non-invasive test that provides the clinical team with important cardiac function data. This functional data is needed to care for patients with many pathologies and used to diagnose a number of diseases. This activity discusses echocardiography procedure details including relevant anatomy, clinical indications, and potential limitations and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in caring for patients requiring this valuable diagnostic test.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of echocardiography.
- Describe the equipment/personnel needed in performing echocardiography.
- Review the clinical significance of various echocardiographic modalities.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance echocardiography and improve outcomes.
