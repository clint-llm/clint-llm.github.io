While phocomelia is the most notable side effect of thalidomide, there have been several cases in the last 30 years of phocomelia associated with thalidomide use. However, today the cause of most cases is undetermined. Despite strict regulation worldwide, there have been several cases in the last 30 years of thalidomide attributed phocomelia. Underdeveloped countries and those endemic with leprosy where thalidomide occasionally remains in use, still report cases of defects caused by thalidomide exposures in pregnancy. Strict regulations in more developed countries have resulted in a dramatically decreased incidence of phocomelia within the general population.

Aside from the teratogenicity of thalidomide, researchers have hypothesized that phocomelia is associated with anomalous origins of the subclavian artery, resulting in a disrupted vascular supply to intermediate limb segments.
