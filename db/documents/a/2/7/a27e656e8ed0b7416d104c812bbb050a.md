The corrugator supercilii muscles have a dual nerve supply from branches of the temporal, zygomatic, and buccal branches of the facial nerve. The motor nerve supply of the corrugator supercilii muscles originates from the frontal branch of the temporal division of the facial nerve while the zygomatic branch appears to innervate the oblique head. After receivingÂ innervation from the zygomatic branch, the buccal branch forms the angular nerve to supply the corrugator supercilii muscles and procerus.

The supratrochlear nerve (STN) and supraorbital nerve (SON), which are some terminal branches of the frontal nerve, are also closely associated with the corrugator supercilii muscles. After traveling over the orbit anteromedially, the supratrochlear nerve and supraorbital nerve pass through the corrugator supercilii muscles and enter the occipitofrontalis muscle to receive sensation from the mucosa of the glabella, skin of the lower forehead, and upper portion of the eyelid. The supratrochlear nerve also exits lateral to the origin of the corrugator supercilii muscles, enters the corrugator supercilii muscles where it splits into three or four small branches, and then penetrates the frontalis muscle.
