Conditions causing secondary osteoporosis include:

**Endocrine Problems**

a. Primary Hyperparathyroidism (PHPT): Generally presents in individuals over 50 years of age. It has a high prevalence of 233 cases per 100,000 women and 85 cases per 100,000 men. PHPT can result from a single gland adenoma, parathyroid gland hyperplasia, double adenoma, or rarely parathyroid carcinoma. There is also familial PHPT condition in the setting of MEN 1, MEN 4, MEN 2A and hereditary hyperparathyroidism like in jaw tumor syndrome or nonsyndromic familial isolated primary hyperparathyroidism.

b. Cushing's Syndrome: Patients with Cushing syndrome have a higher risk for osteoporosis-related fractures. Bone resorption is increased, and there is decreased bone synthesis.

c. Hyperthyroidism: Von Recklinghausen, in 1891, described the appearance of long bones from a young woman who died of hyperthyroidism as "worm-eaten." Thyroid hormones act through the thyroid nuclear receptor.

d. Hypogonadism and Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI), also referred to as primary ovarian insufficiency or premature menopause: It describes the loss of ovarian function younger than 40 years of age. POI has a prevalence of almost 3 to 4%. Osteoporosis is a major health concern in this population. Other risk factors for bone loss also play an important role in determining the final bone quality in this population. Turner syndrome is the most common genetic cause of POI, which affects 1 in 2,000 female births. Male hypogonadism can affect men of all ages and can be of primary or secondary etiology in males younger than age 50. Z-scores instead of T-scores should be used in bone density evaluation for this age bracket. The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) recommends using a T-score of less than -2.5 for the diagnosis of osteoporosis in both men and women and a Z-score of -2.0 or lower for a younger age.

e. Diabetes Mellitus: Patients with type 1 diabetes have increased fracture risk. The review of the literature suggests that there is a 3-fold increased risk for any fracture and a 7-fold increased risk for hip fracture in patients with type 1 diabetes as compared to the general population. Patients with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk than the general population, with a relative risk of 1.17-2.03 in anterior sites. Although this risk is less than in patients with type 1 diabetes, the higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes makes it an important secondary cause of osteoporosis. Certain medications for diabetes, including thiazolidinediones and SGLT-2 inhibitors, have shown an increased risk in studies for osteoporosis.

**Chronic Inflammatory Conditions**

a. Rheumatoid arthritis: Almost one-third of patients with rheumatoid arthritis have osteoporosis. The presence of fragility fractures in this population is close to double that of the age-matched general population.

b. Cystic fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis-related bone disease involves osteomalacia as well as osteoporosis. Patients with cystic fibrosis have a high prevalence of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. Thoracic vertebral and rib fractures are more common in this population. HRpQCT in cystic fibrosis-affected young adults shows compromised trabecular and cortical microarchitecture.

c. Chronic Obstructive pulmonary disease: Osteoporosis affects about one-third of the patients with COPD worldwide. The most common fragility fractures in this population are vertebral, femoral, and rib fractures.

**Chronic Kidney Disease**

Chronic kidney bone disease prevalence has increased lately and is described as chronic kidney disease–mineral bone disorders (CKD-MB). The spectrum involves osteomalacia, adynamic bone disease, osteitis fibrosis cystic, and mixed bone disease.

**Idiopathic Hypercalciuria**

Idiopathic hypercalciuria is a prevalent cause of calcium-containing renal stones and involves almost 1/5 of a healthy population and up to 40% of postmenopausal women with fractures. Urinary calcium of more than 200 mg/day is associated with an increased risk for calcium stone formation. These patients have lower BMD than the general population and increased fracture risk.

**Neuromuscular Diseases**

a. Cerebral palsy: Cerebral palsy involves defects in the motor component of the central nervous system. Patients with cerebral palsy have improved survival resulting in a higher population with increased risk for skeletal conditions, including contractures, spasticity, and osteoporosis.

b. Spina Bifida: In multiple studies, patients with spina bifida have been found to have a higher risk for osteoporosis and fractures than the general population, with a prevalence of almost 30% in this population.

c. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD): DMD is an X-linked recessive progressive muscular disease resulting from mutations in the dystrophin gene. Boys with DMD have a significantly higher risk for osteoporosis, with a prevalence of almost 20 to 60% in this population.

d. Multiple Sclerosis: Studies have suggested that patients with multiple sclerosis have a twofold increased risk for osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures compared to the general population.

e. Parkinson disease: Patients with Parkinson disease have higher fracture-related mortality than the general population.

**Gastrointestinal Diseases**

a. Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease with either Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis have a significantly higher risk for osteoporosis and fractures than the general population.

**Nutritional Conditions**

a. Anorexia nervosa: Patients with anorexia nervosa have decreased peak bone mass, impaired bone microarchitecture, and a high risk for osteoporosis.

**Glucocorticoid Induced Osteoporosis**

Glucocorticoids, even at low doses of 2.5 mg of prednisone per day or inhaled corticosteroids for bronchial asthma, can lead to increased bone loss. The bone loss with glucocorticoids is maximum during the first 2 to 3 months of therapy. Glucocorticoids are not only involved with excessive bone resorption but also cause decreased bone formation. Guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology suggest treating patients with a higher risk for osteoporosis fractures when they are on a glucocorticoid dose of around 2.5 mg of prednisone, or more, per day for over three months.

**Post-transplant Osteoporosis**

With the advancement of medical therapy and an increasing number of patients who are benefiting from transplants, there is a need to evaluate bone health in these patients as well. All patients awaiting transplants should have a baseline DXA scan.a. Stem cell transplant: Almost half of the patients with stem cell transplants have osteopenia and osteoporosis, which are more prominent at the proximal femur.b. Heart/lung transplants: Higher bone loss has been observed in these patients.c. Liver transplant: Bone loss and fractures are highest in patients with liver transplants in the first 6 to 12 months.d. Kidney transplant: In this patient population, bone loss is reported that is more significant in the first 6 to 8 months.

**HIV Infection**

HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy increase the risk of bone loss and osteoporosis. Patients should have a baseline DXA for evaluation of bone health.

**Medications/Adverse Lifestyle Factors**

Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, antiepileptic drugs (like phenobarbitone, phenytoin, topiramate), SSRIs, PPIs, alcohol, PPAR gamma, glucocorticoids, smoking are all accused of causing bone loss in various degrees, so patients receiving those medications on a chronic basis should be evaluated with a bone density measurement.

**Cancer and Bone**

Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance MGUS: These patients have a high risk for pathological fractures and osteoporosis. Multiple myeloma patients can present with lytic bone lesions as a result of plasma cell infiltration. Adjuvant endocrine therapies: Therapies for prostate cancer and breast cancer involving androgen deprivation therapy, tamoxifen, and aromatase inhibitors have all been associated with increased bone loss.

**Genetic Diseases**

Thalassemia: This is an autosomal recessive disorder of red cells due to mutations in either alpha or beta globin chain of the hemoglobin molecule. Patients with thalassemia have reduced BMD and increased fracture risk and bone pain.Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS): Osteoporosis has been recognized as a complication of EDS.
