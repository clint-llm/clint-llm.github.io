When preparing for arterial cannulation, it is important to have at least 1 other member of the healthcare team that is familiar with the process available to assist in the procedure. Appropriate personnel readily available to assist in the procedure will decrease the margin of error related to placement of supplies, securing the arterial catheter post cannulation, and connection of the pressure tubing to the catheter hub.
