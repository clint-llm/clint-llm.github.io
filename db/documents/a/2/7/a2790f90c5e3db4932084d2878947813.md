Traditionally, the nasoseptal flap was used to reconstruct large bony and dural defects of the anterior and ventral skull base following skull base surgery.Â In the last two decades, the indications for nasoseptal flap have broadened somewhat, and the efficacy of these strategies is under investigation.

In the span of the skull base defects, the nasoseptal flap can extend to cover surgical approaches from the cribriform to the clivus.
