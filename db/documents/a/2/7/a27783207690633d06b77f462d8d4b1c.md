Its current administration is typically via the oral route through commercially available pills or as a tea.Panax notoginseng are used as a medicine and have been shown to have higher levels of saponins than the root.

The metabolism of oral ginseng occurs via gut microbes, which convert the hydrophilic components into hydrophobic ones that are absorbable. The level of absorption that occurs is dependent on the number of gut microbes present that can convert ginseng into an absorbable state, adding an individualized response component to this drug.
