Normal hearing involves the complex, coordinated interplay of many closely associated anatomical structures within the ear and beyond. On the other hand, hearing loss occurs when pathology results in audiometric hearing thresholds falling below 25 decibels hearing level (dB HL) - a scale based on normative hearing thresholds as opposed to decibels of sound pressure level, which reflect the actual amount of sound energy produced. Damage or pathology of any of the multiple components of the auditory system, i.e., tympanic membrane, middle ear ossicles, cochlea, nerves, neural pathways, nuclei, and central processing centers, can contribute to hearing loss. Amongst the myriad causes of hearing loss, a distinct yet often unrecognized entity is nonorganic functional hearing loss.

Nonorganic functional hearing loss is that hearing loss evident on audiological testing, which has no corresponding organic impairment in the auditory system or a hearing loss that seems to be more severe than can be explained by the pathology identified in the auditory system.

Other terms for this condition include “non-organic hearing loss (NOHL),” “functional hearing loss,” “pseudohypacusis,” “hysterical hearing loss,” “conversion hearing loss,” "malingering,” “feigning,” “psychogenic deafness,” “simulated hearing loss,” and “dissociative deafness.” Many nonorganic functional hearing loss cases go undetected, so that sufferers can be prescribed unnecessary, sometimes harmful, treatments. Nonorganic functional hearing loss is a condition encountered by otolaryngologists, audiologists, general practitioners, and psychiatrists.
