Even though scalp lacerations are for the most part uncomplicated and can be managed by the emergency team with little to no issues, thoroughly evaluating for injuries that may be associated with facial trauma is essential as many require prompt management that requires the involvement of other healthcare specialties such as plastic surgery and neurosurgery. Being vigilant and not hesitating to ask for help when appropriate is essential in these cases as head injuries can cause significant harm to the patients if not dealt with in a timely and professional manner. The ED nurse or the emergency department physician should inquire about tetanus status. In most cases, antibiotics are not necessary if the wound is clean. However, the patient should be seen in the clinic to ensure that healing is going as planned.

Scalp lacerations are best addressed through an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists when necessary, nursing staff (including dermatology specialty-trained nurses), and in the event of infection, pharmacists. Communication among the various disciplines of the health care team will bring about optimal patient care and outcomes. [Level 5]
