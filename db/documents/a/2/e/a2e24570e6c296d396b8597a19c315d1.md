**Effect of Gut Microbiota on Intestinal Permeability**

Increased intestinal permeability and inflammation via lipopolysaccharides (LPS) appear to influence the pathogenesis of obesity.

Short-chain fatty acids are monocarboxylic acids that are byproducts of carbohydrate metabolism in microbes and are associated with lower body weight and adiposity.

When a loss of gut microbiota diversity occurs in the patient with obesity, there is a concomitant loss in SCFAs. This loss is especially notable concerning Bifidobacterium.

Decreased gut barrier integrity that results from "obese microbiota" has been found to cause systemic inflammation. The signaling of peritoneal macrophages induces this by upregulating the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta).

Gut microbiota can also influence intestinal permeability by modifying alkaline phosphatase activity, interfering with tight junctions, and changing gene expression of cannabinoid receptor 1 in the colon, which has downstream effects on permeability.
