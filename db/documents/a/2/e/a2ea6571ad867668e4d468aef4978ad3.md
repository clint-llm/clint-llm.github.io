Patients with erosive lichen planus are at significant risk of developing secondary infections. This risk is especially high for the development of candidiasis, staphylococcus aureus cellulitis, and herpes simplex.

A similar risk of development of squamous cell carcinoma has also been found in penile and vulvar lichen planus, although the rates of transformation have been less clearly identified.
