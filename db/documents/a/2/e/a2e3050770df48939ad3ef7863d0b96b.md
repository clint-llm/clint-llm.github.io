Influenza infection is self-limited and mild in most healthy individuals who do not have other comorbidities. No antiviral treatment is needed during mild infections in healthy individuals. Antiviral medications can be used to treat or prevent influenza infection, especially during outbreaks in healthcare settings such as hospitals and residential institutions. Oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir belong to the neuraminidase inhibitors family and can be used for the treatment of influenza A and B. The adamantanes antiviral family has two medications, amantadine, and rimantadine. Amantadine and rimantadine are effective against influenza A, but not influenza B. During recent influenza seasons, high rates of resistance have been identified in influenza A for the adamantanes antivirals, and they are not recommended for treatment or prophylaxis against influenza A. Resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors has been low in recent influenza seasons, but the virus may mutate and develop resistance at any time. Resistance can develop in some patients following treatment, especially in immunocompromised patients. Oseltamivir can be used for chemoprophylaxis for individuals one year and older in cases of outbreaks and exposure in high-risk groups. The side effects of oseltamivir include skin reactions that might be severe and sporadic transient neuropsychiatric events; these side effects form a barrier to the use of oseltamivir in the elderly and individuals that are at higher risk of developing these side effects. The only contraindication to zanamivir is an allergy to eggs.

Vaccination is highly recommended at the start of the winter season. The flu vaccine recommendations include:

- All individuals aged six months and older

- Individuals with egg allergy who only develop hives should receive the vaccine

- In all settings, resuscitation equipment must be in the room and patient observed for 10-15 minutes

- The nasal flu vaccine has not been very effective in previous years. The injection is preferred.

- The flu vaccine can be administered to pregnant women

- Vaccination often is not effective in individuals over 65, so high dose formulations should be used.
