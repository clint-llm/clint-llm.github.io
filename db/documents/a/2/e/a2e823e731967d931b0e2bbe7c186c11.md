Schistosomiasis is a disease that disproportionally affects those with poor hygiene, lack of healthcare resources, and poor living and working conditions overall. Lack of proper education regarding its prevalence and symptoms also impedes recognition and treatment. Population education regarding limiting urination into fresh-water lakes would also be beneficial as there is a short window for miracidia to infect snails.

Overall, elimination efforts would likely need to be multifactorial involving education and mass treatment programs. Unfortunately, it would also require significant cost and time investments by endemic countries, many of which are poverty-stricken.
