Lifestyle changes are recommended for all patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) even without NASH as these patients have metabolic derangements and are at risk for the development of cardiovascular diseases. A weight loss of 3 to 5% in simple steatosis and a weight loss of 7% to 10% in NASH is the recommendation. Adequate control of risk factors like hyperlipidemia with statins (it also protects from cardiovascular risks), hypertension, adequate glycemic control is required. Please refer to the chapters on hepatitis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis under the transplant hepatology section for a detailed discussion of this topic.

Patients with NASH are to followed by hepatologists or gastroenterologists. NASH with cirrhosis requires hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance with an ultrasound every six months. Several clinical trials are being conducted using anti-fibrotic, anti-apoptotic, and immune therapies for the treatment of NAFLD.
