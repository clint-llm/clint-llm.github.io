All vascular beds, small and large vessels contain EDRF; this is true for many species. EDRF acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to invoke endogenous vasodilation and inhibiting sympathetic vasoconstriction.

EDRF serves as nitric oxide that functions through activating soluble guanylyl cyclase. Endothelial cell membranes contain an enzyme called endothelial nitric oxide synthase which produces nitric oxide, which then binds to soluble guanylyl cyclase in smooth muscle cells. This binding triggers a cell signaling cascade, ultimately leading to arteriole vasodilation. This process of endogenous nitric oxide production physiologically modulates blood flow and vasomotion.

It also has antiplatelet properties by inhibiting platelet adhesion and platelet aggregation. The decrease in platelet activation directly leads to an anti-thrombotic effect.
