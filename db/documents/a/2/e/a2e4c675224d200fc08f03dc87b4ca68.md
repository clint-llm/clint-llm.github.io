Once the aspirated peritoneal fluid is obtained, it can be analyzed microscopically and cultured.

False-negative culdocentesis can occur in non-ruptured ectopic pregnancies or if the Pouch of Douglas is destroyed from endometriosis or scarring due to pelvic inflammatory disease.

In a comparative study performed in 1998, researchers set out to identify if culdocentesis was comparable to sonography in the diagnosis of hemoperitoneum in 46 patients, 40 of which had an ectopic pregnancy. The results of the study found that ultrasound showed 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity in identifying hemoperitoneum. Culdocentesis had 80% specificity and 66% sensitivity. The negative predictive value of a non-diagnostic culdocentesis was 25%. The negative predictive value of sonography was 100% when there was no fluid found on ultrasound.
