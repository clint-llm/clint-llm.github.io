Before any intervention, a consultation with an anesthesiologist is necessary in order to identify the factors of co-morbidity and to assess the feasibility of the operation. Establishing a general anesthesia program is necessary since you must keep an average blood pressure higher than 70 mmHg without having to resort to vasoactive agents such as catecholamines. For monitoring the flap vessels intraoperatively, the Doppler probe is mandatory.

Tissue oximetry using near-infrared spectrophotometry technology has been reported as a useful tool because it is non-invasive and objective and provides continuous monitoring with high sensitivity and specificity.

Other techniques like fluorescent indocyanine green angiography (FA ICG) are used and are reliable adjuncts to assessing flow in the flap.
