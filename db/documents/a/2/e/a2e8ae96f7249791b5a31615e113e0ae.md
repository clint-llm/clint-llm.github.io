- Coral snake venom acts by inhibiting acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction to cause neurotoxic motor weakness.

- Life-threatening complications of coral snake bites are related to respiratory muscle weakness and the need for ventilatory support.

- Although significant envenomation is uncommon due to the coral snakeâ€™s less-aggressive behavior and difficult mechanism of delivery, the potential of life-threatening respiratory insufficiency delay of up to 13 hours warrants very close observation after a reported exposure.

- While limited in supply and difficult to obtain and transport, coral snake antivenom should be given to all patients bitten by coral snakes regardless of symptoms.

- Hypersensitivity reactions to equine-based coral snake antivenom are common, and infusion should be stopped immediately if patients develop adverse reactions.
