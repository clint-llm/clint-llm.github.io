A reduction in subchondral blood supply induces a state of hypoxia, leading to loss of integrity of cell membranes and necrosis of cells. The pathological appearances of necrosis marked by the appearance of neutrophils and macrophages will predominate. Macroscopically this induces subchondral collapse and subsequent joint degeneration.

MRI will demonstrate osteosclerotic changes secondary to decreased bone resorption as a result of disrupted osteoclast function. Specifically, the T2 signal will be increased, and the T1 signal will be decreased due to fat cell edema/ischemia of bone marrow.
