Acetazolamide is not frequently used in clinical medicine, but clinicians need to know the drug's adverse effects and contraindications. Patients require education from the team, including the clinician, nurse, and pharmacist, on the dose and indications of the drug and to report any side effects. Because there is no antidote to acetazolamide, it is essential to emphasize to the patient to seek immediate care if there is an overdose. The prescriber should work with the pharmacist on medication reconciliation to ensure no drug-drug interactions. The prescriber should also use Tall Man (mixed case) lettering for the prescription of acetazolamide which is included in look-alike-sound-alike drugs.

Pharmacists should also verify that the prescription as acetazolamide is included in the ISMP (Institute for Safe Medication Practices) medication list to avoid confusion.
