Although it is a rare disease, Felty syndrome should be on the differential diagnosis of any patients who present with RA and neutropenia, because the consequence of any treatment delay is potentially fatal. The clinician should be mindful that neutropenia may become masked in patients with acute infection. No specific treatment exists for patients with Felty syndrome. Although many options are available for treatment, randomized trials are lacking because of the rarity of the disease. The basis for treatment recommendations is only a few observational studies. This diagnosis, therefore, poses a therapeutic challenge in an acute setting, especially in resource-limited situations and refractory neutropenia. In the non-acute settings, all patients with asymptomatic neutropenia should be advised about good oral and dental hygiene and should be closely monitored with adjustment in their anti-rheumatic medications to improve the neutrophil count, which can help prevent infections.
