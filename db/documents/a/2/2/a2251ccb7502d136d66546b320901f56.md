Due to their anatomic location near the entrances of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, the palatine tonsils get exposed to a myriad of exogenous foreign materials.  The function of this tissue as a secondary lymphoid organ seems to inherently provide a method of prolonged exposure to infectious material or other antigens.  These two properties may have a role in the infection risk which the palatine tonsils seem predisposed.  At this time, it is still unclear if tonsillar hypertrophy results from persistent infection.

Peritonsillar abscesses have been shown to be the leading cause of deep neck infections in the adult population.
