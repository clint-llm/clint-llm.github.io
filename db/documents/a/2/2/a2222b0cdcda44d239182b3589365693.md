Management of pseudohyponatremia focuses on the treatment of the underlying cause:

- Hypercholesterolemia: appropriate management involves lowering of the causative lipoprotein with lifestyle modification and/or medication. In most cases, this can take place in the ambulatory setting over an extended period.

- Hyperproteinemias and hypergammaglobulinemias: the causative protein or antibody determines appropriate management. Consultation with the appropriate subspecialty may be necessary for further recommendations.

- Lipoprotein X: pseudohyponatremia due to the accumulation of lipoprotein X is an exceedingly rare disorder; nearly all cases have involved some degree of cholestasis.

- Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): clinicians direct the management of suspected pseudohyponatremia related to cholestasis and subsequent dyslipidemia related to gastrointestinal manifestations of GVHD by controlling the immune response.
