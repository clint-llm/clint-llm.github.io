Risk management requires the efforts of a complete, top-down interprofessional team, both in terms of implementing policies and practices, executing them in day to day patient care, and even when addressing medical errors that have occurred. A coordinated team approach where everyone is on the same team and empowered to express their concerns irrespective of "rank," and members are knowledgable about their duties, offers the best chance for successful risk mitigation. This interprofessional approach leads to enhanced patient care and a reduction in potentially catastrophic events.
