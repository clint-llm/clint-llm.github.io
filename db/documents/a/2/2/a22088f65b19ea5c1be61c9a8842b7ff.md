Many muscles act on or affect the movement of the ribs. These muscles are:

- Pectoralis major: its clavicular head originates on the anterior surface of the medial half of the clavicle, but its sternocostal head originates on the anterior surface of the sternum, the proximal six costal cartilages, and the external abdominal oblique aponeurosis. It inserts on the bicipital groove's lateral lip of the humerus. Its sternal head is innervated by the medial pectoral nerve, and its clavicular head is innervated by the lateral pectoral nerve. It is considered to be an auxiliary inspiratory muscle.

- Pectoralis minor: originates on the third, fourth, and fifth ribs, and inserts on the coracoid process of the scapula. It lies posteriorly to the pectoralis major and is innervated by the medial pectoral nerve. It lifts the ribs when the scapula is in a fixed position. It is considered to be an auxiliary inspiration muscle and is one of the rotator cuff muscles.

- External abdominal oblique: it originates on the fifth to twelfth ribs, and inserts on the xiphoid process, pubic crest, outer lip of the iliac crest, linea alba, pubic tubercle, anterior superior iliac spine, and inguinal ligament. It pulls the ribs inferiorly and compresses the abdominal cavity to increase the intraabdominal pressure. It is innervated by the anterior lower six thoracoabdominal branches and the subcostal nerve on each side.

- Rectus abdominis: originates on the pubic crest and inserts on the fifth, sixth, and seventh costal cartilages and the xiphoid process. It is innervated by the thoracoabdominal and subcostal nerves. It acts on the ribs by tilting the rib cage and pelvis inward towards the abdomen helping in active expiration.

- Subclavius: originates on the first rib and cartilage and inserts on the clavicle's subclavian groove. It is innervated by the subclavian nerve. It elevates the first rib.

- Serratus anterior: originates on the upper eight or nine ribs and inserts along the medial border, superior angle, and inferior angle of the scapula.

- External intercostal: originates on the lower borders of the ribs and inserts on the upper border of the rib below. It is innervated by intercostal nerves. It assists in inspiration by driving the ribs in the cranial direction.

- Internal intercostal: its origin, insertion, and innervation are similar to the external intercostal muscle. It assists in forced expiration by depressing the ribs and bending them inward.

- Innermost intercostal: its origin, insertion, and innervation are similar to the external intercostal muscle. It assists in forced expiration in the same manner as internal intercostal.

- Diaphragm: The sternal part originates on the inner surface of the xiphoid process. The costal part originates on the inner surfaces of the cartilages of the distal six ribs. The medial crus originates on the lumbar vertebrae. The lateral crus originates on the ligaments that jump over the quadratus and psoas muscles. All the portions of the diaphragm insert on the central tendon. It is innervated by the phrenic and lower intercostal nerves. It expands the lower rib cage and is considered to be the main inspiratory muscle.

- Quadratus lumborum: arises from the posterior border of the iliac crest and inserts on the first to fourth lumbar vertebrae plus the twelfth rib. It is innervated by the first four lumbar nerves, plus the twelfth thoracic nerve. It depresses the lower rib cage.

- Transversus thoracis: originates from the posterior aspects of the xiphoid process, the body of the sternum, and the lower three or four true rib's costal cartilages. It inserts on the lower surfaces of the second through sixth ribs with their costal cartilages. It is innervated by the intercostal nerves; and assists in forced expiration by depressing the ribs.

- Latissimus dorsi: originates on the inferior three or four ribs, thoracolumbar fascia, inferior angle of the scapula, iliac crest, and the spinous processes of the seventh thoracic to the fifth lumbar vertebrae. It inserts on the floor of the intertubercular sulcus of the humerus. It is innervated by the thoracodorsal nerve. Its role in the ribcage's movement is not yet clear but is considered to be a respiratory accessory muscle.

- Serratus posterior superior: originates on the nuchal ligament and the seventh cervical to the third thoracic vertebrae. It inserts on the upper borders of the second to fifth ribs. It is innervated by the second to fifth intercostal nerves; its function is to elevate the second to fifth ribs. Note that there is no evidence supporting its role in respiration.

- Serratus posterior inferior: originates on the spinous process of the eleventh thoracic to the second lumbar vertebrae and inserts on the inferior borders of the ninth to twelfth ribs. It is innervated by the distal four intercostal nerves; it depresses the distal four ribs. Note that there is no evidence supporting its role in respiration.
