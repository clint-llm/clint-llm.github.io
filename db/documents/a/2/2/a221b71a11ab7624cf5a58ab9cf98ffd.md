The differential diagnosis for tinea cruris includes several other dermatologic conditions affecting the groin with similar presentations. Candidiasis, erythrasma, psoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis exhibit comparable signs and symptoms and are most commonly confused with the fungal groin infection. Unlike tinea cruris, candidal intertrigo frequently affects women, and the rash may involve the scrotum and penis in males.
