The key factor in deciding the treatment plan is whether the UCL injury is displaced or non-displaced. A displaced UCL complete tear cannot heal by itself and requires a surgical intervention to prevent permanent instability and degenerative changes of the MCP joint.

The repair should ideally be done within the first 21 days of the injury. Late repairs have been known to have marked pain and weakness on pinchÂ grip. In addition, there is a risk for arthritis of the MCP joint. Surgery requires reducing the joint and using K-wire to maintain the joint in position. The UCL is repaired. The avulsed bone may be removed if small but if the fragment is large, it should be reduced and reattached with wire. Patients who have timely surgical repair have favorable outcomes. Patients with a delayed diagnosis have less favorable outcomes.

If the complete tear is treated conservatively, there is a 50% failure risk. Braces may be an option for patients who refuse surgery. A thumb spica splint can be used but obtaining complete stability is rare.

A non-displaced tear is immobilized with a protective splint for 4 to 6 weeks. The MCP joint is fixed, and the interphalangeal joint is free to move to prevent stiffness. Associated fractures, if not displaced, are also managed conservatively. Physical therapy can be applied to facilitate recovery.
