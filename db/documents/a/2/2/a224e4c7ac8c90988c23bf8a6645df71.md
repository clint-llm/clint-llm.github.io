Treatment options are focused on the pathology of the peroneus longus tendon, which is typically managed conservatively via immobilization, oral anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), and/or steroid injections and may be followed with a course of physical therapy.

The type of surgical intervention will depend on the location and extent of the tendon injury.
