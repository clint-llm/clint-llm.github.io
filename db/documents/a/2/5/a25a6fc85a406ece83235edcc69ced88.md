Studies are limited on CoQ10 use in patients with kidney and liver disease, and therefore, coadministration of CoQ10 supplements should be avoided in these patients. Patients using chemotherapeutic drugs should also avoid using CoQ10 since there is little data on the interaction of CoQ10 with these drugs. Since CoQ10 has been shown to lower fasting blood glucose in some patients, it should be used with caution in those with diabetes and/or patients who are prone to hypoglycemic episodes. CoQ10 use should be avoided in nursing mothers, children, and infants as studies in these populations are lacking.

CoQ10 is chemically similar to Vitamin-K, and there are some reports available for potential warfarin and CoQ10 interaction in the literature. There are chances of warfarin treatment failure when patients are taking CoQ10 supplements along with warfarin therapy. This interaction is believed to be reversible.
