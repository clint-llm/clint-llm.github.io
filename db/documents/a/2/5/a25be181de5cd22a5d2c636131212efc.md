Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a commonly encountered diagnosis and a common reason for inpatient admission. Timely identification of this condition, appropriate choice of treatment, and adequate administration of medication impacts morbidity and mortality tremendously. This activity will review the modalities used to treat patients with ACS, with particular focus on the appropriate selection of agents and interventions based on clinical characteristics of patients and the most current available evidence. The role of the interprofessional team in improving outcomes will be reviewed.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the general components of the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
- Summarize the findings from the most recent clinic trials regarding antiplatelet therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention.
- Identify patients at the highest risk of mortality from acute coronary syndrome.
- Describe the importance of interprofessional teamwork in the effective care of patients with acute coronary syndrome.
