Congenital dermal melanocytosis commonly appears as a single or multiple hyperpigmented macular lesion(s) on the lower lumbar, sacral, or gluteal surface. The pigmentation of the lesion ranges from dark grey, blue, to blue-green. The shape of the lesion can vary from round, oval, or irregular. These lesions can appear at birth or shortly after birth.

Congenital dermal melanocytosis lesions commonly fade by 1 year old, rarely persisting after 6 years old.

Asking parents or caretakers about the onset of lesions and the location of the affected site will aid the clinician toward the correct diagnosis. Clinicians should perform a detailed history and physical and use their clinical judgment to assure that congenital dermal melanocytosis is not confused for other possible diagnoses. Congenital dermal melanocytosis can resemble the bruises that occur in non-accidental trauma. Documentation of these lesions on initial evaluation is important to help delineate from suspected abuse in subsequent visits. Congenital dermal melanocytosis should also be differentiated from other dermal melanocytoses such as nevus of Ota (melanocytic pigment around the face and orbits, usually in a unilateral trigeminal nerve distribution) or nevus of Ito (melanocytic pigment involving the neck, supraclavicular and scapular regions).
