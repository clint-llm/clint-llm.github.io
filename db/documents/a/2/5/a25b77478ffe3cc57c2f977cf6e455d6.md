In patients who do not have diabetes, hypoglycemia is uncommon, but when it occurs, there are a few major causes of hypoglycemia: pharmacologic, alcohol, critical illness, counter-regulatory hormone deficiencies, and non-islet cell tumors.

Most cases of hypoglycemia occur in diabetic patients who are undergoing therapeutic intervention with meglitinides, sulfonylureas, or insulin. Drugs are the most common cause of hypoglycemia.

Alcohol inhibits gluconeogenesis in the body, but does not affect glycogenolysis. Thus, hypoglycemia occurs after several days of alcohol consumption and after glycogen stores are depleted.

In critical illness states, for example, end-stage liver disease, sepsis, starvation, or renal failure, glucose utilization exceeds glucose intake, glycogenolysis and/or gluconeogenesis. The result of this imbalance is hypoglycemia. Counter-regulatory hormone deficiencies can occur as in states of adrenal insufficiency. Hypoglycemia associated with such deficiencies are rare. Non-islet cell tumors may also be a cause of hypoglycemia through increased secretion of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2).

Insulinomas are hyperfunctioning islet cell tumors associated with increased insulin secretion. They can be life-threatening and primarily manifest with postprandial hypoglycemia. Although these tumors are rare, MEN1 should be a consideration in the workup of suspected cases.
