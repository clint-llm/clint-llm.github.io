‘Termination of life support’ is important clinically. It helps end-of-life patients who have expressed their wishes to avoid any aggressive interventions performed in case their clinical condition deteriorates. It prevents care that is futile and may involve invasive interventions with potential adverse impact on their quality of life, without adding a significant survival benefit. It also provides the grieving family comfort to witness a pain-free and peaceful death of their loved one.
