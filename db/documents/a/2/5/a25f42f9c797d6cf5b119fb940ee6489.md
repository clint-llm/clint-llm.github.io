In addition to the clinical exam, lab investigations are essential for diagnosis and management. Blood culture is the most crucial step towards diagnosis, in addition, to complete blood count, serum electrolytes, and renal and liver function tests, which are necessary to assess for severity and co-morbidities. In suspected cases, paired blood cultures (one from the central line and peripheral vein) must be drawn and labeled accordingly before being sent to the lab. In the case of poor peripheral access or when unable to obtain a peripheral sample, two or more samples must be drawn from different lumens of a multi-lumen central line. The following definitions help in arriving at a diagnosis:

**Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) - ****Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) definition:**Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is the preferred term used by IDSA. The definite diagnosis of CRBSI requires one of the following: Isolation of the same pathogen from a quantitative blood culture drawn through the central line and from a peripheral vein with the single bacterial colony count at least threefold higher in the sample from the central line as compared to that obtained from a peripheral vein (or) same organism recovered from percutaneous blood culture and from quantitative (>15 colony-forming units) culture of the catheter tip (or) a shorter time to positive culture (>2 hours earlier) in the central line sample than the peripheral sample (differential time to positivity [ DTP ])

**CLABSI - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition**: CLABSI is a surveillance definition used by the CDC and defined as the recovery of a pathogen from a blood culture (a single blood culture for an organism not commonly present on the skin and two or more blood cultures for organism commonly present on the skin) in a patient who had a central line at the time of infection or within 48 hours before the development of infection. The infection cannot be related to any other infection the patient might have and must not have been present or incubating when the patient was admitted to the facility.

In the case of tunneled catheters, the accepted definitions for exit site and tunnel infections are as follows:

**Exit site infection:**Signs of inflammation confined to an area (typically < 2 cm) surrounding the catheter exit site and the presence of exudate that proves to be culture positive.

**Tunnel infection:******Inflammation extending beyond 2 cm from the exit site (along with the track or cephalad towards the vein entry site or extending beyond the cuff), typically associated with pain and tenderness along the subcutaneous track and culture-positive exudate at the exit site that may not be seen unless expressed by palpation.
