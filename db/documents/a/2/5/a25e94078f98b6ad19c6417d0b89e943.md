Nearly half of infected individuals are asymptomatic. For those with symptoms, the onset is typically 1 to 2 weeks after infection. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, and large volume watery, foul-smelling, greasy stools. Children may present with abdominal pain with minimal diarrhea. Due to a large number of stools, infected individuals will often be dehydrated.

The CDC recommends that providers consider giardiasis in the differential diagnosis of all individuals with more than three days of diarrhea. Patients should be asked about risk factors such as recent international or wilderness travel, contact with unsanitary water, daycare work, and sexual practices.

Physical examination is most often benign and often only reveals mild dehydration. Fevers are not common but may occur. Mild but diffuse abdominal tenderness to palpation may be present, and borborygmi may be apparent on auscultation. Providers should assess for possible skin manifestations such as hives or granuloma annulare.
