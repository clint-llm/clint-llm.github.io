The ulnar nerve has several potential compression sites along its course. Although the elbow is the most common site of compression, the ulnar nerve is also susceptible to injury at the wrist, forearm, and upper arm. When the primary care provider and nurse practitioner come across patients with ulnar nerve dysfunction, it is important to refer these patients to the neurologist and hand surgeon to first confirm the diagnosis and treatment.  Prevention of compression and early diagnosis/treatment is important for its prognosis because the treatment outcome is usually disappointing once the nerve has axonal damage. There are 2 main conservative treatments:  reducing the frequency of external compression on the nerve and flexion of the elbow joint. This is expected to decrease the stress placed on the ulnar nerve. The use of elbow splints, elbow pads or sleeves, and physical therapy have been suggested. For patients with mild to moderate symptoms, conservative treatment can be administered. It was shown that in patients with mild symptoms, conservative treatments are proven to be beneficial in about 90% of the patients; however, only 38% of the patients with moderate symptoms respond well to a non-operative method.
