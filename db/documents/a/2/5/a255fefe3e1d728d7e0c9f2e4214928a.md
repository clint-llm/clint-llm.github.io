As body lice cannot jump or fly, they spread primarily by direct contact, though transmission can also occur through clothing, bed linens, and towels. Infestations are strongly correlated with poor body hygiene, lack of access to clean clothing, and crowded conditions, which facilitate the spread of lice through direct physical contact. Outbreaks most commonly occur in situations where large groups of people live in unsanitary conditions such as prisons or camps of large groups of refugees from war, famine, or natural disasters. In the United States and other developed countries, body lice infestations most commonly occur in homeless populations because of the lack of access to clean clothes or showers. Outbreaks of body lice infestations and louse-borne diseases continue to occur globally and have been documented in jails and refugee camps in central and eastern Africa, rural areas in the Peruvian Andes, and amongst rural populations in Russia.
