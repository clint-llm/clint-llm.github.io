Traditionally, cholangiocarcinoma was histologically classified as poorly differentiated or well-differentiated adenocarcinoma: gland forming or tubular, squamous, mucinous, signet cells, and some other rare variants of the tumor.

The American Joint Committee for Cancer (AJCC) modified this classification from simply well-differentiated to poorly differentiated carcinoma on the histological basis to:

- Adenocarcinoma

- Intraductal papillary neoplasm without any invasive characteristics

- Mucinous cystic neoplasm with an associated invasive carcinoma

- Adenosquamous carcinoma

- Squamous cell carcinoma

- Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma

- Mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma.
