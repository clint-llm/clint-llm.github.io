Thyroid cancer is a malignancy arising from the thyroid parenchymal cells. Its incidence is steadily increasing worldwide, while the mortality rate has remained stable over the past several years. The clinical behavior of thyroid cancer is highly variable, from indolent, slowly progressing tumors to highly aggressive tumors with high mortality rates. There are various new cutting-edge treatment options for advanced thyroid cancer, while there is also evidence against the overtreatment of low-risk thyroid cancers. Hence, a thorough understanding of the types of thyroid cancer and its management is of paramount importance in providing the appropriate treatment to the patient. This activity reviews the incidence, etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of thyroid cancer and highlights the role of interprofessional communication in optimizing the care of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the epidemiology and risk factors of thyroid cancer.
- Describe the clinical presentation and detailed histopathology of the different types of thyroid cancer.
- Explain the different treatment options for patients with thyroid cancer.
- Highlight the importance of interprofessional teams in coordinating care to optimize outcomes for patients with thyroid cancer.
