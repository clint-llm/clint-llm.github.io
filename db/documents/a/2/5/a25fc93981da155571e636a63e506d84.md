**Five Stages of Grief**

- Denial and Isolation

- Anger

- Bargaining

- Depression

- Acceptance

**Cardiac Outcomes of Grief**

- Heart Attack

- Takosubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome): Occurs predominantly in postmenopausal women soon after exposure to sudden, unexpected physical and emotional stress.

- Atrial Fibrillation: Heart rhythm disorders or arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, can result from stress. Studies report stress and mental health issues worsening atrial fibrillation symptoms.

**Factors Increasing Risk After Bereavement**

**Traumatic circumstances**such as the death of a spouse or a child, the death of a parent in early childhood or adolescence, sudden, unexpected, and untimely deaths ( particularly if associated with horrific circumstances), multiple deaths (particularly disasters), deaths by murder or manslaughter.

**Vulnerable people**such as those with low self-esteem, low trust in others, previous psychiatric disorder, previous suicidal threats or attempts, and/or absent or unhelpful family are more likely to experience increased symptoms.

These factors also specifically include an ambivalent attachment to deceased people, dependent or interdependent attachment to the deceased person, insecure attachment to parents in childhood (particularly learned fear or learned helplessness).
