Typically, zipper injuries occur in young children who are dressing and zipping while paying attention to something else. It is certainly not unusual for young children to be easily distracted. Zipper injuries also happen inÂ adults but less often. In adults, the condition typically occurs when the zipper is being closed by a relative or caretaker, as in patients with dementia or individuals with other neurocognitive disabilities who are unable to fully dress themselves. In children, only toilet seat injuries are more common causes of penile trauma than zippers. It is unclear if "going commando" (not using underwear) is a contributing factor. Known risk factors for penile zipper injuries include younger age (less than 18 years), not being circumcised, and requiring assistance for dressing.

Penile ring entrapments occur when a ring is placed around the penis, usually intended for erotic purposes, and cannot be removed by the patient. This causes increasing venous stasis leading to worsening edema, reduced lymphatic and arterial flow, bruising, cyanosis, ischemia, necrosis, and eventual gangrene. Patients are typically adults who often delay coming to the Emergency Department due to embarrassment. This often results in a more severe level of injury when they finally appear for medical assistance.
