**Acute Hypocalcemia**

Acute, symptomatic hypocalcemia should be treated with intravenous calcium. Calcium gluconate is preferred over calcium chloride since the latter can cause tissue necrosis if it extravasates and should only be administered through a central venous line. Each 10cc ampoule of 10% calcium gluconate contains 1 gram of calcium gluconate but only 93 mg of elemental calcium. One-2 ampoules can be diluted in 5% dextrose and infused intravenously over 10 to 20 minutes. The serum calcium should be repeated in several hours, and additional doses administered as needed.

**Chronic Hypocalcemia**

Patients treated with calcium and calcitriol can experience episodes of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia and are at an increased risk of developing nephrolithiasis and renal insufficiency. In addition, they score poorly on scales that measure the quality of life. Due to the increased risk of renal complications, patients should have periodic imaging of the abdomen looking for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. CT scans may be more sensitive than ultrasounds but expose patients to higher radiation levels.
