The caudate nucleus receives blood supply from the anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, and anterior choroidal artery. The majority of the head of the caudate nucleus receives blood supply from the anterior cerebral artery, though there is some normal variation among individuals. The superior head and body of the caudate nucleus receive vascular supply via the perforating lenticulostriate branches of the middle cerebral artery. Finally, the tail of the caudate nucleus receives blood from the perforating anterior choroidal artery.

The only organ system lacking a lymphatic system is the central nervous system, which was previously believed to lack lymphatic drainage completely. However, in the CNS, a glymphatic system removes waste from the CSF and allows it to drain to the periphery rather than a lymphatic system. One way by which this occurs is by aquaporin-4-mediated fluid movement and waste clearance. Aquaporin-4 expresses on astrocyte processes, and aquaporin-4 knockout mice have decreased ability to clear solutes.
