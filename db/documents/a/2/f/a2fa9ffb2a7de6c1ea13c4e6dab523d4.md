A corneal mucous plaque has a diverse etiology and can present with a diagnostic dilemma. The ophthalmologist is generally the first one involved in the patient's care. An interprofessional team of specialists, including rheumatologists, dermatologists, and primary clinicians, need to be included according to the etiology of the plaque. Nurses play an important role, too, as they can educate the patient about avoiding contact lenses, and warning signs of the associated systemic disease. Pharmacists should ensure that the patient is using proper topical and systemic medication. The pharmacist also prepares the correct concentration of topical acetylcysteine (10 to 20%) as advised by the ophthalmologist.
