Thrombus plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). The formation of a thrombus within a coronary artery with obstruction of coronary blood flow and reduction in oxygen supply to the myocardium produces several ACS. It is essential to understand the structural components and burden of the thrombus to decide revascularization strategies. Strategies combining dietary, pharmacologic-medical, and interventional-surgical therapies have shown considerable success in preventing and treating major cardiovascular events. These regimens focus on inhibiting the various pathways involved in thrombus generation. Novel strategies based on the knowledge of platelet aggregation's biochemistry and the coagulation processes and the geometric conditions encountered in the circulation are in different stages of development and clinical trials. Advances in noninvasive imaging techniques will help identify plaques at risk and reduce thrombosis's clinical impact.
