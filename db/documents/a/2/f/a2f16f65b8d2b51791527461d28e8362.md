Tinnitus is not harmful; however, depending on the etiology, the underlying process can be life-threatening, such as multiple sclerosis. Other than the underlying disease process, tinnitus can cause a range of emotional distress to patients, from severely debilitating to causing little to no distress to the patient. Additionally, there is not enough data at this time to predict whether symptoms will discontinue or reduce, regardless of whether there is an identifiable cause for the tinnitus or idiopathic in origin.
