- If a patient complains of eye irritation, pay particular attention to the eyelashes as you may miss a subtle finding which can cause severe discomfort to the patient, e.g., cilia incarnata internum.

- Trichiasis may be simple (local trauma, blepharitis) or may be the first presentation of a more serious disease like local eyelid malignancy, mucous membrane pemphigoid or trachoma.

- Beware trichotillomania. Many unnecessary investigations can be avoided.

- Always consider mucous membrane pemphigoid disease when seeing older patients with trichiasis.

- Eyelashes causing corneal irritation/ulcers can be managed with appropriate local non-surgical and surgical methods.

- With trachoma, blindness is preventable. With migration and population movements, all physicians need to be aware of this condition.
