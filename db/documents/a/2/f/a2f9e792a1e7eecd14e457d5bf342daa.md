The entirety of the central nervous system (CNS) derives from neuroectoderm. Ectoderm is one of the three initial germinal layers of the CNS, along with mesoderm and endoderm. This neuroectoderm eventually becomes the neural tube and neural crest, from which form the brain and nerves that make up the CNS. During the formation of the brain itself, the neural tube induces the formation of three vesicles; the prosencephalon, the mesencephalon, and the rhombencephalon. After this stage, the three vesicles differentiate into five vesicles, with the mesencephalon becoming the midbrain and the aqueduct.
