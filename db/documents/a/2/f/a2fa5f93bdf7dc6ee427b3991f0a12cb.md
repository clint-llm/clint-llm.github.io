Urethritis is inflammation of the urethra and is a lower urinary tract infection. The urethra is a fibromuscular tube through which urine exits the body in both males and females and semen in males. Urethritis has a strong association with sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Urethritis is characterized as gonococcal or nongonococcal infections. Neisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis are the most common causative organisms of STIs.
