Vocal fremitus is a vibration transmitted through the body. It refers to the assessment of the lungs by either the vibration intensity felt on the chest wall (tactile fremitus) and/or heard by a stethoscope on the chest wall with certain spoken words (vocal resonance). The vocal cords produce vibrations in the tracheobronchial tree that are felt throughout the lungs and chest wall. This is usually assessed by asking a patient to repeat a word such as "ninety-nine," while the healthcare provider feels the chest wall.

Evaluating for vocal fremitus, in the hands of an experienced examiner, can quickly rule in or out clinical issues of concern.

- Causes of increased vocal fremitus: pneumonia, lung abscess.

- Causes of decreased vocal fremitus: pleural effusion, pneumothorax, emphysema.
