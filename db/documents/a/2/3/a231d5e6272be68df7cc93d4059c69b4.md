Nurses, pharmacists, and clinicians should be fully aware that ipecac is no longer available for use to treat any disorder. There have been concerns about the toxicity of this agent. While the drug enjoyed everyday use in the past, its therapeutic benefits have also come into question. Thus, nurses who get an order for ipecac from a physician should consult with the pharmacist, particularly one who has taken some toxicology training, before administering the drug to the patient. Pharmacists must also be vigilant if they receive a prescription for ipecac and contact the prescribing physician in an attempt to dissuade them from giving the patient this drug. In cases where ipecac is even a consideration, a toxicologist should be brought in for a consult. Only with an interprofessional team approach to care can ipecac use be prevented in most cases, and more appropriate measures are employed to direct patient care to optimal outcomes. [Level 5]
