Patients with renal failure may experience a 30 to 50% decrease in plasma clearance of pancuronium and associated prolonged neuromuscular blockade.

Due to its blockade of muscarinic receptors, mainly M2 receptors found in the atria, pancuronium increases heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and cardiac output.

Pancuronium and other NMBDs have correlated with persistent weakness syndromes in critically ill patients requiring prolonged infusions of these drugs. Critically ill patients have many comorbidities, such as acid-base derangements, electrolyte imbalances, and organ system failure, potentially leading to myopathies and polyneuropathies.

It is important to note that pancuronium has no anesthetic, amnestic, or analgesic properties, and patients may have intraoperative recall leading to significant morbidity and psychological trauma without the use of sufficient anesthetic agents.
