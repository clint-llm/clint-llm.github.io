Pericardiocentesis is a major procedure with the potential of causing life-threatening injuries. The procedure is usually performed by a cardiologist, emergency department provider, cardiac surgeon, or radiologist, but the pharmacist and nurse's role is indispensable. The pharmacist may be required to assist in pain control. Prior to the procedure, the patient must have informed consentÂ and be told about the procedure's risks and benefits. Patient positioning and monitoring during and after the procedure are also major requirements. While the procedure is done under local anesthesia, the nurse often provides assurance and comfort to the patient while at the same time monitoring the vital signs. After the procedure, the patient is maintained at bed rest for 12-24 hours, but the vitals needs to be monitored until stable. If a drain is left inside the pericardium, the nurse should record the drainage every shift.

Outcomes

When done in the hands of experienced physicians, pericardiocentesis has good outcomes, but complication rates still occur in about 5 to 40% of cases. Most complications present early and need immediate attention. The use of ultrasound or fluoroscopy is highly recommended to lower the risk of complications.
