Multiple signaling pathways participate in the complex development of the midgut. The signaling protein nodal is responsible for differentiation into either mesoderm or endoderm. Higher-level exposures to nodal go on to form endoderm, while lower-level exposures favor mesoderm. Nodal has also been shown to be necessary during A-P patterning.
