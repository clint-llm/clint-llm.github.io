The exact etiology of meconium plug syndrome is ill-defined. In a majority of cases, meconium plug syndrome occurs in isolation. There may be an association, however, with the following conditions:

- Prematurity

- Neonates of mothers with diabetes - (gestational diabetes mellitus and chronic diabetes mellitus)

- Neonates of mothers  who received magnesium sulfate as a treatment for eclampsia or preterm labor

Moreover, according to a recent study, by Cuenca et al., an association with magnesium tocolysis was noted in 16% of the cases and only 3.2 % with Hirschsprung disease.
