**Clinical differential diagnoses**- Raised hemidiaphragm (phrenic nerve palsy, liver enlargement), pleural thickening (secondary to previous tuberculosis, empyema), plaques, consolidation, and lobar collapse,

**Radiological differential diagnoses**- The differential includes pleural thickening, plaques (benign and malignant), pseudo-plaques, and inferior pulmonary ligament. Pseudo-plaques are defined as plaque-like lung opacities formed by small nodules and contiguous with the visceral pleura. These are formed by small coalescent nodules, commonly seen in sarcoidosis, coal workers pneumoconiosis, and silicosis.

**Histopathological differential diagnoses**- Non-specific pleuritis - cytology negative exudative pleural effusion without a definable etiology after histopathological analysis.
