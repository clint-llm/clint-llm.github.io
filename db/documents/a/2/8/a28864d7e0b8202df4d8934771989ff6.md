The function of the gallbladder is to store bile (30 ml to 50 ml), which is released during the digestive and absorptive processes in the intestine. Contraction of the gallbladder with the release of bile into the biliary tree and duodenum is caused by gastric distension and fatty food content. This stimulates the secretion of cholecystokinin (CCK) from inclusion cells of the duodenum which causes contraction of the gallbladder. Disruption of neuro innervation, blockage of the cystic duct from gallstones, or other etiologies can cause symptoms ofÂ chronic or acute cholecystitis. Tests such as a nuclear HIDA (hepatobiliary) scan with CCK, or ultrasound are used to diagnose gallbladder disease. The gallbladder is distensible, and when the cystic duct is obstructed, it can enlarge to twice its size. This may result in infection requiring surgical removal.
