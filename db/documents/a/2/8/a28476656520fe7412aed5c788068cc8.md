Pneumocystis jirovecii is ubiquitous worldwide, and antibodies against it are widespread in immunocompetent children, with more than 80% of children developing antibodies by age 4 years. During the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic, rates up to 60% of patients with AIDS developed this condition. The onset of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has made this condition significantly less prevalent among PLWHIV. On the other hand, the advent of novel immunosuppressive therapy for conditions such as cancer, rheumatologic disorders, and the increased number of transplant patients, haveÂ made this population the main subset suffering from PCP.
