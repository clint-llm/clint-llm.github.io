Risk factors for complications include urinary tract obstruction, recent urinary tract instrumentation, and older age and patients with diabetes mellitus (particularly for emphysematous pyelonephritis and papillary necrosis). Acute pyelonephritis can also be complicated by the infection progressing to a renal abscess, perinephric abscess, papillary necrosis, or emphysematous pyelonephritis. This may present as the failure of symptoms to improve even after 48 hours of appropriate antibiotic therapy and requires further evaluation with urological imaging. Patients with complicated UTI can present directly with bacteremia, sepsis, multiple organ system failure, or acute renal failure.
