Once a body surface is exposed to an alkali substance, hydrogen ions penetrate the tissue leading to protein denaturation and lipid saponification. Thrombosis of microvasculature also occurs during this process, leading to further tissue necrosis and deep tissue injury called liquefaction necrosis. This process can lead to gastric and esophageal necrosis, emesis secondary to gastric irritations, pneumonitis after aspiration, and pulmonary irritation from chlorine gas production in the stomach.
