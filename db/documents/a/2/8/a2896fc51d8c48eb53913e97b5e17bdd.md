A single ventricle is an uncommon occurrence in embryogenesis, which results in the anatomical or functional loss of a ventricular cavity. These malformations are life-threatening and necessitate quick revision to correct. Prompt identification and goals of care discussions provide optimal outcomes for potential interventions. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of a single ventricle and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of a single ventricle.
- Review the common presentation of a patient with a single ventricle.
- Identify treatment considerations for patients with a single ventricle.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by a single ventricle.
