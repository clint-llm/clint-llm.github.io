Approximately 85% to 90% of small isolated VSDs close spontaneously during the first year of life. Patients with small, asymptomatic VSDs with the absence of PAH have an excellent prognosis without any intervention. Otherwise, the management approach includes VSD closure. Patients with Eisenmenger syndrome are usually managed in advanced centers due to the complexity of managing such cases. Historically, surgical repair of VSDs was the only option; however, recent advances in interventional techniques make percutaneous VSD closure possible. It is no longer recommended for patients with unrepaired ventricular septal defects to be routinely prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis.

- Those who suffered an episode of endocarditis.

- When the ratio of the pulmonary blood flow to the systemic blood flow (Qp/Qs) is equal to or more than 2 plus clinical evidence of LV fluid overload.

- In milder shunts such as those with Qp/Qs above 1.5, it is reasonable to intervene when there is evidence of LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, or when the pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance are less than two-thirds of systemic pressure and systemic vascular resistance, respectively.

Surgical repair reduces the risk for endocarditis, might improve PAH, and overall it increases survival. Without PAH, the operative mortality rate is approximately 1%. Complications include residual or recurrent VSD, valvular incompetence such as tricuspid regurgitation and aortic insufficiency, arrhythmias, LV dysfunction, and progression of PAH. The arrhythmias which accompany VSD repair include atrial fibrillation, complete heart block, and uncommonly, ventricular tachycardia. The main contraindication for surgical VSD closure is the presence of irreversible PAH; this is due to the high surgical perioperative mortality and pulmonary complications.

Percutaneous device VSD closure is reserved for those whose surgery is very risky due to severe PAH, multiple comorbidities, and those who had prior cardiothoracic surgery such as residual or recurrent VSD. Muscular VSDs are the main type amenable to this procedure, the proximity of other defects to the inlet valves makes performing this technique challenging in such cases. Despite the fact that it is still unpopular in the United States, current data shows excellent outcomes with complete closure and low mortality. The most frequent complication is complete atrioventricular block mostly related to perimembranous defects.

In conclusion, VSD is the most common congenital anomaly at birth. Small defects are expected to close spontaneously in the first year of life; however, larger defects can result in severe complications. Surgical VSD closure and device closure are the main intervention for large defects.
