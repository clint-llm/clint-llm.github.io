The pathogenesis is not well understood; however, multiple studies have shown overproduction of T-helper-2 cytokines (e.g., interleukin-13) and chemokines (e.g., CCL26/eotaxin-3), eotaxin-1, interleukin-5, and interleukin-15 upregulates eosinophils. Once eosinophils get recruited in the intestinal epithelium, they become cytotoxic by producing factors major basic protein, an eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, eosinophilic cationic protein, and eosinophilic peroxidase.

Other possible factors contributing to the pathophysiology include increased serum thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), interleukin-33 levels, and overactivation of TH17; however, it necessitates further study to define their exact roles.
