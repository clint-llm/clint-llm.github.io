Although almost all patients without a perineal opening get diagnosed in the newborn period, few patients with anorectal malformation can have a delayed diagnosis. These are most commonly children with perineal fistulas or anal stenosis that may go unrecognized in the neonatal period. In the case of a question of the presence of an anorectal malformation, an exam under anesthesia of the anus should be performed by a pediatric surgeon to assess if the opening is the correct size and the proper anatomic location (centered within the muscle complex.) Occasionally a patient may present with an anal opening that appears to be more anterior than is typical in most patients, which is a normal variant if the anal opening sizes appropriately and is in the center of the muscle complex.
