Infertility is a highly complex disorder with significant effects on the couple as a whole. It is important to remember that there can be, and regularly are, multiple causes of infertility. The differential diagnosis for infertility can be extensive, and a thorough workup is required to ensure no harmful disease process is missed. Due to the expansive nature of this discussion, the manuscript will focus on the differential diagnosis for PCOS due to its high prevalence in the infertile population.

The differential diagnosis for patients with suspected PCOS includes:

- Androgen producing ovarian tumors

- Adrenal tumors

- Nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia

- Cushing syndrome

- Prolactinemia disorders

- Thyroid disorders

The investigation of PCOS should include total testosterone, DHEA-S, and 17-Hydroxyprogesterone for evaluation of a virilizing ovarian or adrenal tumor or nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). There is a suggestion that DHEA-S should only be reserved for women with severe virilization because an asymptomatic, slightly elevated DHEA-S level does not affect management. Additionally, prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone should also be measured.

- The upper limit of normal for female testosterone is 45 to 60 ng/dL.

- A testosterone value greater than 150 ng/dL warrants investigation for ovarian and adrenal androgen-secreting tumors.

- DHEA-S of greater than 500 to 700 mcg/dL warrants further investigation of an adrenal tumor.

- A fasting 17-hydroxyprogesterone greater than 200 ng/dL collected during the follicular phase warrants an ACTH stimulation test, and a value greater than 500 ng/dL is diagnostic for nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

The clinical signs and further evaluation of these disorders are outside the scope of this paper.
