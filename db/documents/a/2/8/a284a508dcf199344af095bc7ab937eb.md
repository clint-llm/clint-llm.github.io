Infants with pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) are treated in neonatal ICU as these patients are critically ill and can develop complications such as pneumothorax, pneumopericardium, and require mechanical ventilation. They may also need invasive procedures such as thoracentesis, chest tubes, along with vitals monitoring closely. There are a few approaches for the management of PIE; however, success rates vary. A high number of PIE infants tend to be premature. Firstly, the use of surfactant in premature infants (<30 to 32 weeks) may reduce PIE development by preventing the occurrence of respiratory distress syndrome. Secondly, if mechanical ventilation is avoidable, then it should be avoided because high oxygen pressure can damage the infant's underdeveloped lungs. CPAP should be attempted first, although it can also cause PIE. Ventilator settings should be focused on reduced inspiratory time, prolong expiratory time, and decreased pressure while adjusting PEEP. This should allow the airway to empty upon expiration properly. These infants require close monitoring of vitals, oxygen, blood gas, and nutrition.

**Conservative Management**

There are a few preventive measures to prevent PIE. The prophylactic surfactant can be administered in preterm infants who are at risk of respiratory failure as it has shown to decrease risk. It has been observed that the incidence of air leaks is reduced in premature infants if the surfactant is administrated early with brief ventilation.

A more conservative approach is lateral decubitus positioning. It is more effective in infants with unilateral PIE and has been successful. One case study showed that with this approach, unilateral PIE had resolved within 2 to 6 days. There are low failure rates and minimal recurrence. Lateral decubitus positioning helps with bilateral PIE if one side is affected more significantly. The lung that is not affected will have improved oxygen, which will decrease the ventilator settings.

**Surfactant**

Surfactant is used in premature infants for prophylactic and management of respiratory distress syndrome. Surfactant is available as natural or synthetic and administrated through intratracheal administration. Surfactant helps decrease the surface tension between air and alveolar surface, so it prevents the collapse of the alveoli upon expiration.

Natural surfactants are normally derived from animals, more commonly bovine then porcine. It has been found to very similar to human surfactants. There has been success in using them. Some obstacles with surfactant use are that efficiency is inconsistent; there is a risk of pathogen contamination, lack of cost-effectiveness, and possible anaphylactic shock reaction. Currently used surfactants are the following: Survanta is made of bovine lung extract, beractant is made of porcine lung extract, and calfactant is a bovine broncho-alveolar extract.

A few synthetic surfactants have been studied to be therapeutic and better than natural surfactants. Colfosceril palmitate only contains phospholipids and is protein-free. Lucinactant is one of the newer surfactants that contain protein and have been studied to be better and more effective.

**High-Frequency Ventilation**

High-frequency positive pressure ventilation has been proven to be a preventive measure of air leaks and PIE when compared to conventional mechanical ventilation in some studies. Still, data is limited, and others have proven to be no different.

If an infant is in severe respiratory distress, there have been cases that have successively treated infants with selective intubation of contralateral bronchus of patients affected by PIE.

Another method that may help with intubation is turning the infant's head contralateral to the side of intubation, which may help with the intubation of the bronchus of choice.

A study found that high-frequency oscillatory ventilation is better compared to rapid-rate ventilation. These settings were found to be safe and effective for PIE in infants.

**Lobectomy**

Lobectomy is considered one of the last resort therapies due to its being an invasive procedure. Lobectomies are considered when medical management fails, and spontaneous resolution does not occur. This is considered in infants who have severe emphysema as previous results are successful.

**Other Methods of Management**

Few other rare case reports of other methods of management have included artificial pneumothorax,
