Staging in lung cancer is based on CT scan images according to the Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system. This is a summary of the 8th Edition of TNM in Lung Cancer, which is issued by the IASLC (International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer) and replaces the TNM 7th edition.

Proposed T, N, and M descriptors for the eighth edition of TNM classification for lung cancer

Note: Changes to the seventh edition are in bold.

- a. The uncommon superficial spreading tumor of any size with its invasive component limited to the bronchial wall, which may extend proximal to the main bronchus, is also classified as T1a.

- b. Solitary adenocarcinoma, ≤ 3cm with a predominately lepidic pattern, and ≤ 5mm invasion in any one focus.

- c. T2 tumors with these features are classified as T2a if ≤4 cm in greatest dimension or if the size cannot be determined, and T2b if >4 cm but ≤5 cm in greatest dimension.

- d. Most pleural (pericardial) effusions with lung cancer are due to tumors. In a few patients, however, multiple microscopic examinations of pleural (pericardial) fluid are negative for tumor, and the fluid is non-bloody and not an exudate. When these elements and clinical judgment dictate that the effusion is not related to the tumor, the effusion should be excluded as a staging descriptor.

- e. This includes the involvement of a single distant (nonregional) lymph node.
