Differences in susceptibility, even when individuals have the same risk factors to fungal infection, provide evidence about the complex interaction between the host, agent, and the environment. Recently, the immune-genetic predispositions for more severe, invasive disease have been described in the literature with specific defects in the innate and adaptative immunity.

Acquired immunosuppression, as in HIV/AIDS, lymphoma, diabetes, older age, Cushing's syndrome, or use of chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive agents, predisposes the host to tinea infection. Web spaces, excess sweating, and maceration also create a more hospitable environment for better fungal growth.

Mannan glycoproteins mediate the adherence of dermatophytes to the keratin-containing epithelial tissue of the host, and then proteases digest the keratin network to facilitate penetration. T. rubrum cell wall mannan has also been shown to suppress lymphocyte response.

Dermatophytes invade and infect the stratum corneum and may persist there. The skin responds to the superficial infection via the increased proliferation of keratinocytes and the production ofÂ scales**.**The epidermal hyperkeratosis clinically manifests as a thickening of the skin.
