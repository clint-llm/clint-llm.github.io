Two phenotypes have been described, early (infantile, classic) and late (non-classic) onset

Early-onset is characterized by exhibiting symptoms before the age of 1 year

Late-onset patients commonly exhibit symptoms in childhood or beyond in a variable manner, though usually as proximal muscle weakness. Symptom progression is slower but ultimately leads to lower limb weakness and respiratory failure due to diaphragm affection
