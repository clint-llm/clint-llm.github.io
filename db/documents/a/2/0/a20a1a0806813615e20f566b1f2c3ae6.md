Surgical interventions require an anesthesia provider, an operating room circulator nurse, a technologist, a surgeon, and potentially an additional surgical assistant, such as an RN first-assist or a physician assistant.

Non-surgical treatments, like injections, can often be performed by a surgeon, a non-surgeon physician, such as a dermatologist, or a non-physician, such as a physician assistant or nurse.
