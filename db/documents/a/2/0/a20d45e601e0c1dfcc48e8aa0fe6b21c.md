Extravasation of the dye under the skin is a severe side effect and should be avoided. It leads to severe pain and may cause necrosis of the skin. Applying an icepack to the area of extravasation helps relieve pain. Nausea is the most frequent side effect (0.06 to 15.29 %).

A more severe reaction in the form of bradycardia and hypotension may occur. In this case, the patient is made to lie down with their feet elevated. Blood pressure is monitored. The most frequent allergic reactions are mild. This includes hives or itching. Antihistamines are useful in these cases. Severe allergic reactions like bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, and acute myocardial infarction are life-threatening and need urgent care. A few cases of death have been documented with intravenous administration of fluorescein. The emergency equipment and drugs cart should always be available. Epinephrine, steroids, and bronchodilators like aminophylline help treat bronchospasm and severe anaphylactic reaction that may occur. The overall incidence of death has been reported as 1 in 2,22,000.
