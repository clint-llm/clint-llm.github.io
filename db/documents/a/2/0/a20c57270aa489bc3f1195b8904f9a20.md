Mid-forehead brow lifts were more popular before small incision procedures, and endoscopic procedures were developed, and they have become today's gold standard. However, there are specific patients for whom the mid-forehead brow lift is ideal: typically men with thinning or absent hair, deep forehead rhytides, and sparse eyebrow hair. When patients are chosen with care, the outcomes are satisfying and cosmetically very acceptable. The main advantage of the mid-forehead brow lift is greater mechanical advantage than with coronal and endoscopic lifts due to the proximity of the dissection to the brow itself; thus, brow height and contour can be manipulated more effectively and more reliably. Asymmetry is also addressable with greater ease using mid-forehead, direct, and suture suspension techniques compared to coronal and endoscopic approaches. Lastly, the mid-forehead brow lift technique is simple and can be performed easily in the office on an outpatient basis.
