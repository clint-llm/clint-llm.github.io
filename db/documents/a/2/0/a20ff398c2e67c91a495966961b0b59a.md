The TTMPB is performed under ultrasound guidance, which minimizes the risk of complications. The basic equipment needed to perform the block includes:

- Ultrasound machine with a high-frequency linear transducer

- Sterile gloves

- Sterile ultrasound sleeve and gel

- Chlorhexidine or other antiseptic preparation

- Nerve block needle, typically 80 mm to 100 mm

- Two (if bilateral) 20 to 30 mL syringes containing local anesthetic +/- adjuncts

- Local anesthetic: long-acting agents such as bupivacaine or ropivacaine are typically used

- Physiologic monitors, including a pulse oximeter, blood pressure monitoring, and electrocardiography
