**Interscalene Block**

After surgery in the postoperative period, nerve blocks may be used to decrease the pain experienced by the patient. One widely used example of such a nerve block is the inter-scalene nerve block, which is used specifically in many upper extremity injuries.

**Thoracic Outlet Syndrome**

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a common syndrome due to abnormal regional anatomy or injuries to the associated structures, with an incidence of between 3 and 8 in 1000 people.

For these reasons, thoracic outlet syndrome has long been considered difficult to diagnose, not least because there is no formal clinical diagnostic test.

In general, the neurovascular structures in the triangle undergo compression. The compression of the subclavian artery is more diagnostic of TOS than the compression of the subclavian vein because vein compression can occur in non-TOS patients.

Diagnostic modalities that may be employed in investigating suspected thoracic outlet syndrome include ultrasonography, chest radiography, CT angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, dedicated venography or arteriography, nerve conduction studies, or needle electromyography.
