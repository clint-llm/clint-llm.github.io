The abdomen consists of the organs necessary for digestion. These include the stomach, pancreas, liver, gallbladder and small and large intestines. The abdomen also contains the kidneys and spleen. Connecting tissues called the mesentery, hold these organs together. The mesentery also allows these organs to move relative to one another and expand. The abdomen has a covering fascia, a layer of tissue that is protective. The abdominal muscles lay in front of the fascia, and on the outermost layer is the skin. The back of the abdomen consists of back muscles as well as the spine.

The junction where the abdomen ends and the pelvis begins is the lumbar region of the abdomen. The pelvis is composed of the bony pelvis, pelvic floor, pelvic cavity, and the perineum. The function of the pelvis is for structural support and stability.
