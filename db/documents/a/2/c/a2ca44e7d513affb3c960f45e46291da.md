While GLPLS can bring about significant psycho-social stress from the superficial alteration to appearance, there are no known systemic manifestations of the disease. Further study of the INCENP protein and its role in overall mitotic function may lead to the discovery of concomitant morbidities in GLPLS, yet no such comorbidity is present at this moment. The primary lasting complication present in GLPLS is the existence of the follicular scarring that occurs after the infundibular inflammation. This cicatricial portion of the disease manifests on the scalp and leads to permanent damage of the pilosebaceous unit.
