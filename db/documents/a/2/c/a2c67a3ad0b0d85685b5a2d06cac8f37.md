Neonates affected by HI are typically born prematurely and encased in markedly thickened, hardened stratum corneum. This casing cracks and results in yellow plaque-like “armor” plates separated by deep longitudinal and transverse erythematous fissures encompassing the entirety of the body. The hyperkeratotic plates restrict movement of the chest wall, upper and lower limbs. Enlarged scales on the chest wall restrict expansion leading to respiratory distress, hypoventilation, and respiratory failure. Moreover, pseudo-contractures of the limbs from the tension of hyperkeratotic plates restrict movement and impair perfusion, leading to digital pallor and ischemic necrosis to distal extremities.

Edematous hands and feet are often enveloped in a mitten-like casing from hardened scales. Furthermore, severe bilateral ectropion (out turning of the eyelids) involving upper and lower eyelids exposes the conjunctiva leaving the cornea at risk for abrasions and desiccation. The nose may appear flattened, and nares may be obstructed by overlying skin. Also, flattened ears are observed with external auditory canal obstructed by the skin. Severe traction on the lips causes eclabium (eversion of the lips) with an appearance of a wide gaping mouth. Additionally, the loss of skin barrier leads to impairment of thermoregulation, dysfunction of sweat glands, hyperthermia, and dehydration from excess water loss. Generalized poor hair growth and nail deformities are also commonly seen.
