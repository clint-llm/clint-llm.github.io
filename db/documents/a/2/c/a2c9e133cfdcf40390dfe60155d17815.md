The early identification of AMI is paramount to reduce the likelihood of debilitating morbidity and high mortality. AMI has a vague presentation, and a high index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose suspected patients because of the life-threatening potential of the disease. Findings of abdominal pain out of proportion to a physical exam and cardiovascular risk factors that predispose a patient to embolism and peripheral thrombosis should alert the clinician to consider AMI. Diseases to consider in the differential diagnosis are those that cause acute abdominal pain and are therefore variable. These include acute colitis, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, bowel obstruction, diabetic ketoacidosis, gastrointestinal perforation, and malignancy.
