Research shows interprofessional teams are participating in standardized patient scenarios that deal with difficult conversations with patients. These interdisciplinary teams can consist of residents, student nurses, medical students, and pharmacology students, among many others.

Standardized patients as embedded participants and as subjects of clinical care can provide a robust opportunity to train communication skills in an interprofessional setting. Despite technological advances in many other areas of healthcare simulation, this authentic interpersonal communication cannot be simulated through other modalities at this time.
