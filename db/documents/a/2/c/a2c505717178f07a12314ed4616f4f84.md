cGMP levels get balanced by the opposing actions of guanylate cyclase, which synthesizes cGMP from GTP, and phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which convert cGMP to 5â€™-GMP, ending its activity. Nitric oxide (NO) binds to soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and greatly increases its catalytic activity, increasing the conversion of GTP to cGMP. The other mechanism of cGMP conversion is receptor-mediated, typically activated through natriuretic peptide (NP) ligand binding to particulate guanylate cyclase (pGC).

cGMP mediates its effects through three main pathways. cGMP-dependent serine/threonine protein kinases (PKGs) are enzymes primarily activated through ligand binding by cGMP. There are two identified subclasses, PKGI and PKGII, which differ in both tissue distribution and targets of phosphorylation. cGMP also activates protein kinase A (PKA), though it is a weaker agonist than cAMP.

The PDE superfamily consists of 11 members differentiated by cAMP/cGMP substrate specificity, kinetics, activation, and inhibition. cGMP is the sole substrate of PDEs 5, 6, and 9, and is a dual substrate (with cAMP) of PDEs 1, 2, 3, 10, and 11. The dual-specificity of PDE enzymes allows cGMP to effect changes through regulation of cAMP levels as well. By binding to PDE, cGMP can block sites that would normally catalyze cAMP conversion to AMP, resulting in elevated cAMP levels and the downstream effects that this mediates.
