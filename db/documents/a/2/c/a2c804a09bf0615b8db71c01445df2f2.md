Congenital myotonic dystrophy (CMD) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion of CTG (cytosine-thymine-guanine) in the DMPK (dystrophia myotonica protein kinase) gene on chromosome 19q 13.3. DM is more than just muscular dystrophy as the affected individuals show the involvement of other organ systems such as cataracts, cardiac conduction anomalies, insulin resistance, the congenital form being associated with developmental disabilities, etc.

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), also known as Steinert disease Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), which is a milder version of DM1.

Like any trinucleotide expansion repeat diseases, a larger number of repeats are associated with the severity of the disease.

**Natural History:******The incidence of CMD is 1 in 47619 live births, and the mortality in the neonatal period is up to 40%. Severe CMD demonstrates a unique “biphasic” course; in which neonatal symptoms improve/stabilize in surviving neonates before adult-onset symptoms present in later life.
