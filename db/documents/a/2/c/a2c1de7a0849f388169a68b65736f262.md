The precise mechanism of action of trihexyphenidyl remains inadequately comprehended; it appears to act on the parasympathetic nervous system by inhibiting efferent impulses directly. Structures innervated by the parasympathetic system, such as the salivary glands, eyes, and smooth muscles (directly and indirectly), are affected, even at smaller doses. The direct central inhibition of cerebral motor centers may occur with higher doses. Research indicates that the receptors affected are the dopamine and M1 muscarinic receptors.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**The drug is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and the onset of action occurs 60 minutes after an oral dose, with peak activity occurring after 2 to 3 hours.

**Distribution:**Trihexyphenidyl achieves high concentration in the brain facilitated by intralysosomal uptake.

**Metabolism:**Trihexyphenidyl is metabolized by hydroxylation of the alicyclic groups. Enterohepatic circulation is low.

**Excretion:**The estimated elimination half-life in adults is about 5 to 10 hours, but some studies suggest an elimination half-life of up to 33 hours.
