Ultimately, management of SBS requires an interprofessional team led by a physician with gastrointestinal expertise. A gastrointestinal surgeon can provide the appropriate surgical recommendations and management, and a transplant surgeon can expand the patient's therapeutic options. Other essential team members include administrative support, a nurse coordinator to handle the patient's day-to-day management, and a nutritionist. A psychologist and social worker are important to address the psychosocial challenges of SBS.
