Researchers have extensively studied deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities. With the increased use of central venous catheters, cardiac pacemakers/defibrillators, and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines. DVTs in the upper extremities have become more commonplace and require a heightened index of suspicion from clinicians. Patients can be otherwise asymptomatic but commonly present with limb swelling. The most serious complication associated with any DVT, including upper extremity DVT, is a pulmonary embolus (PE). Recognition and appropriate intervention may prevent significant patient morbidity and mortality. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of deep venous thrombosis of the upper extremity and the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.
- Summarize the treatment of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with suspected upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.
- Outline the evaluation and management of deep venous thrombosis of the upper extremity and the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.
