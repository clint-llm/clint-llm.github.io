By far the majority of medications are not recommended during pregnancy. All healthcare workers who prescribe medications have a responsibility in educating the pregnant patient not to take any medication, prescription or over the counter, without first speaking to the provider. While the thalidomide tragedy took place nearly four decades ago, it was one of the first to reveal the tragic side effects that drugs can have on the fetus. Nurses and pharmacists should always speak to pregnant patients about medications and their potential harm to the fetus. For pregnant patients who are ill, the first consideration should always be one that does not involve a drug. Of course, there are many situations where there is no choice but to use a medication, but the onus is on the healthcare provider to weigh the benefits and the risks; consulting a pharmacist is prudent in such instances if there is any doubt. When medications are used, the nursing staff should be extra vigilant regarding the potential for adverse effects to the fetus and the mother and report all concerns to the prescriber. This is one situation where an interprofessional team approach is critical for improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]
