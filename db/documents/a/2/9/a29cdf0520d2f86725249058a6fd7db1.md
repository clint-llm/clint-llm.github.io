**Pharmacokinetic**

Epinastine is a powerful anti-allergic drug that has antihistaminic properties. In addition to that, epinastine also shows anti leukotriene, anti-PAF, and anti-bradykinin activities, which provide additional anti-allergic activities.

Plasma concentration at steady state is approximately 5.96 to 6.04 ng/ml.

Epinastine is categorized as a second-generation antihistamine as it can not cross the blood-brain barrier. There is no diffusion at the central nervous system because of its polarity and cationic charge at the ph of the physiological state. Since it doesn’t cross the blood-brain barrier, it has no CNS effects and does not cause sedation in patients.

The duration of onset of epinastine is approximately 180 seconds and lasts for about 8 hours when administered as an eye drop.

**Monitoring**

Physicians should educate the patients about the course of therapy, potential adverse/side effects, and steps to take in case of an adverse event. Patients should be monitored via regular checkups to assess the relief in their symptoms. Patient compliance with the prescription should be ensured and encouraged. Drug dose should be adjusted as needed based on regular checkups and thorough examination.
