Neonatal meningitis can be difficult to diagnose due to pathogens varying with gestational age at birth, age at presentation, geographic location, the often subtleness of clinical presentation, and inconsistent findings among infected individuals. Well-appearing febrile neonates can become toxic quickly and are at high risk for meningitis due to their immature immune systems. Lumbar puncture (LP) with cultures plus or minus molecular diagnostics of the CSF continues to be the gold standard for diagnosing neonatal meningitis. The current recommendation is to perform an LP on all neonates with confirmed or suspected sepsis.

Select recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Evaluation of Febrile Infants 8 to 60 Days Old are listed below:

- Obtain CSF for analysis and bacterial culture in the workup of a febrile infant 8 to 21 days old.

- Enterovirus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) should be sent if pleocytosis is present on CSF testing during periods of increased local enterovirus prevalence.

- In infants at high risk for HSV, PCR testing should be obtained.

- High-risk patients for HSV include infants born to mothers with genital HSV lesions, maternal fever 48 hours before or within 48 hours of delivery, or if the infant has CSF pleocytosis in the absence of a positive Gram stain.

- Obtain CSF analysis for infants 22 to 28 days if inflammatory markers are abnormal and/or no other source of infection or fever is identified.

- Urinalysis and workup for urinary tract infections are universally recommended in evaluating patients with a fever in this age group.

A multicenter study from 2019 reported that most infants less than 60 days old with bacterial meningitis either have positive Gram stain results or corrected CSF pleocytosis (80.3% sensitivity). The bacterial meningitis score was noted to have poor specificity in this study; therefore, the authors recommend not using this prediction tool in infants less than 60 days old. The authors also noted that infants who did not have pleocytosis or abnormal Gram stain but were later proved to have bacterial meningitis either had peripheral leukocytosis or bandemia on presentation. Notably, correcting the CSF leukocyte count for red blood cells (RBCs) decreased the sensitivity of pleocytosis for meningitis in this population.

Monitoring in a hospitalized setting is required until culture results are obtained. The time to pathogen detection may vary based on the underlying pathogen and the clinical presentation. A multicenter study from 2018 reported that in infants under 60 days old with an underlying invasive bacterial infection (either bacteremia or meningitis), 88% of the pathogens were detected in blood, and 89% were detected in CSF cultures and/or Gram stain within 24 hours. In "well-appearing infants," the detection rate was 85% at 24 hours. They reported that in all "non–ill-appearing febrile infants," only 0.3% will have a pathogen detected after 24 hours, most commonly S. aureus.

**Polymerase Chain Reaction**

Real-time PCR assays to detect multiple pathogens, including S pneumoniae, E coli, GBS, S aureus, and L monocytogenes, had a higher detection rate than traditional cultures (72% vs 48%), even if antibiotics had been started (58% vs 29%).E coli, Haemophilus influenzae, L monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitides, S agalactiae (GBS), Streptococcus pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, HSV types 1 and 2, human herpes virus 6, varicella zoster, human parechovirus, and Cryptococcus neoformans/gattii).

PCR testing for HSV is essential for diagnosing HSV CNS involvement. A large multicenter study noted significant variation in HSV testing across emergency departments in North America when evaluating neonates for meningitis. This variation did not correlate with local HSV incidence. The authors concluded, "Our data emphasize the need for improved management strategies focused on the early identification of infants at both high and low risk of HSV infection."

**When to Defer Lumbar Punctures**

The 2012 Committee on Fetus and Newborn recommend performing an LP for all infants with sepsis or bacteremia.

**Radiographic Evaluation**

Expert opinion varies regarding the radiographic evaluation of neonates with meningitis. Some authors recommend a sonographic evaluation of every infant with evidence of meningitis, while some recommend sonography only if there is suspicion of neurologic complications.
