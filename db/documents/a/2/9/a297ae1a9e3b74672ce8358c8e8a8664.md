Acute mountains sickness is a clinical diagnosis based on the presence of a headache, with or without the other typical symptoms, in the appropriate setting.  There is no specific lab or other testing recommended. Since the symptoms of Acute Mountain Sickness are nonspecific, the presence of atypical symptoms, such as diarrhea, should trigger an evaluation for other causes. Also, the patient may have increased their alcohol intake while traveling, and this should be considered when evaluating. Finally, the presence of additional or more severe neurologic symptoms is indicative of possible High Altitude Cerebral Edema and should be treated as a medical emergency.
