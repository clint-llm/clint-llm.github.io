The CDC established case definition criteria for human mpox during the 2003 outbreak in the United States. However, the same criteria are not necessarily as valuable in endemic areas. The specificity of the epidemiological criteria decreases as the potential exposure of the population to infected mammals or humans increases. In addition, the specificity of the clinical criteria decreases as the prevalence of similar illnesses increases, as is the case with chickenpox, given the lack of routine varicella-zoster vaccination in Africa.

Considering the similarities between human mpox infection and smallpox, the “Acute, Generalized Vesicular or Pustular Rash Illness Protocol” created by the CDC with the addition of lymphadenopathy to requisite primary criteria could be used to determine which patients warrant further testing.

Mpox infection can be confirmed via isolation in viral culture or by PCR for mpox virus DNA from a patient specimen. Alternatively, tests indicating the presence of Orthopoxvirus in a patient specimen, barring patient exposure to another of the same genus, can be sufficiently diagnostic, such as visualization on electron microscopy, immunohistochemical staining for orthopoxvirus antigens, serum studies for anti-orthopoxvirus IgM (indicating recent exposure) and IgG (indicating prior exposure or vaccination).
