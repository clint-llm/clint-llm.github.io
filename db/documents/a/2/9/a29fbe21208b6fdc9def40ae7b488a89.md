Signals will transmit from the nucleus solitarius to several other regions of the brain, including several brainstem nuclei, such as the parabrachial nucleus of the rostral pons, which will send cardiorespiratory inputs to the forebrain and the limbic system, of which many travels in the ventral amygdalofugal pathway. Some references consider the parabrachial nucleus as part of the limbic system. The locus coeruleus, the dorsal raphe nuclei, and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, which in turn has descending neurons synapsing in the autonomic fibers, all control autonomic functions. Within the nucleus solitareus, there are two specific subpopulations of neurons that send their projections to the stria terminalis. The aldosterone-sensitive neurons, which are sensitive to sodium depletion, and the A2 noradrenergic neurons, which are activated by immune and stress-related stimuli modulate several functions, including autonomic control, endocrine modulation, sleep-arousal states, and stress-induced behaviors. These may have implications in multiple disease states.
