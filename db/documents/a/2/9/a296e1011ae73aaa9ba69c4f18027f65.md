During prepartum visits, it is important to elicit risk factors for developing caput succedaneum or any other birth-related trauma and counsel parents on the possibility of complication and prognosis. Caput succedaneum is a clinical diagnosis that typically does not warrant further imaging or laboratory testing. Both intrapartum and postpartum ultrasound of the scalp will show an echogenic hemorrhage above the skull. However, an ultrasound is not required to make a diagnosis of caput succedaneum.
