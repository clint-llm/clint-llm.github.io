The RER is associated with many roles in protein synthesis, which also include post-translational modifications, folding, and sorting. Membrane-bound ribosomes in the RER translate the mature mRNA transcript into amino acids that are attached to become polypeptides. Eukaryotic ribosomes (80S) consist of two unequal subunits: the small subunit (40S) and the large subunit (60S). The (S) refers to a Svedberg unit, which is a non-metric unit of measure for the sedimentation rate. Each Svedberg unit is equal to 10^-13 seconds. After protein synthesis, the post-translational addition of some carbohydrates and some proteolytic cleavages occur in the RER. However, most post-translational modifications take place in the Golgi complex.

The first step towards proper folding requires oligosaccharyltransferases to glycosylate the newly formed peptide chain. Glycosylation of the peptide increases its solubility and protects it until chaperones can bind to the chain and begin the folding process. Major chaperones in this process include Calnexin (CNX), Calreticulin (CRT), and binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP).

After proper synthesis and folding of the protein, it goes to the edges of the RER. The vesicular coat protein complex II (COPII) mediates the formation of vesicles at the RER edges, which transport the protein product towards the Golgi apparatus for further processing.
