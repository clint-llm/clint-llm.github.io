Anosognosia is a neurological condition in which the patient is unaware of their neurological deficit or psychiatric condition. It is associated with mental illness, dementia, and structural brain lesion, as is seen in right hemisphere stroke patients. It can affect the patientâ€™s conscious awareness of deficits involving judgment, emotions, memory, executive function, language skills, and motor ability. This activity examines when this condition should be considered and the differential diagnosis for this condition. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.
