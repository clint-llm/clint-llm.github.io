The infection is thus best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the pulmonologist, internist, thoracic surgeon, infectious disease consultant the laboratory specialist. The organism is easy to identify in culture but of more importance is prompt treatment. The pharmacist must ensure compliance with drug therapy because recurrences have been reported when the treatment duration is limited. Patients who are immunocompromised need long term treatment. A few patients may require drainage of the abscess. The infectious disease nurse should follow up on these patients to ensure that recovery is going smooth.
