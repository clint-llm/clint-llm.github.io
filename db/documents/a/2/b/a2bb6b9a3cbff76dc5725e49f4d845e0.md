Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis can be classified as primary (idiopathic), genetic, or secondary.

**Primary (idiopathic) FSGS**

Primary FSGS has been associated with the presence of circulating permeability factors/cytokines, which cause foot process effacement and proteinuria. These include corticotrophin-like cytokine factor 1, apoA1b, anti-CD40 Ab, and suPAR.

- FSGS with hyalinosis

- Progression from immunoglobulin M (IgM) nephropathy

- Progression from minimal-change disease

- Progression from mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis

- Superimposed on other primary glomerulonephritis conditions (e.g., immunoglobulin A [IgA] nephropathy)

Variants of primary FSGS include the following:

- Collapsing form

- Cellular variant

- FSGS with mesangial hypercellularity

- FSGS with glomerular tip lesions

**Genetic**

Several genes encoding proteins of slit diaphragm, cell membrane, cytoskeleton, nuclear, mitochondrial, and lysosomal origin have been identified to be abnormal/mutated, causing the loss of integrity of glomerular filtration barrier resulting in FSGS.NPHS1 and NHPS2 mutations that lead to the absence of essential slit diaphragm components, causing severe congenital nephrotic syndrome. Moreover, polymorphisms in the APOL1 gene are usually found in people of African descent, which markedly increases the risk for FSGS.

**Secondary FSGS**

A range of factors, including drugs, inflammations, infections, toxins, and intrarenal hemodynamic alterations, may initiate injury to podocytes and lead to glomerulosclerosis.

Drugs associated with FSGS include the following:

- Intravenous heroin

- Analgesics

- Pamidronate

- Lithium

- Anabolic steroids

- Doxorubicin, daunomycin

Viruses associated with FSGS include the following:

- Hepatitis B and C

- HIV

- Parvovirus B19

- Cytomegalovirus

- SARS-CoV-2

Adaptive responses lead to glomerular hypertrophy. Histopathologically, these are characterized by large glomeruli, the predominance of perihilar scarring, and partial foot process effacement.

- Solitary kidney

- Kidney allograft

- Renal dysplasia

- Renal agenesis

- Oligomeganephronia

- Segmental hypoplasia

- Vesicoureteral reflux

Hemodynamic causes in patients without decreased renal mass include the following:

- Obesity (especially morbid obesity)

- Sickle cell nephropathy

- Congenital cyanotic heart disease

Lymphomas and other malignancies have an association with FSGS. Miscellaneous other conditions causing FSGS include the following:

- Hypertensive nephrosclerosis

- Alport syndrome

- Sarcoidosis

- Radiation nephritis
