Affected persons with MMN present clinically with subacute to chronic progressive asymmetric muscle weakness. Unilateral wrist drop, finger weakness, or foot drop may be the initiating complaint. Although upper limb muscles are predominantly affected, leg weakness may also occur. Weakness may be aggravated by the cold. Sensory symptoms of pain and tingling are not uncommon but are typically minimal. Some patients may complain of muscle cramps, twitching, fasciculation, or excessive fatigue. The involvement of cranial nerves, bulbar, and respiratory muscles is unusual in these patients.

Physical examination reveals the weakness of distal muscles in the distribution of the motor nerves. For instance, with radial nerve involvement, the wrist and finger extensors are more affected than the triceps. Muscles of the same myotome may be spared innervated by a different nerve. For example, although both abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) are of the same myotome (C8-T1), only APB will be affected if the median nerve is involved. Muscle atrophy may be present late in the course of the disease and is often disproportionately mild as compared to the weakness. Deep tendon reflexes may be normal or asymmetrically reduced. Upper motor neuron signs are typically absent, differentiating from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).Â Myokymia may be seen in the affected muscles.
