The prognosis of JIA has changed dramatically in recent years thanks to the availability of novel drugs, which can inhibit the biological mechanisms responsible for persistent inflammation selectively. Prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent permanent joint damage and preserve joint functionality.  Some studies support the possibility of the existence of a “window of opportunity” in early disease, during which prompt treatment induces higher rates of remission and improves long-term outcomes.

A recent study on 168 patients showed the remission off medication in 48.8% of cases, the remission on medication (or minimal disease activity) in 49.9% of cases, and only 1.3% of subjects were no-responders. No association was found between the state and duration of remission and age of patients, clinical features, disease course, or laboratory findings.
