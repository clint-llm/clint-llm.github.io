In 90% of patients, Diamond Blackfan anemia starts before 12 months of age. It commonly presents with congenital bony malformations (50% of the cases) and growth retardation (30% of cases).

Patients usually present with severe macrocytic anemia and normochromic anemia, along with erythroid aplasia due to congenital bone marrow failure. Typically platelet and leukocyte counts are in the normal range; however, there have been patients with low leukocyte and high platelet counts. Patients can have significantly low reticulocyte counts.

DBA presents with a broad spectrum of phenotypes from mild to profound in severity. Physical abnormalities are present in 50% of cases.

PRL5 mutation has associations with cleft lip or cleft soft palate, while RPL11 largely correlates with thumb abnormalities but is also seen in cleft lip or palate cases.

Other physical anomalies include urogenital anomalies, atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects.

**Diagnostic Criteria for Classical DBA**

- Age of onset less than 12 months

- Macrocytic anemia without other significant cytopenias

- Reticulocytopenia

- Bone marrow with normal cellularity with a lack of erythroid precursor

**Major Supporting Criteria**

- Gene mutation described in DBA

- Positive family history

**Minor Supporting Criteria**

- Elevated ADA activity

- Congenital anomalies described in classical DBA

- Elevated HbF

- No evidence of another inherited bone marrow failure syndrome
