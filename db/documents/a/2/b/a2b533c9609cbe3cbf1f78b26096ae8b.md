A vitreous detachment typically affects patients older than the age of 50 and increases in prevalence by age 80. Individuals who are myopic or nearsighted have an increased risk of vitreous floaters. Additionally, eyes with an inflammatory disease after direct trauma to the globe or having recently undergone eye surgery have an increased chance of developing a vitreous floater. Men and women appear to be affected equally.
