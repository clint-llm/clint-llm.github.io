# Continuing Education Activity

The development of new medications in the US is a lengthy process governed by the FDA. The drug development process involves coordination between drug sponsors, clinical researchers, and regulatory authorities. All drugs must move through the pipeline of discovery, investigation, clinical trials, and FDA approval before being marketed to consumers. This activity reviews the federal regulations of medication development and highlights the interplay between the FDA, drug manufacturers, and clinical researchers.

**Objectives:**
- Outline specific laws about regulations of drug development by the FDA.
- Describe the New Drug Application process, including expedited review programs.
- Summarize the intellectual property laws regulating drug development.
- Explain the process of regulating the production of generic small-molecule drugs and biologics.

# Introduction

Before 1906, there were few controls on drug distribution, and products were often inconsistent in strength or poorly labeled.

Numerous amendments were added to the FDCA to modify the regulations and oversight of the FDA. The Durham-Humphrey Amendment was enacted to regulate unsafe medications to be taken without medical supervision, distinguishing between over-the-counter and prescription drugs.

In 1961, thalidomide was shown to cause severe congenital disabilities after being marketed in Europe, prompting increased regulations on medication development.

# Function

The FDA approval process requires comprehensive pre-clinical testing followed by multi-phase clinical trials to ensure safety and efficacy. Discovery is the beginning phase of medication development involving disease study, molecular models, and high-throughput screening to determine potential new drug molecules. Pre-clinical testing involves in-vitro and in-vivo experiments using cellular and animal models.

The submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application is required before being administered to human participants.

Initial testing of fewer than one hundred healthy patients to determine pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and drug safety in humans. Roughly two-thirds of drugs complete phase I testing and move on to phase II clinical trials.

Phase IV is considered post-market surveillance of the approved drug on thousands of diseased patients. Annual reports are submitted to the FDA to determine if the drug should still be available on the market.

If drug sponsors can demonstrate adequate safety and efficacy during clinical trials phases I-III, they may subsequently submit a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA).

Priority review can be used for an NDA or BLA to decrease the FDA review period and may be combined with other expedited review programs.

The FDA continues to monitor newly approved drugs and biologics for long-term safety. Phase IV clinical trials are used for post-market surveillance, which involves thousands of participants.

US governing authorities heavily regulate intellectual property. Drug patents are granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office, whereas data exclusivity for new medicines is set by the FDA. Exclusivity involves inhibiting the approval of competing drugs for a set period to balance novel drug creation and consumer medication accessibility. The FDA allows 5 years of exclusivity for novel small-molecule drugs and 12 years for biologics.

Following the expiration of patents for name-brand drugs, the FDA regulates the production of generic drugs by requiring the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application(ANDA). The FDA approval of an ANDA requires evidence from a manufacturer that their production of a generic small-molecule drug is bioequivalent to the existing name-brand drug.

However, biologics are regulated under a different set of rules and require submission of an abbreviated Biologics License Application(aBLA). Generic biologics, or biosimilars, may differ considerably in molecular structure from the original biologic, unlike generic small-molecule drugs.

# Issues of Concern

Due to the stringent requirements set by the FDA, some studies have revealed the issue of “drug lag” in the US markets. Particularly in the 1970s, new drugs were often approved and marketed far earlier in European markets than in US markets.

The increasing cost of performing clinical trials creates another significant barrier to the approval of new drugs. The average cost of performing a clinical trial is nearly $48 million per drug.

# Clinical Significance

The regulations provided by the FDA have assured the production of safe and efficacious medications for consumers. For instance, the Kefauver-Harris Amendment, also known as the "Drug Efficacy Amendment," required pharmaceutical companies to show evidence of drug efficacy before approval. The legislation also worked to prevent the rebranding of generic drugs as breakthrough drugs at a higher price. As a result of modern drug regulations, physicians and pharmacists can inform patients about adverse effects, safe dosages, and the proven effectiveness of medicines in treating disease. In addition, drug sponsors must monitor adverse drug reactions through the FAERS to safeguard clinical trial participants and consumers. Historically, the FDA has stopped drug trials prematurely due to high rates of adverse events in concordance with such reporting systems. Thus, patient safety is the foundation of many laws governing drug development.

Government oversight of intellectual property laws also has clinical implications. Drug manufacturers are allowed drug data exclusivity for several years, during which the manufacturer can recoup the huge costs associated with research and clinical trials. Data exclusivity promotes pharmaceutical innovation so that novel drugs are created for consumers. Privatized drug innovation is balanced by allowing cheaper generic drugs to be produced after data exclusivity ends. Clinicians are therefore able to prescribe more affordable generic drugs to their patients without compromising on drug efficacy. The regulations for generic drugs provide significantly better health care to consumers from a lower socioeconomic background.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Federal regulations have evolved over time to improve consumer safety. As mentioned, the FDA makes attempts to balance pharmaceutical drug innovation with public access to affordable medicines. The processes involved have implications on physicians and pharmacists prescribing medications. Physicians and pharmacists need to consider the bioequivalence of generic drugs when prescribing and educating patients. Furthermore, health professionals involved in researching novel drugs should be cognizant of the processes and federal regulations surrounding drug development. A better understanding of these regulations by physicians and pharmacists alike will enhance the difficult process of drug development. [Level 5]
