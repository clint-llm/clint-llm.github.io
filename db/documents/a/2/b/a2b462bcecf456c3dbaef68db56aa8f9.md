Many neurotransmitters and peptides within the central nervous system appear to play a major role in the physical manifestations. Results of brain imaging studies have shown characteristic changes, including increased flow and receptor activity, in specific geographic regions including the limbic and frontal region. The amygdala is proposed as the main area of dysfunction. From a pathophysiological and psychological standpoint, medical illness and panic disorder are highly correlated. There are two main theories that attempt to explain why patients are more likely to experience panic attacks. The first hypothesizes that susceptible patients lack the appropriate neurochemical mechanisms which would normally inhibit serotonin and this increased serotonin causes alterations in the fear network model of the autonomic nervous system. The second theorizes that a deficiency in endogenous opioids results in separation anxiety and increased awareness of suffocation.
