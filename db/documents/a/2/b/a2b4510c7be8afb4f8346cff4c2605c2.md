The nose is the most commonly injured facial structure. Most nasal injuries do not require immediate intervention, but trauma resulting in septal hematoma is an exception. A nasal septal hematoma is a rare but serious complication of nasal or facial trauma. It refers to the collection of blood under the mucoperichondrium or mucoperiosteum of nasal septal cartilage or bone. It may be unilateral or bilateral, with the latter being more frequent in the setting of severe trauma.

The key is to prevent the formation of an abscess which can eventually result in a saddle nose deformity or septal perforation, both of which are potentially permanent complications.
