Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) represents one of the most common congenital anomalies seen in major pediatric surgical centers. Infants with TEF classically present with respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, choking, and risk for aspiration. TEF is most commonly associated with other congenital anomalies, particularly cardiac defects. Esophageal atresia (EA) is a related congenital malformation with a similar presentation to TEF and can occur with or without the presence of a fistula.
