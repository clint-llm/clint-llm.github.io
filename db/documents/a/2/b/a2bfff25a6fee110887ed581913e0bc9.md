All types of medical providers may come across a patient with uneven pupils. It is important to know that while the condition can be benign, there are many serious pathologies associated with this eye finding. It is important to communicate this finding with other healthcare providers so that the appropriate intervention can take place.

There are multiple pathways involved in determining pupillary size and reactivity. Pupillary size may be influenced by systemic drug use or topical ophthalmics. Anisocoria also may be present in a cluster headache with lacrimation and rhinorrhea. Other rare forms of a headache also may invoke anisocoria. Additionally, some autonomic ganglion pathology may manifest as anisocoria. Also, there are reports of a variety of unusual causes involving a number of medicines as well as surgical procedures that usually occur on the face.

A referral to a neurologist and/or ophthalmologist is highly recommended in most cases of anisocoria in which the underlying etiology has not been identified. In cases of acute anisocoria with concern for a compressive third nerve palsy or Horner syndrome, the patient should be sent to the emergency department immediately for imaging.
