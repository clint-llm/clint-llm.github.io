Pneumonia is an umbrella term for a group of syndromes caused by a variety of organisms that result in infection of the lung parenchyma. Classification schemata have helped establish the common organisms responsible for each type of pneumonia and helped to formulate treatment guidelines for efficient management, in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Optimize interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by pneumonia.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the types of pneumonia.
