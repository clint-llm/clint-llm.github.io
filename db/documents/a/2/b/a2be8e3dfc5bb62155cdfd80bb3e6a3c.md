The National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the UK released guidelines for offering bariatric surgery. The guidelines in the US are also on similar lines. The indications must include all of the following:

- BMI >40 kg/m^2 or between 35 and 40 kg/m^2 with weight loss responsive disease

- All nonoperative measures haveÂ failed to maintain weight loss for >6 months

- Managed through a specialist obesity service

- Fit enough to survive anesthesia and surgery

- Commits to long term follow up

Assessing commitment to the follow-up process is difficult to assess preoperatively. Successful weight loss through medical management is not an established predictor of this.
