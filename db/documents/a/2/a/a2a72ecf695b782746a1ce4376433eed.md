Idiopathic Parkinson disease: It is characterized by bradykinesia, shuffling gait, postural instability, and resting pill-rolling tremor; this disease is most clinically similar to manganese toxicity.  Distinguishing differences between the two syndromes include less prominent tremors in manganism, the reversal of psychiatric symptom onset (later in Parkinson disease, earlier in manganism), the age of onset is typically younger in manganism as compared to Parkinson disease and clear occupational correlation with manganism.

Dementia with Lewy bodies: Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies develop a parkinsonian syndrome concomitant with many cognitive dysfunctions in the 5th to 6th decade of life. Early cognitive deficits include short term memory difficulties, multi-tasking deficits, and visuospatial deficiencies. These symptoms will develop alongside visual hallucinations and motor difficulties consistent with Parkinson disease. This disease process can be differentiated from both Parkinson disease and manganism by the presence of characteristic hallucinations and concurrent development of neuropsychiatric and motor dysfunction.

Frontotemporal dementia: This dementia is characterized by several different phenotypes, which include a behavioral/executive dysfunction type and two primary language deficiency types.  Clinical features of the behavioral subtype include disinhibition, apathy, compulsive behaviors, hyper-orality, and overall diminished executive function skills. Features of the language dysfunction variants include difficulties with daily life due to speech deficits, aphasia, speech apraxia, and other speech and comprehension impairments. This syndrome can easily be mistaken for manganism in its early stages if behavioral symptoms predominate, given manganism’s early neuropsychiatric manifestations. An adequate history-taking can differentiate these two syndromes.

Essential tremor: Essential tremor is a chronic, progressive neurologic disorder characterized by a high-frequency action tremor. This disorder can affect the neck, jaw, and other body regions alongside that of the arms and hands. Manganism will produce tremors early on in the disease process, typically after the development of psychiatric dysfunction. Differentiation of essential tremor from manganism involves elucidating occupational history, lack of family history, and identification of concomitant neuropsychiatric features in Mn toxicity.

Multiple system atrophy: As its name denotes, multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a complex disorder characterized by autonomic dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension, cerebellar dysfunction, parkinsonian symptoms unresponsive to L-dopa, and earlier age in onset (greater than 30 years old). This neurologic disease can be distinguished from manganism due to its multiple concomitant system dysfunction, autonomic dysfunction, and cerebellar findings.

Corticobasal degeneration: As the name denotes, this is a disease that affects predominantly the brain cortices and basal ganglia, resulting in apraxia, hemineglect symptoms, alterations in behavior and emotion, rigidity, bradykinesia, and myoclonus. This is another syndrome very similar in presentation to manganism; however, it can be differentiated based on history and chronicity in relation to exposure risk for Mn.

Progressive supranuclear palsy: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is an L-dopa responsive parkinsonian syndrome similar to corticobasilar degeneration. Features of this syndrome include vertical supranuclear palsy and parkinsonian symptoms. These syndromes can be differentiated from manganism by their responsiveness to L-dopa therapy.

Drug-induced Parkinsonism: The most common cause of parkinsonian symptoms, drug-induced parkinsonism, is an often under-appreciated disease process. Common precipitants include antipsychotic medications, anti-emetics, anti-motility agents, some rarely prescribed calcium channel blockers, and dopamine depleting medications. A clear and concise medication history can lead to the diagnosis in these cases.

Methcathinone, this substance is a psychoactive stimulant used recreationally. Case reports have suggested its chronic use is linked to the development of Mn toxicity, substantiated by the evidence of parkinsonian features and MRI correlate abnormalities in the basal ganglia. Drug use and medication history may lead to the discovery of this diagnosis.

Other neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington disease, repeated and chronic head trauma, several infections such as syphilis, HIV, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, structural brain disorders such as intraparenchymal masses or hydrocephalus, and metabolic disorders such as Wilson disease, hypoparathyroidism, chronic hepatic failure, and hemochromatosis.
