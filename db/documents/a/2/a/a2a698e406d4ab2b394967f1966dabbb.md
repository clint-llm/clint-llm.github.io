Burst fracture: Axial loading forces result in vertebral body fracture with a vertical fracture through the posterior elements. In Chance fracture, the fracture of the posterior elements is horizontal in orientation.

Compression fracture: Axial loading forces result in vertebral body fracture without the involvement of the posterior elements. Chance fracture includes a horizontal fracture through the posterior elements.

Distraction injury: Vertical distraction forces result in the distraction of two vertebral bodies, in contrast to horizontal fracture through the spinous process, pedicles, and vertebral body seen in Chance fracture.

Shear injury: Shearing forces result in listhesis of two vertebral bodies, in contrast to horizontal fracture through the spinous process, pedicles, and vertebral body seen in Chance fracture.
