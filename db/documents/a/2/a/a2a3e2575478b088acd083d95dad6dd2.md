**The dictum of management**in CNS lymphoma is:

- Prolonging remission

- Reducing refractory cases

- Increasing management strategies for recurrent PCNSL.

**The management strategies**should take into consideration:

- Physiological fitness

- Performance status

- Neurocognitive function

- Previous therapy and patterns of response, and

- Patient choice.

Management strategies during remission and consolidation phases include:

- Corticosteroids

- Chemotherapy, and

- Whole brain Radiotherapy (WBRT).

The mainstay of management and the most time-critical step is to reduce the diagnostic delay.

Complete surgical resection is not amenable due to its infiltrative nature, multifocality, and microscopic seedlings protected by the intact blood-brain barrier.****

The gold standard for diagnosis is a stereotactic biopsy.

Corticosteroids can lead to marked shrinkage or even the disappearance of such tumors. D/d- sarcoidosis or multiple sclerosis. Histopathological diagnosis is hindered by corticosteroid therapy (CST).

- Neurosarcoidosis

- Multiple sclerosis

- Glioblastoma, and

- Vasculitis.

There is an odds ratio of 3.3 for inconclusive biopsy after CST and therefore CST should not be administered before surgery.

High-dose Methotrexate (HD-MTX), a folate antagonist, is the backbone of multimodal chemotherapy.

Due to its high sensitivity to radiation, patients with newly diagnosed central nervous system lymphomas have traditionally received treatment with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). While the initial responses were high, early relapse, as well as radiation-associated neurotoxicity, was common among survivors.

Currently, the mainstay of treatment for individuals with CNS lymphoma is induction chemotherapy that aims for a complete radiographic response (CR), followed by consolidative therapy. The goal of consolidative therapy is to eradicate residual disease and improve overall survival.

In one study, cytarabine was added to HD-MTX for induction, followed by WBRT for consolidation, with the overall survival at 3 years 46% compared to 32% with HD-MTX monotherapy. In another, thiotepa and rituximab were added to HD-MTX during induction followed by WBRT for consolidation and overall survival was 69% vs. 42% with HD-MTX alone. When using HD-MTX along with procarbazine, vincristine, and rituximab for induction followed by cytarabine and reduced-dose consolidative radiotherapy, the overall survival rate at 3 years was 87% in patients who achieved a complete response (CR) to induction. Also, the median overall survival was not reached at 6 years.

Myeloablative therapy and autologous stem cell transplant are also options for consolidation. In one study, HD-MTX along with cytarabine, thiotepa, and rituximab for induction was followed by myeloablative therapy with high-dose carmustine and thiotepa with autologous stem cell transplant. The overall survival rate at 2 years was 87%. In a similar study, after an HD-MTX-based induction regimen, conditioning therapy was achieved with thiotepa, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide followed by a stem cell transplant. The overall survival rate at 2 years was 81%, and the progression-free survival rate was 79%. At 10 years, the overall survival rate in a similar study was 35%, suggesting that this might be an effective consolidative option, especially for younger patients.

Unfortunately, more than half of patients with CNS lymphoma experience a relapse, with an average survival of 2 months at that time.

For the treatment of intraocular lymphoma, one study recommended an HD-MTX and rituximab-based induction, followed by consolidation with cytarabine and etoposide. Intraocular lymphoma also responds well to binocular external beam radiation. Intravitreal rituximab and MTX remains effective option in unilateral disease. But, systemic chemotherapy is the recommendation if the disease is suspected elsewhere within the neuraxis.

Prophylaxis with HD-MTX can be considered for those patients with high-risk systemic non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma to prevent CNS dissemination. High-risk features in these patients include a high international prognostic index score and the presence of extranodal disease, particularly in the testes.

The outcome of the remission can be categorized into the:

- CR-complete response

- Cru-unconfirmed complete response

- PR-partial response

- SD-stable disease, and

- PD-progressive disease.

**Current recommendations for the Remission phase of management of PCNSL include:**

- **If the patient is physiologically fit for intensive therapy-**four cycles of MATRix (HD-MTX, cytarabine, thiotepa, rituximab) are recommended.

- **If unfit for HD-MTX**, options include:

- Regimen incorporating rituximab and an oral alkylating agent such as R-MP [rituximab, MTX, procarbazine]

- Oral chemotherapy (temozolomide)

- Whole-brain radiotherapy, and

- Corticosteroids (dexamethasone).

- Intrathecal chemotherapy is recommended for leptomeningeal disease unfit for systemic therapy.

**Consolidation therapy**is ideally commenced within 6–8 weeks of the first day of the final induction cycle.****Thiotepa/ carmustine with autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) has a 3- to 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of 70–81%.****High-dose thiotepa-based chemotherapy with ASCT as first-line consolidation should be considered for all eligible patients.

- Patients ineligible for HDT-ASCT, and

- Patients with residual disease after thiotepa-based ASCT.

Consolidation phase chemotherapy plus WBRT had no improvement in OS compared with chemotherapy alone during the treatment in the consolidation phase.

**Recommendations for follow-up**of the patients:

- At the completion of the therapy then every 3 months for the initial two years.

- Every 6 monthly for the next 3-5 years, and

- Then annually for a total of 10 years.

**Mandatory assessments during each follow-up**should encompass:

- Thorough medical history and clinical examination

- Cognitive evaluation

- Contrast CT/ MRI brain, and

- Ophthalmologic examination and lumbar puncture if indicated.

Relapsed PCNSL should undergo complete re-staging. Re-staging is not necessary for lesions refractory to first-line therapy.

In systemic non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, combination chemotherapy is substantially more effective than single-agent therapy.
