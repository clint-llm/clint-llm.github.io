Rarely a patient with findings of RARs and no increase in blast count in the marrow and a rare blast with an Auer rod may be found.  Depending on the level of blasts encountered, a patient may classify as RARS-2, which would portend a worse prognosis for the patient.  Correlation with the mutational status of SF3B1 is also important and been identified in these cases. The blast count will determine the overall prognosis of the patient in the end, the higher the count, the greater the propensity to develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
