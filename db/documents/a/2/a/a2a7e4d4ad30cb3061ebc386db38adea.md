Understanding the etiology of cognitive decline is challenging and involves a deeper understanding of how medical and non-medical factors interact. Age itself is a risk factor that constantly increases to the age of 80.

Patients belonging to lower socioeconomic status and with a lower educational background have a high risk of cognitive decline.

Some biomarkers linked withÂ progression to AD are apolipoprotein E4 genotype (ApoE4), positron emission tomography showing tau deposition in the lateral temporal lobe, and low plasma amyloid-beta levels.
