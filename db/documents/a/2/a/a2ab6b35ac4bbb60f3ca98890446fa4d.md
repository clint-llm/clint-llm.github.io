Hypotension and tachycardia suggest blood loss, hypovolemia, or sepsis and require prompt aggressive fluid resuscitation with adequate large bore IV access. Broad-spectrum antibiotics covering gram-negative enteric organisms should be administered in a timely fashion when infection, peritoneal soilage, or sepsis is in the differential. Sick patients should be monitored with ongoing vital sign resuscitation. Adequate pain relief with opioids is a standard of care. The use of anti-emetics is likewise important. If a surgical emergency is suspected based on presentation or physical findings, a surgeon should be consulted in an emergent fashion. The surgeon must be contacted before potentially time-consuming testing is performed.

In summary, the acute abdomen consists of several intrabdominal processes that require rapid intervention in both diagnosis and treatment. An acute abdomen may present in an obvious or subtle manner, but must always be recognized. Rapid, appropriate testing and concomitant resuscitative therapy are mandatory. If the condition is even possibly surgical, early consultation with a surgeon is mandatoryÂ as well.
