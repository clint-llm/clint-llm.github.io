Mesotheliomas represent a proliferative neoplasm made up of epithelial and mesenchymal cells of the mesothelium which make up part of the serosal covering and lining of various organ surfaces within the body. Mesotheliomas can be broadly divided into benign and malignant types. This activity will focus on the benign form, its pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the histopathophysiological features of a benign mesothelioma.
- Outline the presentation of benign mesothelioma.
- Summarize the treatment options for benign mesothelioma.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by benign mesothelioma.
