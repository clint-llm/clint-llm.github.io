Metachromatic leukodystrophy must be differentiated from other LSDs with similar presentation and with arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency. Arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency can be differentiated using gene mutation analysis or evaluation of radiolabeled sulfatide fibroblast uptake and accumulation. Other differentials that must be kept in mind while diagnosing metachromatic leukodystrophy are:

- **Krabbe diseases:**

- **X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy:**

- **Canavan disease:**ASPA on molecular genetic testing.

- **Peroxisomal biogenesis disorders (e.g. Zellweger disease):**PEX genes, PEX1 being the most common, leading to dysfunctional peroxisomes. Clinical symptoms may include intellectual delay, craniofacial dysmorphia, retinopathy (e.g. glaucoma, retinitis pigmentosa), visual blindness, sensorineural deafness, hypotonia, hepatomegaly with coagulopathy, diffuse jaundice, dysphagia, chondrodysplasia punctata, and seizures. MRI can show neocortical dysplasia, diffuse white matter atrophy, and ventriculomegaly with cysts. Elevated transaminases and hyperbilirubinemia are common.

- **Polyglucosan body disease:**GBE1.

- **Fucosidosis:******very rare, caused by FUCA1 mutation, characterized by coarse facies, recurrent opportunistic infections, generalized dystonia, spasticity, dysostosis multiplex, diffuse angiokeratoma, and organomegaly

- **Childhood-onset schizophrenia:**
