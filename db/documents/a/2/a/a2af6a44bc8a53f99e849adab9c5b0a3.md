**Pulmonary:**Treatment ofMycobacterium avium lung disease is successful in approximately 39% of patients with a 12% 5-year mortality rate. High levels of morbidity and mortality are seen in strains that exhibit macrolide resistance with a significantly higher 47% mortality rate at 5 years. Outcomes of pulmonary Mycobacterium abscessus infection are poor, with only around 41% of patients achieving sputum conversion with surgical and antibiotic intervention.Â Approximately 34% of patients achieve sputum conversion with antibiotics alone.

**Lymphadenitis:**Children with lymphadenitis caused byMycobacterium avium are cured in 95% of cases where both surgical excision and antibiotic therapy are used.

**Skin and Soft Tissue Infection:**Resolution of infection is achieved in the vast majority of patients withMycobacterium marinum, abscessus, ulcerans, fortuitum, and other skin and soft tissue infections when proper antibiotic and surgical treatments are utilized.
