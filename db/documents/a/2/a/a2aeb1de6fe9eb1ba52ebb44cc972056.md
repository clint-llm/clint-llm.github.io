Sarcopenia presents a great financial burden on the field of healthcare, as well as decreased quality of life in those who suffer from it. Clinicians who care for elderly patients must detect and treat sarcopenia early to reduce these burdens and improve the outcomes of the condition.

To achieve optimal outcomes in clinical practice, advancing interprofessional communication, pharmacological research, patient education, and patient adherence to recommendations is imperative. Currently, the most effective modalities available to fight sarcopenia are physical activity and nutrition optimization. To make the greatest use of this knowledge, clinicians, nutritionists, and physical therapists alike must work together as a team to improve outcomes. Additionally, further research is warranted to investigate pharmacological approaches to treat sarcopenia, as they are currently unavailable.
