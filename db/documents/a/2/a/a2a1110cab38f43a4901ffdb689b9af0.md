Data has indicated that milk thistle has great potential in reducing biochemical changes seen in patients with NAFLD, and multiple pharmacological studies have demonstrated why many consider the plant to be a hepatoprotective substance. Based on the data available today, many believe that milk thistle represents a viable alternative for patients with acute and chronic liver disease, especially those in whom standard therapy has failed. However, despite this current data, more evidence is needed to establish the short-term and long-term effects of milk thistle.

Healthcare workers, including physicians, nurse practitioners, nursing staff, and pharmacists, should be aware that currently, there is no firm clinical evidence to recommend the use of silybin or silymarin in the clinical setting.

At this time, using milk thistle is not consistent with the standard of care. There have been thousands of papers published on milk thistle to date, and the high publication volume suggests that interest among the research community remains high. Future research should continue to assess the mechanisms for preventing inflammatory sequelae and the cytoprotective effects of milk thistle, including silymarin and silybin. This research will allow for better recognition of cellular targets of milk thistle, leading to a more potent and selective compound that could prove clinically useful in treating a wide variety of liver pathology.
