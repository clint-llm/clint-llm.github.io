Treatment of echolalia depends on the etiology. The management of echolalia related to autism requires a multidisciplinary team, including parents, neurodevelopmental specialists, therapists, psychologists, and special educators. The key to managing echolalia in children is to know the reason for speech repetition, the meaning behind the repetition, and responding in a manner to help the child learn to communicate. Observing, listening, and waiting during the child’s interaction and talking helps gather messages behind the echolalic speech. While interpreting the child’s echolalia, the ideal response is to “say it exactly how the child would if he or she could.”

A speech-language pathologist plays a pivotal role in treating echolalia in childhood autism. Applied behavior analytic interventions for echolalia in ASD include cues-pause-point training, script training, visual cues, gestalt learning, verbal modeling, self-monitoring training, differential reinforcement of lower rates of behavior, and positive reinforcement for appropriate responses.

Pharmacotherapy may be indicated in older children, where the echolalia is triggered by stress and anxiety. Selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been used in echolalia secondary to stroke.
