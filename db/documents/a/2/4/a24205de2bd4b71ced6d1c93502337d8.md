The 2016 CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain specifically recommend incorporating strategies to mitigate risks, such as prescribing naloxone in patients with a history of substance use disorder, high risk and/or history of overdose, higher opioid dose (>50 morphine milligram equivalent daily dosing), patients at risk of returning to a high dose to which they are no longer tolerant (e.g., patients recently released from prison), or concurrent benzodiazepine use.

There has also been legislation passed providing legal protection to laypersons attending to a suspected opioid overdose and/or initiating early activation of the emergency response system. All interprofessional healthcare team members (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs) who prescribe opioids should be familiar with current guidelines for pain management; failure to do so may result in patient harm and loss of prescribing privileges for certain controlled substances. Nurses and pharmacists also have a role to play in these cases because they often are the first contact points for patients with the medical system. Pharmacists can see the patient's prescription history, and nursing staff can provide counsel and ask questions. Working as an interprofessional team is necessary when using opioid antagonist therapy to achieve optimal patient results and prevent adverse events, both from the antagonist medication as well as the opioid itself.
