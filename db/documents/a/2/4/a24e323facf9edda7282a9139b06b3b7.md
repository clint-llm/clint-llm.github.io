The external carotid artery gives off many branches to perfuse the head and face. The posterior auricular artery is one of the branches that come from the external carotid artery. The order and the location of the posterior auricular artery branch can vary. The posterior auricular artery can sometimes branch from the occipital artery instead of the external carotid artery. But for the majority of individuals, the posterior auricular artery consistently branches from the external carotid artery. The origin, length, and termination of the posterior auricular artery can vary greatly.
