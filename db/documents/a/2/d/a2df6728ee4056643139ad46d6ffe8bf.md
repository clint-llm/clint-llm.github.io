Since the arteries in the hand originate from the subclavian artery descending and dividing into the axillary artery and then the brachial artery then eventually become the radial and ulnar arteries, any damage to the arteries above will affect the hand arteries. Any injury to the arteries above the origin of the radial and ulnar arteries will compromise the blow flow to their branches and cause possible damage or necrosis to the distal structures in the hand.
