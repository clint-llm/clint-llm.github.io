- Diaphragm eventration refers to the elevation of a portion of the diaphragm

- The etiology is congenital or acquired

- Congenital: due to abnormal migration of myoblasts during development
- Acquired: due to phrenic nerve injury (usually trauma or thoracic surgery)
- Both lead to a thin and weakened diaphragm in the affected region

- Acquired causes are more common than congenital

- Most patients are asymptomatic and diagnosis is usually incidental

- Symptomatic patients may have respiratory distress, poor oral intake, and gastrointestinal symptoms

- Diagnosis is confirmed with radiographic imaging (chest X-ray, CT, ultrasonography, fluoroscopic sniff testing)

- Asymptomatic and mild cases are managed conservatively

- Severe cases are treated with surgical plication of the diaphragm
