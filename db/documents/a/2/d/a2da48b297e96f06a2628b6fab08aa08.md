The main purpose of scintimammography is to increase the positive predictive value of breast cancer detection with imaging to decrease the overall cost and improve the patient experience by minimizing the number of negative breast biopsies. Currently, scintimammography is not commonly used because of the prevalence of MRI for such examinations, as stated above. However, if additional research and discussion are performed to support its efficacy and use, it could be a valuable asset for the breast imaging world.
