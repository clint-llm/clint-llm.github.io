Divers who have suffered from decompression illness, especially those without any physiologic explanation are at higher risk of experiencing decompression illness again and possibly aggravating any pre-existing residual injury. The odds ratio of experiencing neurologic decompression sickness (DCS) has been reported to be as high asÂ 8.4 in divers who have suffered previously from DCS, depending on experience, large right to left shunt, and not modifying their diving practice.
