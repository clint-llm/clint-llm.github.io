Swimmer's shoulder is a term can represent numerous shoulder pathologies. These include impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tendinitis, labral injuries, ligamentous laxity or muscle imbalance causing instability, muscular dysfunction, and neuropathy from nerve entrapment. Interprofessional team members must be able to differentiate between these different etiologies. This activity describes the pathophysiology, etiology, presentation and management of swimmer's shoulder and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of swimmer's shoulder.
- Describe the presentation of swimmer's shoulder.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for swimmer's shoulder.
- Summarize how an optimally functioning interprofessional team would coordinate care to enhance outcomes for patients with swimmer's shoulder.
