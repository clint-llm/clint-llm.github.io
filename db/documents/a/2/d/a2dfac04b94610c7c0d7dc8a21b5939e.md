Pes cavus is seen in both adult and pediatric populations. When it is found to be bilateral, it is often from a hereditary or congenital source. A unilateral presentation is more typical for post-traumatic conditions.

- Neurologic conditions: hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies (HMSN), cerebral palsy, post-stroke symptoms, anterior horn disease, spinal cord lesions, poliomyelitis, myelomeningocele, polyneuritic syndromes, Parkinson disease, Huntington chorea, Friedreich ataxia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, leprosy, Roussy-Levy syndrome, Stumpell-Lorrain disease, Pierre-Marie heredotaxy

- Traumatic: compartment syndrome, talar neck malunion, peroneal nerve injury, knee dislocation, scar tissue, burns, vascular lesions, hindfoot instability, tibial fractures (distal), or calcaneal malunion

- Post-traumatic bone deformities or ligamentous imbalance or instability often lead to a deformity in this post-traumatic setting.

- Untreated or undertreated clubfoot

- Idiopathic or other causes include tarsal coalition, rheumatoid arthritis, ankle osteoarthritis, plantar fibromatosis, varus subtalar joint axis, diabetic foot syndrome. The subtle cavus foot is often categorized within the idiopathic group.
