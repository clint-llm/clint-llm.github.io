Because there are many causes of hyperuricemia, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that may include an internist, primary care provider, nurse practitioner, endocrinologist, urologist, rheumatologist, and oncologist. The majority of patients are asymptomatic and do not need medical therapy for hyperuricemia, as they will never develop gout or nephrolithiasis. The unnecessary cost of medication and the potential for adverse effects outweighs the benefit of starting medication. Urate-lowering medications in asymptomatic patients are only indicated in those undergoing cytolytic therapy for malignancy to prevent tumor lysis syndrome.

The outlook for benign causes of hyperuricemia is good, but those with malignancy may develop complications like gout or renal stones. The majority of these patients need close monitoring to determine if the condition is improving with treatment.
