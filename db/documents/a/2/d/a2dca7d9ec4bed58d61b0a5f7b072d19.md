Patients and caregivers should receive education about the medication, its use, adverse effects, signs of toxicity, and drug withdrawal. Compliance with medication can be extremely challenging, especially in PD, and once-daily prolonged release ropinirole greatly improves medication compliance. Additionally, the severity of the motor symptoms such as tremor and rigidity may also be an important factor to consider to improve the compliance and management of these patients.

RLS can be very challenging in its chronic state because of the disruption of sleep for both the patients and family members. Ropinirole has demonstrated an improvement in the quality of sleep, quality of life, and mood of patients with RLS.

When prescribing ropinirole, the pharmacist should consult and verify the appropriateness of therapy the optimal starting dose and check for potential drug-drug interactions. Nursing staff can monitor patient progress with the patient or caregivers, assess compliance, answer questions, and monitor for adverse events, reporting anything of concern to the clinician. These interprofessional team activities can optimize ropinirole therapy and drive better patient outcomes. [Level 5]
