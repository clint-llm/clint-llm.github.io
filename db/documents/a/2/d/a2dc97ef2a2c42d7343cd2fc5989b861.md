In patients with obstructive sleep apnoea, the lateral pharyngeal wall has been shown to collapse during the airflow as compared to patients without apnea. This collapse may exist because, during the expiratory-inspiratory transition, there may be a delay in the relaxation of the constrictor muscles. The lateral pharyngoplasty is a technique developed to act on these pathophysiological aspects of apnea. By myotomy of the superior constrictor muscles and suturing of the lateral pedicle flaps to the palatoglossus muscle, the lateral pharyngeal wall is reconstructed.

During the surgical procedure of zeta-pharyngoplasty, anterior mucosa gets removed, and splitting of the soft palate is done in the midline. For this, the palatoglossus muscle is cut and then the posterior palatal mucosa is sewed to the anteriorly resected margin.

**Role in Glossectomy:**During a surgical procedure for resecting tongue tumor, the area of resection is governed by the extent of tumor spread. The procedure of glossectomy can be divided into various categories based on the area of resection. Type IIIb glossectomy, also known as compartmental hemiglossectomy, includes the mucosa, submucosa, intrinsic muscles (transversalis, verticalis, inferior longitudinalis, and superior longitudinalis) and extrinsic muscles (genioglossus, hyoglossus, styloglossus and the inferior portion of the palatoglossus muscle) on the ipsilateral side of the lesion.
