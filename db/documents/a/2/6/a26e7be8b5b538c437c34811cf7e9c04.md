Complications with hip arthrography rarely occur, but with any procedure, there are risks. Hip arthrogram risks include septic arthritis, allergic reactions, bleeding, contrast reactions, and damage to surrounding structures. Reports have described complications related to the use of air with a double-contrast technique. One case report noted that a near-fatal air embolus occurred after air was injected into a hip joint during arthrography. The authors discouraged the use of air arthrography to confirm intra-articular needle placement.

Due to these reports, using air with a double-contrast technique is not recommended. It is imperative to properly expulse any air from the intravenous tubing and syringe before contrast injection into the hip joint.
