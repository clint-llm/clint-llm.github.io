There continues to be debate over the need and timing of surgical pulmonary valve replacement in cases of repaired tetralogy of Fallot. In the absence of pulmonary valve repair, patients with pulmonary regurgitation will develop RV dilation, RV systolic dysfunction, left ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. It has been found that the risk of arrhythmias is greater in cases where biventricular dysfunction has set in.

Favorable outcomes following repair include a reduction in RV volume, improvement in RV systolic function noticed during the first postoperative year, improved exercise tolerance, reduction in risk of arrhythmias, improvement in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class for patients initially graded NYHA class I and II.
