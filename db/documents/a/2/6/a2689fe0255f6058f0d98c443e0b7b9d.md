Similar to other peripheral IV catheterization, the indications for scalp vein catheterization include the sampling of blood for laboratory analysis and direct access to the circulatory system to infuse intravenous fluids, blood products, and/or medications. Generally, extremities will be the first sites to explore for peripheral intravenous catheterization. In patients without limbs (i.e., phocomelia) or inability to successfully obtain peripheral IV access in the arms or legs, scalp veins are another option for obtaining IV access.

Peripheral vein catheterization is generally used for short periods of time (72 hours or less) before necessitating relocation or discontinuation due to expectedÂ degradation with use. Whether in the extremities or the scalp veins, these access sites are useful for short term access; in the scalp, generally smaller caliber catheters are ideal.
