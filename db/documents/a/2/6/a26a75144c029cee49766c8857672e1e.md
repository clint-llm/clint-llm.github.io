Diverticulosis of the colon is common in western countries and increases with age. Over 50% of individuals over the age of sixty have diverticulosis, and the incidence rises to 70% after eighty years of age.

Multiple environmental risk factors have been postulated in the development of diverticular disease; however, many remain controversial. A 1970Â study hypothesized that a diet high in fiber was protective against diverticular disease, but the evidence is conflicting.

In the past, patients with diverticular disease were discouraged from eating nuts, seeds, and popcorn, but a recent study determined that these foods do not increase the risk of developing diverticulitis.

There are also postulates regarding protective factors. Vigorous exercise, such as running, has shown a risk reduction of developing complicated diverticulitis by 25%. Light activity, such as walking, is less effective.
