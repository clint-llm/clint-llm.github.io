The differentiation of various hypopigmented conditions is not always possible solely based on the clinical findings of the lesion. A detailed history of the patient, including personal, occupational, and family history, gives a clue about the etiology and severity (inherited/ acquired, benign/malignant) of the condition. The patients, at times, may have extracutaneous signs and symptoms, and a complete physical examination from head to toe is vital to make the right diagnosis. The following questionnaire and examination findings may be useful to evaluate the patients with hypopigmentation macules.

1. Is the skin lesion present since birth or acquired?

2. If acquired, is it sudden or gradual in onset?

3. Any history of prior inflammation, or exposure to chemical substances?

4. Is the hypopigmentation localized or diffuse?

5. Location of the lesions - which areas are predominantly affected? (sun-exposed areas, or body-folds like axilla, or under the breast)

6. Characters of lesion - this includes:

- Size of the lesions

- Margins-well circumscribed or ill-defined

- Appearance- scaly/non-scaly

- Pattern of distribution

- Unilateral or bilateral

- Stable or progressive

- Any coalesce of lesions

- Any changes in color

- Any history of pruritus or signs of excoriation

- Any history of prior inflammation, or exposure to chemical substances?

- Any change in the characteristics of lesions due to weather conditions?

- Surrounding skin characteristics
