Lactic acidosis is among the most common concerns for those caring for critically ill patients. However, clinical studies of this problem have been somewhat sparse, with most studies being retrospective, or prospective with small sample sizes.

Jung and colleagues conducted a multi-center, prospective analysis in 2011.

Jung et al. found that severe lactic acidosis occurred in 6% of the studied population of 2550 patients. Eighty-three percent of those patients were treated with vasopressors, and mortality was 57% in this group with a pH of 7.09 (plus or minus 0.11) and high lactic acid values. The severity of lactatemiaÂ and the time for the lactic acidosis to correct were linked to survival. The higher the level and the longer the time for normalization, the greater the mortality.

Shock and severe lactic acidosis (pH less than 7.2) are often comorbid, and this carries a mortality rate of about 50%. No survival has been reported for severe lactic acidosis with shock when the pH had fallen under 7.0. Interestingly, this contrasts to lactic acidosis associated with non-shock states, as in metformin-induced lactic acidosis producing pH values of 7.0 where observed mortality was only 25%.
