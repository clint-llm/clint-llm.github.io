Pancreatic ascites is a somewhat rare entity. It results from persistent leakage of pancreatic secretions in the peritoneum from pancreatic duct injury. The severity of this condition varies widely, often depending on the location and degree of ductal injury and infection in the fluid. While mild cases of pancreatic ascites resolve spontaneously, persistent pancreatic ascites and infection are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The mainstay of treatment is diverting pancreatic fluid away from the leakage to the small bowel with a pancreatic stent, allowing the leak to heal. Adjunct treatment includes medical therapy to decrease pancreatic exocrine secretions and salvage treatment with surgery. However, due to the low incidence of this condition, comparative studies with different treatment approaches are not available.
