Exposure can come from environmental means, including soil, volcanic dust, industrial pollution, food, and water. Household water can contain nickel from pipe corrosion. Nickel is not an essential element but is found in various foods. Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, oral intake ranges from 100 to 300 mcg daily. Daily oral nickel consumption is about 20 mcg, and inhalation includes 0.4 mcg.

Absorption occurs through the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. Not all inhaled nickel is systemically absorbed; it can be coughed out or remain in the respiratory tract, as the solubility depends on the nickel compound. Nickel carbonyl is highly soluble and readily absorbed. Nickel salts have lower absorption and can remain in the GI tract. Their absorption is also slowed with the presence of food in the stomach.

Dermal absorption is dependent on potency and skin integrity.

Nickel in the blood is primarily bound to albumin, with the presence of the transport protein nickeloplasmin. The distribution of nickel in the body varies depending on the route of exposure. Following exposure to nickel carbonyl, the highest concentrations of nickel are typically found in the lung, brain, kidney, liver, and adrenal glands. This distribution pattern highlights the affinity of nickel for certain organs and tissues and emphasizes the potential health risks associated with exposure to nickel compounds.

Nickel is not known to exhibit cumulative toxicity, meaning it does not tend to accumulate in the body over time. Instead, it undergoes elimination primarily through urine and feces. The elimination of nickel follows first-order kinetics, which means that the rate of elimination is proportional to the concentration of nickel in the body.

Multiple mechanisms have been investigated to explain the toxic effects of nickel on the human body. Research has been performed on humans and through experimental means to show the optimal amount of essential nickel to the point of toxicity. Inhalational and absorbed nickel appears to form a complex with thiol. A reaction occurs between this complex and oxygen, producing free radicals.

These reactions, which create reactive oxygen species, ultimately can lead to intracellular hypoxia and activates alternate specific gene expression.
