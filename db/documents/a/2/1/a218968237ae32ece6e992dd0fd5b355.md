The most important aspect of preparation for any cosmetic procedure is patient counseling and expectation management. Treatment, surgical or otherwise, should not begin until the surgeon or other healthcare provider feels that the patient's goals and expectations are consistent with anticipated outcomes. Additionally, surgical patients should ideally temporarily discontinue anticoagulant therapy and quit smoking, if applicable.

Facial and great auricular nerve function should be evaluated and documented prior to rhytidectomy. Having preoperative photographs of the patient posted in the operating room for reference during the case is also helpful. The patient's jowls and platysmal bands should be marked while the patient is sitting upright, and the nurse performing the surgical scrub should avoid smearing or removing the marks.

Regardless of whether the plan is for general anesthesia or not, injection of local anesthetic or tumescent solution will help to lower the analgesic requirement and aid hemostasis. Intravenous steroids will decrease edema and nausea in the immediate postoperative period, facilitating the patient's discharge home.
