Prognosis depends on the particular type of shunt. Noncyanotic shunts carry remarkably better prognosisÂ over cyanotic shunts. Small lesions can often close spontaneously or could remain asymptomatic for life. Large lesions need closure to avoid complications. Once severe pulmonary hypertension has developed, the prognosis worsens, and heart-lung transplantation is often warranted, which is not widely available. Severe cyanotic lesions present soon after the birth, and often there is no chance of survival without timely surgical intervention.
