Symptom onset depends on the etiology, with traumatic or surgical causesÂ presenting earlier compared to the other etiologies.

Typically, patients present with dyspnea due to pleural effusion. Chronically leaking chyle also results in malnourishment and susceptibility to infections, which is seen in non-traumatic causes (e.g., malignancy). However, in surgical and traumatic causes, the symptom onset may be immediate if the volume is more than 500 ml/day.

Examination reveals decreased breath sounds and also dullness to percussion in areas of lymph collection.
