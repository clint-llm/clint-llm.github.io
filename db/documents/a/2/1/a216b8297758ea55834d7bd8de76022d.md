The most significant component of the assessment for a patient who presents with signs and symptoms of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia is a history and physical exam. These should include vital signs (respiratory rate, blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate) and an electrocardiogram. A patient presenting with AVNRT should undergo evaluation for any unknown underlying coronary artery disease or heart failure. During an assessment, the clinician should establish whether the patient is hemodynamically stable based mainly on his blood pressure, mental status, and respiratory rate. Initial evaluation of patients with AVNRT can include testing to access the patient's thyroid and pulmonary function, together with routine blood work and echocardiography.
