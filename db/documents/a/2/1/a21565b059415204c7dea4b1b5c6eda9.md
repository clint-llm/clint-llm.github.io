Exenatide is FDA-indicated to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when used as an adjunct to diet and exercise; although, it is not recommended as a first-line therapy to treat diabetes. Clinical trials have shown that exenatide can be safe as either monotherapy or in combination with metformin. Clinical trials have also demonstrated exenatide's ability to lower HbA1c and postprandial blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Exenatide received approval in 2005, after evaluation for its safety and efficacy. All studies included patients treated with either diet, exercise, metformin, sulfonylureas, or a combination of these agents. Research has shown that weekly administration of exenatide results in more significant reductions in both plasma glucose and HbA1c than twice-daily administration.

As of 2018, the American Diabetes Association suggests adding GLP-1 receptor agonists if appropriate fasting glucose levels are attainable using a titration of basal insulin.

Following the experience with Rosiglitazone and its impact on cardiovascular risk, the FDA focused heavily on requiring drug manufacturers to conduct either meta-analyses or post-marketing trials to prove the cardiovascular safety of all new diabetic medications. Such studies involving exenatide have shown to have similar cardiovascular protection when compared to the placebo. These studies have also demonstrated the added benefits of exenatide,Â including weight loss, reduction in systolic blood pressure, and slight reductions in cholesterol levels.
