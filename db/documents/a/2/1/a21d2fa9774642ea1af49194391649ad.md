Physiologic variants of the bony pelvis exist between males and females. The male pelvis is typically thicker and heavier than the lighter and thinner pelvis of the female. Males also tend to have a narrower pelvic opening than females.

Most physiological differences lie in variations of the pelvic girdle. There are four types classically described:

- The gynaecoid pelvis displays an oval shape with a wide transverse diameter. This variant is the most common type and provides adequate cavity space for a female to give birth.

- The android displays a heart-shaped inlet and is most common in males.

- The platypelloid type displays a wide inlet transversely but is short in the anterior-posterior axis. This type provides challenges for a female to give birth and is found among approximately 20% of women.

- The anthropoid type is characterized by a wide anterior-posterior axis but is short in the transverse axis and is found in around 15% of women.
