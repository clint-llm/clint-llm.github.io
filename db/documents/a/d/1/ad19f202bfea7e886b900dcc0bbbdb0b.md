A thorough history should be obtained from the patient, focusing on cognitive and functional deficits, onset, and symptomatic progression. Interviewing family members and caregivers is important as patients with cognitive decline rarely have insight into their cognitive and functional limitations. Caregivers may report an abrupt or stepwise onset of cognitive decline, or the appearance of symptoms may be subtle without connection to an ischemic event. The functional assessment should evaluate for impairments in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), such as cooking, driving, and financial and medication management, and basic activities of daily living (ADLs), such as dressing, bathing, and toileting. Additionally, the patient's past medical history, current medications, and surgical history should be obtained. Regarding physical examination, one should assess patients for focal neurologic deficits.
