With the continued growth and development of the telencephalic vesicles, a vascular system develops from the rostral division of the internal cerebral artery. This vascular channel later gives origins to all the lenticulostriate vessels, including the recurrent artery of Heubner, and then also forms the adult middle cerebral artery (MCA). This embryological origin accounts for the formation of rete communication among branches of the recurrent artery of Heubner and the lenticulostriate branches from the ACA and the MCA.
