As the clinical manifestations of annular pancreasÂ exhibit a bimodal age distribution presenting either early during infancy or adulthood, the differential diagnosis of this anomaly is also based on the age of presentation. Infants commonly present with duodenal obstruction with the classic "double bubble sign" on imaging, and the differential diagnosis can be classified into either intrinsic or extrinsic causes.

Besides AP, the other notable extrinsic causes that need to be considered are malrotation of the gut or midgut volvulus. Peptic ulcer disease, pancreatic divisum, primary duodenal and pancreatic malignancies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an adult patient suspected to have AP.
