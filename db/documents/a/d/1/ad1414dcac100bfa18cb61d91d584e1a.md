Depression, in general, has a substantial impact on both morbidity and mortality and a common cause of global disease burden and disability worldwide. Persistent depressive disorder represents a disorder of chronic depression, and outcomes and prognosis are similar if not worse than those of major depressive disorder depending on whether or not the disorder represents dysthymia or chronic major depression. Outcomes of a 10-year study suggest that persistent depressive disorder is independently associated with greater severity of depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms in comparison to major depressive disorder.
