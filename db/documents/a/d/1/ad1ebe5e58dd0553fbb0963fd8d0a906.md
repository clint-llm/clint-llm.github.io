Glycol ether (GE) toxicity complications primarily affect the neurologic and renal systems. Evidence of seizures, cranial palsies, and structural changes in the brain have been documented.

Clinical case reports and studies of epidemics, such as the Panama mass poisoning incident, indicate that patients may experience axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, cranial nerve neuropathies, and demyelination. Some complications may occur in the acute to subacute stages, while others may develop months after the initial presentation in patients who survive the acute poisoning. However, limited long-term longitudinal studies are available to follow up on these patients.

Electrolyte imbalances, pancreatitis, and acidemia are expected acute complications likely related to renal failure, encephalopathy, and peripheral neuropathies. In addition, a few isolated case reports suggest that significant acute GE ingestion can cause pulmonary edema.

In patients who survive GE toxicity, the long-term complications can vary widely. For example, mild kidney injury may resolve, but those who require hemodialysis generally remain dialysis-dependent.

Oxidative stress caused by GE metabolites can result in liver damage, although the long-term hepatic effects have not been studied. No evidence suggests that GE toxicity increases the risk of malignancy. A few studies on GE exposure and the risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia have not shown statistically significant results.
