According to the manufacturer's prescribing information, an overdose of ephedrine can cause a rapid rise in blood pressure. In the case of an overdose, careful blood pressure monitoring is recommended. If blood pressure rises to an unacceptable level, parenteral antihypertensive agents can be administered at the clinician's discretion.

Signs and Symptoms: The principal manifestation of ephedrine poisoning is hypertension and convulsions. A case report of cardiomyopathy and spinal artery vasospasm leading to quadriplegia has been noted.

Treatment: If respirations are shallow or cyanosis is present, secure the airway and provide mechanical ventilation.

Antidote: For hypertension, 5 mg phentolamine mesylate diluted in saline may be administered slowly intravenously, or clinicians may give 100 mg orally. Convulsions may be controlled by benzodiazepines.
