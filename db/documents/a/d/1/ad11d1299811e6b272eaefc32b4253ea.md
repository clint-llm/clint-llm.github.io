Malingering is associated with an anti-social personality disorder and histrionic personality trait. To get an external (secondary) gain, the individual fakes an illness that can be of physical or psychologicalÂ nature. The patient consciously lies about his or her condition to get a benefit, and upon achieving the benefit, they stop complaining. No medicine or intervention can cure malingerers. Upon detailed history, the malingerer may exhaust their excuses and give up.

DSM-5 states that if any combination of the following 4 complains is present in a patient, then malingering should be considered.

- The medicolegal context of the presentation, for example, a lawyer sending his client for evaluation or patient presents with an illness while facing trial

- Marked discrepancy between the individual's "claimed stress or disability" and "objective finding and observation"

- Lack of compliance with diagnostic evaluation, treatment regimen and follow up care

- Presence of anti-social personality disorder
