The presentation of endotheliitis fugax hereditaria can vary, though characteristically, patients will complain of an incapacitating painful red eye with decreased visual acuity, which may begin with a foreign body sensation or stiff neck before quickly progressing. There may be associated lacrimation and congestion of the ipsilateral nostril with a watery discharge that occurs in about 50% of patients. The symptoms are typically unilateral, but bilateral or sequentially unilateral (i.e., one eye develops symptoms immediately after the initial flare resolves in the opposing eye) cases are not uncommon.

The disease typically presents around age ten to eleven (although there are reports that it develops as early as three years of age and as late as twenty-eight), and the possibility of an initial attack merits strong consideration in younger children with a positive family history. In older individuals, a history of similar events that occur between one and six times a year may be present, though reports exist of spontaneous mutations. As the disease is genetically linked, family history is an essential aspect of making a correct diagnosis. Complete hereditary history will likely show the disease inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, although spontaneous mutations apparently can occur.

On slit-lamp examination in the acute phase, conjunctival injection and corneal edema will likely be present. An opacity in the central stroma, with or without keratic precipitates on the posterior surface of the cornea, is a common aspect of the disease and may be seen.

However, If the patient presents following the initial acute phase (i.e., two to four days following the onset of symptoms), the only visible sequela of the disease still likely to be present is the stromal opacification or posterior precipitates.
