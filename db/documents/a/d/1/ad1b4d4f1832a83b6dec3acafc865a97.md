The recommended treatment for anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is based onÂ surgery when feasible and chemoradiation either concurrently or sequentially.

**Surgery**

Debulking surgery is the most common procedure in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. It consists of removing any gross tumor that is potentially threatening the airway with the aim of preserving the larynx. However, a tracheostomy may be necessary in cases of airway compromise. While complete excision is often impossible due to the local extension of the disease, the quality of resection is a significant prognostic factor for survival.

**Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy**

External-beam irradiation is effective in improving local control. For patients with locally advanced unresectable disease, definitive radiation therapy and chemotherapy are the recommendations.

Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is usually not responsive to I131 therapy. Radioiodine is only a recommendation upon identification of a differentiated iodine-positive component.
