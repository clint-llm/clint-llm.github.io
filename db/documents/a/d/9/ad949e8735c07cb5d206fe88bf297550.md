The differential diagnosis for recurrent variable decelerations includes:

- Intrauterine umbilical cord compression

- Maternal/fetal positioning
- Low fluid or oligohydramnios
- Nuchal cord or other cord entanglements
- True knot or short umbilical cord
- Uterine tachysystole
- Pushing efforts during the second stage of labor

- Increasing fetal acidemia

- Umbilical cord prolapse

- Uterine rupture

The possibility exists that other fetal heart rate decelerations may be confused for variable decelerations. While the definitions for each type of deceleration are clear, there is poor intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility in fetal heart tracing interpretation.

**Early Deceleration**

- Visually apparent gradual decrease and return of the fetal heart rate associated with a uterine contraction.

- Time from onset to nadir is 30 seconds or more.

- The nadir occurs at the same time as the peak of the contraction.

- This is usually considered a benign result of fetal head compression.

**Late Deceleration**

- Visually apparent gradual decrease and return of the fetal heart rate associated with a uterine contraction.

- Time from onset to nadir is 30 seconds or more.

- The nadir comes after the peak of the contraction.

- This is usually considered a worrisome indication of uteroplacental insufficiency.
