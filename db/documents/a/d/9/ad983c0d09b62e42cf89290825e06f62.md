- Patients with asymptomatic sinus bradycardia

- Patients with infrequent Atrial premature contractions or Ventricular premature contractions

- Patients with presyncope and no other evidence of cardiac disease

- Evaluation of left ventricle function for Pre-operative screening in patients without symptoms or signs of cardiac disease

- Routine follow-up of patients as surveillance (<1 year) for diagnosed pulmonary artery hypertension patients without a change in symptoms or physical examination

- Routine follow-up of patients as surveillance in patients with a previous history of pulmonary embolism with normal right ventricular function and pulmonary artery systolic pressure

**Absolute Contraindications Of Transesophageal Echocardiography**

- History of esophageal stricture, perforation, tumor, laceration, and diverticulum

- History of upper gastrointestinal bleeding

- Severe atlantoaxial joint disorder

- Conditions that prevent neck flexion

**Inappropriate Transesophageal Echocardiography Indications**

- Routine use of transesophageal echocardiography in patients in whom decision regarding diagnosis and management already resolved by transthoracic echocardiography

- To diagnose infective endocarditis in patients with low pretest probability.

- To rule out cardiovascular source as embolus in patients with an obvious cardiac cause.

- Patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in whom the decision to anticoagulant already made

**Conditions In Which Stress Echocardiography Are Inappropriate**

-  Patients with definite acute coronary syndrome
