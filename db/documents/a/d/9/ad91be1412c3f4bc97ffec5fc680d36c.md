In general, the prognosis of ocular hypotony depends on the impact of the hypotony on the eye and the etiology of the ocular hypotony. Hypotonic eyes are apt to undergo various changes that will affect the media's clarity, including the formation of cataracts and cornea opacity.

Astigmatism can occur from the effect of adjacent extraocular muscles and adnexa on the soft eyeball and non-resistant sclera. Posterior segment findings, including ciliochoroidal detachment and hypotonic maculopathy, can also profoundly impact vision.

The etiology of the ocular hypotony can directly affect the visual prognosis, such as the direct effect of trauma, ocular ischemia, and advanced PVR. Also, the duration of the hypotony is another prognostic factor. Chronic hypotony may be associated with more permanent changes and may fall within the constellation of phthisis bulbi. However, several authors have shown a reversal of the effect of ocular hypotony after successful treatment, including bleb revision.
