Before discussing the indications for neck dissection and the operative technique, it is essential to review the brief background, history, and types of neck dissection. The credit for neck dissection as a curative procedure for cervical metastases belongs to George Washington Crile from the Cleveland Clinic.Transactions of the Southern Surgical and Gynecological Association. This operation is the basis of all neck dissections, with subsequent surgeries framed as modifications of this initial operation. Hayes Martin from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, who described the stepwise procedure of RND in his classic article in 1951, popularized this operation. However, this operative procedure is not without significant morbidity, as it results in a cosmetic deformity and dysfunction of shoulder movement due to en bloc resection of the accessory nerve, sternocleidomastoid muscle, internal jugular vein, and the tail of the parotid gland. Argentinian surgeon Oswaldo Suarez was the first to describe functional neck dissection in 1963, now called modified radical neck dissection (MRND). He described the removal of all five lymph node levels in the neck while preserving the spinal accessory nerve, sternocleidomastoid muscle, and internal jugular vein to limit any functional disability in the shoulder.

1. Radical neck dissection (RND): Lymph nodes from level I-V, ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM), internal jugular vein (IJV), and spinal accessory nerve (SAN) undergo removal (the parotid tail is rarely included in modern RND). RND is indicated when there is bulky nodal disease in the neck with extensive soft tissue involvement due to extra-capsular spread.

2. Modified radical neck dissection type I (MRND-I): Lymph nodes from level I-V, ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle, and internal jugular vein are removed, with preservation of the spinal accessory nerve. Indications for MRND-I is in bulky nodal disease with extracapsular spread involving the SCM and IJ, where the accessory nerve is free of disease.

3. Modified radical neck dissection type II (MRND-II): Removal of lymph nodes from level I-V and ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle, with preservation of IJV and accessory nerve. Indications for MRND-II include bulky nodal disease with SCM involvement but sparing the IJ or accessory nerve.

4. Modified radical neck dissection type III (MRND-III): Lymph nodes from level I-V undergo removal, with preservation of SCM, IJV, and SCM. MRND-III is indicated in metastatic disease with limited extracapsular spread and the IJ, SCM, and accessory nerve can all be dissected free.

Indications:

1. Supraomohyoid neck dissection (SOHD): Lymph nodes removed are Levels I–II, with sparing of IJV, SCM, and accessory nerve. SOHD is indicated in the N0 neck for primary SCC or malignant melanoma where the primary site is anterior to the ear or is located in the lower eyelid (but should include parotidectomy for face and forehead/anterior scalp).

2. Selective neck dissection (SND): Removal of lymph nodes in levels Ib–IV, with sparing of IJV, SCM, and SAN. The procedure is indicated in N0 neck for SCC of the lateral tongue, oral cavity, anterior floor of mouth, or for N1 disease in these primary sites.

3. Lateral neck dissection (also technically a selective neck dissection): Removal of lymph nodes from levels II-IV with sparing of IJV, SCM, and accessory nerve. Indications for this procedure are any N-stage neck without significant extracapsular spread for SCC of larynx and hypopharynx, for differentiated thyroid carcinoma, or for melanoma with a positive sentinel lymph node that drains to these nodal basins. Certain primary parotid malignancies also warrant this operation.

4. Postero-lateral neck dissection: Removal of levels II–V, suboccipital, retro-auricular nodes with sparing of IJV, SCM, and SAN. Indications for this procedure are any N-stage neck cutaneous melanoma with high-risk features or melanoma with a positive sentinel node where the primary site is posterior to the ear.

5. Modified radical neck dissection: As described above. This procedure has an indication for thyroid cancer and upper aerodigestive carcinomas with positive lateral neck nodes but limited extracapsular spread.
