The structure, function, and dysfunction of the BBB are of significant importance in the discussion of CNS disorders and associated therapeutics. Very few drugs are successful in treating CNS diseases, with the therapeutic efficacy significantly limited by two significant challenges, the first being ineffective transportation of drugs across the BBB. The efficiency of drug transportation across the BBB dramatically depends on the properties of molecular size, hydrophilicity, and degree of dissociation. Currently, it is known that most small-molecule drugs and almost all macromolecular drugs, such as recombinant proteins, therapeutic antibodies, and nucleic acids, cannot cross the BBB. Therefore, developing a drug delivery system that can effectively transport therapeutic agents into the CNS is crucial in the future treatment of CNS diseases.

The second challenge the BBB poses, which limits therapeutic efficacy, is that diseases causing focal BBB breakdown lead to perivascular accumulation of blood-derived toxic products and macromolecules, inflammatory responses, vascular regression, and local reductions of CBF. These focal vascular changes limit the CNS distribution of neurotherapeutics in disease-affected regions by disrupting diffusional transport across brain endothelial cells, blocking normal interstitial flow dynamics, or both.
