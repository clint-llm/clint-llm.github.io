In healthy T cells, TCL1 is expressed in CD4-/CD8- cells but not in cells at later stages of differentiation. The TCL1 gene rearrangements on chromosome 14 are the most common genomic alterations; they increase the expression of the gene. The overexpression of the TCL1 gene and its protein in humans has been involved in the development of T-PLL by serving as a co-activator of the cell survival kinase AKT.

The most frequent chromosome 14 alterations involve inv(14)(q11;q32) in 80% of patients and involve the TCL1a and 1b, t(14;14)(q11;q32) in 10% of cases; they also involve TCL1a/1b and t(X;14)(q28;q11) which involves MTCP1 (Mature T-Cell Proliferation 1). Fluorescence in situ hybridizationÂ (FISH) is often used to diagnose rearrangements of the T-cell receptor locus (TCL1).

TCL1 and MTCP1 (rare) alterations play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of T-PLL by enhancing cell proliferation and survival. TCL1 and MTCP1 alterations lead to activation of protein kinase B (Akt), impairment of protein kinase C (PKC) theta, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. Their alterations are necessary initiating events but are not sufficient to drive leukemogenesis in T-PLL.
