In evaluating dyspnea, a thorough history and physical exam are warranted, with special attention to underlying and possibly reversible causes. Additional laboratory and radiologic evaluation can be useful in diagnosing and in guiding treatment. Pulse oximetry can provide information about oxygen saturation. Arterial blood gases can reveal the presence of acid-base disturbances, hypoxia, or abnormal partial pressures of carbon dioxide. Hemoglobin count can identify anemia.Â  An abnormally high or low leukocyte count or an abnormal leukocyte differential may be suggestive of an infection.

Radiographic imaging, with such modalities as x-ray and computed tomography, can provide a great deal of information regarding the lung parenchyma, pleural space, pulmonary vasculature, and larger airway structures, as well as the bony elements of the thorax. Combined, the laboratory and radiographic information may help identify an underlying etiology of the dyspnea and, as such, can help guide disease-modifying and symptomatic treatment. However, as dyspnea is a subjective, multifactorial symptom, it may occur in the absence of any identifiable laboratory or radiographic abnormalities.
