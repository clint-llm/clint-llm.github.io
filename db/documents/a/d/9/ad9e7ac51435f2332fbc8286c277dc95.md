GUTB, as with other cases of TB, is usually caused by infection with M. tuberculosis. However, other species of mycobacteria in the MTB complex, including Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium pinnipedii, Mycobacterium microti, Mycobacterium caprae, and the TB vaccine bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), can rarely cause disease.
