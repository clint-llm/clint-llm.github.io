The prognosis of bladder stones is generally good if the stones are treated appropriately. Treatment of the stones depends on the cause of the bladder stones. Small bladder stones may pass out easily but the large one can lodge at the bladder neck and stop the flow of urine. Untreated cases can lead to damage to the urinary tract, recurrent stone formation, or infection.
