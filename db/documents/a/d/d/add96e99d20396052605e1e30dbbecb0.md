Plastic surgeons most commonly undertake the fasciocutaneous flap. Currently, with the advent of "orthoplastic" surgery, some orthopedic trauma surgeons can perform these flaps.

The surgery can be performed by one provider with one surgical assistant, primarily to helpÂ manage intraoperative bleeding, cut suture, and place a postoperative dressing. A scrub nurse and a theatre runner are also essential members of the team.
