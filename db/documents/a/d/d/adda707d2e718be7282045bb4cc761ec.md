The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advocates for screening pregnant women and women with STI risk factors for N. gonorrhoeae infection. STI risk factors include prior STI diagnoses, non-Latino African American ethnicity, young age, sparse condom use, and multitudinous sexual partners.

An interprofessional team of clinicians, epidemiologists, infectious disease specialists, community health nurses, and pharmacists (preferably with infectious disease specialization) can improve patient outcomes. Patients need to be taught preventative measures, and management of recent sex partners (i.e., < 60 days) is also a crucial element in preventing community spread. Nurses and mental health professionals are key players in this type of counseling. Pharmacists will be able to verify dosing and should have knowledge of the latest antimicrobial resistance data and can share that with the clinical staff, in addition to performing medication reconciliation. All interprofessional team members should keep accurate and updated records; these are crucial in the event of drug-resistant infections. The interprofessional approach will help drive the best outcomes with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]
