The proper use of technetium 99m sestamibi requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that includes a nurse, pharmacist, and a number of physicians in different specialties. Although improper usage of sestamibi in itself is not very dangerous, adverse clinical outcomes manifest secondary to missed diagnoses leading to insufficient medical management. With proper utilization, myocardial perfusion defects can be accurately identified, thus reducing the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular events. Patients who present with chest pain need rapid diagnostic stratification to rule out myocardial infarction. In the outpatient setting, a nurse can inject the radiotracer in a patient presenting with chest pain to be later imaged by the cardiologist. The prognostic information derived from the proper utilization of sestamibi includes predicting clinical outcomes in the outpatient setting and determining stress parameters for very long-term outcomes in patients with limited exercise capacity.

The American College of Radiology rated myocardial perfusion imaging with an appropriateness criteria score of eight on the nine-point scale for the setting of intermediate and or high probability of myocardial infarction.
