Mirizzi syndrome is a rare condition caused by the obstruction of the common bile duct or common hepatic duct by external compression from multiple impacted gallstones or a single large impacted gallstone in Hartman's pouch. Presenting symptoms are similar to symptoms of cholecystitis. This condition may be confused with other obstructive conditions such as choledocholithiasis or ascending cholangitis due to the presence of jaundice. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of Mirizzi syndrome and highlights the interprofessional team's role in its diagnosis and management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the cause of Mirizzi syndrome.
- Describe the presentation of Mirizzi syndrome.
- Outline the evaluation of a patient suspected of having Mirizzi syndrome.
- Review how care coordination among interprofessional team members can improve outcomes for patients affected by Mirizzi syndrome.
