The optic radiation and cortex on one side of the brain contain the visual information from the contralateral binocular visual hemifield.

Homonymous superior quadrantanopia is caused by damage to the contralateral inferior parts of the posterior visual pathway: the inferior optic radiation (temporal Meyer loop), or the inferior part of the occipital visual cortex below the calcarine fissure.

The nerve fiber bundles of the geniculocalcarine tract are topographically distributed in a dorsal to the ventral array as they project from the lateral geniculate nuclei to the occipital lobe.

- Ventral fibers that transmit visual information from the inferior quadrants of the retina (superior visual field) initially travel through the anterior temporal lobe around the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle (Meyer loop) before connecting to the primary visual cortex in the inferior lip of the calcarine fissure.

- Dorsal fibers that transmit visual information from the superior quadrants of the retina (inferior visual field) travel through the posterior temporal lobe and the parietal lobe before connecting to the primary visual cortex in the superior lip of the calcarine fissure.

A lesion involving the V2 and V3 extrastriate cortex may also cause a quadrantic visual field defect.
