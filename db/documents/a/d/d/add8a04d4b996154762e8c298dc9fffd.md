# Continuing Education Activity

Orbital pseudotumor, orbital inflammatory pseudotumor (OIP), or idiopathic orbital inflammation (IOI) is a benign, non-infectious, non-neoplastic, space-occupying, inflammatory condition of the orbit and peri-orbit without identifiable local or systemic causes. This article presents the current theories on the etiology, clinical manifestation, pathogenesis, differential diagnosis, laboratory and imaging tests, and treatment options for the management of orbital pseudotumor. The role of the interprofessional team will be reviewed in this activity.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of orbital pseudotumor. 
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of orbital pseudotumors.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for orbital pseudotumors. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis and treatment of orbital pseudotumor and improve outcomes.

# Introduction

Orbital pseudotumor, also known as orbital inflammatory pseudotumors (OIP), idiopathic orbital inflammation (IOI), orbital inflammatory syndrome (OIS),  idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor (IOIP), or nonspecific orbital inflammation (NSOI) is a benign, space-occupying, and non-infectious inflammatory condition of the orbit but may extend in the peri-orbital area.

Orbital pseudotumor is rare in children. The most common ophthalmic findings are periorbital edema and blepharoptosis. A palpable mass may be present. On orbital radiography, common findings are dacryoadenitis, orbital mass, or myositis.

# Etiology

The exact etiology is unknown, but researchers have considered infection elsewhere besides the orbit and autoimmune disorders. Among infections, the presence of Streptococcal pharyngitis or viral upper respiratory infection has reportedly correlated with the occurrence of orbital pseudotumor. Molecular mimicry of the foreign antigen with self-antigens is one theory to explain IOI after infection.

Various rheumatologic disorders such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener granulomatosis), giant cell arteritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, polyarteritis nodosa, multifocal fibrosclerosis (now categorized as IgG4-related disease), Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis are associated with orbital inflammation.

There are several theories proposed to explain the inflammation that causes orbital pseudotumor. Reports exist of high levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins, interferon (IFN), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in histopathological specimens, as well as increased expression of CD20 and CD25.

# Epidemiology

Orbital pseudotumor accounts for approximately 8% to 11% of all orbital tumors.

# Histopathology

There is a debate on whether there is a need for orbital biopsy since typical idiopathic orbital inflammation cases can be treated with systemic corticosteroids without a biopsy.

Histopathologic examination through either fine-needle aspiration biopsy or incisional/excisional biopsy is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis.

Research has described five patterns of acute inflammatory pseudotumor: anterior and diffuse acute pseudotumors, anterior or diffuse orbital infiltration, lacrimal involvement, posterior or apical involvement, and myositic infiltration.

On histopathology, there is a pleomorphic inflammatory cellular response consisting of pleomorphic response by lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and eosinophils.

The presence of granulomatous inflammation, vasculitis, or necrosis generally excludes the diagnosis of IOI.

# History and Physical

Orbital pseudotumor is diagnosed by excluding other orbital diseases with similar presentations. Thus, systemic diseases such as sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Sjogren syndrome, IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), lymphoproliferative and histiocytic disorder, xanthogranulomatous disease, or metastatic disease may be elicited through a careful history-taking and a review of previous medical conditions.

**Signs and Symptoms**

Idiopathic orbital inflammation has highly variable clinical features ranging from a diffuse process to a specific focal target like the lacrimal gland and extraocular muscles.

Another typical presentation is that of a patient with an acute onset of orbital pain and headache. In adults, there may be eyelid and periorbital erythema and edema, conjunctival congestion, proptosis, ptosis, diplopia, light sensitivity, decrease in eye motility, and pain on eye movement.

Dacryoadenitis accounts for 50% of all IOI’s. It typically presents with a painful, firm, mass with edema in the lateral upper eyelid, and S-shaped ptosis. It may be bilateral. Some patients with idiopathic dacryoadenitis have gotten relabeled as having immunoglobulin G4-related ophthalmic disease (IgG4-ROD).

Orbital myositis may be acute, subacute, or recurrent. It may involve one or multiple ocular muscles. The most commonly involved muscles are the medial rectus, followed by the superior, lateral, and inferior recti muscles.

Systemic disorders have correlations with orbital pseudotumor. There are reports of immunologic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and scleritis, causing orbital inflammatory disease. Implications also point to sinusitis. Concurrent systemic diseases such as flu, asthma, colitis, and severe anemia are also reportedly correlated with NSOI, as are hepatitis C, rheumatoid arthritis, and xanthogranuloma.

# Evaluation

**Laboratory Findings**

Laboratory evaluation usually includes hematologic work-up, routine biochemistry, inflammatory markers, and a comprehensive autoimmune panel. Hematologic work-up consists of a complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, electrolytes, thyroid function studies, sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, rheumatoid factor, angiotensin-converting enzyme level, and rapid plasma regain test.

**Ultrasound, Computed Tomography (CT), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**

Orbital ultrasound, CT, and MRI may aid in the diagnosis when combined with clinical findings and treatment response. Ultrasonography may help in evaluating the globe and ocular complications such as retinal and choroidal detachments.

Enhancement is variable depending on the stage. In the acute stage, there is pronounced enhancement, while in the chronic and sclerosing type of inflammation, there is hypointensity on T2-W images noted. Diffuse IOI CT and MRI findings are similar to anterior IOI. Orbital lymphoproliferative may be challenging to differentiate. Apical IOI may show signs of intracranial involvement such as abnormal soft tissue extending into the middle cranial fossa, cavernous sinus, and meninges.

# Treatment / Management

Current therapeutic agents available for idiopathic orbital inflammation are:

- Corticosteroids

- Radiation therapy

- (3) nonspecific steroid-sparing agents such as  (a) methotrexate; (b) cyclosporin-A; (c) mycophenolate mofetil; (d) cyclophosphamide; (e) rituximab and

- (4) biologic agents such as (a) infliximab; (b) adalimumab; (c) etanercept; (d) daclizumab; (e) abatacept; (f) tocilizumab.

While a modest proportion of patients experienced resolution of their symptoms without treatment, orbital pseudotumor responds dramatically to steroids.corticosteroid response is a dramatic improvement of signs and symptoms within 48 hours after the administration of systemic prednisolone.

For adults, initial steroid treatment doses are typically 1 mg/kg of prednisone. For children, high-dose oral corticosteroids of 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg/day are the preferred protocol.

There is no consensus on the treatment protocol for cases that do not respond to steroid treatment. The reported cure rate is only 37% and a recurrence rate of 52% with corticosteroid therapy. Long-term use of steroids leads to systemic side effects, including insomnia, hyperglycemia, weight gain, and cataracts. Local corticosteroid injections for periorbital and orbital inflammation are also options.

For patients who are non-responsive to steroid treatment or suffer relapses despite steroid treatment, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, T-cell/calcineurin inhibitors, lymphocyte inhibitors, tumor necrosis factor-a inhibitors, and surgical debulking may be employed.

Immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy may be an option in selected cases. Cyclosporin-A (CsA) suppresses the lymphocyte-mediated responses. It inhibits T-cell activation via decreased production of interleukin-1 and interleukin-2. Renal function requires monitoring while on CsA.

Antimetabolites like methotrexate, which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase needed for DNA and RNA synthesis, result in the suppression of rapidly dividing B-cells and T-cells.

Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody that works against tumor necrosis factor-a, has been used for autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Other therapeutic agents and immunomodulators in use for recalcitrant OIP are interferon-A, tacrolimus, rituximab (a B-lymphocyte inhibitor monoclonal antibody), daclizumab (T-lymphocyte inhibitor monoclonal antibody), and leflunomide.

While idiopathic orbital inflammation is benign, its course can be clinically fulminant with vision loss and severe oculomotor dysfunction. Patients with optic nerve involvement may require admission for aggressive IV steroid therapy to prevent long-term visual impairment.

# Differential Diagnosis

The following diseases, among others, should be considered to prevent misdiagnosis.

- Infections- orbital cellulitis

- Systemic diseases such as thyroid ophthalmopathy

- Malignancies: Lymphoma, metastatic carcinoma, leukemia

- Autoimmune disorders: Systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis

- IgG4-related orbital disease

- Sarcoidosis

Orbital and systemic diseases that may present with similar signs and symptoms include orbital cellulitis, thyroid eye disease, sarcoid, orbital lymphoma, lymphangioma, metastatic carcinoma, leukemia, lymphoproliferative disorder, and rhabdomyosarcoma.

Bilateral sclerosing orbital pseudotumor should alert the physician. This subset of IOI leads to serious morbidity with a chronic, severe, progressive disease commonly manifesting with proptosis, restricted ocular motility, and pain.

In children, the differential diagnoses include orbital cellulitis, orbital trauma with retained foreign body, ruptured dermoid cyst, lymphangioma, neuroblastoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and pediatric malignancies such as rhabdomyosarcoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma and, metastatic retinoblastoma.

Distinguishing among the various clinical entities that mimic orbital pseudotumor may require the use of ancillary laboratory exams, CT, MRI, and biopsy.

# Prognosis

While orbital pseudotumor resolves without treatment in some patients, steroids are the mainstay of treatment. Over 75% of patients show improvement within 24 to 48 hours of steroid treatment.

# Complications

Vision loss and severe oculomotor dysfunction can be permanent if orbital pseudotumor is left untreated or is unresponsive to treatment. The inflammation can spread to contiguous structures such as the periorbital area, the optic nerve, and the intracranial cavity. Multiple cranial nerves may be affected, and sensorimotor hemiparesis may occur. Severe inflammation may cause secondary angle-closure glaucoma because of choroidal effusions that cause the anterior rotation of the ciliary body.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients should be educated that symptoms of vision loss or eye pain should be evaluated by a trained medical professional. If orbital pseudotumor has been diagnosed, patients should also be educated about the importance of continuing treatment for orbital pseudotumor.

# Pearls and Other Issues

- The signs and symptoms of orbital pseudotumor may mimic other orbital diseases such as auto-immune disorders, thyroid disease, or malignancy.

- A careful history and a physical examination by an internist, primary care physician or medical specialist are particularly relevant to rule out systemic diseases that may be associated with orbital pseudotumor.

- The use of ancillary laboratory and diagnostic testing, including CT, MRI, and biopsy, must be used judiciously for a definitive diagnosis.

- Clinicians should carefully weigh treatment options for patients who are non-responsive to a steroid regimen.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Since orbital pseudotumor is diagnosed by excluding other diseases, the health care team should consist of an interprofessional team of pediatricians, primary care physicians, internists, rheumatologists, endocrinologists, allergologists, immunologists, radiologists, and auto-immune disease experts. A comprehensive systemic examination by qualified medical personnel and carefully documented history are vital to the ophthalmologist’s diagnosis and management. The use of systemic therapy should involve a follow-up with physicians to monitor the side effects or complications of treatment. The patient or the patient’s family should be always be informed of his prognosis at each stage of the disease and be actively involved in the choice of diagnostic procedures and management. Ophthalmology nurses often arrange follow-ups with patients, provide education, and report back to the team. Pharmacists review prescriptions for dosage and interactions. They assist the team by educating patients about the importance of compliance and discuss side effects. These are examples of how the interprofessional team approach can improve patient outcomes in orbital pseudotumor cases. [Level 5]
