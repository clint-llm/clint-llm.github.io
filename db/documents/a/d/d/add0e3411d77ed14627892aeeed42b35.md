Plasmapheresis is a therapeutic intervention that involves extracorporeal removal, return, or exchange of blood plasma or components. The underlying mechanism of this procedure is accomplished by either centrifugation or filtration using semipermeable membranes. This activity reviews plasmapheresis as a therapeutic intervention that involves extracorporeal removal, return, or exchange of blood plasma or components. This intervention results in a filtered plasma product that can be used for the treatment of numerous diseases. It also highlights the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance plasmapheresis and improve outcomes.
