ALP is inhibited by metal-complexing anticoagulants. They inhibit the enzyme by complexing Mg and Zn and should not be used. Hemolyzed and lipemic specimens should be rejected if they have a high background absorbance. Bilirubin at concentrations of up to 20 mg/dL does not interfere.

Serum ALP levels are affected by many drugs, physical conditions, herbal medicines, food intake, smoking, alcohol intake, and pregnancy. Some 1000 drugs, herbs, and physiological conditions that affect ALP activity have been documented. Clofibrate lowers serum ALP activity, reducing all ALP fractions except the liver; this may be caused by increased biliary clearance of ALP.

Verapamil, widely used in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, angina pectoris, and essential hypertension, increases serum ALP in hypertensive patients. When verapamil is administered to hypertensive patients for 2 months, total ALP activity increased significantly, and an increase in bone ALP in serum is subsequently observed. These results suggest that verapamil may affect bone metabolism which is secondary to the enhancement of parathyroid hormone secretion.

Alkaline phosphatase assays are susceptible to negative interference because alkali denaturation of hemoglobin may cause a negative offset in absorbance readings. Icterus exerts effects on chemistry tests primarily through spectrophotometric and chemical interferences. Bilirubin absorbs light between 400 and 540 nm, with a peak around 460 nm.
