Prescribing clinicians, including nurse practitioners, primary care providers, physician assistants, and internists who prescribe trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), should be familiar with ints indications and adverse effects. Also, when a patient receives a prescription of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, some patients may need a baseline blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine ratio, frequent complete blood counts (CBC), and electrolyte measurements if renal impairment is a known issue or if taking a drug that has interactions with potassium.

Pharmacists should be consulted to verify coverage in conjunction with an infectious disease specialist, verify dosing, perform medication reconciliation, and report any concerns to the rest of the healthcare team. Nurses will administer the drug inpatient and can also confirm that there are no adverse events resulting from therapy with TMP-SMX, reporting any concerns immediately to the prescriber.Â  In instances of pediatric use or cases of renal impairment, the pharmacist, nurse, and prescriber should coordinate to ensure proper dosing. As with any medication therapy, antimicrobial treatment with TMP-SMX requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient outcomes.
