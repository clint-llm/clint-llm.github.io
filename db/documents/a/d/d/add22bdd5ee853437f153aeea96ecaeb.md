The airway, ventilation, and circulation are assessed. Intravenous access is obtained, and intubation is performed if necessary. Hypoxia and hypotension have to be avoided as they are detrimental to outcomes.

After the head CT scan is obtained, management is decided. In patients with no immediate neurosurgical lesions, the priority is the management of intracranial pressure (ICP). Monitoring ICP is performed if the GCS is below 8. An external ventricular drain (EVD) has the advantage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. Intraparenchymal devices can also be used. In patients with cerebral contusions, seizure prophylaxis is started for seven days to prevent post-traumatic seizures. Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is defined as the difference between the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the ICP. CPP = MAP - ICP. The goals in treatment are to keep the ICP under 20 mm Hg and the CPP above 60 mm Hg. Patients with increased ICP are managed using sedation, diuresis, and hypertonic saline.

Some patients need immediate craniotomy for evacuation of the contusion; however, there is still debate about the value in removing intraparenchymal lesions. Indications for surgical removal include progressive neurological deterioration, signs of mass effect on brain CT, unresponsive increased ICP, midline deviation of more than 5 mm, cistern compression evidenced on brain CT, temporal contusions of greater than 20 cc of volume.

Hemorrhage/contusion progression in up to 87% of the cases is a potential complication of decompressive craniectomy.

The American College of Surgeons published in 2015 a three-tiered protocol for the management of increased intracranial pressure.

Tier 1

- The head of the bed elevated at 30 degrees.

- Sedation and analgesia using short-acting agents for intubated patients.

- EVD with intermittent drainage.

- Repeat head CT imaging if no improvement.

- If ICP remains ≥ 20 - 25 mmHg, proceed to Tier 2.

Tier 2

- If using a parenchymal ICP device, change to an EVD.

- Hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol or hypertonic saline), given intermittently.

- Mannitol administered in intermittent boluses (0.25 to 1 gm/ kg body weight). Check frequently the serum sodium and osmolality; additional doses held if serum osmolality exceeds 320 mOsm/L.

- Hypertonic saline 3% sodium chloride solution administered in intermittent boluses of 250 ml over 0.5 hours (2-5 mL/kg over 10-20 minutes). Serum sodium and osmolality checked every 6 hours. Additional doses held if serum sodium exceeds 160 mEq/L. A bolus of up to 23.4% sodium chloride solution can be given for refractory increased ICP.

- CPP no less than 50 mm Hg. (Goal between 60 and 70 mm Hg).

- PaCO2 goal of 30 to 35 mmHg should be maintained.

- Repeat head CT imaging if no improvement.

- Neuromuscular paralysis bolus test dose.

- If ICP remains ≥ 20 to 25 mmHg, proceed to Tier 3.

Tier 3

- Decompressive hemicraniectomy or bilateral craniectomy.

- Neuromuscular paralysis via continuous infusion (titrated to maintain at least two twitches out of a train of four). Adequate sedation must be utilized.

- Barbiturate or propofol coma. Hypotension is a common side effect. Continuous EEG is used to achieve burst suppression.

- Hypothermia below 36 degrees C is not indicated as an initial TBI treatment. Use only as salvage therapy after all previous Tier 3 treatments have failed.
