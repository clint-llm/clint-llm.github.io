The skin findings of purpura fulminans have a characteristic appearance and evolution. Purpura fulminans begins with erythema, which develops irregular central areas of blue-black hemorrhagic necrosis. In some cases, vesicles and bulla form. The affected skin initially is painful and indurated, but in the later stages, there may be a total loss of sensation. Secondary infection of gangrenous tissue may occur. Necrosis may extend to deeper tissues.

In general, the history and physical exam for purpura fulminans should be aimed at early recognition and determination of the underlying cause. Make sure to thoroughly examine the patient’s skin, especially in patients who could be presenting with necrotizing fasciitis. Early in the diagnosis of associated diseases, the skin findings may be subtle, so it is important to keep this diagnosis in your differential. Petechial rash or bruising in a neonate or septic patient should trigger consideration of purpura fulminans. Components of a patient’s history include a history of severe infections or trauma as well previous splenectomy. Because of the association with DIC patients may experience bleeding from multiple sites including mucous membranes, areas of trauma or the rectum. Because of the association with severe septic shock, the patient may experience symptoms of end-organ damage such as hematuria, oliguria, and respiratory distress. Pain out of proportion to exam should always make one consider necrotizing fasciitis.
