Approximately 6 million fractures are reported per year in the United States. Of these, between 1.9% to 15% result in nonunion. This rate will vary depending on the fractured bone and the characteristics of the fracture (i.e., open vs. closed). In tibial fractures, the rate of non-union is close to 1.1% if treated nonoperatively and nearly 5% if treated operatively.
