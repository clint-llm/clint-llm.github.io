While rare, some complications can be associated with US-guided arthrocentesis.

- Infection. This procedure must be done entirely with an aseptic technique to avoid introducing bacteria into the sterile joint space. To limit this, patients must be draped and prepped in the typical sterile fashion and avoid inserting a needle through infected skin. In addition, the US should be covered in a sterile ultrasound cover, and sterile gel should be used during the procedure.

- Bleeding. Hemarthrosis is rare during arthrocentesis but can be seen in patients with coagulopathies, such as those taking anticoagulants. Care should be taken when inserting the needle, avoiding side-to-side motions to avoid shearing the structures around the joint space and the blood vessels.
