The glabella is the bony landmark present in the outer table of the frontal bone in the middle of the superciliary arches; the glabella receives blood supply from the diploic veins present between the outer and inner table of the frontal bone. Arteries supplying the skin and muscles over the glabella gives branches to glabella also.

Supraorbital and the supratrochlear arteries (branches of the ophthalmic artery) supply forehead and medial canthal area.

The superficial vertical branch of the supraorbital artery anastomoses with the supratrochlear artery and the frontal branch of the superficial temporal artery in the forehead. The superficial branches of the supraorbital artery course superficially within the subcutaneous layer.  Supraorbital and supratrochlear arteries anastomose with the angular artery at the medial angle of the eye to form an arterial arcade.

The glabella is drained by meningeal veins, supratrochlear and supraorbital vein. The supratrochlear and supraorbital veins join near the medial canthus to form the angular vein, which descends deep into the nasolabial fold. At the inferior border of the nose, it joins the superior labial vein to become the facial vein, which crosses the body of the mandible. Facial vein unites with the anterior division of the retromandibular vein to form the common facial vein, which ultimately drains in the internal jugular vein.

The glabella and glabellar complex drain into the preauricular and deep parotid lymph nodes.
