Patients with one to four teeth, either missing or in excess of normal, are generally considered to have had a developmental disturbance during their development. In contrast, extensive hypodontia and hyperdontia are common oral manifestations associated with syndromes, and thus these patients should be further evaluated for underlying syndromic or systemic conditions. The clinician will require the appropriate radiographic imaging to accurately assess the extent of hypodontia or hyperdontia and determine the most appropriate course of action or treatment for the patient.
