Once there is a diagnosis of Wyburn-Mason syndrome, the treatment is based on the location of the arteriovenous malformations and the corresponding symptoms. Because the condition is associated with high morbidity and mortality linked to hemorrhage, the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an internist, geneticist, hematologist, radiologist, ophthalmologist, neurosurgeon, and intensivist. Dental surgeons and otorhinolaryngologists should be cautioned about the increased risk of hemorrhage for any interventional procedure that they plan to do. Even during simple tooth extraction, significant hemorrhage can occur. Follow up is usually done by the primary care provider and nurse practitioner.  Patients with unruptured arteriovenous malformations without symptoms can be observed; other options include radiation therapy, embolization, surgical resection, or a combination of these approaches. Before the patient undergoes any invasive procedure, the healthcare professional should be familiar with the syndrome and how to manage the hemorrhage. The outcomes for patients with eye involvement are guarded; most patients do end up with some degree of vision loss.
