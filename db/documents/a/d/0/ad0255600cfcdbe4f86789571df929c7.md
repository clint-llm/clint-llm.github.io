Patients typically present with wrist pain following a fall onto an outstretched hand. Axial loading of the wrist in forced hyperextension and radial deviation can cause the fracture as the scaphoid impacts on the dorsal rim of the radius. Contact sports and road traffic accidents are also common causes. Tumors and infections are uncommon causes of pathological scaphoid fractures.
