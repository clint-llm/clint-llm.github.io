There is no direct reversal agent for the potentially major bleeding that may occur during tPA therapy. Commonly employed strategies include anti-fibrinolytic therapy such as tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid though there is no research on specific dosages. If fibrinogen levels are less than 150mg/dL, there may be added benefit from fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate. Cryoprecipitate should be used without any delay and monitor the fibrinogen level closely.
