Diagnosis is made clinically on the basis comparison with a normal looking tongue due to lack of standard size of the tongue. Infants may present with feeding difficulties, poor weight gain, and failure to thrive due to protrusion of the large tongue. They may also present with speech difficulties, misaligned, or protruded teeth in later life. Necrosis may be noted on the tip of the tongue, and ulcerations may be noted throughout the tongue.

The tongue may be displaced upwards and forwards in lesions affecting the tongue, including tumors, Ludwig angina, etc. Patients with generalized or posterior enlargement of the tongue may present with airway obstruction that can be life-threatening.
