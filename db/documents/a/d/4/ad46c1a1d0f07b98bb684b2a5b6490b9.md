Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy has been reported in many populations, from young children to the elderly. The highest prevalence of SUDEP is in people between the ages of 20 and 45.

Large-scale studies from the USA and Europe have identified higher rates of SUDEP in populations with socioeconomic barriers to care, including lack of employment, lack of access to medications and other treatments, and increased distance from appropriate healthcare providers.

A study by Sveinsson et al. in Sweden showed that patients with generalized tonic clinic seizures (GTCS) had a tenfold increased risk of SUDEP, and the majority of patients lived alone. A twofold increased risk of SUDEP was seen in individuals with a previous diagnosis of substance abuse or alcohol dependence.
