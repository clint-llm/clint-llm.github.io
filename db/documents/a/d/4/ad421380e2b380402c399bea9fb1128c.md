A hip arthrogram procedure involves the injection of contrast into the hip joint while maintaining a sterile field. Skin cleansers, sterile drapes, sterile gloves, sterile syringes, and sterile needles are needed to maintain a sterile environment.

An 18-gauge spinal needle attached to a 50 mL syringe is utilized as a contrast reservoir. Approximately 18 in of intravenous tubing connects the syringe to the spinal needle. The tubing allows for easier redirection of the needle and proper needle placement during the procedure. Contrast agents can be rather dense and obscure anatomic structures. It is therefore recommended to dilute contrast agents with a 50:50 mixture of sterile saline and contrast agent.
