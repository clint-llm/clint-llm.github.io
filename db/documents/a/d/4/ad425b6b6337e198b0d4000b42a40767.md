Research revealed that the incidence of hyperphosphataemia was 12% in all patients at admission to a tertiary care hospital, excluding patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with acute kidney injury (AKI) or whose phosphate did not get measured at admission.

Hyperphosphatemia is a common laboratory abnormality encountered by nephrologists. In patients with ESRD, the prevalence of hyperphosphatemia varies from 50Â to 74%.

In a study, researchers found that among children with oncologic disorders who received liposomal amphotericin, nearly 45% of children developed hyperphosphatemia.
