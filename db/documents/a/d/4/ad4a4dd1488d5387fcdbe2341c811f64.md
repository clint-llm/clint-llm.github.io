Parkinson disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that mostly presents in later life with generalized slowing of movements (bradykinesia) and at least one other symptom of resting tremor or rigidity. Other associated features are a loss of smell, sleep dysfunction, mood disorders, excess salivation, constipation, and excessive periodic limb movements in sleep. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis of Parkinson disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Parkinson disease.
- Review the presentation of a patient with Parkinson disease.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for Parkinson disease.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with Parkinson disease.
