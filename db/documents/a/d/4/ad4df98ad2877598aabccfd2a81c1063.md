There are no laboratory markers for the condition, but lab work should be done to exclude other conditions. Hormonal studies should be ordered to rule out Cushing syndrome, thyroid abnormalities, or endocrinologic abnormalities. Patients with adiposis dolorosa are found to have a slight to moderate increase in cholesterol levels. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) may be slightly elevated in this disease as well.

Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be helpful in making the diagnosis. Ultrasound may demonstrate multiple, small, oblong hyperechoic nodules. MRI of patients with adiposis dolorosa may show multiple, oblong superficial subcutaneous fatty lesions with a nodular increased fluid signal that appears “blush-like.”
