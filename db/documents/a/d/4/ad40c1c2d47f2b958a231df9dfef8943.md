The Madelung-type deformity can occur due to trauma (from a fracture or repetitive microtrauma as seen in gymnasts' wrist) or tumors (including multiple hereditary exostoses and Ollier disease). This must be distinguished from true Madelung deformity as Vickers ligament will not be present; thus, treatment options and natural history will differ.

In any patient presenting with wrist pain and loss of range of motion, one must consider common causes, including fracture, arthritis, and tendinopathies, in the differential diagnosis. In patients presenting with deformity, tumors must be considered as well.
