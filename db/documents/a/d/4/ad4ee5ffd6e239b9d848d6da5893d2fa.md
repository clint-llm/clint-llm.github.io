Although the pathophysiology of these disorders is secondary to different deficits, the final common pathway to chromosomal instability is due to an increased risk of DNA damage or defective DNA repair mechanisms.

- Ataxia-telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive (AR) disorder that primarily presents with cerebellar ataxia. It results from a mutation in ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) gene, which leads to a total loss of ATM protein (classic type) or a reduction of its level (wild type).****The ATM protein in normal conditions recognize DNA damage and activates DNA repair mechanisms to reduce genetic damage. The defect in the regulatory functions of theATM gene causes somatic mutations that lead to the manifestations of the disease.

- Bloom syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a lack of BLM helicase enzyme, the result of a mutation in the BLM gene. BLM gene encodes a RecQ helicase and RECQL3, referred to as the Bloom syndrome protein (BLM), which helps maintain DNA stability especially during recombination repair and replication. The protein is also involved with other molecules involved in DNA damage surveillance and repair.

- Fanconi anemia is a DNA repair disorder where cells cannot repair DNA damage caused by interstrand cross-links (ICLs). This defect eventually leads to chromosomal instability, particularly upon exposure to cytotoxic therapies and a general predisposition to certain cancers. FA can result from a mutation in any of the 17 different Fanconi anemia genes (FANCA to FANCQ) genes. The most commonly mutated genes in patients with FA are FANCA, FANCC, and FANCG. Inheritance patterns include AR, autosomal dominant (AD), and X-linked.

- Nijmegen breakage syndrome is an autosomal recessive chromosome instability syndrome associated with immunodeficiency. Nijmegen breakage syndrome is a result of mutations in the nibrin (NBN) gene on 8q21. The protein product is involved in DNA double-strand breaks repair, base excision repair, meiotic recombination, and telomere maintenance.
