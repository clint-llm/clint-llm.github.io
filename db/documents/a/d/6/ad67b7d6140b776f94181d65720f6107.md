A seizure can be defined as abnormal, hypersynchronous discharge of cortical neurons, and epilepsy is defined as a propensity to have seizures. Idiopathic (genetic) generalized epilepsy is a subtype of generalized epilepsy and consists of childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures alone. This activity will review the diagnosis and management of idiopathic generalized epilepsy and highlights the importance of an interprofessional team in providing the highest standard of care for patients suffering from this disease.

**Objectives:**
- Review the latest International League Against Epilepsy classification system for epilepsy.
- Summarize the typical presentation of childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
- Identify the most commonly used antiepileptic drugs for this subtype of epilepsy.
- Outline interprofessional team members' roles in providing optimum care to patients with idiopathic (genetic) generalized epilepsy to enhance care coordination and improve clinical outcomes.
