Community-acquired distress syndrome (CARDS) toxin is an exotoxin identified as a significant virulence factor of M. pneumoniae. M. pneumoniae encodes transcription of the CARDS toxin-encoding gene upon exposure to host cells, and the resultant exotoxin plays an essential role in Mycoplasma host cell interactions.  Exposure of animal models to the CARDS exotoxin reproduces the clinical features of mycoplasmal infection including increased cytokine production, eosinophilia, and hyperreactivity of airway resembling asthma.
