The etiology of mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms is unclear. Professionals hypothesize that these tumors are related to female hormones due to the preponderance of these tumors in women. This is believed to be the case because ovarian mucinous cystic neoplasms share the same histology and characteristics as mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms. These shared characteristics include the mucinous secreting columnar epithelium and the surrounding ovarian stroma that are seen in both ovarian and pancreatic mucinous cystic lesions. Also, the presence of estrogen receptors in mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms is another feature alluding to a hormonal cause. Finally, another common feature is the benign nature of the ovarian mucinous cystic tumors, which rarely metastasize to other organs or involve lymph nodes akin to mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms. However, due to the rarity of these tumors, other etiologies are unknown. A benign mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasm can potentially evolve into aggressive cancer, and hence, surgical resection is recommended in younger patients
