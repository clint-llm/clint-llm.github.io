GIP is measured in the plasma using commercially available sandwich ELISA kits. The ELISA test is specific for GIP, and it does not cross-react with GLP-1 and GLP-2. GIP-(1-42), which is the biologically active form of GIP, is metabolizedÂ by DPP-4 to form GIP-(3-42). GIP-(3-42) is biologically inactive and is found to have a weak antagonizing effect on GIP receptors in rat models.
