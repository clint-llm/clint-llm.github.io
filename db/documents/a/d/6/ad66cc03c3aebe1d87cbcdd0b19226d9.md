Several conditions and syndromes hold relevance to the Hering Breuer reflex. For one, understanding the neural circuitry and interplay among airway mechanoreceptor reflexes have been extensively studied in the past due to their clinical relevance in maintaining airway protection and upper airway motor tone. One potential clinical circumstance includes sleep and the possible dysregulation in patients who suffer from obstructive sleep apnea.

Second, as discussed previously, the HBR loop maintains breathing pattern stabilization in neonates and even in preterm infants.

Another clinical circumstance with regards to the HBR is removing feedback altogether (via reduced vagal nerve stimulation or vagotomy). Research has shown such an occurrence to reduce the respiratory rhythm while increasing the inspiratory amplitude and prolonging the duration of expiration.
