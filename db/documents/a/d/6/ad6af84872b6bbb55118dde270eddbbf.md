Uveitic macular edema is mostly associated with noninfectious causes of posterior, intermediate, and panuveitis. In patients with anterior uveitis, macular edema is mostly seen in anterior uveitis due to HLA B27, as it has a strong association with the development of macular edema. Otherwise, UME is not common with anterior uveitis. A few infectious disorders also lead to UME.

Common causes of UME include the following:

- Anterior uveitis: HLA B27, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, idiopathic

- Posterior uveitis: Birdshot retinochoroidopathy, toxoplasmosis, retinal vasculitis, CMV retinitis, acute retinal necrosis

- Panuveitis: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH), sympathetic ophthalmia (SO), Adamantiades-Behcet disease, endophthalmitis, sarcoidosis, multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis, immune recovery uveitis, immunological causes

- Intermediate aveitis: Pars planitis, sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, Lyme disease

- Drug-induced: topical medications like brimonidine, metipranolol, prostaglandin analogs, glucocorticosteroids.

- Systemic: sulfonamides, cidofovir, rifabutin, bisphosphonates, sulfonamides, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors [TNF-a]

- Irvine–Gass syndrome: macular edema develops after cataract surgery

- Intraocular tumors: primary CNS or ocular non-Hodgkin lymphoma

- History of travel

- Recent administration of immunomodulatory therapy: fingolimod, paclitaxel, taxane
