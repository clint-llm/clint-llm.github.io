IgA deficiency has been likened to a "Heterogenous Disease" due to its variety of mechanisms, a disease with a common result to a multitude of pathogenic approaches.

Another physiologic target is B-cell maturation, the "IgA class-switching" that converts the B-cell into an IgA-secreting plasma cell. There are two subclasses of IgA known as IgA1 and IgA2. Monomeric IgA1 is foremost within the serum. There are monomeric and dimeric forms of both IgA1 and IgA2 that are linked by a J-chain (a polypeptide responsible for complex formation and transmural transport) located on mucosal surfaces.

Familial studies have been inconsistent; some cases appear to be autosomal dominant, while others are autosomal recessive. Chromosome mutations have been noted in JAK3, RAG1, RAG2, TAC1, CXCR4, and STAT1.
