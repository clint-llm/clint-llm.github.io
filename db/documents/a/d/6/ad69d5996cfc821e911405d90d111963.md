Diagnosis of relapsing fever requires a careful history with attention to travel history and other geographic information, living conditions, and the temporal pattern of the symptoms. Laboratory evaluation may include neutrophil leukocytosis, as well as thrombocytopenia.Â Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction occurring in response to antibiotics is associated with leukopenia. Elevated liver function tests are seen with hepatic impairment. Mild renal dysfunction can occur. Cerebral involvement is associated with cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis without the presence of spirochetes.

Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Borrelia in Giemsa-stained blood films, serologic analysis, or via PCR detection of the organism. These organisms are not identifiable in routine laboratory cultures. The diagnostic yield is highest with the earlier febrile episodes and decreases with each recurrence. Early in the course of illness, the number of spirochetes visible in the blood can reach 100,000/mm3. Between episodes and in later recurrences, the spirochetes may not be visible at all. Serology may also be used to diagnose tick-borne relapsing fever, particularly in situations in which diagnosis is suspected later in the course of illness. In that case, repeated testing with a rise in Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is suggestive of recent infection. However, these serologic tests cross-react with other spirochetes such as Leptospirosis and syphilis and must be interpreted in the setting of clinical symptoms.
