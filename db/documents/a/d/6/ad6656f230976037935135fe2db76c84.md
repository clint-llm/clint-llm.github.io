After diagnosis, a radiotherapist and oncologist should educate the patient regarding the favorable outcome associated with strict adherence to the program. Otolaryngology and otolaryngology nurses provide care and education to these patients after nasopharyngeal biopsy and regarding hearing optimization if Eustachian tube dysfunction is present. Board-certified oncologic pharmacists review prescriptions and check for drug-drug interactions. Oncology specialty nursing staff can administer chemotherapy, assist in post-procedural care and monitoring, and report any concerns to the treating clinicians.

All these interprofessional team members are tasked with keeping meticulous patient records so that everyone involved in the patient's care has the most accurate and updated information, and everyone must maintain open communication lines so interventions can be promptly initiated when needed.
