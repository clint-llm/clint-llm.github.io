After an appropriate physical examination, patients suspected to have calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease should undergo arthrocentesis for synovial fluid analysis, in addition to radiography of the involved joints.

Diagnostic confirmation may be via the presence of rhomboid crystals in the synovial fluid aspirate visualized under polarized microscopy. These crystals typically present positive birefringence.

While imaging findings consistent with chondrocalcinosis support the diagnosis of CPPD, its absence does not rule it out.

Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly gradient-echo sequences, for the evaluation of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition burden in joint cartilage.
