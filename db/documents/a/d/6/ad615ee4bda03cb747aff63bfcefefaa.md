Assessment of medical students is measurable via the use of the Kirkpatrick model. The Kirkpatrick model has four levels of assessment which are:

- Level 1 = participants react favorably to the learning or intervention.

- Level 2 = participants acquired knowledge, skills, and attitudes based on the intervention or study.

- Level 3 = participants applied what they learned into practice.

- Level 4 = once applied, there was an outcome to that application of skills learned from the intervention.

One advantage is that one can continue to evaluate the application of skills learned in a simulated setting to real-life situations. This method derives from the book-Kirkpatrick DL, Kirkpatrick JD. Implementing the four levels: a practical guide for effective evaluation of training programs. California: Berrett-Koehler;2007.

A discussion of the practical application of the method appears in some of the review papers.
