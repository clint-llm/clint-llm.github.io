**Alirocumab**

- Supplied in 75 mg or 150 mg single-dose prefilled pen or syringe.

- The recommended starting dose is 75 mg once every two weeks, administered subcutaneously.

- An alternative starting dose is 300 mg once every four weeks.

- If the LDL-C response is inadequate, the dosage may be adjusted to the maximum dosage of 150 mg administered every two weeks.

- There is currently no pediatric dosing for this drug.

**Evolocumab**

- Supplied as a 140 mg/mL single-use prefilled syringe or autoinjector and 420 mg/3.5 mL solution in a single-use infusor with a prefilled cartridge.

- For adults, the dosing is 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg once monthly administered subcutaneously.

- 420 mg dose can be administered over 5 minutes using the single-use infusor or by giving three 140 mg injections consecutively within 30 minutes.

- For children 10 years of age and older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, the dosing is 140 mg subcutaneously every two weeks or 420 mg subcutaneously once a month.

- For adults and children, 10 years of age and older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia the dosing is 420 mg subcutaneously once a month but can be increased to 420 mg every 2 weeks if a clinically meaningful response is not achieved in 12 weeks.

**Inclisiran**

- Supplied in 284mg/1.5 mL prefilled syringe.

- The recommended dose is 284 mg subcutaneous injection initially, again at 3 months, and then every 6 months.

No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderately impaired hepatic or renal function. For both alirocumab, evolocumab, and inclisiran no data are available in patients with severe hepatic. For alirocumab, no data are available in patients with severe renal impairment, and for inclisiran no data in those with end-stage renal disease.

**Efficacy**

- Decreases LDL cholesterol by 45 to 70%

- Decreases apoprotein B by 40 to 50%

- Decreases lipoprotein (a) by 30 to 40%

- Decreases triglyceride by 8 to 10%

- Increases HDL-cholesterol by 8 to 10%

- Increases apoprotein A1 by 4 to 5%

**Outcomes Data**

Both short and long-term studies have shown a significant reduction in cardiovascular events with both alirocumab and evolocumab.

Cardiovascular outcomes trials for inclisiran are currently being conducted but at the present time, there are no published results.

**Cost**

- Expensive: Monthly cost based on the Red Book wholesale acquisition cost: alirocumab and Evolocumab $450 - $500; inclisiran $6,500

- Requires prior authorization

- Generally recommended for patients with established or at high risk for cardiovascular disease who cannot achieve adequate lowering of LDL cholesterol with maximally tolerated statin ± ezetimibe or who are statin-intolerant

**The American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and the National Lipid Association 2018 published guidelines on the use of PCSK9 inhibitors in adults**

PCSK9 inhibitors are recommended for the following groups:

- In patients with cardiovascular disease at very high risk whose LDL-C level remains ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 mmol/L) on a maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy, adding a PCSK9 inhibitor is reasonable.

- In patients with severe primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C level ≥190 mg/dL [≥4.9 mmol/L]), without calculating 10-year ASCVD risk, if the LDL-C level on statin plus ezetimibe remains ≥100 mg/dL (≥2.6 mmol/L) and the patient has multiple factors that increase subsequent risk of ASCVD events, a PCSK9 inhibitor may be considered.

- In patients 30 to 75 years of age with heterozygous FH and an LDL-C level of 100 mg/dL or higher (≥2.6 mmol/L) while taking maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy, the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor may be a considered.

- In patients 40 to 75 years of age with a baseline LDL-C level of 220 mg/dL or higher (≥5.7 mmol/L) who achieve an on-treatment LDL-C level of 130 mg/dL or higher (≥3.4 mmol/L) while receiving maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy, the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor may be considered.

The specific details of these guidelines formulated by the ACC and NLA are cited in the references at the end of this article.

Treatment with small interfering RNAs (inclisiran) designed to target PCSK9 messenger RNA is under investigation in clinical trials as an alternative mechanism to reduce PCSK9 activity and LDL cholesterol levels.
