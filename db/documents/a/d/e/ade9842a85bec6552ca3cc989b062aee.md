Breath holding spells were once considered to be attention-seeking behavior, but studies showed that these episodes are not intentional and are a result of an involuntary reflex.

There are two types of breath holding spells. The most common ones are the cyanotic breath-holding spells, which are 85% of breath holding spells and are most commonly a result of temper tantrums. The trigger for these episodes is anger or frustration of the child, who will typically cry for a brief period, becomes silent, stop breathing, and then becomes cyanotic. The patient usually recovers in less than a minute, regains consciousness and after the episode gasping for air may occur, and the child may seem tired. Even though the incident appears frightening, children do not have any long-term effects after these episodes. Rarely, another event may be triggered if the child continues crying.

The pallid form usually follows a painful experience or frightful experience. After an inciting event, the heart rate slows down, the child stops breathing, loses consciousness and becomes pale. Children may become sweaty and have body jerks or lose bladder control. Episodes are usually brief, and the child regains consciousness without any intervention; however, the child may seem sleepy for a while.

Sometimes there are features of both cyanosis and pallor, which are termed mixed episodes.  Even though the frequency of breath-holding spells may vary, it could happen many times in a day or just once a year.
