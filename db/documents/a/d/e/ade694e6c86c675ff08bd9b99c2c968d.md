Several preparations of glucocorticoids are available, each with varying efficacy. Dexamethasone and betamethasone are long-acting with the highest glucocorticoid efficacy with a biological half-life of 36 to 54 hours. Cortisone and cortisol are short-acting with a biological half-life of under 12 hours and are not frequently used. Prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and triamcinolone are intermediate-acting with a biological half-life of 18 to 36 hours. The glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid effects of each available preparation vary, with cortisol and cortisone having almost 1 to 1 glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid effects while all others with almost no mineralocorticoid effects. Equivalent glucocorticoid doses can be calculated for these various preparations. 5 mg of prednisone is equivalent in its glucocorticoid effects to 5 mg of prednisolone, 4 mg of methylprednisolone, 4 mg of triamcinolone, 0.75 mg of dexamethasone, 0.60 mg of betamethasone, 20 mg of cortisol, and 25 mg of cortisone.

**Intravenous Administration**

Parenteral intravenous administration of high doses of glucocorticoids may be warranted in emergencies, such as septic shock, COPD exacerbation, and severe acute asthma. Pulse therapy of glucocorticoids (1000 mg intravenous methylprednisolone divided over 3 to 4 daily doses) for several days has been studied in several rheumatological conditions. This approach is recommended only for organ-threatening or life-threatening situations, including lupus nephritis (Class III or IV), giant cell arteritis with vision loss, ANCA-associated vasculitis, etc. Americal College of Rheumatology also recommends using intravenous glucocorticoids in patients with acute gout who are unable to take medications orally.

**Oral Administration**

Oral preparations are usually useful in both acute and chronic indications. For acute exacerbations of underlying chronic illness (such as asthma, COPD, gout, pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), etc.), short duration of moderate to high doses of oral corticosteroids is usually efficacious in treating the flare. Tapering dose packs starting at high doses and tapering daily over 7 to 9 days are commercially available and can be used in these situations as well. Long-term oral corticosteroid therapy may be necessary for chronic illnesses such as polymyalgia rheumatica, SLE, RA, vasculitis, myositis, IgG4-related disease, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), lymphoma, leukemia, multiple sclerosis, organ transplantation, etc. Clinicians must make every effort to use the glucocorticoids at the lowest possible dose and for the shortest possible duration in these cases. A slow taper shall be attempted in patients with prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids to prevent adrenal crisis.

**Local Administration**

Glucocorticoid administration can be via several non-systemic routes, including intra-articular joint injections for joint inflammation, inhalational for asthma, topical for dermatological problems, ocular drops for eye conditions, and intra-nasal for seasonal rhinitis. Clinicians generally avoid intramuscular (IM) glucocorticoids due to the risk of local muscle atrophy due to depot effect, and the only indications for intramuscular glucocorticoids are for IM triamcinolone acetonide for specific inflammatory disorders and IM injection of betamethasone to a pregnant mother less than 37 weeks of gestation to stimulate fetal lung maturity. When appropriate, a non-systemic route is preferable to the systemic route of administration to minimize systemic adverse effects.
