A critical component of the management of sitosterolemia is compliance with dietary modifications. Restriction of plant sterol intake must be emphasized during patient education, and patients must be made aware of the severe risks of complications associated with consuming plant sterols. Patients should be offered a consultation with a dietician given the importance of maintaining a plant sterol-free diet.

Given that sitosterolemia generally presents earlier in life, this presents an additional challenge. Counseling will generally involve the patient's family members to help ensure a full understanding of the dietary restrictions. Intuitively, the foods which are restricted in these patients may not be inherently unhealthy, and hence additional education is often required.
