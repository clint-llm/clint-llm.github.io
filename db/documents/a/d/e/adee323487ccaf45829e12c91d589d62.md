Inverted urothelial papilloma is a rare non-invasive endophytic urothelial tumor of the urinary bladder accounting for less than 1% of urothelial neoplasms. Since its initial description by Paschkis in 1927, there have been more than 1,000 cases reported in the literature. The clinical and endoscopic features of inverted urothelial papilloma of the bladder are not specific, and the definitive diagnosis is based on the histopathological examination. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of inverted urothelial papilloma and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the histological manifestations of inverted urothelial papilloma.
- Summarize the history, physical, and evaluation needed to diagnose inverted urothelial papilloma.
- Review the potential differential diagnosis options when evaluating for inverted urothelial papilloma.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in the diagnosis of inverted urothelial papilloma and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
