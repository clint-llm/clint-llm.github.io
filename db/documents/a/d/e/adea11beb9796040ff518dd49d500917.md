In managing patients presenting with colitis, computed tomography scans, colonoscopy, and biopsies could help differentiate between infectious and noninfectious colitis. However, these investigations are of little help in deciding the infectious agent causing colitis. Microbiological studies, including microscopy, cultures, and sensitivity, and PCR DNA tests are of high value in defining the etiology of an infectious cause. Treatment of infectious colitis should be individualized depending on the patientâ€™s age, causative agent, risk factors, presence of comorbidities, and current guidelines of management of infectious colitis. Antibiotics treatment of children with E. coli O157: H7 infection increases the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome and should be avoided.
