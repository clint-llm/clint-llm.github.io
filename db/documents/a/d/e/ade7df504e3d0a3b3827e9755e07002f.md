**Pearls**

- Caput succedaneum is benign edema associated with birth trauma that crosses cranial suture lines. On palpation, it is described as boggy, soft, and fluctuant. Parents should provide reassurance that the condition typically resolves within forty-eight hours and is not associated with significant complications.

- The most common risk factors for caput succedaneum include an extended labor course in primigravida pregnancy and instrument-assisted vaginal delivery.

- Monitoring any edema on a newborn's scalp is important to rule out more concerning etiologies of hemorrhage that require more aggressive management associated with birth trauma.

- Evaluating and palpating the scalp is an important component of the initial newborn assessment.

**Additional Information**

Vacuum-assisted delivery is associated with the development of caput succedaneum, cephalohematoma, subgaleal hemorrhage, and other scalp injuries. However, healthcare practitioners and patients must be aware that it is a largely safe procedure, and it has been shown not to impact long-term development adversely.
