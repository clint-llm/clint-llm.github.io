Complications of erysipelas can be serious but rarely fatal. Some local complications include abscess formation, scarlet fever, pneumonia, meningitis, skin necrosis, hemorrhagic purpura, thrombophlebitis, and bullous formation. There has been a case report of erysipelas leading to bilateral lower limb and abdominal elephantiasis secondary to erysipelas.

Local recurrence is reported in 5-20% of patients and can lead to scarring.
