Rectus sheath hematoma is a relatively uncommon entity that is most often associated with abdominal wall trauma or anticoagulation. Although it is a well-documented condition, its diagnosis can be difficult given its propensity to mimic a variety of intra-abdominal pathologies. This activity reviews the cause, presentation and diagnosis of rectus sheath hematoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the causes of rectus sheath hematoma.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with rectus sheath hematoma.
- Summarize the treatment options for rectus sheath hematoma.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by rectus sheath hematoma.
