Phalangeal fractures of the hand are a common injury that presents to the emergency department and clinic. Injuries can be located at the proximal, middle, or distal phalanx. For the vast majority of phalanx fractures, an acceptable reduction can be managed with non-operative treatment. Early intervention is important to allow healing and return of function. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of fractures of the phalanges and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the underlying anatomy and its importance of the mechanism of injury. 
- Explain the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of phalanx fractures of the hand. 
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for phalanx fractures of the hand. 
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes with phalanx fracture treatment. Provide education to interprofessional teams that will be treating phalanx injuries.
