Specialist equipment is not necessary. A general plastic surgical tray and equipment will often suffice when performing brachioplasty. When combined with liposuction, however, equipment for performing liposuction should be made available; this is often dependent on the surgeon's practice and location. Additionally, infiltration solution with local anesthesia (such as Klein's tumescent solution) will often be used when performing concurrent liposuction.
