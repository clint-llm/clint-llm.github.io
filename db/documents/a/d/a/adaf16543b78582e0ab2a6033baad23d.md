Surgical intervention is crucial in the treatment of LV rupture, while medical therapy can play a supporting role

LV free wall rupture is managed by resection of the infarcted area and closure of the area with polytetrafluoroethylene or polyester patches or by biologic glues. Surgical repair is recommended for pseudoaneurysms even if asymptomatic as they carry a high risk of rupture. Associated VSDs are closed by patch depending on the size. If there is associated papillary muscle rupture, it is treated with mitral valve replacement. Coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) is likely needed in most cases while treating mechanical complications post-AMI.
