Lissencephaly has different levels of severity and symptoms.

Symptoms may include seizures, feeding difficulty, muscle spasm, mental disability, severe psychomotor impairment, failure to thrive, developmental delays, and sometimes hands, finger, or toe anomalies. However, some children may develop normally with a mild learning disability.

Epilepsy develops in the first year of life in 9 out of 10 lissencephaly cases.
