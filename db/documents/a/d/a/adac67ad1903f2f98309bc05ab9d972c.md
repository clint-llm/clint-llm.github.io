The primary clinical manifestation of the factor V Leiden mutation is the risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, the most common finding in individuals with factor V Leiden is a laboratory-only abnormality. Only a small percentage of individuals with factor V Leiden will develop VTE in their lifetime, with an approximate risk of 5% for factor V Leiden heterozygotes in the general population and up to 20% in thrombophilic families.

**Venous Thromboembolism**

- The most common site of VTE is deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), but other sites, including superficial veins of the legs or cerebral, portal, and hepatic veins, may be involved.

- Isolated PE is a less common presentation. Without evidence of DVT, factor V Leiden patients can still present with PE. But this is a less common presentation of VTE in individuals with factor V Leiden compared with the general population, a phenomenon called the factor V Leiden paradox.

- Cerebral vein thrombosis can occur in factor V Leiden individuals, especially in patients using oral contraceptive pills. Studies have shown that factor V Leiden can be associated with an increased risk of Budd-Chiari syndrome.

**Arterial Thromboembolism**

- The association between factor V Leiden and arterial thromboembolism remains controversial, and it is likely to be small if present.

- Myocardial infarction: Studies have shown a modest increase in the risk of coronary artery disease in patients with factor V Leiden. It has been observed that the factor V Leiden mutation is associated with an increased risk of stroke, especially in women, smokers, and younger individuals.

**Pregnancy and Postpartum Thromboembolism Risk**

- Thromboembolism affects 1.2 of every 1000 deliveries.

- Women with factor V Leiden and other inherited thrombophilia with or without a family history of VTE are at increased risk of VTE and VTE-related complications during pregnancy.
