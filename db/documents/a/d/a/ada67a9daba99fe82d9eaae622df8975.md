The neoplastic proliferation of B cells in the marginal zone of lymphoid tissue gives rise to marginal zone B cell lymphomas. Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma or MALT lymphoma is the term used for extranodal marginal zone lymphoma, referred to as MALToma. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of MALToma and highlights the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**

- Summarize the evaluation of a patient with a diagnosis of MALToma.
- Outline the management options available for MALToma.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by MALToma.
