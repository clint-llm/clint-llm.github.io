After initial assessment for acute life-threatening conditions, a thorough history and physical examination are necessary. The clinician should determine when the bite occurred, obtain a description of the snake if possible, and evaluate the site of envenomation. Common physical exam findings from a pit viper envenomation include one or more fang marks, pain, erythema, ecchymosis, and progressive edema. Nausea, vomiting, coagulopathy, and systemic signs of envenomation can occur as well. Patients will also occasionally bring in the snake, which can help to identify venomous versus non-venomous species. In general, it is not advised to go catch the snake to bring it to the hospital as this may risk further bites. Even dead snakes can still cause envenomation if not handled carefully.
