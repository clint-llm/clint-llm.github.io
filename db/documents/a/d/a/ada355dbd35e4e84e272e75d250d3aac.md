# Continuing Education Activity

Edoxaban is a medication used in the management and treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). It is in the direct-acting oral anticoagulant class of drugs. This activity outlines the indications, action, and contraindications for edoxaban as a valuable agent in treating and managing thromboembolic events. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors pertinent to the healthcare team members in caring for patients with pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, and non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of edoxaban.
- Summarize the most common adverse events associated with edoxaban therapy.
- Describe the contraindications to using edoxaban.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to patients receiving edoxaban therapy.

# Indications

Edoxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). It exerts its effects by inhibiting factor Xa (FXa). Edoxaban was FDA approved in early 2015 to treat deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and decrease the risk of hypercoagulability-related illness, stroke, and systemic embolism (SE) in subjects with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).

Various clinical trials and studies (ENGAGE AF-TIMI and Hokusai-VTE) expressed edoxaban's effectiveness compared to the conventional vitamin K antagonist warfarin. It was demonstrated to be non-inferior in preventing blood clots compared to warfarin.

**FDA-Approved Indications**

- Deep venous thrombosis

- Pulmonary embolism

- Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF)

# Mechanism of Action

Edoxaban exerts its mechanism of action via direct, reversible, selective inhibition of factor Xa.

# Administration

Edoxaban is available for oral administration in three dosage forms and strengths

- 15 mg

- 30 mg

- 60 mg

**Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation**

- 60 mg orally administered once a day

Dosage should be modified and decreased to 30mg once a day in subjects with CrCL 15 to 50 mL/min.

**Deep Vein Thrombosis**

- 60 mg orally administered once a day

Dosage should be modified and decreased to 30mg once a day in subjects with CrCL 15 to 50 mL/min and patients weighing <60kg.

**Pulmonary Embolism**

- 60 mg orally administered once a day

Dosage should be modified and decreased to 30mg once a day in subjects with CrCL 15 to 50 mL/min and patients weighing <60kg.

# Adverse Effects

- Risk of Bleeding

- Rash

- Anemia

- Abnormal liver function tests

- Interstitial lung disease (ILD)

Early stoppage of edoxaban and the lack of sufficient alternative anticoagulation can increase the risk of ischemic events. Transitioning to another agent should be considered in the absence of pathological bleeding.

# Contraindications

Edoxaban is contraindicated in patients with massive or pathological bleeding. Edoxaban should also not be used to manage patients with CrCL higher than 95 mL/min. The ENGAGE AFTIMI 48 study demonstrated that subjects with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients and CrCL higher than 95 mL/min had a more significant risk of ischemic stroke with a 60 mg daily dosage of edoxaban compared to subjects managed with warfarin.

Edoxaban is not for patients with underlying valvular pathologies or patients with mechanical heart valves. Patients taking edoxaban and undergoing spinal or epidural puncture procedures are at risk of producing a spinal or epidural hematoma. Indwelling catheters should be held for at least 12 hours post edoxaban therapy, and the agent should not be started for at least two hours post catheter removal.

# Monitoring

Edoxaban has a half-life of 10 to 14 hours and a fast onset with serum concentration levels peaking at 1 to 2 hours (Cmax).

Pregnancy Category C: edoxaban should be used with caution only if benefits outweigh risks as there haven't been enough studies during pregnancy.

# Toxicity

Patients with impaired kidney function have a higher risk of toxicity. No distinct agent for reversal as yet exists, and agents such as protamine sulfate, vitamin K, and tranexamic acid have not demonstrated effectiveness.

If the agent was administered within the past 2 hours, activated charcoal could also be an alternative.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Edoxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) that is FDA-approved and indicated for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), pulmonary embolism (PE), and to decrease the risk of stroke and systemic embolism (SE) for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The primary care clinician or specialist prescribing the drug should be up to date on the latest anticoagulation guidelines and the latest clinical trial studies on edoxaban and its indication and adverse effects. The care for patients with thromboembolic diseases prompts critical care from an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals as preventable ischemic events can lead to life-long permanent complications and mortality. These healthcare professionals include a primary care clinician, a hematologist, a cardiologist, a pulmonologist, a nurse, and a pharmacist coordinating their activities and sharing information as a cohesive interprofessional team. This interprofessional approach will drive better patient outcomes and help to preclude adverse events. [Level 5]

The primary care clinicians and specialists should educate their patients about the consequences of non-compliance with anticoagulant therapy for the full duration and how subtherapeutic levels can further result in thromboembolism and ischemic complexities. Before initiating therapy, the prescribing physician should be aware of the kidney function and CrCL levels, as dosing modifications are required for CrCL 15 to 50 mL/min and contraindicated in CrCL <15 mL/min. Patients should receive information on the common adverse effects that may occur while on therapy with edoxaban, such as the risk of bleeding, rash, and anemia. Routine check-ups should be scheduled, and liver functions monitored routinely as edoxaban therapy may cause an elevation in liver enzymes.

Counseling and careful monitoring should be conducted during pregnancy, as clinical studies during its use in pregnancy are limited, and edoxaban is labeled as pregnancy category C. The clinician performing spinal or epidural puncture procedures should be aware of patients currently taking anticoagulants as there is a significant risk for spinal and epidural hematoma, which can cause life-long impairment. The patient should also be fully informed of no concurrent use with other hematologic agents as it may predispose the patient to an increased risk of pathological bleeding. Interprofessional communication is key to building patient rapport and developing a therapeutic alliance, so the patients comply with therapy adequately to prevent thromboembolism-related complications.
