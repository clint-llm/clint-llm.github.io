Tympanocentesis is a very important minor surgical procedure in the diagnostic arsenal and management of otitis media (OM) and a host of other ear conditions. It is a relatively old procedure that has found increased use in recent years. However, its widespread utilization is a challenging concept for some clinicians. With the advent of widespread antibiotics, many clinicians will empirically treat OM rather than aspirate middle ear fluid.
