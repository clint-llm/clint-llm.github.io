The diagnosis of ACS depends on both radiographic evidence and clinical symptoms. To be diagnosed with ACS, a patient must meet the following criteria.

- New pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging (chest x-ray, CT) involving at least one lung segment; this cannot be due to atelectasis and must have one of the following symptoms:

- Chest pain

- Temperature more than 38.5 C

- Tachypnea, wheezing, rales, coughing, appearance of an increased work of breathing

- Hypoxemia, relative to baseline (more than 2% decrease in SpO2 from steady state on room air, PaO2 less than 60 mmHg)

This algorithm lacks someÂ specificity, and can also be diagnostic of pneumonia. It is very important to get a chest radiograph on every SCD patient with any respiratory symptoms since ACS can start insidiously, and it is important to start treatment early.

**Risk Factors**

- Low HbF

- Young age

- Presence of asthma or other hyperreactive lung disorder

- Smoking

- Recent trauma or surgery
