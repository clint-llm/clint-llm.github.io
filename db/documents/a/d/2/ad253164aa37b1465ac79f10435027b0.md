Cardiac enzymes have been in use since the mid 20th century in evaluating patientsÂ with suspected acute myocardial infarction (MI). The biomarkers used back then are not clinically relevant today as more sensitive and specific biomarkers have replaced them. Troponins are the most widely recognized and important cardiac enzymes used in the diagnosis of acute myocardial ischemia in modern medicine. The majority of patients with an acute MI will have elevation in troponins within 2 to 3 hours of arrival at the emergency department, versus 6 to 12 hours with creatine kinase.
