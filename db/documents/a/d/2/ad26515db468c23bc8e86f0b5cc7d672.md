There are numerous types of services that can be provided by a simulation center; however, the use of standardized patients (SP) is one of the most unique. It is this service that must be executed, controlled, and maintained by the director of the standardized patient program to replicate or evoke the substantial aspects of a clinical encounter in a fully interactive fashion. Additionally, the roles and responsibilities of the standardized patient program director include ensuring the administration of these services, bridging the gap between facility and facilitator, and developing a ready workforce of individuals who are capable of engaging with and assessing learners in a realistic and reproducible manner.

There are organizations such as the Association of Standardized Patient Educators (ASPE), the Society of Simulation in Healthcare (SSH) and the International Nursing Association of Clinical Simulation Learning (INACSL) that help to set Standards of Best Practice (SOBP) and provide education to those working in this field.
