Hashimoto thyroiditis is a life long disorder with no cure; thus, it is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an endocrinologist, primary care provider, and an internist. The key is to follow up on the levels of thyroid hormone. Empirically prescribing one standard dose of levothyroxine may lead to hormone toxicity in some people. In addition, some patients may develop lymphoma, and thus a regular examination of the neck area is highly recommended.
