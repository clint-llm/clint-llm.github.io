Emphasis should be on maintaining the airway along with stabilization of breathing and circulation. Patients may present obtunded due to hyponatremia requiring endotracheal intubation. Though no formal contraindication to specific RSI agents exists, caution is necessary with ketamine which could potentiate the hyperadrenergic state of the already hypertensive and tachycardic patient. If rhabdomyolysis is a consideration, avoiding succinylcholine due to hyperkalemia should be considered in favor of rocuronium or vecuronium. Patients who present in severe toxicity within one hour of ingestion can receive activated charcoal PO or via an NG tube. Agitation should be controlled with benzodiazepines such as lorazepam or diazepam.  For the hyperthermic patient, evaporative cooling along with ice packs to the groin and axilla are beneficial.  More invasive measures may be necessary in extreme cases. If treatment fails, dantrolene is a consideration. Antipyretics, such as acetaminophen, have no role and can worsen an already compromised liver.

Patients with MDMA toxicity can present with seizures and hyponatremia. Those with seizures should receive benzodiazepines. If hyponatremia is the cause, patients should be free water restricted and treated with hypertonic saline. Urine output should be closely monitored with a foley. Caution is necessary with the judicious administration of IV fluids.

The undifferentiated tachycardic, hypertensive, hyperthermic, and altered patient necessitates a broad approach to treatment and evaluation since this constellation of findings are not specific to MDMA toxicity. Hence, patients may require a head CT, LP, and coverage with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
