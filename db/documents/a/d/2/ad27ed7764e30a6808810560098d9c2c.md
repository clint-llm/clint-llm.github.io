Melasma is a benign skin disorder that has no morbidity. The key reason why some patients seek treatment is aesthetic. Fortunately, melasma resolves on its own in most cases. Thus, healthcare workers including nurse practitioners, dermatologists, and primary care providers should educate the patient on avoiding the sun and discontinuing the trigger medications. There are dozens of treatments for melasma and none is superior to the other. In fact, some treatments like the laser may worsen the condition.

Patients who seek no treatment and avoid the sun will notice that the rash usually disappears in a few months.
