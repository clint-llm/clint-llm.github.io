COPD is one of the major leading causes of lung pathology worldwide. Tobacco smoke is the primary cause of the disease. Nicotine and the thousands of other toxic components contained in cigarettes lead to the formation of free radicals, causing alveolar damage.

COPD is a general term referring to the combination of chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is an obstructive disease, impairing expiration. The chronic bronchitis component causes severe hypoxemia due to airway inflammation and mucus production. The emphysematous component causes enlargement of air spaces, leading to decreased recoil and increased compliance, which ultimately causes air trapping.
