A bicuspid aortic valve is a common congenital heart defect in which the bicuspid aortic valve contains two cusps instead of the usual three. This leads to degenerative changes of the valve and is associated with dilatation of the aorta. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of bicuspid aortic valve and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the epidemiology of bicuspid aortic valve.
- Describe the presentation of patients with bicuspid aortic valve.
- Summarize the use of electrocardiogram and echocardiogram in the evaluation of the bicuspid aortic valve.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients affected by bicuspid aortic valve.
