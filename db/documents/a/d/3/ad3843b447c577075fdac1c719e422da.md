Patients with atrioventricular reentry tachycardia generally enjoy a favorable prognosis as the arrhythmia usually can be terminated when it persists. Similarly, the prognosis of WPW syndrome is also generally good;  however, in less than 1% of patients with preexcitation, sudden cardiac death can occur. In a meta-analysis that included 20 studies involving 1869 patients with preexcitation that did not undergo ablation, the rate of SVT was 16 events per 1000 person-years, and the rate of sudden cardiac death was 1.25 per 1000 person-years.
