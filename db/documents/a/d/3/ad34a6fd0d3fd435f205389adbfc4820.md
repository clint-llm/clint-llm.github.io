Diagnostic tests for latent TB have largely played the most influential factor in fighting the prevalence of this disease over time. Modern measures of testing through IGRAs and TST have proven paramount in decreasing the incidence of illness and controlling the spread. In addition, the development of vaccines for the prevention of TB in endemic areas and effective therapeutic regimens for the treatment of active TB have helped to reduce progression as well.

There are multiple facets of clinical significance in using interferon-gamma release assay over other testing methods for the diagnosis of latent TB. Factors to consider include: single patient visit at the time of sample collection, the possibility of collection results within twenty-four hours, prior BCG vaccination history, results not subject to reader bias, and reduced staff time with avoidance of unnecessary follow-up. However, in cases of immunosuppression, IGRAs should be approached with caution as the patient may not be able to develop an adequate immune response to latent TB for the test, resulting in false negatives. IGRAs should also not be used in children under five years of age for this same purpose. Additionally, IGRAs should not be used to monitor treatment response for TB.
