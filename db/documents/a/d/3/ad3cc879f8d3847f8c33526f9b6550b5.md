Various grading systems have been studied to grade the extent of pterygium preoperatively.

The simplest method is to measure the length of the fibrovascular stroma of pterygium, which over-hangs the cornea.

Verma et al. gave the classification based on the size of pterygium being measured from the limbus.

- Grade 1: 0-2 mm

- Grade 2: 2-4 mm

- Grade 3: >4 mm

Tan et al. gave a morphological classification of pterygium based on its transparency under the microscope.

- Grade T1: consists of atrophic pterygia, whose episcleral blood vessels which are present under the body of pterygium are clearly visible

- Grade T2: consists of intermediate pterygium which has characteristics between atrophic and fleshy pterygium

- Grade T3: consists of fleshy pterygia with episcleral vessels completely obscured

According to Sejal Maheshwari, the grading is as follows

- Grade I: pterygium between the limbus and a point midway between the limbus and the pupillary margin (temporal pupillary margin for temporal pterygium, and nasal pupillary margin for nasal pterygium)

- Grade II: head of the pterygium is present between a point midway between the limbus and the pupillary margin

- Grade II: pterygium that crosses the pupillary margin
