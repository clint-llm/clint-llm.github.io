The characteristic lesion of Sjogren syndrome is focal lymphocytic sialadenitis (FLS). FLS is a lesion of exocrine glands. Foci of lymphocyte-rich mononuclear cells infiltrate exocrine glandular tissue adjacent to blood vessels and excretory ducts. The foci are comprised predominantly of T lymphocytes. However, B lymphocytes, plasma cells, and other cell types are seen. With more severe disease the foci may become confluent. The infiltrating mononuclear cells, humoral factors such as antibodies and cytokines, or both are hypothesized to cause exocrine gland dysfunction resulting in diminished tear production by the lacrimal glands and diminished saliva production by salivary glands. Also, exocrine glands outside the head and neck may be involved resulting in skin, tracheobronchial and vaginal dryness as well as lung and kidney dysfunction. Rarely, malignant transformation of B lymphocytes can result in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Immune complexes may deposit in skin, joints and other organs resulting in a systemic vasculitis.
