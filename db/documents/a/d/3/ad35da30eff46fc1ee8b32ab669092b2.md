Oral mucosal cancer presents clinically in various ways depending on its location. Early disease may manifest as irregular white, red, or mixed patches on the mucosa. More established cancers appear as an indurated raised nodule, often with an ulcerated surface that may cause little pain.Â  If cancer has spread locally or systemically, patients may present with dysphagia, odynophagia, hoarse voice, otalgia, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy.

A thorough clinical examination of the entire oral cavity is key in identifying potential tumors and spotting concurrent tumors and/or spread. Examination with two tongue depressors and a good light source should be carried out in addition to neck examination to assess for any lymphadenopathy. Regional neck lymphadenopathy is recorded according to the anatomical levels I to VI. A flexible nasendoscopy should be performed to check for any concurrent oropharyngeal or laryngeal tumors.
