The posterior auricular artery will ascend towards the posterior side of the ear. The posterior auricular artery then perfuses the majority of the ear and the posterior region of the scalp. The posterior auricular artery will give off small auricular branches that perfuse the ear. Another branch that comes from the posterior auricular artery is the stylomastoid artery. The stylomastoid artery will perfuse the styloid process of the temporal bone, the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and the facial nerve. The facial nerve receives blood from the stylomastoid artery as it exits the stylomastoid foramen.

The posterior auricular artery forms anastomoses that will provide collateral blood flow to other regions on the face and head. Three main anastomoses form with the superior temporal artery, the parietal artery, and the anterior auricular artery.

The lymph drainage from the scalp near the ear and the ear itself is towards the posterior auricular lymph nodes. The lymph fluid will eventually drain into the main circulation via the right lymphatic duct and the thoracic duct. The right ear will drain towards the right lymphatic duct. While the left ear drains toward the thoracic duct.
