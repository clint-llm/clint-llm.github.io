Most patients recover well from a takotsubo event, recovery time varies among patients, and clinicians are still researching the long-term effects of the condition. Some patients experience a full recovery in a matter of weeks or over a few months. However, more recent research suggests there may be ongoing effects. Each patient needs to adopt a recovery pace suitable for their particular situation.

There are also takotsubo support groups, and the cardiac nurse can direct the patient to a cardiac rehabilitation class to assist in recovery.
