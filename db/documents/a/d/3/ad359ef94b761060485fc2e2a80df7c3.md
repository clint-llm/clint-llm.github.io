Fletcher et al. (1996) cited that there exists a clinicopathological correlation between the cytogenetic aberrations and the morphological subtypes of lipoma tumors. They concluded that such a correlation could serve as a significant diagnostic tool in difficult or histologically borderline cases.

Intradural lipomas of the spinal cord have also been shown to reflect a clinicopathological significance, whereby they occur most frequently in men between the ages of 20 to 40 years and are observed in the thoracic region of the spine, specifically at the cord. Symptoms, as described by respective patients, included pain, sensory changes, paraparesis, and urinary incontinence.

Tubulonodular lipomas are often associated with serious frontal lobe abnormalities. Tubolonodular lipomas are found anteriorly and associated with serious frontal abnormalities. Patients with either tubulonodular or curvilinear lipomas can present with a seizure disorder or headaches.
