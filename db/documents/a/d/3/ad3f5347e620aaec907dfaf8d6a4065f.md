The recurrent peroneal branch of the common peroneal nerve penetrates the articular capsule of the knee. It follows the vascular supply to the peripheral regions of the lateral meniscus and the anterior and posterior horns. Neural innervation is most concentrated at the meniscal horns where mechanoreceptors convert tension and compression during extremes of flexion and extension into an electrical nerve signal. Ruffini endings, Pacinian corpuscles, and Golgi tendon organs are all mechanoreceptors that researchers have identified in studies of human menisci, and the belief is thatÂ these neurosensory structures are critical for joint motion and proprioception.
