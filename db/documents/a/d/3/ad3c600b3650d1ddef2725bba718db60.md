Cyclic vomiting syndrome is characterized by recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting lasting from hours to days in the absence of identifiable pathology. Cyclic vomiting syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion, and oftentimes patients have undergone extensive, unrevealing workups over the course of months or even years. Some patients have even tried abdominal surgeries to decrease their symptoms but to no avail. Cyclic vomiting syndrome results in decreased quality of life for affected patients. Affected children often miss school, and affected adults often visit the emergency department several times per year and require time off work. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the causes of cyclic vomiting syndrome.
