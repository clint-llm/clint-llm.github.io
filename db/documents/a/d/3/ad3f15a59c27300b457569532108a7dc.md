Intermediate filaments, microtubules, and microfilaments compose the goblet cell cytoskeleton. Although actin plays a significant functional role, the contribution of actin is minimal in number.

Different glycosylation patterns may exist in the goblet cells of the large intestine, but they present in morphologically homogeneous cell populations. Due to these different patterns, researchers have suggested that goblet cells have various functional subclasses.Â One example of such a subclass is in carboxylated and sulfated goblet cells documented to secrete mucin within an acidic component.
