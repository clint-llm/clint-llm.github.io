Neuroma prevention and treatment are mostly dependent on the surgeon. Still, during the patient journey, many healthcare professionals are encountered, and they must know about the prevention and treatment of neuromas to signpost, appropriately manage, and refer patients, and must function as an interprofessional team. Surgical teams have to be vigilant about intraoperative nerve damage and adequately repair as non-repaired injuries have a high risk of neuroma formation.

If a patient sustains an injury in the community and attends a minor injuries unit or an emergency department, it is vital that triaging and treating staff do not overlook checking for sensation and motor function. If nerve damage is suspected, it is essential to refer the patient to the appropriate specialist team.

While surgery is the primary form of treatment, patients can try various conservative pain-relieving pharmacological and non-pharmacological options. If they work, the patient does not have to have surgery. For pharmacological options, a pharmacist should participate in optimizing pain control and helping prevent opioid dependence. Nursing staff will prove invaluable in all phases of management regardless of whether it is surgical or conservative and can serve as a gatekeeper to the clinician for patient concerns, as well as their monitoring duties. Using this interprofessional approach will drive optimal patient outcomes. [Level V]
