First responders significantly enhance patient care when an appropriate history and physical evaluation is performed in the field, especially in cases involving high-energy trauma like motor vehicle accidents. Noting the vehicle size, speed, location (i.e., highway, side of a vehicle damaged), airbag deployment, seatbelt use, extrication time, etc., can be invaluable to emergency and trauma physicians when deciding on a treatment plan. Whenever possible, distal forearm injuries should be immobilized at the scene to minimize discomfort, displacement, and damage to critical surrounding structures. Have splint materials available at the scene, but even temporary materials like cardboard can provide enough stabilization for safe transport for definitive care.

Once in an acute care facility, triage should determine whether the patient warrants a possible trauma activation or is safe to be seen non-emergently. Initiate Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) if there is a concern for life-threatening injuries. Nurses, physicians, and other support staff should take histories and perform secondary and tertiary surveys to rule out occult injuries. Open fractures require urgent surgical evaluation, exploration with washout, antibiotics, and tetanus prophylaxis. Especially in circumstances of severe instability or soft tissue compromise, urgent consultation to orthopedic or hand surgery services should be done.
