As mentioned, AEFs form by either primary or secondary causes. In primary cases, aneurysmal development is the most common cause of mechanical thinning of the aortic and enteral outermost layers as they rub against each other with each successive cardiac pulsation and gastrointestinal peristalsis, respectively.

Secondary AEFs most commonly form following aortic stent-graft placement. The proximity of the graft material to the neighboring enteral tract allows for mechanical rubbing, which can result in erosion into the enteral tract when not sufficiently bolstered by soft tissue. This erosion can be rapidly exacerbated as enteral bacteria translocate into the bloodstream and seed the graft leading to fistula development, sepsis, and graft infection.
