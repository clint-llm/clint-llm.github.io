Clinical assessment, as well as imaging studies, help to outline the factors involved in the prognosis of a hamstring injury. Patients with a grade I and II injuries or a negative MRI study, an ability to walk pain-free within 24 hours of an injury, or short muscle tear tend to have a good prognosis in recovering from the injury as demonstrated by less time to return to play. On the other hand, Grade III injury in MRI, hamstring injuries with an avulsion fracture of bones, proximal tendon injuries, injury with large and deep hematoma tend to incline towards a poor outcome from the injury and longer recovery time. An injury sustained from low-speed stretching movements has a poorer prognosis compared to the injury sustained during high-speed activities.
