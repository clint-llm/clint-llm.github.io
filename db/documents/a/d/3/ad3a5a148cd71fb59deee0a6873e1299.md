Numerous occupations may place workers at risk for exposure to silica dust across a wide variety of industries. [3] High-risk occupations include road repair, concrete manufacturing, coal mining, brick working, and rock excavation. Also at risk are workers employed in stone cutting, petroleum extraction, steel working, sandblasting, and others. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, there are over two million workers exposed to some form of respirable silicon dioxide on a regular basis. Improved awareness and safety measures in the workplace have led to a substantial decrease in this disease over the last several decades; however, safeguards remain imperfect and there continue to be new cases of silicosis that arise.
