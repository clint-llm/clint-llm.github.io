Several different factors and variables often confound efforts to determine the precise incidence of restenosis. In the pre-stent era, the incidence of restenosis ranged between 32 and 55% of all angioplasties. This figure dropped to 17 to 41% in the BMS era.

The ISR rate is often higher in the setting of multivessel disease compared with single-vessel disease, as demonstrated in the study of Zhao et al; the occurrence of ISR was significantly higher in patients with two-vessel (OR: 2.922; 95% CI: 1.266–6.745; P=0.012) or three-vessel disease (OR: 2.574; 95% CI: 1.128–5.872; P=0.025) when compared with those with one-vessel disease.

ISR is an important predictor for future restenosis, and these lesions pose numerous challenges for successful PCI. In the ICARUS Cooperation study, a total of 546 patients treated with drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty for drug-eluting stent (DES) restenosis had followup with angiography at 6 to 9 months. Researchers observed recurrent restenosis in 101 (20.8%) patients. Likewise, on multivariate analysis, increased lesion length, and reduced vessel size were independently associated with recurrent restenosis.
