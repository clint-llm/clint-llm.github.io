The beginning injury is to the extensor mechanism, typically a central slip insult. This results in a lax volar plate and a tight triangular ligament. The laxity of the volar plate relates to the hyperextension of the PIP joint, and the intrinsic contracture relates to the imbalance of forces on the PIP joint and DIP joint.
