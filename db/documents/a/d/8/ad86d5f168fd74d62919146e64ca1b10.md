Avulsion fractures may be small or have a relatively benign appearance to those unfamiliar with these injuries. The uninformed provider may be inclined to deem these injuries inconsequential, when in fact they are a sign of potentially more severe underlying damage to other major stabilizing structures of a joint.

Accurate diagnosis is paramount because treatments and potential additional workup differ between each type of avulsion fracture.

Patients with prior chronic apophysitis, or repetitive avulsion injury at the site of tendon insertions, may be at increased risk for acute avulsion injuries.

Avulsions are best cared for by an interprofessional team consisting of primary care providers, emergency medical personnel, radiologists, orthopedists, specialty trained nurses, physiatrists, and physical therapists. [Level 5]
