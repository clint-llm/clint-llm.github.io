To understand the mechanism of LGCCs, one must understand the physiology of neurotransmission and action potentials. At rest, a neuron’s membrane potential exhibits -90 millivolts, produced by a high internal concentration of K+ and a high external concentration of Na+. As a neuron gets stimulated, the membrane potential begins to increase as the membrane becomes more permeable to Na+ via Na+/K+ pumps and voltage-gated Na+ channels. As the membrane potential reaches 0 millivolts, the neuron depolarizes allowing large amounts of Na+ into the neuron causing the membrane potential to “overshoot” as high as +60 millivolts. As the neuron returns to the resting state, it goes through a repolarization stage in which voltage-gated K+ channels and K+ leak channels return the neuron’s membrane potential to resting at -90 millivolts.

Relating to LGCCs and their mechanism of causing inhibitory signaling, both GABA-A receptors and glycine receptors work to increase intracellular concentrations of Cl- to put the neuron in a state of hyperpolarization. For GABA-A receptors these work in a pulsatile fashion opening and closing as each GABA molecule binds and unbinds their allosteric active sites.
