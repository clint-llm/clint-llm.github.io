The clinical problem posed by this benign tumor is for the surgeon or surgical oncologist who encounters such a lesion during a laparotomy for another malignant lesion. Typically, the surgeon will perform a liver biopsy for a frozen section once this lesion is encountered. It can be difficult to distinguish benign hamartomas from metastatic disease in the liver. A pathologist who receives the specimen for the frozen section and is unaware of this entity may label the lesion as metastatic carcinoma or Carolis disease. However, these lesions do not communicate with bile ducts, and no treatment is necessary.
