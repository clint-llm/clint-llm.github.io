The diagnosis of SVAS is confirmed by echocardiography. MRI with angiography also provides excellent anatomic detail of SVAS.

- Electrocardiography: Left ventricular hypertrophy with strain pattern is usually seen. Biventricular or right ventricular hypertrophy is seen if the pulmonary arteries are also stenosed.

- CXR: Typically, normal with mild to moderate cardiomegaly in some cases depending on the severity of stenosis.

- Echocardiography: Shows the supravalvular stenosis and its type. The sinuses of Valsalva are dilated. The aortic annulus diameter is greater than that of the Sino tubular junction. The ascending aortic arch and the aorta appear to be small or normal in size.

- Doppler examination: Typically overestimates the gradient when compared with that obtained at cardiac catheterization.

- Cardiac angiography: Necessary for accurate measurement of the gradient across the left ventricular outflow tract (and across the stenosis), and to determine the status of the coronary arteries.
