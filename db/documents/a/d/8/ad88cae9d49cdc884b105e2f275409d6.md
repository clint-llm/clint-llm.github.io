There are three main mechanisms that can cause an ischemic stroke; thrombosis, hypoperfusion, or embolic phenomena.

Embolic strokes occur when clots migrate from the source to block more distal cerebral arteries causing cessation of brain tissue perfusion and ischemia. The embolic source can be cardiac, aortic, arterial, from a venous origin in the pelvis or lower limbs with the presence of a cardiac shunt resulting in paradoxical embolism, or an unknown source. Therefore, careful evaluation and workup for an embolic source with transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiogram if needed in addition to Holter monitoring and vascular imaging is mandatory to guide appropriate evidence-based treatment and prevent stroke recurrence.

Emboli can happen due to different mechanisms including blood stasis in an abnormal, structurally enlarged left cardiac chamber such as left ventricular aneurysm with subsequent thrombus formation, material detachment from structurally abnormal calcific degenerative valves, or embolus passage from the venous to the arterial circulation (paradoxical embolism) because of the presence of right to left cardiac shunt such as Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO).

Ischemic strokes of cardioembolic source are generally the most severe ischemic stroke subtype. Although cardiac emboli can be variable in size, the emboli arising from blood stasis within the left cardiac chambers are usually large in size and may cause large vessel occlusions such as Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) and basilar artery occlusions, and hence severe strokes with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. They also carry a higher risk of stroke recurrence.

The embolism risk is variable. The most common potential high-risk cardiac conditions that can cause embolic ischemic stroke include atrial fibrillation (AF), recent myocardial infarction, mechanical prosthetic valve, dilated myocardiopathy, and mitral rheumatic stenosis respectively. However other identifiable high-risk cardioembolic sources include infective bacterial endocarditis, nonbacterial marantic endocarditis, and left atrial myxoma which is a rare condition but the most common tumor originating from the heart.

Minor cardioembolism sources include patent foramen ovale (PFO), calcific aortic valve stenosis, mitral valve annular calcification, atrial septal aneurysm, ventricular (VSD), or atrial septal defects (ASD).

AF is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and cause of cardioembolic stroke. This is related to associated low cardiac output, blood stasis which is associated with increased concentration of prothrombotic fibrinogen, D-dimer, and von Willebrand factor, and results in thrombus formation within the atrial appendage and hence increased risk for cardioembolic strokes. Prevalence of AF increases with age particularly in people over 65 years reaching a peak of 5% in this group age. Hypertensive heart disease remains the most common underlying cause of AF in developed countries. Other associated causes of AF include heavy alcohol drinking, valvular heart disease, especially in developing countries, and thyrotoxicosis.

Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is another common risk factor of embolic strokes mainly because of left ventricular dysfunction, low cardiac output, blood stasis, mural thrombus formation, and associated arrhythmias including AF. Ischemic cardiomyopathy increases the risk of embolism. The stroke risk is inversely proportional to the ejection fraction (EF). Studies showed that patients with an EF of less than 28% had a relative risk of stroke of 1.86 compared to patients with an EF greater than 35%. Data showed that about 2.5% of patients with acute MI will develop embolic stroke within the first 2 to 4 weeks following the infarction. The presence of a mural thrombus that may be mobile or protrudes into the ventricles carries a very high risk of 22 % of developing embolic stroke within the first 2 to 4 weeks. However ischemic strokes can also be a late complication to MI as data showed that 11% of affected female patients and 8% of affected male patients will have an ischemic stroke within 6 years following acute MI.

Valvular heart disease carries embolic stroke risk even with the absence of associated AF. Mechanical prosthetic valves is a well-recognized risk factor. The mitral mechanical valves carry a higher risk than aortic mechanical valves, the risk is particularly higher in patients inadequately treated, resistant, or noncompliant with warfarin. Another cause is calcific aortic stenosis. In developing countries, rheumatic heart disease affecting the mitral and aortic valves remains a well-recognized cause of embolic stroke in young patients.

Treatment of patients with septic embolic strokes from bacterial infective endocarditis is challenging because of the high risk of hemorrhagic transformation and multiple emboli. 10% of affected patients will develop embolic stroke particularly early within the first 2 weeks of the disease course even during the administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy. The risk of multiple strokes is higher in infected prosthetic valve cases with staphylococcus aureus. Infective endocarditis can also cause mycotic aneurysms, which is a less common complication (1-5%) however it may be a fatal one as these aneurysms may enlarge and rupture causing severe intracranial bleeding. Endocarditis can also be non-infective associated with underlying malignancy or autoimmune disease such as SLE anti-phospholipid syndrome.

Although myxomas are rare, they are the most common primary cardiac tumors. They account for more than 50 primary cardiac tumors cases and they usually manifest clinically by causing thromboembolic strokes occurring mostly in young patients. Less commonly is papillary fibroelastoma.

COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is a novel virus that is proven to be associated with increased risk of strokes whether embolic or small vessel disease strokes. Embolic strokes are most likely related to the associated hypercoagulable state and associated with high inflammatory markers including CRP, D-Dimer, and ferritin. However, it is still unknown if anticoagulation may decrease the risk of embolic strokes in this category of patients. Associated cardiac complications such as myocarditis with decreased EF causing blood stasis may result in embolic strokes as well.
