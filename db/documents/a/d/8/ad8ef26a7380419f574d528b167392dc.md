As mentioned above, depolarizing muscle agents bind to all acetylcholine receptors of the autonomic nervous system, and when targeting cardiac muscarinic receptors, patients may develop bradycardia, especially in repeat doses. There is a relative contraindication in a patient with bradycardia. In addition, the defasciculations result in a large amount of potassium release and oxygen depletion.

Depolarizing muscle agents are contraindicated in cases of neurologic injuries, such as a cerebral vascular accident or spinal cord injury or severe tissue injury, including trauma or burns. This results from post-synaptic receptor up-regulation that typically occurs within three to five days. These injuries place the patient at risk for life-threatening hyperkalemia. Of note, the risk of hyperkalemia is not associated with decreased potassium clearance; however, attention should be given to those who have chronically elevated potassium levels, such as renal failure patients.

Depolarizing agents are absolutely contraindicated in patients with degenerative neuromuscular disorders or a history of malignant hyperthermia. Undiagnosed children with skeletal muscle myopathy, such as Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, are at risk for rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia.
