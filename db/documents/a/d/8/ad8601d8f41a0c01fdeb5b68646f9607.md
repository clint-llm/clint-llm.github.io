In the majority of cases, discitis stems from one of three inciting events: direct inoculation, hematogenous spread, or less commonly contiguous spread.Staphylococcus aureus.Staphylococcus, Escherichia coli,
Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Salmonella spp.

Hematogenous spread of disease, such as systemic infection, or bacteremia, can lead to seeding of the vertebrae first, followed by the disc, causing subsequent infection.

Spinal arteries supply blood to vertebrae and eventually to the intervertebral discs. In children, the blood vessels extend from the cartilaginous endplates into the nucleus pulposus, whereas in adults these vascular supplies degenerate, and only extend into the annulus fibrosis.
