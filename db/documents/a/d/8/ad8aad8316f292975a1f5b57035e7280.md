The posterior tibial artery is superficial and readily palpable just behind the medial malleolus. For this reason, it is used during the physical exam to assess for peripheral vascular disease, which affects about 12% of the population.

The posterior tibial artery can also be involved in compartment syndrome. Compartment syndrome may occur acutely following blunt force injury or trauma, or as a chronic, exertional syndrome commonly seen in athletes.

Aneurysms of the posterior tibial artery, although rare, have been reported. False aneurysms (pseudoaneurysms) are more common and are commonly associated with trauma.
