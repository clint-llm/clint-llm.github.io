There are always risks involved when performing a peripheral nerve bock. The following are complications that can result: nerve injury, allergic reaction, hematoma, infection, and local anesthetic systemic toxicity.

A 20% lipid emulsion administration is effective for local anesthetic toxicity. A bolus dose of 1.5 mL/kg based on the lean body mass of lipid emulsion should be given over 1 minute and followed by an infusion of 0.25 mL/kg/min. This continuous infusion should continue until reaching hemodynamic stability. If hemodynamic stability is not obtained, then another bolus of 1.5 mL/kg (for a maximum of two total doses of 20% lipid emulsion), followed by a continuous infusion at the increased dose of 0.5 mL/kg/min should be considered.
