In general, the technician or other staff performing the test should observe the following steps

- The patient should rest for approximately 10 minutes before starting the test.

- Measure the baseline heart rate and oxygen saturation. These should be continuously monitored to identify the lowest oxygen saturation, which may occur before the end of the test.

- The patient's baseline dyspnea is then rated using the Borg scale.

- Set the lap counter and timer.

- Provide the patient with detailed instructions on how to proceed during the test.

- The patient is then positioned at the starting line and allowed to walk unassisted once the test begins.

- The technician should only address the patient during the test. As each minute passes, the patient should be informed of the time left to complete the test and encouraged to continue.

- At the end of the test, record the Borg dyspnea and fatigue levels, check heart rate and oxygen saturation, the number of laps from the counter or marks on the worksheet, and total distance walked.
