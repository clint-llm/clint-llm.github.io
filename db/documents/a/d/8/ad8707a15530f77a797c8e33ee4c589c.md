ECM1 is a glycoprotein that plays various extracutaneous roles, including regulation of endochondral bone and cartilage formation, endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and dendritic cell differentiation.

In the skin, ECM1 interacts with basement membrane-specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan core protein (HSPG), also known as perlecan, and other proteins important for ECM structure and tissue remodeling like matrix metalloproteinase-9, fibulin-3, and laminin 332.

Mutations within the ECM1 gene lead to compromised protein-protein interactions and disrupted tissue homeostasis.
