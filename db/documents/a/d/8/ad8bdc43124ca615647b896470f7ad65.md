Constitutional symptoms characterize a very nonspecific early acute inflammatory phase seen in Takayasu arteritis which includes fever, malaise, muscle aches, weight loss, and anorexia. Most patients do not seek treatment until signs of the “pulseless” phase occur, in which symptoms are usually secondary to arterial insufficiencies; these include hypertension in renovascular stenosis, neurologic manifestations as seen with carotid artery occlusion, or upper limb claudication as seen in upper extremity ischemia secondary to stenosis. Thus, delayed diagnosis is quite common. Severe debilitating upper or lower extremity ischemia often leads to diminished or absent pulses, hence the name "pulseless disease," or possibly a vascular bruit. Other potential late findings worth noting include accelerated atherosclerosis or heart failure.
