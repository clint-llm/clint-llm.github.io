The pathophysiology of pituitary cancer is genetically related, but most mutations are unknown and actively being studied. There are ongoing efforts to determine the association with specific gene mutations.

There are six hormones produced and secreted by the anterior pituitary, which include luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and growth hormone (GH). The hormones stored in the posterior pituitary gland are oxytocin and anti-diuretic hormone (ADH).

The release of LH and FSH is controlled by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, while ACTH hormone secretion is controlled by the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus. TSH is released after being stimulated by the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. The hypothalamic hormones that control the release of GH are regulated by two hormones, including growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which stimulates the release, and somatostatin, which inhibits the release of GH. The release of prolactin is inhibited by dopamine release from the hypothalamus.

Pituitary gland tumors are rarely cancerous and mostly benign. Pituitary tumors may function with hormone production or non-functioning without producing hormones. Functioning tumors cause different types of signs and symptoms depending on the specific hormone they secrete.
