Methanol toxicity can occur via ingestion, dermal absorption, and inhalation. The most common reported ingestions are secondary to drinking windshield washer fluid as a suicide attempt. Accidental ingestions can occur via exploratory behavior in children. Methanol has also been abused as a substitute for ethanol with agents such as food-warming fuel, and carburetor cleaner as a source of abuse via inhalation.
