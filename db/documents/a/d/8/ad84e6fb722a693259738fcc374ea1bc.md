The risk factors for the development of optic atrophy have been denoted by the mnemonic: VIN DITTCH MD. This mnemonic denotes the following conditions= V: Vascular; I: Inflammatory and infectious; N: Neoplastic or compressive; D: Primary demyelinating disease or idiopathic optic neuritis; T(2): Toxic and traumatic; C: Congenital; H: Hereditary; M: Metabolic and endocrine causes; D: Degenerative.

A retrospective case series of non-glaucomatous optic atrophy in Malaysia found the main etiologies to be: space-occupying intracranial lesions (26%), congenital/hereditary diseases (13%), hydrocephalus (12%), trauma (12%) and vascular causes (12%).

Optic atrophy can be classified based on the various causes which may lead to this condition. Various conditions in which optic atrophy may occur can be classified as follows:

- Congenital optic neuropathies:

- Isolated: These include dominant and recessive optic atrophy, Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy, and Behr’s hereditary optic atrophy.
- Optic atrophy associated with systemic disease or neurological conditions.

- Extrinsic compression: Pituitary adenoma, intracranial meningioma, aneurysms, craniopharyngioma, mucoceles, papillomas, metastasis.

- Intrinsic optic nerve tumors: Optic nerve glioma, optic nerve sheath meningioma, and lymphoma.

- Vascular disease: Arteritic and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION, NAION), central retinal artery occlusion, carotid artery occlusion, cranial arteritis.

- Inflammatory disease: Demyelinating optic neuritis (Multiple sclerosis, Devic’s disease), sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarthritis nodosa, Churg-Strauss syndrome, meningitis, orbital cellulitis.

- Infection: Syphilis, tuberculosis, Lyme disease, Aspergillosis, Cryptococcus, chickenpox, measles, mumps.

- Toxic and nutritional optic neuropathies: Nutritional amblyopia, toxic amblyopia, thyroid ophthalmopathy, juvenile diabetes, tobacco, methyl alcohol, and drug addiction. Optic atrophy due to toxic or nutritional causes is usually symmetrical and insidious in onset.

- Trauma: To optic nerve, optic nerve sheath hematoma, damage due to orbital fracture or foreign body.

- Swollen optic nerve: Papilledema, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION).

- Retinal disease: Retinitis pigmentosa, macular dystrophies.
