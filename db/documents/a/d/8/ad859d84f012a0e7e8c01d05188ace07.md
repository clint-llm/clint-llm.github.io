The treatment of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is surgical removal, ideally with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), a surgical technique that ensures complete histopathologic margin control at the time of surgery. MMS is preferred over wide local excision as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans tends to have an unpredictable subclinical extension. In select situations or when Mohs micrographic surgery is not available, wide local excision may be performed with 2- to 4 cm margins. However, local recurrence is relatively common with wide local excision even with clear surgical margins. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans treated with wide local excision has a recurrence rate of about 7.3% compared to a recurrence rate of about 1% when treated with MMS. If feasible, modified wide local excision with horizontal sectioning, as opposed to the usual histologic vertical processing (‘bread-loafing”), and detailed mapping can be performed to decrease the likelihood of local recurrence. As spread to the lymph nodes is extremely rare, regional node dissection is not recommended.

The chemotherapy agent imatinib mesylate, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, can be used for recurrent, unresectable, and metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans in adults. Imatinib mesylate competitively inhibits ATP binding to the PDGF-beta receptor, a tyrosine kinase. This slows down kinase activity, limiting the growth of the tumor, and promoting apoptosis. Patients with the t(17;22) translocation show a greater response to imatinib mesylate, and thus screening for this translocation should be performed before initiating therapy. Testing for the translocation can be performed using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Side effects of imatinib mesylate include gastrointestinal upset, edema, fatigue, anemia, and rash. The majority of patients with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans with the translocation respond favorably to imatinib mesylate therapy, with studies suggesting a response rate of approximately 65%. The duration of therapy varies. Some sources recommend 6 months of therapy, but this may be extended if needed. Alternatively, radiation therapy may also be used for unresectable or recurrent tumors, and adjuvant radiation may decrease the risk of local recurrence.

As local recurrence is common, patients require close clinical follow-up after completing treatment. The risk of recurrence is highest in the first 3 years after treatment, and thus patients should be evaluated every 3 to 6 months during this time and at least annually thereafter. Some sources advocate baseline and serial chest CT scans, especially in the case of fibrosarcomatous dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, which has a higher risk of local recurrence and metastasis. Otherwise, routine imaging is not required unless there are symptoms to suggest metastasis.
