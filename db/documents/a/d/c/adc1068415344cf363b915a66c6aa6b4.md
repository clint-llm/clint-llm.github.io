Individuals with Lynch syndrome tend to have fewer than ten adenomatous polyps cumulatively in their life. Adenomas are commonly seen in patients younger than the age of 40 and frequently have a villous growth pattern with moderate to high-grade dysplasia. Adenomas in individuals with Lynch syndrome tend to transform to cancers more rapidly than in individuals in the general population with adenomas. Both adenomas and colon tumors associated with Lynch syndrome occur most frequently on the right side of the colon. Tumors are also noted to have a characteristic phenotype, including poor differentiated medullary-type carcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, signet-ring cells, and a Crohn-like reaction with infiltrating lymphocytes.
