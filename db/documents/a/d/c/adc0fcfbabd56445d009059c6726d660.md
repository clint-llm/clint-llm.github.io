There is no antidote to the polio vaccine, nor have longterm negative effects of the inactivated polio vaccine been recorded.

Toxicity related to the oral polio vaccine is not specific to the formulation, but rather as would beÂ expected with any live vaccine. As previously stated, live vaccines are to be avoided in immunocompromised persons.
