Patients with TIF have a prior history of tracheostomy. Some of these patients will present with a small amount of bleeding 24 to 48 hours before the occurrence of massive hemorrhage. This is called the sentinel or herald bleed, and it can occur in up to 30% of patients with TIF. Patients will present with bleeding, often pulsatile, from around the tracheostomy site. They can also have hemoptysis (which may be associated with a threatened airway) or febrile episodes. Patients may exhibit hemodynamic instability and hemorrhagic shock depending on the severity of the bleeding. The majority of patients present within 3-6 weeks following a tracheostomy.
