Vaginal bleeding

- Confirmation of an IUP in the setting of vaginal bleeding in a first-trimester pregnancy effectively rules out an ectopic pregnancy if the pregnancy was conceived without reproductive endocrinology assistance. The diagnosis, in this case, is usually a threatened abortion. NDIUP in the setting of vaginal bleeding warrants further workup for an ectopic pregnancy.

Positive pregnancy test, asymptomatic

- Emergency physicians are often the first providers to ultrasound first trimester pregnancies, as obstetricians will ask a patient to schedule her first appointment at approximately 8 weeks gestation according to her last menstrual period. For this reason, patients will often present to the ED after finding out they are pregnant from a home pregnancy test, sometimes for no other reason other than to formally diagnose the pregnancy. Under these circumstances, an ultrasound should be attempted to confirm the presence of an IUP, as well as to date the fetus if present. While it was once thought the earlier a pregnancy is dated, the more accurate the gestational age, the difference may be too small to justify.

Abdominal pain

- Confirmation of an IUP in the setting of abdominal pain effectively rules out an ectopic pregnancy if the pregnancy was conceived without reproductive endocrinology assistance, given the rare incidence of heterotopic pregnancy in these women.

- Confirmation of a live ectopic pregnancy, defined as a gestational sac containing a yolk sac or fetal heartbeat outside the uterus or with an endomyometrial mantle less than or equal to 7 mm (which supports the diagnosis of an interstitial ectopic pregnancy) should lead to prompt obstetrician consultation for operative management.

- In an hCG-positive female with abdominal pain, where the uterus reveals NDIUP as well as free fluid in the pelvis, prompt obstetrician consultation should be sought. If there is additional free fluid in Morison’s pouch, these findings carry high specificity for ectopic pregnancy needing operative management.

Hypotension

- Free peritoneal fluid in Morison’s pouch or the pelvis in a patient with an NDIUP who has a positive urine pregnancy test is highly specific for an ectopic pregnancy requiring operative management.

Hyperemesis gravidarum

- A twin gestation or molar pregnancy may explain significant nausea and vomiting.

If the transabdominal pelvic ultrasound shows NDIUP, a transvaginal ultrasound is indicated. If a female is or has received reproductive endocrine assistance in getting pregnant, early consultation with her reproductive endocrinologist is recommended.
