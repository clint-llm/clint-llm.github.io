Before initiating treatment with tofacitinib, the patient should be tested for active or latent TB. In the case of a positive active or latent TB test, patients should be treated accordingly prior to receiving treatment with tofacitinib. While on therapy with tofacitinib, patients should also be monitored for TB routinely throughout. A baseline complete blood count (CBC) should be done before starting tofacitinib and 1Â to 2 months following initiation, and every 12 weeks after that. Subjects with hemoglobin (Hb) levels below 9 g/dL, absolute lymphocyte count below 500 cells/mm^3, and absolute neutrophil count below 1000 cells/mm^3 should not be started on therapy.

Baseline lipid levels should be obtained and monitored 4 to 8 weeks after initiation of treatment. Dose-dependent increases in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol may occur. Patients receiving treatment should be routinely monitored for the development of any severe infections. Treatment should be halted if any bacterial, viral, fungal, or opportunistic infections ensue. Liver function tests should also be monitored routinely as tofacitinib may cause hepatotoxicity. If hepatic injury from tofacitinib is suspected, treatment should be interrupted. Use in severe hepatic impairment is not recommended.
