The choroid plexuses are highly vascularized epithelial tissue masses that contain fenestrated blood vessels. Besides producing CSF, they are the main structural components of the blood-brain barrier. Along with providing structural support to the blood-brain barrier, they also offer a biochemical barrier, releasing toxins and drugs taken up by cells in the blood-CSF barrier.

The arteries that supply the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle originate from multiple areas of the cerebellar arteries and pass by the pons and medulla. One study showed that the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA), and the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) supplied the majority of blood flow to the fourth ventricle choroid plexus. The AICA was responsible for supplying the plexus near the cerebellopontine angles, as well as a portion of the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle into the lateral apertures. The PICA supplied the choroid plexus in the median aperture and roof of the fourth ventricle.
