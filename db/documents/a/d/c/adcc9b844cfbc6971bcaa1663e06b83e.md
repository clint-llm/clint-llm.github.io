The pathogenesis of the formation of spiradenomas is not completely understood. A defect in the tumor suppressor gene, CYLD, is thought to contribute to their development in Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, which also features multiple cylindromas.

Historically, spiradenomas were thought to be of eccrine lineage, though many lesions have been shown to demonstrate apocrine differentiation. Alternatively, one study using immunohistochemical markers for stem cells and CD200 suggests that both spiradenomas and cylindromas are follicular-based tumors as opposed to being derived from eccrine or apocrine glands. Other studies have shown spiradenomas to have either apocrine or folliculosebaceous differentiation.

Increased expression of p53 has been observed in malignant spiradenomas.
