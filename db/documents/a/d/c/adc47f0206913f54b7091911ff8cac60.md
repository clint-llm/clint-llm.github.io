The medial lemniscus is a second-order neuron of the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway (DCML), which, with the somatotopic arrangement, transports the sensory spinothalamic information of conscious proprioception, vibration, fine touch, and 2-point discrimination of skin and joints of the body and head; from the caudal medulla to the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus, and subsequently the primary somatosensory cortex. The medial lemniscus (second-order neuron of DCML) commences at the nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus at the caudal medulla; the arcuate fibers decussate at the caudal medulla and ascend via the medial lemniscus contralaterally in the brainstem until synapsing at the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus, the point at which the third-order neuron of the DCML pathway commences. The third-order neuron ascends from the ventral posterolateral nucleus until synapsing with the primary somatosensory region of the brain cortex. Due to the unique somatosensory information and location of this pathway, the dorsal column-medial lemniscus tract may be used as an important clinical clue to pinpoint a possibleÂ site of injury and manage the patient accordingly.
