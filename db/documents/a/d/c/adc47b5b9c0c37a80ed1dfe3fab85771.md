There are no relevant recommendations available in the literature to distinguish patients who may benefit from the application of ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring. The present proposals are as follow

- To establish the link between palpitations and abnormal heart rhythms

- To diagnose the cause of syncope or near syncope

- To evaluate transient episodes of cardiac arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia

- Patients with neurologic events when transient atrial fibrillation or flutter is suspected

- To monitor the efficacy and safety of pharmacological or nonpharmacological therapies

- To detect proarrhythmic responses to antiarrhythmic therapy in patients at high risk

- To analyze the function of pacemakers or other implantable devices

- To evaluate prognosis

- To stratify the risk of sudden cardiac death

The selection between the common two to three lead or the twelve lead Holter ECG monitoring depends mostly on the desired goal. If it is being used to monitor heart rate and its rhythm then two to three leads are sufficient. In contrast, if the purpose is to establish the origin of premature beats/ dysrhythmias or tachycardia, then a twelve-lead Holter electrocardiography is the preferred modality of choice.

Selection of which monitor to use depends on the frequency of symptoms. When symptoms are continuous, a routine twelve-lead electrocardiogram is sufficient to make a diagnosis. Usually, Cardiologists use the Holter monitor for intermittent symptoms. If symptoms rarely occur, the devices for the longer duration like Implantable loop recorder (ILR) or event monitor can be used.

A twelve-lead Holter monitor is very accurate and can instantly diagnose supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), ventricular tachycardia (VT), atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, monomorphic or Polymorphic VTs, long QT syndrome, supraventricular premature complexes, ventricular premature complexes, dominant atrioventricular accessory pathways, atrioventricular block, right and left bundle branch block, and left anterior and posterior fascicular block.

Current European guidelines endorse the use of an intracardiac monitor for patients diagnosed with a cryptogenic stroke.
