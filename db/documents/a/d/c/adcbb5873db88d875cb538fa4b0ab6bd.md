Bursitis is the result of inflammation that leads to increased fluid production from the synovial cells that line the bursa. Increased fluid production leads to increasing pressure of the bursa and in the result, increased pain. Trauma or puncture of skin at the site of a bursa can lead to the direct introduction of bacteria and subsequent inflammation and infection. Overlying skin and soft tissue infections such as cellulitis can also lead to secondary infectious bursitis. In deep bursa, anÂ infectious spread is more likely related to spread from blood or joint infections such as septic arthritis.
