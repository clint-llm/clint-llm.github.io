No laboratory studies are necessary. Sebaceous hyperplasia is diagnosed based on clinical examination or assisted by dermoscopy. A biopsy can be appropriate in differential diagnosis with basal cell carcinoma. Histopathological examination of sebaceous hyperplasia lesions reveals enlarged glands with normal morphology. Inside each gland, mature sebaceous lobules connect to a dilated principal sebaceous duct.
