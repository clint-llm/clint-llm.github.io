In histochemistry, Sertoli cells stand out when stained for the androgen receptors. The androgen receptor is only on the nucleus of the Sertoli cell. Because of this, the androgen receptor can be reliably identified with the Sertoli cell. There are, however, other histochemistry and cytochemistry markers for which the Sertoli cell would also stain positively. These markers include SOX9, WT1, the GATA binding proteins, and many more. It is important to note that the SOX9 marker represents the SRY coded gene, and the WT1 gene represents a Wilms tumor.
