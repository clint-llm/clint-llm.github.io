In IFR, the same pressure wires utilized in FFR are passed to a point distal to a stenotic lesion. During a period of diastole known as the “wave-free period,” IFR then calculates the ratio of the distal coronary artery pressure (Pd) to the pressure within the aortic outflow tract (Pa). During this timeframe completing blood flow complicating these measurements is negligible.
