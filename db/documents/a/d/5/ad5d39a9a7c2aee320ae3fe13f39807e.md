The optic nerve head represents the distal portion of the optic nerve. It is the point where axons of the RGCs exit out of the eyeball. The arterial supply to this segment of the optic nerve is through a capillary net originating from the retinal arterioles. Due to the presence of the capillary network and total internal reflection of light in the axons, the optic nerve head appears yellow-pink. The degeneration of RGCs, axons, and capillaries leads to the appearance of the pale optic disc seen in optic atrophy.
