Bone scintigraphy is a diagnostic nuclear medicine imaging method that evaluates active bone formation related to malignant and benign diseases, as well as physiological processes.

Almost all bone scintigraphy examinations are performed in patients with a diagnosis of malignancy, especially breast, prostate, and lung cancer. And the method plays an indispensable role in the staging and treatment of malignant tumors. Bone metastases usually appear as scattered foci of increased uptake, which are different from each other in terms of size and shape on radionuclide bone imaging.
