The recommended views for radiographic evaluationÂ of the proximal humerus fracture include a true AP, scapular Y, and axillary. CT scan is performed for preoperative planning if there is intra-articular comminution or if the position of the head or greater tuberosity is uncertain. If a humerus shaft fracture is suspected, AP and lateral views including the joint below and above should be a part of the initial evaluation. With suspected distal humerus fractures, the recommended radiographic views include an AP and lateral of the humerus and elbow which should include the entire humerus and forearm.
