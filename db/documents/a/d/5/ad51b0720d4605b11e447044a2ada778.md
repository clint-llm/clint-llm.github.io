No specific histochemical markers or staining methodologies yet exist for basophilic stippling. That said, basophilic stippling can be differentiated from other erythrocyte inclusions – namely Pappenheimer bodies – by its lack of special staining. Pappenheimer bodies have a similar appearance to basophilic stippling in peripheral blood with Wright-Giemsa staining; however, the former is composed of iron aggregates rather than ribosomal material. Prussian blue stain preferentially binds iron in tissues; therefore, Pappenheimer bodies rather than basophilic stippling will be visible on a specimen treated with Prussian blue.
