Brain herniation, also called brain code, requires early diagnosis and prompt management in order to prevent irreversible pathological cascades that eventually lead to respiratory arrest and subsequent death. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of brain herniation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical clinical presentation of a patient with brain herniation syndrome.
- Describe the rostral-caudal pattern of progression of each subtype of brain herniation and their typical associated imaging findings.
- Review treatment and management options available for patients with brain herniation.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to upgrade the "target guided" multimodal management approach for patients with brain herniation syndrome.
