Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a group of symptoms comprised of severe peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and chronic diarrhea caused by a gastrin-secreting tumor of the duodenum or pancreas (gastrinoma triangle) that results in increased stimulation of acid-secreting cells of the stomach.

Gastrinoma-causing Zollinger-Ellison syndrome occurs sporadically in about 80% of cases and is reported to be 20% to 25% as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) from multiple reports in the literature.

Zollinger-Ellison syndrome first appeared in the Annals of Surgery in 1955 as a case series compiled by two surgeons from Ohio State University, Dr. Robert M. Zollinger and Edwin H. Ellison. Both cases had ulcers at the upper jejunum with excess gastric acid production refractory to medical and surgical therapy, including gastrectomy. The ultimate finding that led to ZES with hypersecretion, hyperacidity, and recurrent peptic ulceration was a non-beta cell islet tumor of the pancreas.
