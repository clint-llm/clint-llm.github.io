Treatment of peripheral neuropathies should focus on the treatment of the underlying disease process. For example, glucose control in diabetic neuropathy and alcohol cessation in alcoholic neuropathy. Nutritional deficiencies can have therapy with supplementation of the depleted vitamins or minerals. Unfortunately, not all peripheral neuropathies are reversible. Physical therapy and occupational therapy can be initiated to aid in the improvement of a patient's overall strength and function. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy is treated using corticosteroids initially but can also be treated using intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange, and some immunosuppressant drugs.

A referral to a pain specialist can be beneficial for those patients who are suffering from neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain, particularly in those suffering from small-fiber neuropathies, does not typically respond to simple analgesics. Instead, effective treatment for pain associated with peripheral neuropathies can be with membrane stabilizers, certain anti-epileptics, and tricyclic antidepressants.
