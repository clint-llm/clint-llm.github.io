Calciphylaxis is a disease of calcification of small and medium-sized vessels that lead to ischemia and necrosis of the overlying skin. It is seen in patients with chronic renal failure and on dialysis but can also occur in those with normal kidney functions. This disease entity will be discussed elsewhere.
