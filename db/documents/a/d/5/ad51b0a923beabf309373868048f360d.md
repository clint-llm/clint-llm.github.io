A pancreatic pseudocyst is an encapsulated collection of homogenous fluid with little or no necrotic tissue located near the pancreas. It often presents with nonspecific symptoms in patients with a history of chronic pancreatitis and less commonly acute pancreatitis. It is crucial to identify any complications that may arise to minimize the associated morbidity and mortality. This activity reviews the etiology and evaluation of pancreatic pseudocysts and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the various treatment modalities available for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of a pancreatic pseudocyst.
- Review the evaluation of a pancreatic pseudocyst.
- Outline the histopathology of a pancreatic pseudocyst.
- Summarize the interprofessional team needed to select treatment modalities and thus improve outcomes for patients affected by pseudocysts.
