Treatment and management of chronic headache disorders depend upon the underlying etiology and may require an interprofessional approach.

The patient should maintain a headache journal documenting their headache episodes and any accompanying triggers. If found, stressors should be avoided or minimized.

**Chronic Migraine**

- Chronic migraine treatment should begin with setting the expectation that headache frequency and severity will decrease, but headaches will not be eliminated.

- The patient should be counseled that high caffeine intake, sleep deprivation, overuse of analgesics, and comorbid conditions can worsen chronic migraines.

- Prophylactic pharmacologic treatment should be used. First-line therapy includes beta-blockers, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants. The most commonly used medications are propranolol, topiramate, and amitriptyline.

- Botulinum toxin A is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatment for chronic migraines and is considered second-line therapy.

- Monoclonal antibodies that target calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are the newest development in chronic migraine treatment. Erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab are approved for chronic migraines, which have failed to respond to other treatments.

- Triptans, steroids, NSAIDs, and opioids are often used to abort acute episodes, but routine use of these medications increases the risk of developing a medication-overuse headache.

- Patients may also benefit from psychological counseling if anxiety or depression is present.

- Manual medicine, such as spinal manipulation and trigger point treatment, may be used as complementary or alternative therapy.

- In drug-resistant cases, invasive procedures such as sphenopalatine ganglion and occipital nerve blockades may be tried with variable results. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is also used in some treatment-resistant cases.

**Chronic Tension Headache**

- Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic tension headaches.

- Amitriptyline, in addition to inhibiting serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake, also reduces tenderness in pericranial muscles.

- Tricyclic antidepressants increase the risk for cardiac arrhythmia, and patients should be screened for cardiovascular disorders before initiating therapy. In addition, patients over 40 should undergo an ECG.

- Anticonvulsants, such as topiramate and gabapentin, can be considered second-line treatment.

- Addressing the potential musculoskeletal causes of tension headaches, treatment with physical therapy, acupuncture, trigger point injections, spinal manipulation, or muscle relaxants may be beneficial.

- Behavioral therapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and relaxation techniques, is particularly helpful for patients with coexisting anxiety or depression.

**Medication Overuse Headache**

- Patient education about the potential for overuse of analgesic medication to lead to headache progression is key. Include the use of over-the-counter analgesics in the discussion.

- The physician initiates a preventative medication while simultaneously assisting the patient in discontinuing the causative drug.

- Patients may experience withdrawal symptoms of nausea and anxiety for 2 to 10 days when the analgesic medication is discontinued.

- There is no consensus on the most appropriate medication for bridge therapy following discontinuation of the offending drug. Long-acting NSAIDs, prednisone, dihydroergotamine, and antiemetics are options.

- Medications that may be effective for prophylaxis include topiramate, amitryptiline, valproic acid, and beta-blockers. The choice of medication should be based upon comorbidities and the primary headache disorder.

**Chronic Autonomic Cephalgia**

- Indomethacin is the drug of choice for paroxysmal hemicrania, hemicrania continua, primary stabbing headache, hypnic headache, and Valsalva-induced headaches (e.g., cough headache, exercise headache).

- Verapamil is the drug of choice for the prevention of chronic cluster headaches. However, Verapamil requires titration to become effective, and glucocorticoids or dihydroergotamine can be used for exacerbations.

- Chronic cluster headaches not responsive to pharmacologic therapy can be treated with a non-invasive vagus nerve stimulator or sphenopalatine ganglion microstimulator.

- First-line prophylactic therapy for chronic SUNCT and SUNA is lamotrigine. Topiramate and gabapentin are alternatives.
