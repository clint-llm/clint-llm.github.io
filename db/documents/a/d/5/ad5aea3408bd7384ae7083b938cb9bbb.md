Abdominal radiographs, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography are used to diagnose pneumatosis intestinalis. However, one-third of patients’ radiographs may not reveal any signs, such as thickened bowel walls containing gas. Computed tomography is the most sensitive imaging modality as it better distinguishes intraluminal air from submucosal fat and detects additional underlying causes of pneumatosis intestinalis such as portal air, colonic tissue stranding, and dilated bowel. Subsequent imaging should be performed to assess the presence and expansion of portal venous and intra-abdominal air.

Gas can be distributed in a cystic pattern as seen with pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis or linear, which is associated more with bowel ischemia and portal venous gas. A linear pattern is more in line with the secondary PI. Ling et al. reported that gas cysts can be located in the colon (46%), small intestines (27%), large intestines (7%), and stomach (5%). An endoscopy can be performed to characterize the distribution of gas formation (linear versus cystic) and to exclude any other colonic lesions. Laboratory tests play an important role in determining the treatment and management of benign versus life-threatening cases. Such laboratory exams include but are not limited to white blood cell count, lactic acid, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, amylase, bicarbonate level, and alkaline phosphatase.
