Laryngeal papilloma may be confused with other laryngeal lesions. Even though laryngeal papilloma has a risk of malignancy, vocal cord leukoplakia, squamous cell carcinoma, and verrucous carcinoma need to be ruled out. These can be easily differentiated with a biopsy of the lesion. LP can be confused with other benign lesions such as vocal cord granulomas, vocal cord nodules, and polypoid corditis, known as Reinke edema. These lesions, contrary to malignant lesions, are mostly differentiated with a detailed stroboscopic examination.
