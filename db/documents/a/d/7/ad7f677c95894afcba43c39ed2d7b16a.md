Aphasia is an impairment of language caused by damage to the language area of the brain, primarily Broca and Wernicke areas. Injury to the brain can be caused by various disease processes such as cerebrovascular accident (CVA), traumatic brain injury (TBI), brain mass, or neurodegenerative diseases. Patients can develop symptoms that include difficulties articulating words or sentences, deficits of comprehension, or both. This activity highlights the evaluation and treatment of aphasia and outlines the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of aphasia.
- Outline the typical presentation of each aphasia syndrome.
- Explain the management options available for aphasia.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of patients with aphasia and improve outcomes.
