The etiology of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is complex and is not yet completely understood. Carcinogenesis is however known to be associated with high titers of EBV. Other risk factors include a diet consisting of preserved foods containing nitrosamines and smoking. In some epidemiologic studies, family history of nasopharyngeal cancer has been established as a predisposing factor as well. In areas where EBV is not endemic, like the United States, smoking and alcohol are found to be risk factors. In some areas of the world, circulating EBV DNA is being used for screening and disease surveillance. Studies have shown that high circulating levels of EBV DNA is associated with poorer response to treatment and higher rates of distant metastasis and mortality.
