Patients should understand that skin tags are benign lesions, but they may carry correlations with type 2 diabetes or obesity, hence the need to maintain healthy body weight and blood glucose levels. Patients with type 2 diabetes require monitoring by an endocrinologist to ensure control of blood glucose levels.

For those with skin tags around the neck, they should be told to avoid wearing jewelry on the neck to prevent skin irritation and friction injuries.

Furthermore, the patient should be told to avoid wearing restrictive and synthetic clothing, which can also cause friction in the presence of a skin tag.
