The treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis is challenging and complex. There is no established treatment for PSC yet. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been widely studied as a therapy for PSC patients. Treatment guidelines for PSC are conflicting. American College of Gastroenterology and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases do not support the use of ursodeoxycholic acid. The use of moderate doses of ursodeoxycholic acid has been approved by the European Association for the Study of the Liver. Nonetheless, at moderate doses of 15 to 20 mg/kg daily, it remains widely used.

A few studies do show that UDCA can improve symptoms and survival.

Other treatments that have been tested and are not proven to be beneficial are prednisolone, budesonide, colchicine, penicillamine, azathioprine, tacrolimus, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, and antitumor necrosis factor antibodies.

In patients with PSC with dominant stricture (defined as stenoses measuring less than 1.5 mm in the common bile duct or less than 1.0 mm in the hepatic ducts) and pruritus, and/or cholangitis, ERCP with balloon dilatation is recommended to relieve symptoms.

Surgical options for PSC include biliary reconstructive procedures like choledochoduodenostomy, in which the surgeon attaches the common bile duct to the duodenum, and choledochojejunostomy, in which the surgeon attaches the common bile duct to the jejunum, and liver transplantation. Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Patients whose model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score exceeds 14 should be referred for liver transplantation. Orthotopic liver transplantation has 5-year survival rates of up to 80% in patients with PSC.

**General Measures**

In patients with PSC and moderate pruritus, bile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine should be taken to reduce symptoms. Rifampin and naltrexone are second-line treatment agents, which can be considered if cholestyramine is ineffective or poorly tolerated.

Patients with PSC should undergo bone mineral density testing at the time of diagnosis and then every 2 to 4 years.

Fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies are common in patients with advanced liver disease, and clinicians should screen for and monitor patients for these.
