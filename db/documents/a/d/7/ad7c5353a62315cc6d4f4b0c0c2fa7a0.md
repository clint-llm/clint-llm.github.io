Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers are often administered to assist endotracheal intubations and provide adjuvant therapy in the perioperative maintenance of anesthesia and care of critically ill patients. These drugs paralyze muscles and make it difficult to breathe. Thus, no alert patient should ever receive these agents. To ensure the safety of these drugs, the physician, nurse anesthetist, and nurses must work together in a team approach to assure safe intubations with the best possible patient outcome. When administering non-depolarizing agents, resuscitative equipment must be at the bedside for immediate intubation. Nurses who manage patients in the ICU should be familiar with the dosage and potential adverse effects. The pharmacist should always double-check the drug dosage before dispensing it to the nurse. Only through open communication and interprofessional teamwork can the patient's safety be ensured with nNMBs.
