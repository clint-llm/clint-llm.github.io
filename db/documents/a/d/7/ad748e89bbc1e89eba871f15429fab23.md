Barium swallow with videofluoroscopy provides information regarding its size, location, and character of the mucosal lining, and diagnoses the condition.Â Upper endoscopy, which includes both flexible and rigid assessment, are also used and typically essential in the surgical evaluation. Staging of the Zenker diverticulum is imperative to the overall evaluation. There are 3 staging systems: Lahey, Morton, and Van Overbeek staging systems. Only one of the 3 may be used. The staging is typically reliant on the size of the pouch in which the bigger the size, the higher the staging.

Endoscopy may reveal fibrosis around the diverticulum which limits the risk of local abscess formation. Endoscopy may reveal pooling of food in the diverticulum.
