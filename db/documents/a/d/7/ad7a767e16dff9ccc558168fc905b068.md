Body lice, which have a worldwide distribution, are ectoparasites that must feed on human blood to survive. They assume 3 forms across their life cycle starting with the egg, or nit, and progressing to the nymph and adult stage. As with head lice, nits are oval and appear yellow or white.  However, unlike head lice, which attach their eggs to the proximal hair shafts, body lice lay their eggs in the seams of clothing. A nymph is an immature louse, which except for its smaller size, has the same appearance as an adult louse. Adult lice have 6 legs, are tan to grayish-white in color, 2.5 to 3.5 cm in length, have no wings, and are flat in shape.

Body lice feed 1 to 5 times a day and can live up to 60 days. When separated from a human host, body lice will die within a week.
