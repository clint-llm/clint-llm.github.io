Multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C) in children is defined as persistent fever, evidence of inflammation, and signs of multi-organ dysfunction with or without confirmation of previous COVID-19 infection. Other infectious and inflammatory causes that present with similar signs and symptoms must be excluded before diagnosing MIS-C. MIS-C is considered an immune sequela of COVID-19 and has evolving symptomatology and severity. Early recognition depends on high suspicion in the susceptible population. The mainstay of treatment involves IVIG and corticosteroids. Due to rapid mutations and the contagious nature of the viral infection, covid-19 infection and associated sequelae remain a threat, and better preventative strategies are needed. This activity reviews the incidence, pathophysiology, management, and outcomes of MIS-C in neonates and highlights the importance of timely diagnosis and prompt management of infants with MIS-C.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology and pathophysiology of neonatal MIS-C.
- Review the clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria for MIS-C.
- Outline current management practices of neonatal MIS-C.
- Summarize the outcomes of neonatal MIS-C.
