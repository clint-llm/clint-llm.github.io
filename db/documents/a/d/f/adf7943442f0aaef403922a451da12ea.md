The histopathology shows arrest of neuroectodermal development, which includes absent iris musclesÂ with hypoplasia of iris. There may be dysgenesis of the Schlemm's canal and trabecular meshwork. Hypoplasia of the ciliary body is also noted but is less severe than iris-hypoplasia. Large iris vessels may be present over the anterior surface of the hypoplastic iris. The anterior chamber angle may be normal. There may be incomplete cleavage of the angle or anomalous development of the angle.
