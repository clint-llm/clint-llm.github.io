Diagnosis of meconium plug syndrome (MPS) is a challenge because several other clinical entities present similarly. The differential diagnosis includes Hirschsprung disease, malrotation, meconium disease, and intestinal atresia. The major conditions that should be ruled out are listed below:

- Meconium ileus: Here, the inspissated meconium obstructs the small intestine rather than the colon and decreases the diameter of the colon, resulting in a microcolon.  In comparison, meconium ileus is a disease of critical nature as it has a higher rate of complications such as perforation, small bowel volvulus, peritonitis, and intestinal atresia and strong association with cystic fibrosis.

- Small left colon syndrome(SLCS): Historically considered along with meconium plug syndrome as both are transient functional obstructions of the colon. SLCS characteristically presents a sudden change in the colonic diameter proximal to the splenic flexure. MPS occurs mostly in preterms, whereas SLCS occurs in full-term babies. A majority of both MPS and SLCS patients revert to normal spontaneously within 30 days.

- Hirschsprung disease: the absence of ganglion cells can be differentiated on rectal biopsy.

- Anorectal malformations: diagnosed by physical exam.

- Malrotation: limited upper gastrointestinal contrast study to evaluate for malrotation.

- Intestinal atresia: upper and lower gastrointestinal series
