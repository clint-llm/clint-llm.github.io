Meigs syndrome is an uncommon presentation, where a benign ovarian tumor presents along with ascites and pleural effusion. About 1% of ovarian tumors can present as Meigs syndrome. A similar presentation can be seen in many metastatic malignancies. This article will present findings to aid clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of this syndrome. It will help to differentiate it from malignant ovarian conditions. Some patients have either ascites or pleural effusion with benign ovarian tumors and are classified as atypical/incomplete Meigs syndrome. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the presentation, evaluation, and treatment/management of Meigs syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Meigs syndrome.
- Review the evaluation of Meigs syndrome.
- Outline the management options available for Meigs syndrome.
- Explain the importance of coordination and communication by the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients with Meigs syndrome.
