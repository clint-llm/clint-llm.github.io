Adverse events of TKIs are usually dose-based, with broad side effect profiles unique to each drug. However, due to similarities in drug targets, different classes of TKIs can have similar side effect profiles. Clinicians use BCR-Abl and KIT inhibitors to treat Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML and GIST, respectively.

EGFRs are a large family of RTKs associated with several cancers, including NSCL, breast, colorectal, pancreatic, esophageal, and head-and-neck cancers. The most common severe adverse effects associated with EGRF inhibitors are related to cutaneous adverse drug reactions.

Angiogenesis is a critical step in cancer growth. VEGF is a key inducer of pathological angiogenesis expressed in nearly all human tumors.

Common adverse events related to TKIs are listed below. Not all adverse events are associated with every TKI, occurring at different frequencies depending on the drug.
