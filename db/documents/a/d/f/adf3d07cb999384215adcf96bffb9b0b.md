Mucoceles occur when there is an injury to the minor salivary glands, which are scattered throughout the oral cavity. The most frequent involved minor salivary glands are those of the lower lip, which can be injured in a variety of ways. Among them, mechanical trauma is the most common in biting one's own lip during chewing.

The origin of ranulas is similar to that of mucoceles with trauma to the excretory duct of the major salivary glands as the leading cause and obstruction of the duct (sialolith or mucus plug) as the less common one. Other causes leading to ranulas formation include chronic inflammation (sarcoidosis andÂ  Sjogren syndrome) or infection (HIV) with periductal scarring, ductal hypoplasia, ductal stenosis, ductal agenesis, and neoplasia.
