Calcium is a prominent molecule involved in many biochemical processes throughout the body. It is an essential element for proper cardiac function, the structural integrity of bone, and muscular contraction and acts as an enzymatic signal in biochemical pathways.

Serum calcium can be measured by a venous sample, with physiologic levels ranging from 8.8 mg/dl to 10.4 mg/dL for total calcium and 4.7 mg/dL to 5.2 mg/dL for ionized calcium.
