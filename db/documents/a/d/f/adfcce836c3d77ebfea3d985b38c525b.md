The arterial system undergoes various modifications within an embryo during its growth. Intraembryonically, the arterial system consists of aortic arches, and the central and dorsal aortas, that are all continuous with each other. Arising from the dorsal aorta are paired ventral segmental arteries, some of which fuse to form the median vessels. These vessels then give rise to the three main arterial systems: celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery.

By the 4th week of embryologic development, the gastrointestinal tract has divided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut. Foregut extends from the esophagus to the ampulla of Vater, midgut extends from the distal duodenum to the proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon, and hindgut extends from the distal one-third of the transverse colon to the rectum. Foregut, midgut, and hindgut will each have a unique blood supply.
