A contracted socket is a challenging entity for an oculoplastic surgeon. It may develop at any time following removal of the eye. Additional pathologies frequently accompany the contracted socket. Although the patient may eventually wear the prosthesis in most cases, it demands a high level of care from both the patient and the concerned clinician. A lifelong follow-up is recommended to minimize subsequent complications. A constant open communication line involving the entire interprofessional healthcare team, including the patient, the ocularist, the ophthalmologist, family clinician/mid-level practitioner, and ophthalmology-trained nursing staff, is highly encouraged for best outcomes.
