Social distancing, handwashing, and hygienic environments reduce the spread of enteroviral disease. The rapid spread of disease through households is typical. Children are the largest reservoirs for enteroviruses, and handwashing in this age group has a significant impact on the reduction of disease transmission. The restriction of school-aged visitors within hospitals is reasonable.

In the presence of community-wide outbreaks, surveillance should be increased, and disease-specific action plans (such as asthma action plans for circulating rhinovirus) should be put in place.

Healthcare-associated outbreaks of enteroviruses have been reported, and are associated with morbidity and mortality. Healthcare workers should treat patients with enteroviral or respiratory symptoms using appropriate contact and airborne precautions. As viruses may spread via both large and small droplets, donning of masks reduces disease spread. Symptomatic healthcare workers may spread the disease to patients.
