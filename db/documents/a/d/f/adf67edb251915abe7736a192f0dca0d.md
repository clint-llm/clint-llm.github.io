Among the various acid-base disorders, metabolic alkalosis is the most frequently occurring derangement in hospitalized patients, with an incidence of 51% in this group. Respiratory alkalosis is also commonly seen in the hospitalized patient population. Prevalence has shown to be 22.5% to 44.7% in inpatient studies in the United States.

The incidence of mixed respiratory and metabolic alkalosis is estimated to be around 29%.

There does not appear to be a significant gender distribution to alkalosis, except in cases of infantile pyloric stenosis, where there is an overwhelming male predominance noted.
