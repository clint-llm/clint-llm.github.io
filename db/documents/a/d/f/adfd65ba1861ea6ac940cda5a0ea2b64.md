Risk factors for abusive head trauma may include behaviors and situations that involve the child, the family, and the caregiver. Infants who inconsolably cry are at risk of a frustrated caregiver responding with violent shaking. Colic is a risk factor. Infant crying is greatest at 6 to 8 weeks of age and then declines. As a consequence, abusive head trauma peaks during this same period.

Risk factors for abusive head trauma include:

- Behavioral health problems

- Domestic violence history

- Frustration intolerance

- Lack of childcare experience

- Lack of prenatal care

- Low education level

- Low socioeconomic status

- Single-parent families

- Young parents without support

Acute head trauma perpetrators are most frequently the father or stepfather, mother’s boyfriend, female babysitter, and the mother. Shaking is often associated with the perpetrator’s level of frustration and tension.

Child abuse affects all ethnicities, socioeconomic groups, and races, with boys and adolescents more commonly affected. Infants tend to have increased morbidity and mortality with physical abuse. Multiple factors increase a child’s risk of abuse. These include risks at an individual level, such as disability of the child, unmarried mother, maternal smoking, and parent’s depression. Risks at a familial level are domestic violence at home and more than two siblings at home. Risks at a community level are isolation, lack of recreational facilities, and societal factors such as poverty. Other factors include living in an unrelated adult’s home and being a child previously reported to child protective services (CPS). All of these increase the chance of child maltreatment. There are also protective factors that decrease the risk of child maltreatment, including family support and parental concern. Preventive factors include parental education regarding child development and parenting, social support, and parental resilience.
