There are a variety of complications that can occur as a result of retroperitoneal bleeding. Here a brief list is provided based on the original insult and most common sequelae. Complications from hematomal formation mass effect include pelvic/ femoral neuralgia, small bowel obstruction, urinary obstruction, and gastric outlet obstruction.

Complications from the associated hypotension, hypovolemia, and shock that can develop with severe retroperitoneal bleeding include myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, acute liver injury, diffuse cerebral hypoperfusion, global hypoxia, and bowel necrosis.

Complications of surgical intervention include infection, damage to adjacent structures of the operative field, and worsening of bleeding. Complications of angioembolization include infection, damage to the vasculature, worsening of bleeding, contrast-induced nephropathy, and ischemia of embolized arterial distributions.
