Thoracic spinal anesthesia is a beneficial procedure that is useful for a wide range of surgical procedures. However, there are significant risks that the healthcare team needs to be aware of. Patient selection is an important aspect, and a detailed history and physical examination will determine who is eligible. The indication for thoracic spinal anesthesia needs to match the surgical needs of the patient. After surgery, the post-op team should be aware of the procedure, and the patient needs to be monitored closely for hemodynamic stability. Monitoring in the immediate post-op period should occur until the resolution of the anesthetic.

Both physicians and nurses from other specialties should also be aware of the nature of anesthesia that these patients underwent. Before discharge, the patient should receive a list of possible complications and look out for them. They should be asked about any headaches, backache and evaluated for neurological deficits. Lastly, patients should be reassured and evaluated regarding any complications that may have occurred from this procedure.
