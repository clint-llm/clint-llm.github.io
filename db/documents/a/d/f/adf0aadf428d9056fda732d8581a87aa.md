Apoptosis represents an ATP-requiring pathway inducing programmed-cell death and is a requirement for viability. The Greek term apoptosis was initially attributed to this pathway to describe the “falling off of petals from flowers, or leaves from trees.”

Hallmarks of apoptosis include degradation of DNA, disassembly of the cytoskeleton and nuclear lamina, and cellular blebbing. Importantly, the apoptotic pathway is anti-inflammatory and does not induce cell lysis, in contrast to cell death by necrosis, which lysis cellular contents that subsequently leads to inflammation.
