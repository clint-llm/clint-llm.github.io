Prognosis depends upon the cause of tubulointerstitial nephritis, timing of therapy, renal function, previous offending agent, and time of removal of the reason. Chronicity portends worse outcomes. Early identification and removal of the cause improve renal outcomes. In general, drug-induced TIN has a good prognosis because of the potential for partial recovery of the kidney.

Long-term prognosis is usually encouraging with full kidney recovery.
