Yaws is often distinguished by its late feature of destructive bony disease. However, cutaneous manifestations of other diseases may have significant overlap.

**Other Treponemal Diseases**

T. pallidum (Syphilis): Features that distinguish it from yaws include worldwide distribution, disease primarily of adults with a history of sexual contact, initial lesions primarily on genitals, congenital transmission, prominent neurologic late complications, and prominent cardiovascular late complications.

T. endemicum (Bejel): Although this is also a disease of children, it has many features distinguishing it from yaws, for example, a presence in hot, dry areas including deserts of Africa and Saudi Arabia, transmission from salivary contact, rare to have initial cutaneous lesions, and if present on oral mucosa, limited dissemination, destruction of nose and palate are late complications.

T. carateum (Pinta): Although transmitted by skin to skin contact, initial lesions are on lower extremities, and it is also prevalent in hot and humid climates such as South America and Central America. There are many features that distinguish it from Yaws: a disease of adults, disseminated disease restricted to skin, late complication of local skin hyponatremia.

**Tropical Ulcerative Lesions
**

Leishmaniasis, Fusobacterium, or pyoderma may be indistinguishable in the initial papular/ulcerative stages.Haemophilus ducreyi. This painful skin lesion from sexual contact that may cause genital and non-genital lesions in areas where endemic. Lesions are also responsive to azithromycin.
