Contraindications include an excessively large target lesion or too many lesions for practical use. Single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery is usually limited to small lesions (typically less than 4 cm) although increasingly fractionated radiosurgery is useful for larger lesions.

For newly diagnosed glioblastoma, a randomized trial comparing SRS followed by external beam radiotherapy and carmustine chemotherapy versus only radiotherapy and carmustine showed no difference in overall survival, improvement in local control, or quality of life.

SRS pallidotomy yielded a high complication rate, including visual field defects and is not routinely in use.
