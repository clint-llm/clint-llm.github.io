The occlusion of a single hepatic vein usually remains silent, but when 2 hepatic veins get occluded, it causes venous congestion that stretches the liver capsule. This can be very painful. The sinusoids begin to dilate, and there is a filtration of interstitial fluid leading to liver congestion. When the filtrated fluid exceeds the capacity of the lymphatic system to drain it, it starts passing through the liver capsule leading to ascites.

The most common lobe affected in Budd-Chiari syndrome is the caudate lobe becauseÂ its blood is directly shunted into the inferior vena cava. Hence, when the hepatic veins are occluded, the caudate lobe undergoes hypertrophy.
