The parenchyma of the thyroid gland is derived from endoderm. The thyroid gland originates from the foramen cecum, which is a pit positioned at the posterior one-third of the tongue. Early in gestation, the thyroid gland begins its descent anterior to the pharynx as a bilobed diverticulum. The thyroid gland then continues to descend anterior of the hyoid bone and the cartilages of the larynx. By the seventh week, the thyroid gland reaches its destination midline and anterior to the upper trachea. The thyroglossal duct maintains the connection of the thyroid gland to the base of the tongue until involution and disappearance of the duct.

The ultimobranchial body, derived from the ventral region of the fourth pharyngeal pouch, then becomes incorporated into the dorsal aspect of the thyroid gland. The ultimobranchial body gives rise to the parafollicular cells or C cells of the thyroid gland.
