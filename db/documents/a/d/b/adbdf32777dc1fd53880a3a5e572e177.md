Cryptococcosis is an important opportunistic infection that causes more than 100,000 HIV-related deaths each year. It was named the Busse-Buschke disease because of its first description by Otto Busse and Abraham Buschke in 1894.

Even though the infection is usually HIV-related, in many centers (especially in developed countries), most of the non-HIV-related cases include patients under immunosuppressive treatments or with organic failure syndromes, transplants, innate immunological problems, common variable immunodeficiency syndrome, and hematological disorders.
