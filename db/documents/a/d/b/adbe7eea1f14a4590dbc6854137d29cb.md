Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is an asymptomatic preneoplastic plasma cell disorder that is characterized by serum M-protein less than 30 g/L, bone marrow clonal plasma cells less than 10 percent, absence of plasma cell myeloma-related end-organ damage (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, or bone lesions) and absence of B-cell lymphoma or other diseases known to produce an M-protein. MGUS is generally considered a preneoplastic disorder that does not always progress to overt malignancy. This activity describes the pathophysiology, presentation, evaluation, and treatment of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.
- Describe the presentation of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.
- Review the treatment options for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and management of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and improve outcomes.
