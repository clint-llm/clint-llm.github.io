Preparation for cochlear implantation begins with a proper diagnosis of sensorineural hearing loss. History and physical exam will initiate the patient encounter. Special note to rule out secondary causes of hearing loss including tympanic membrane perforation, middle ear effusion/infection, or canal atresia. These would have to be corrected before the placement of a cochlear implant as they can affect the audiological findings that determine if patients are candidates for hearing aids. The next step is to obtain a basic audiogram with tympanometry. In children who are unable to respond appropriately to sound, an auditory brainstem response (ABR) will be necessary. The ABR is a test that transmits sound through the ear and determines if it reaches the cochlear nerve and secondary structures of the hearing apparatus by measuring the electrical potential that occurs from being stimulated.  It is a useful test for both pediatric patients and to rule out hearing loss in patients who may be malingering. After there is confirmation that bilateral sensorineural hearing loss is present and meets the criteria for cochlear implantation, imaging is the next step. A solid history and physical exam may reveal findings that warrant further investigations, referrals to rule out coexisting abnormalities. In pediatric patients deemed to have profound sensorineural hearing loss evaluation by geneticists should be a consideration.

Typically a CT of the temporal bones without contrast and MRI of the internal auditory canals with and without contrast is obtained, however one or the other would suffice.

In the United States, insurance companies do not always cover bilateral cochlear implants, causing difficulty for the cochlear implant team in determining which ear to place a cochlear implant. Generally, the ear with the shortest duration of deafness, the worse hearing ear, and the handedness of a patient for device manipulation may be factors to help determine appropriate implantation. If there are no audiometric differences between ears, then choose the better surgical ear. Some studies suggest that it may not matter which ear receives the implant (better or worse hearing ear), but the intervention of a cochlear implant will be of great benefit when the patients meet criteria.
