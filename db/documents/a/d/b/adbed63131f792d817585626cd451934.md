Ipratropium maintenance therapy has well-established benefits for the treatment of chronic obstructive lung disease. Mortality in chronic obstructive lung disease is often due to complications, including hyperinflation, decreased exercise tolerance, pulmonary infections, and chronic obstructive lung disease exacerbations. Ipratropium has been extensively studied in clinical trials and proven to prevent the progression of obstructive lung disease and these complications. This activity reviews the indications and contraindications, adverse effects, and monitoring of ipratropium. Also, this activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in collaborating to manage patients who are using Ipratropium.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of ipratropium.
- Describe the adverse effects of ipratropium use.
- Describe the potential toxicity of ipratropium.
- Outline working relationships among interprofessional team providers to promote the safe use and administration of ipratropium and promote medication adherence.
