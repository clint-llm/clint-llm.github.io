- Due to the benign and transient nature of oral inclusion cysts, healthcare professionals sometimes fail to recognize them, differentiate them, and even misdiagnose them.

- Gingival cysts have been mistaken for pseudomembranous candidiasis, leading to the unnecessary use of antifungal medication.

- It is worth noting that Epstein pearls, Bohn nodules, and gingival cysts of the newborn are all managed by reassuring the parents of their benign and self-limiting nature.

- Even tough these three cysts have the same clinical aspect, histopathology, evolution, and treatment they are believed to have different etiology and location in the oral cavity.

- Oral inclusion cysts are identified as Epstein pearls when they are seen on the midpalatine raphe or in the junction between the hard and soft palate, as Bohn nodules when they are found on the vestibular or lingual aspect of the alveolar ridge, and as gingival cysts when they are located on the crest of the alveolar ridges.

- The differential diagnosis should include natal and neo-natal teeth, and congenital epulis of the newborn.
