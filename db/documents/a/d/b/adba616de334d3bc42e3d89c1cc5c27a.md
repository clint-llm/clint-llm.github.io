While there are multiple causes of syncope, many of these are neurally mediated. Some neurally mediated causes of syncope include vasovagal syncope, carotid sinus syndrome, and situational syncope. A tilt table test is a diagnostic procedure for patients in whom a neurally mediated syncope is suspected. It is also used to evaluate patients with unexplained recurrent falls, to distinguish neurally mediated syncope from syncope due to orthostatic hypotension, to diagnose psychogenic pseudo, and to distinguish syncope from epilepsy in certain patients. During the tilt table test, the patient is exposed to orthostatic stress, which may be exaggerated by nitroglycerine, clomipramine, and isoprenaline administration. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques involved in performing the tilt table test and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the indications for the tilt table test.
- Describe the technique for using the tilt table test to evaluate syncope.
- Explain the clinical relevance of the tilt table test.
- Employ a structured, interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients undergoing evaluation of syncope with the tilt table test.
