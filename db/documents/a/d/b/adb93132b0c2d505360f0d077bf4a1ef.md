It goes without saying that the goal of pharmacodynamics in a pharmacological therapy setting is to exert positive effects at the least necessary dose that produces the maximum therapeutic effect while minimizing the pharmacodynamics that leads to an adverse event. All interprofessional healthcare team members engaged in the prescribing, dosing, dispensing, or administering of pharmacological therapy must have at least some understanding of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic principles. Obviously, the level of knowledge must be commensurate with the practitioner's clinical function.

However, pharmacologic therapy properly involves an interprofessional team that includes all clinicians who prescribe or order medications (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), pharmacists, who without question need to be the subject matter experts regarding pharmacodynamics and their application in drug therapy; clinicians should utilize them as a valuable resource because of this specialization, and nurses, who along with the pharmacists can counsel the patient about their medications, administer them in inpatient and other settings, and are often the main point of contact for patients regarding their drug regimen. With an interprofessional team approach to pharmacotherapy that includes appropriate pharmacodynamic knowledge, patient outcomes can be optimized while adverse events are minimized. [Level 5]
