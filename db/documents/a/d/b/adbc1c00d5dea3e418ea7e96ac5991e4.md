In males, the corpora cavernosa, corpus spongiosum, and the glans penis develop from the mesoderm of the genital tubercule, under the influence of dihydrotestosterone. The penile urethra is formed from the tubularization of the endoderm.

In females, the genital tubercle differentiates to form the clitoris and the bulbs of the vestibule. The Bartholinâ€™s gland is a derivative of the urogenital sinus.
