Chronic cholecystitis mostly occurs in the setting of cholelithiasis. The proposed etiology is recurrent episodes of acute cholecystitis or chronic irritation from gallstones invoking an inflammatory response in the gallbladder wall. Sometimes the term is used to describe abdominal pain resulting from dysfunction in the emptying of the gallbladder. This overlaps with Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and is best referred to as biliary or gallbladder dyskinesia.

Risk factors for cholelithiasis include:

- Female gender

- Obesity

- Rapid weight loss

- Pregnancy

- Advanced age

- Hispanic or Pima Indians
