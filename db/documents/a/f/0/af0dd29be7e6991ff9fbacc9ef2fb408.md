Platymaplasty is one of the neck rejuvenation techniques used in patients who want to improve the aesthetics of their necks by reducing unwanted platysmal bands, jowls, and neck fat. This procedure is primarily indicated in patients who are in the age range from 40 to 60 years and who do not want a full face-lift surgery, but rather an aesthetic and pleasing neck with a smooth contour and a well-defined jawline. This procedure can be combined with other ancillary techniques like submental liposuction, sub-platysmal fat excision, and submandibular gland and digastric muscle excision to add more longevity and predictability to the final result.
