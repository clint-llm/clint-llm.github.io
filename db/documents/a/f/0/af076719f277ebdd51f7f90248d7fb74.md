There is more than one theory on the embryologic development of the arteries of the arm. One theory suggests that the seventh intersegmental artery gives off a branch, the axis artery, which distally branches into the axillary, brachial, and interosseous arteries.

The basis of another theory is a gradually developing capillary network, which differentiates along with other structures in the fetal arm.
