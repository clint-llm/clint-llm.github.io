The ampicillin/sulbactam combination shows synergy to cover strains of bacteria resistant to ampicillin, thus providing broader coverage.Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter, Klebsiella Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter, and anaerobes. Consequently, ampicillin/sulbactam is approved for the following conditions caused by susceptible bacteria.

**FDA-approved Indications**

- Skin and skin structure infections: Ampicillin/sulbactam has an efficacy comparable to third-generation cephalosporins in treating skin infections in patients with or without a history of intravenous drug abuse.

- Intra-abdominal infections: Ampicillin/sulbactam should be used in mild to moderate community-acquired intra-abdominal infections; however, more severe infections require broader coverage against facultative and gram-negative aerobic bacteria antimicrobials may be combined necessary (carbapenem in combination with vancomycin).

- Gynecological infections:  Pelvic inflammatory disease results from sexually transmitted organisms (Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis) or anaerobic vaginal flora. First-line treatment includes cefoxitin or cefotetan with doxycycline or clindamycin with gentamycin plus doxycycline. Ampicillin/sulbactam is comparable in efficacy and is an essential alternate regimen for gynecological infections.

**Off-label Clinical Uses**

- Lower respiratory tract infections: Ampicillin/sulbactam, compared with various third-generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime and cefotaxime), second-generation cephalosporin (cefoxitin), mezlocillin, and imipenem/cilastatin, had higher efficacy although not clinically significant in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections.

- Aspiration pneumonia: In a study by Kadowaki et al., researchers compared the efficacy of ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin, and imipenem/cilastatin. Cure rates for ampicillin/sulbactam were comparable to imipenem/cilastatin. Although clindamycin was the least expensive.

- Diabetic foot infections: Ampicillin/sulbactam, compared to imipenem/cilastatinPseudomonas aeruginosa.

- Pediatric infections: In the pediatric population, indications for ampicillin/sulbactam include epiglottitis, periorbital infections, acute fulminant meningococcemia, and sepsis management.

- Infection in the intensive care unit (ICU) with Acinetobacter baumannii: Effective and safe to use ampicillin/sulbactam in multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections.

- Endocarditis: Ampicillin can be combined with aminoglycosides for infections caused by susceptible strains of Enterococcus.
