IgA pemphigus is a rare autoimmune blistering diseaseÂ characterized by painful and pruritic vesiculopustular eruptions. These eruptions form as a result of circulating IgA antibodies against keratinocyte cell surface components responsible for cell to cell adherence. While the disease has been associated with several malignancies and chronic conditions, the exact etiology is unclear. The two distinct subtypes of IgA pemphigus are subcorneal pustular dermatosis (SPD) and intraepidermal neutrophilic dermatosis (IND). The subcorneal pustular dermatosis subtype demonstrates intercellular IgA deposition against the glycoprotein desmocollin-1, predominantly in the upper epidermis.
