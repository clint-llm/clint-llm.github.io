Treatment for coronary artery thrombus involves medications and revascularization to improve myocardial perfusion. The mainstay pharmacologic therapy for managing thrombus-containing lesions includes aspirin, thienopyridines (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor), and unfractionated heparin.

Percutaneous devices such as aspiration catheter and embolic protector decrease distal embolization and improve myocardial blood flow and clinical outcomes.

Following the publication of several landmark studies, a rekindled interest in mechanical thrombus extraction arose, especially for STEMI management. One can categorize the contemporary mechanical thrombus removal or dissolution devices into four main types according to their activation mode: (1) manual aspiration catheters, (2) power-sourced thrombectomy, (3) ultrasound-induced sonication, and (4) embolic protection.

Manual thrombus aspiration of the infarct-related vessel is a useful method for the rapid decrease in the thrombotic burden, preventing the distal embolization of thrombus, preserving the microvascular integrity, and reducing infarct size. Manual thrombectomy, therefore, improves myocardial perfusion grade. TAPAS trial showed a mortality reduction, which led the guidelines to recommend routine manual aspiration.

Increased thrombus burden may influence stent opposition, which can lead to low TIMI flow and poor outcomes. The best method of primary percutaneous intervention in the setting of coronary thrombus has been reported in the SINCERE database.
