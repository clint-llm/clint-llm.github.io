The prognosis of pancytopenia depends on the underlying condition. The prognosis is excellent in conditions like viral infections, where the pancytopenia improves without intervention. The prognosis in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome depends on the degree of pancytopenia and the percentage of blasts in the marrow. Patients receiving chemotherapy or drugs causing pancytopenia (methotrexate, linezolid, or anticonvulsants) may have to discontinue the treatment if alternative agents are available. Most of the time, pancytopenia is reversible with the discontinuation of the therapy.
