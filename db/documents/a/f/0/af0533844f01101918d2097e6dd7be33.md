**Interferon-alpha**

Depression, delirium, and cognitive impairments have occurred with interferon-alpha therapy. Patients taking interferon-alpha are at risk for decreased blood counts, cardiotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, endocrine dysfunction (most commonly manifesting as diabetes mellitus and thyroid dysfunction), renal toxicity manifesting as proteinuria, and gastrointestinal toxicity (which leads to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and altered taste). Patients taking interferon-alpha are also at risk for developing autoimmune disorders and neurological impairments, such as seizures.

**Interferon-beta**

Interferon-beta increases the risk of bone marrow suppression, pancreatitis, acute liver failure, and injection site reactions, including infection and necrosis.

**Interferon-gamma**

Interferon-gamma increases the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity, induction of autoimmunity, encephalopathy, acute renal failure, and graft versus host disease following bone marrow transplantation.
