Mittelschmerz most often presents as an acute lower quadrant (usually right-sided) pain ranging from a mild ache to intense pain. Along with several other gynecologic pathologies, mittelschmerz may present similarly to acute appendicitis, leading to misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgery. Mittelschmerz merits consideration before diagnosing appendicitis in young women of reproductive age. Mittelschmerz should also be given adequate attention from all medical providers so that it can be easily recognized and diagnosed. Interprofessional communication and awareness can help improve patient outcomes and reduce patient harm.
