There are two types of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, one related to HPV infection and another related to chronic oxidative damage, uVIN, and dVIN respectfully. dVIN only accounts for a small percentage of all VIN lesions and has a higher association with invasive cancer than uVIN. The majority of uVIN are related to HPV-16 DNA; however, there are reports of other high-risk HPV subtypes in histologically confirmed uVIN.
