The perineum is a diamond-shaped region below the pelvic floor; it extends between the inferior facial layer of the pelvic diaphragm and the perineal skin which is continuous with the skin over the lower abdominal wall and the medial aspect of the thigh. The surface projection of the perineum is best visualized in the lithotomy position, with the individual lying in a supine position and the hip joints in partial flexion and abduction. It is bounded by the lower border of the pubic symphysis and the arcuate ligament anteriorly, the tip of the coccyx posteriorly, the ischiopubic ramus, and the ischial tuberosities anterolaterally and the sacrotuberous ligaments posterolaterally. An imaginary transverse line (the inter-ischial line) between the anterior ends of the ischial tuberosity divides the perineum into an anterior urogenital triangle and a posterior anal triangle.

The urogenital triangle is the anterior region of the perineum and is bounded by the pubic symphysis anteriorly, the inter-ischial line posteriorly, and the lower margins of the ischiopubic ramus on each side. The perineal membrane also called the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm divides the urogenital triangle into the deep perineal space (located above the membrane) and the superficial perineal space (located below the membrane). The perineal membrane is attached to the inferior surface of the ischio-pubic ramus on each side and extends posteriorly to attach to the perineal body and becomes continuous with the superior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm. At its apical end, the perineal membrane is thickened to form the transverse perineal ligament.

The superficial perineal space is further divided into the subcutaneous perineal pouch and the superficial perineal pouch by the three fascia layers: the superficial fascia of the perineum, the deep perineal fascia, and the perineal membrane. The superficial perineal fascia is attached to the margins of the ischiopubic rami at its lateral end and the posterior margin of the perineal membrane at its posterior end. At its anterior end, the fascia continues to line the skin of the urogenital triangle. In males, the fascia also lines the skin of the scrotum that contains the dartos muscle. In both the sexes, the fascia becomes continuous with the membranous layer of the superficial fascia of the anterior abdominal wall (also called the Scarpa's fascia). The deep perineal fascia firmly overlies the muscles of the superficial perineal pouch and attaches to the perineal membrane and the perineal body posteriorly, the suspensory ligament of the penis or the clitoris anteriorly, and the ischiopubic rami laterally.

The subcutaneous perineal pouch is limited by the superficial fascia of the perineum (also called the Colle's fascia) externally and the deep perineal fascia internally. The subcutaneous perineal pouch contains a thin layer of subcutaneous tissue, providing mobility to the skin over the external genitalia.

The superficial perineal pouch is contained between the perineal membrane and the deep perineal fascia. It is bounded by the inner surface of the ischiopubic ramus on each side and communicates with the potential space between the Scarpa's fascia and the fascia of the abdominal wall muscles anteriorly. The general organization of this region remains the same in both the sexes, however, a significant amount of dimorphism occurs with respect to the contents of this area. Although they have different functions in males and females, the ischiocavernosus, bulbospongiosus, and the transverse perineal muscle are present in the superficial perineal space in both sexes along with the branches of the internal pudendal vessels and nerves.

In males, the superficial perineal pouch contains a pair of erectile bodies called the corpora cavernosum of the penis. Posteriorly the paired cavernosum divide to form the crura of the penis that are attached to the ischiopubic ramus. Nestled on the ventral surface of these tissues, lies a midline structure called the corpus spongiosum of the penis. It is attached to the perineal membrane at its base and expands to form the glans penis at its proximal which serves to cap the cavernosa tissue. Each of these erectile tissues contains a core of expandable vascular tissue that engorge with blood to generate effective tumescence for vaginal penetration. In addition to the vascular tissues, the corpus spongiosum also contains the spongy urethra.

A bi-layered sheath of fibro-elastic tissue, called the tunica albuginea, surrounds each of the corpus spongiosum and the corpora cavernosa. Superficial to this sheath lies Buck’s fascia, which aids in the attachment of the erectile bodies to the pelvic bones and the perineal membrane. The bulbospongiosus and the ischiocavernosus muscles lie superficial to Buck’s fascia, overlying which is the deep perineal fascia.

In females, the superficial perineal pouch contains a highly neurovascular tissue called the clitoris. It contains the female erectile bodies which include: a pair of vestibular bulbs, and a pair of corpora that are continuous with the crura. The midline structure of the clitoris also called the glans clitoris is a non-erectile body and is only an external manifestation of the clitoris. The deep and suspensory ligaments of the clitoris provide clitoral stability during sexual intercourse.

In addition to the erectile tissues, the superficial perineal pouch in females also contains a pair of pea-sized glands called the Bartholin’s gland or the greater vestibular glands. They are located on each side of the vaginal ostium and open via a small duct in the groove between the labia minora and hymen. Its secretions help in the lubrication of the vagina and the vestibule.
