After hysteroscopic polypectomy, the collected specimens should beÂ submitted to pathology for evaluation. On follow-up of specimen pathology, polyps may have evidence of malignancy, and referral to gynecology oncology is recommended for further management. Complications associated with hysteroscopic polypectomy are rare, and the risk of intrauterine adhesion is low.

Conflicting data is available on the relationship between endometrial polyps and the risk of infertility. A prospective, randomized controlled trial showed that hysteroscopic polypectomy before intrauterine insemination is an effective measure and improved pregnancy rates.
