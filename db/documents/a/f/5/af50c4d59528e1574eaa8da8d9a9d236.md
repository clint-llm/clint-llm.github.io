Regardless of treatment choice, there remains a 20% to 30% mortality risk in the first year following fracture, with males having a higher mortality rate compared to females. In patients who are treated nonoperatively, cardiopulmonary, thromboembolic events and sepsis are the most common complications seen.

Operative complications include blood loss anemia, infection, nonunion, and collapse, among others. One of the more recognized complications of implant-related failure is screw cutout, which is usually caused when the cephalomedullary screw is placed at a tip apex distance greater than 25 millimeters. If this occurs, a corrective osteotomy with open revision reduction and internal fixation is usually needed in the young patient, whereas in the elderly, treatment for this complication is typically conversion to hip arthroplasty. Another recognized complication with the placement of a long intramedullary device in the elderly population is anterior perforation of the distal femur cortex.  This is the result of a mismatch of the radius of curvature of the femur and the implant. The incidence of nonunion is low, less than 2%.
