Before the determination of phenotypic sex, the gonads are classified as "unisex" and have the potential to develop into testes or ovaries.

The belief is that the ovaries derive from the gonadal ridge. But the primordial germ cells develop in epiblast and migrate to endoderm cells in the yolk sac. They finally appear in the genital ridges in 6th week. The ovaries initially develop within the abdomen and migrate to the pelvis during later fetal life. Even though they migrate into the pelvis, they still retain their blood supply, nerve supply, and lymphatic drainage back to their site of origin, the upper abdomen.

The paramesonephric duct (Mullerian duct) is the embryologic derivative of the genital ducts. The cranial portions form the uterine tubes, while the caudal parts form the uterovaginal primordium. The uterovaginal primordium gives rise to the uterus, cervix, and superior third of the vagina. The vaginal plate is a derivative of the sinovaginal bulbs. It canalizes to form the lower two-thirds of the vagina. All of these derivatives are surrounded by a layer of myometrium that develops from mesenchyme. The outermost covering is the perimetrium that develops from folds of the peritoneum.

Embryologic defects that are important to consider including unicornuate uterus anomalies, where one paramesonephric duct fails to develop, Didelphys anomalies, where there is a complete lack of fusion of the paramesonephric duct and bicornuate uterus anomalies where there is a partial fusion of the paramesonephric duct.

The mesonephric (Wolffian) duct disappears in the case of females, except a small cranial part that remains as epoophoron and paroophoron. The remnant of the mesonephric duct is called the Gartner's duct. A small caudal portion of this duct is seen and referred to as Gartner's duct cyst within the wall of the uterus or vagina.
