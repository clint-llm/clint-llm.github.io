Management of rhegmatogenous and tractional retinal detachments is typically surgical.  Exudative macular detachments usually have nonsurgical management. The recommendation is that the patient work with a retinal specialist, an ophthalmologist with additional training in evaluation and surgical treatment of the posterior portion of the eye.

If the patient has a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, the surgeon should identify and seal all retinal breaks or tears. Three main techniques can be used to achieve closure: pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckle, or pneumatic retinopexy. These techniques can also be combined. Factors that play into the decision of which technique to use include the patient's presentation, surgeon's training, and cost.

A vitrectomy is the mechanical removal of the vitreous gel with a vitrectomy machine. The retinal surgeon typically puts three ports through the pars plana portion of the eye. One port is for the lighting, one port is for the vitreous cutter, and one port is for the infusion cannula. The surgeon then can remove vitreous tractioning on the retina and uses cryotherapy or laser around retinal breaks or tears to prevent the worsening of the detachment.

A scleral buckle is a silicone band wrapped around the globe permanently, sliding under the extraocular rectus muscles causing scleral indentation, which closes retinal breaks. Often a retina surgeon combines this with a retinopexy procedure (reattachment of the retina), typically cryopexy.

In pneumatic retinopexy, an intraocular gas bubble is injected into the eye to allow the subretinal fluid to reabsorb and a chorioretinal adhesion to form around the causative break or tear. A variety of intraocular gases are useful for tamponade, with the most common being air, SF6, or C3F8. Once the gas is in place, and retinal apposition occurs, the surgeon will perform transconjunctival retinopexy. This procedure often can be done in a clinic setting with a compliant patient. Following the procedure, patients may need to position their face down so that the gas bubble can tamponade the retinal tear. Typically, pneumatic retinopexy is only used in retinal detachments with a single break less than one clock hour in size with the break localizing to the superior eight clock hours, absence of proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and confidence that all retina breaks or tears have been identified.

In tractional detachments, tractional elements (usually epiretinal or subretinal membranes) must be relieved, which typically takes place with pars plana vitrectomy, but may be combined with scleral buckling as an adjunct.

For serous detachments, management is nonsurgical. The underlying retinal or choroidal disease or mass should be identified and treated.
