The aim of treatment is prompt and quick correction of the thiamine deficiency in the brain. Wernicke encephalopathy is a medical emergency and considered a reversible condition, therefore, requiring immediate emergent attention although the onset of the disease may be acute or chronic. Parenteral administration of thiamine is most effective and provides for rapid administration, however, in some cases, there are persistent neurological deficits, and the acute condition can progress to chronic Korsakoff syndrome. The preferred dose of thiamine treatment for Wernicke encephalopathy may be as high as 500 mg given one to three times daily parenterally. All malnourished patient may need higher doses of thiamine. Oral dosing is not reliable and not recommended.

There is some evidence that thiamine treatment can improve the confusional state, quick resolution of ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and nystagmus. Thiamine is generally administered before or together with glucose solutions because the glucose oxidation can decrease thiamine levels thereby exacerbating the neurological symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy. Patients with magnesium deficiency should also be treated as this can result in reduced recovery from Wernicke encephalopathy especially in patients with alcoholism.

Most patients need to be admitted to ensure that they receive IV thiamine and magnesium.
