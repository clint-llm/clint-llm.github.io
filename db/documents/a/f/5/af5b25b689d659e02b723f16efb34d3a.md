There are potential false positives and false negatives during the interpretation of a 111-indium leukocyte scan.Â There is the possibility for localization of uptake in instances unrelated to infection.

Pathologic disease processes including chronic abscess, any lymphocytic mediate infection such as sarcoidosis or tuberculosis, and hepatic or splenic abscess given these organs uptake 111 indium to metabolize may cause false-negative nuclear scans with 111- indium.

Given the numerous false positive and false negative interpretations of the 111-indium WBC labeled nuclear scan, correlating clinically to a specific patient's history and physical exam, as well as previously obtained imaging studies, is extremely important.
