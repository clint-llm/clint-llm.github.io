As glucose intolerance is a state with increased risk for diabetes and its complications, intervention can reduce the progression to diabetes. Interventions are more beneficial in IGT with or without IFG in comparison to isolated IFG.

**Diet and Exercise**

Lifestyle modifications which improve insulin sensitivity and beta cell function are very important in the management of glucose intolerance. Several studies have shown that lifestyle intervention can reduce conversion to type 2 diabetes. The aim is to achieve and maintain 7% loss of initial body weight. It should include moderate-intensity physical activity (such as brisk walking) for at least 150 minutes per week, with a minimum frequency of 3 times a week.

Reducing caloric intake is of paramount importance for those at high risk for developing type 2 DM. The quality of fats consumed in the diet is more important than the total quantity. Diets relatively high in monounsaturated fats can help prevent T2DM. Higher intakes of nuts, berries, yogurt and high fiber food, and tea are associated with reduced diabetes risk. Conversely, red meats and sugar-sweetened beverages are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Both the Mediterranean diet and the dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet are reasonable strategies.

**Metformin**

Metformin is a biguanide which inhibits hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity. It has been shown to prevent progression to diabetes. Patients with combined IFG and IGT show benefit on treatment with metformin.  It might have greater benefit in patients under 60 years with significant obesity with a BMI greater than 35, and in women with a history of gestational DM. The role of other pharmacotherapies is not well endorsed by all organizations
