Arthrocentesis is a versatile procedure with both diagnostic and therapeutic value. US guidance provides visualization of the important anatomy, pathology, and needle when performing arthrocentesis. As mentioned above, US-guided arthrocentesis has several key advantages to the landmark-based techniques. These advantages are: the ability to aspirate small volume effusions for evaluation, aspiration of larger volumes from the joint, improved speed to diagnosis, decreased pain during the procedure, and improved safety by avoiding important neurovascular, cartilaginous, and ligamentous structures.****

A perhaps hidden benefit of US-guided arthrocentesis is that it also allows for real-time documentation of the procedure if the US video is stored as part of the medical record. These advantages make US-guided arthrocentesis the technique of choice when the US is available. Furthermore, the US-guided technique will likely increase the clinician's confidence and encourage arthrocentesis when clinically warranted.
