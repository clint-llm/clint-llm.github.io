Patients with increased triglycerides are often on fibrate therapy for management. It is pertinent to take caution when adding statin therapy, as previously mentioned. Fibrates may exacerbate statin-based side effects.

Nicotinic acid supplementation for triglyceride reduction can be a common adjunct in refractory patients. Niacin therapy has a unique side-effect profile that requires caution as well. Hyperuricemia from niacin therapy can predispose patients at risk of acute gout attacks. Acute gout is treated with NSAIDs as first-line therapy in addition to discontinuation of niacin therapy. Additionally, newer formulations with coated capsules help reduce flushing episodes.

Fish oil supplementation helps manage VLDL and triglyceride levels; however, gastrointestinal symptoms are a common cause of patient discontinuation of supplementation.
