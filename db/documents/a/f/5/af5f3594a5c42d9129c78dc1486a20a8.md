A nocturnal cough needs to be assessed in terms of intensity, severity, frequency, and sensitivity. Some clues in the assessment of a nocturnal cough:

- A cough worsening on supine posture: Postnasal drip, esophageal reflux, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and heart failure

- Presence of clear sputum: Hypersensitivity mechanism

- Purulent sputum: Sinusitis, bronchiectasis; rule out tuberculosis

- Blood tinged sputum: Malignancies, tuberculosis, and bronchiectasis

- A non-productive cough: Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor therapy

- Improvement of a cough with antihistaminic treatment confirms the diagnosis of upper airway cough syndrome (UACS)

- The red flag symptoms of chronic nocturnal cough are copious sputum (bronchiectasis), hemoptysis (malignancy, tuberculosis), systemic symptoms (tuberculosis, lymphoma, lung primary or secondaries), and significant dyspnoea (congestive heart failure, COPD, fibrotic lung disease).

General examination should evaluate clubbing (may be indicative of vasculitis, sarcoidosis, and malignancies), pedal edema, and lymphadenopathy. Physical examination includes:

- The search for a deviated nasal septum, turbinate hypertrophy, polyps, and sinusitis

- Ears: Inflammation of the tympanic membrane or the external canal

- Respiratory system: Bilateral wheeze in COPD, bronchial asthma, or even heart failure; localized wheeze may occur in case of obstruction with a foreign body or tumor

- Other systems should also be examined carefully
