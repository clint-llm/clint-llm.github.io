The etiology is uncertain but likely to beÂ multifactorial. Possible associations include toxic insecticides (epidemiological studies in rural Greece), premature birth, and fungal toxin exposure. In the 1990s, the incidence of acute idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) in young infants in several midwestern US cities increased, especially in the Cleveland area. Epidemiological research led to the discovery of substantial growth of the toxigenic fungus Stachybotrys atra in the homes of almost all of the cases, suggesting that exposure to that mold can cause IPH in infants. Subsequent data did not prove this association. Pulmonary hemosiderosis is associated with rheumatoid arthritis, thyrotoxicosis, celiac disease, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, suggesting a potential autoimmune mechanism.
