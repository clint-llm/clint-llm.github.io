In early fetal development, ventral migration of neural crest cells from the neuroectoderm coalesce to form a sympathetic ganglion. Some of these neural crest cells migrate further from the sympathetic ganglion and are subsequently enveloped by mesenchymal cells of the developing fetal adrenal cortex. The surrounded neural crest cells become the adrenal medulla. These cells develop into chromaffin cells capable of synthesizing catecholamines.
