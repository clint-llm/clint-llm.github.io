- Between 50 mmHg to 90 mmHg at sea level, i.e., 1 atmosphere absolute (ATA), while breathing air

- Between 250 mmHg to 450 mmHg at 1 ATA while breathing 100% oxygen

- Between 700 mmHg to 900 mmHg at 2 ATA while breathing 100% oxygen

- Between 900 mmHg to 1300 mmHg at 3 ATA while breathing 100% oxygen.
