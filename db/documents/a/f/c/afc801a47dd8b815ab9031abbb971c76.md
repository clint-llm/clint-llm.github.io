Uncovering the etiology of undifferentiated shock is very important. In a patient presenting with undifferentiated shock, the differential diagnosis includes a wide variety of etiologies that falls under the four major categories of shock, as outlined above. Also, sometimes patients can have a combination of shock syndromes. Another differential is "pharmacological shock," which results from vasodilatation or myocardial depression from medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, opiates, anticholinergics, and sildenafil).
