The presence of non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas with a variety of LangerhansÂ giant cells is the histopathologic hallmark of lupus pernio. Immunohistochemical staining predominantly demonstrates CD4+ Th1 lymphocytes within the granuloma. However, the periphery of the granuloma is composed of CD4+ as well as CD8+ T cells. The proportions of lymphocytic infiltrate and fibrosis in the granulomas vary depending on the patient and disease duration. In some patients, the giant cells have intracytoplasmic inclusions like asteroid bodies, Schaumann bodies, and birefringent crystalline particles.
