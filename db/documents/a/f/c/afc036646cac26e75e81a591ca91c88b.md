Migraine is a primary headache disorder and a common, recurrent, disabling condition affecting an estimated 18% of women and 6% of men. There are commonly reported triggers that can induce migraine, namely stress, fatigue, various foods, alcohol, drugs, smoking, weather changes, and odors. Recent studies also provide new insights into the underlying pathophysiology and genetics of migraine that would provide novel pharmacotherapies for management and prevention.

Children with migraine have a genetic predisposition activated by an environmental or physiological stimulus.Â These stimuli include exposure to drugs, diet, stress, or puberty. Most children with a history of migraines seem to have a positive family history.CACNA1A (calcium channel), ATP1A2 (Na/K-ATPase), and SCN1A (sodium channel) genes resulting in the development of hemiplegic migraine.

Migraine is considered a strongly heritable disorder. Studies investigated the age of onset of migraine between successive generations. The age of migraine onset was significantly lower in the children with a history of maternal or paternal migraine than in their parents. Findings revealed that parental history of migraine showed that children with migraine were significantly younger at the first appearance of migraine than their affected parents.
