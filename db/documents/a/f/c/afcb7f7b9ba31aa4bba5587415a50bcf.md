The scale of a hazmat incident is unpredictable, and many factors affecting the scene have to be considered. Factors such as wind direction, weather, and available resources such as a water supply or electricity can make hazmat scenes difficult to control. On some occasions, decontamination inside warehouses or make-shift shelters may be considered. If decontamination must occur outside in a very cold climate, the incidence command system must implement a way to combat hypothermia. Factors such as these can add many layers to a hazmat incident, adding to the already unpredictable nature of hazmat incidents.

Further, there is often a delay in providing care for hazmat victims. It takes time to respond and adequately set up an incident command system in response to a hazmat call. Even in a well-equipped, resource-rich environment, time to decontamination will often be delayed. One study recommended a “self-decontamination” protocol for large-scale hazmat exposures. This would help relieve the burden of a large patient load overcrowding a decontamination protocol; however, it would require better education of the community. Despite the best planned and rehearsed chemical response plan, most individuals will self-rescue and head toward the nearest hospital or healthcare facility. For this reason, healthcare facilities should also have decontamination procedures in place. Audits must be routinely done to ensure that workers are in compliance with the safety features.
