Maternal morbidity and mortality are global socioeconomic and healthcare burdens, and postpartum infections account for a significant, and often preventable, portion of that burden. The postpartum period is traditionally defined as the six weeks following delivery, and infections are relatively common, affecting an estimated 5 to 7% of women during this time. Puerperal sepsis is one of the top five causes of maternal deaths worldwide and accounts for 10 to 15% of deaths in the postpartum period. Infections are also the most common cause of death following spontaneous or induced abortions. The medical burden of these infections is compounded by the alarmingly rapid increase in bacterial resistance to commonly used antibiotics.

Postpartum infections also present a significant social burden: they increase maternal anxiety and the risk of postpartum depression, interfere with bonding, and negatively impact breastfeeding.
