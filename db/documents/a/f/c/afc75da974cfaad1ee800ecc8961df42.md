When a patient presents with koilonychia, it takes multiple types of healthcare professionals to get to the root of the cause. Realistically, a patient will research his or her condition and then present their concerns to the physician. While the primary care physician can start preliminary testing, itÂ usually requires the help of multiple specialists to determine the cause of koilonychia. There have been no randomized controlled trials involving koilonychia so there are no levels of evidence regarding prevention or treatment of the same.

Patients with PVS are best managed by an interprofessional approach involving a hematologist, gastroenterologist, and a thoracic surgeon. These patients should be followed as outpatients to rule out the complications associated with this entity and prompt treatment should be given whenever needed.
