Patients with risk factors for stroke including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and smoking should be educated on the signs of symptoms of strokes. Additionally, they should be encouraged to call 911 if they ever develop stroke symptoms as patients that utilize emergency medical services frequently have better outcomes. Lifestyle modification including weight loss, limiting carbohydrates and sodium in the diet, and tobacco cessation can lower the risk of stroke. Patients that have had a stroke should be made aware of the importance of medication adherence and the consequences of inadequate treatment.
