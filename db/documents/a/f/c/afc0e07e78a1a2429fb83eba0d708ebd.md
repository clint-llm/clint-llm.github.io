Menetrier disease is a rare disease with unknown prevalence. Primary care clinicians must be aware of this disease as the diagnosis requires referral to a gastroenterologist. As there is no proven treatment for this disease, an interprofessional team approach involving primary clinicians, gastroenterologists, pathologists, and a surgeon is recommended. For milder cases, supportive therapy with the involvement of a dietician to mitigate protein loss is recommended. In all instances, interprofessional care coordination and open communication channels, combined with accurate and up-to-date record keeping, will enhance patient outcomes. [Level 5]
