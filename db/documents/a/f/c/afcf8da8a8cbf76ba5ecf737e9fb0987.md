The presentation is most commonly seen in patients 6 to 15 years old but may include all ages.

In the pediatric population, nonspecific symptoms can be present, and they vary depending on the severity of the infection. The indolent course usually presents with headache, rhinorrhea, and fever. The presence of a fluctuant, tender swelling of the frontal scalp should place PPT high in the differential.

Increased intracranial pressure is suspected if the patient presents with nausea/vomiting, photophobia, cranial nerve deficits, seizures, altered mental status, lethargy, or obtundation. Emergent diagnosis, imaging, neurosurgical/otolaryngologist consultation, and treatment is advised.
