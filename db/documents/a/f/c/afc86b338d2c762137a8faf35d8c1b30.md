There is evidence to show vertebral augmentation can decrease height loss and the severity of the spinal deformity.

The American Society of Radiation Oncology recommends patients with a pathological fracture secondary to vertebral metastasis who elect to undergo vertebroplasty to also proceed with co-current radiation therapy.

There is a limited side effect profile for the majority of patients undergoing vertebral augmentation.

There is promising evidence of pain relief in patients with metastatic multiple myeloma and similar evidence for malignancy with bony metastasis.

Vertebral augmentation should not be considered a first-line treatment option for patients with osteoporotic compression fractures of the lumbar spine. Some experts recommend it for refractory cases with persistent and severe pain.

There have been limited studies completed on kyphoplasty in comparison to vertebroplasty. More randomized controlled trials need to be completed for kyphoplasty to determine its efficacy fully.
