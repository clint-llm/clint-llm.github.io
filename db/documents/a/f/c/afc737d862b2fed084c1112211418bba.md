Multiple options exist for the removal of EAC foreign bodies. The type and shape of the foreign body, its location, and the patient's level of cooperation will determine which piece of equipment to use.

Commonly used instruments include alligator forceps, cup forceps, right-angle hooks, Schuknecht foreign body suction tips, curved Rosen picks, and balloon catheters, such as a Fogarty catheter. The use of fine, sharper instruments is greatly facilitated by binocular microscopy.

Irrigation is another common option, and this can be performed by attaching an angiocatheter to a 20 to 30 mL syringe. Alternatively, modifying a butterfly catheter by cutting off the needle and then attaching the remaining tubing to the syringe can be effective as well. Great care must be taken with blind irrigation, as an unrecognized tympanic membrane perforation may exist. Some authors advise against irrigation of the EAC unless the tympanic membrane can be visualized completely to ensure it is intact.

Suction is also an option and usually is performed with a Frazier tip under binocular microscopy.

Another potential method uses cyanoacrylate (superglue) or tissue glue applied to the blunt end of a cotton-tipped applicator and then placed against the foreign body so that the glue adheres to it, and both the foreign body and applicator can be removed from the EAC together.
