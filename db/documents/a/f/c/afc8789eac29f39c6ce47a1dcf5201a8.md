Treatment mainly depends on the cause of amenorrhea. If the cause of amenorrhea is estrogen deficiency, estrogen can be administered. If amenorrhea is due to malnutrition, a proper diet plan can cure the patient successfully. For anorexia nervosa and stress-induced amenorrhea, cognitive-behavioral therapy and SSRIs can help. Dopamine agonist drugs like cabergoline can treat prolactinoma, and if large, surgery can provide a full cure. The appropriate surgical procedure can treat anatomical causes of amenorrhea. PCOS can be handled by combined oral contraceptives and metformin. SSRI can treat stress-induced hypothalamic amenorrhea.

There is good evidence that patients with menstrual irregularities are at high risk for bone fractures, and hence osteoporosis prevention should be the next step. Patients should be offered vitamin D and calcium supplements.

Because amenorrhea can also affect self-esteem, a mental health consult is necessary.

Women with stress, eating disorders should undergo behavior modification.
