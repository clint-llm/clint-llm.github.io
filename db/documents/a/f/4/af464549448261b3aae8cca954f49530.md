Pneumonectomy is usually performed through a posterolateral thoracotomy incision as it provides the best exposure. An incision is usually done at the level of the fourth or fifth intercostal space. Other approaches commonly used are the axillary and the anterior thoracotomy; however, they provide poor access to the posterior thorax. Hemi-clamshell and clamshell approaches are usually used for large tumors involving the apex of the upper lobe or the anterosuperior mediastinum.

The interest in minimally invasive lung surgery has significantly grown in the past few years. This includes video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS). Surgery is usually done through one or more small incisions in the chest wall. This usually translates into lower morbidity and more favorable pain control when compared to open surgical approaches. In VATS, the surgeon holds the surgical instruments, while in RATS, the surgeon does not handle the instruments but can control all movements from the console. Compared to RATS, VATS is associated with a lower cost, less blood loss, and shorter operative time.

A restrictive IV fluid strategy is usually employed in the absence of severe hemodynamic instability and ongoing blood loss. This is associated with a lower incidence of acute lung injury and enhanced recovery after surgery.

A lung-protective ventilation strategy is usually employed to decrease the risk of acute lung injury. This includes the use of low tidal volumes of around 5 ml/kg of ideal body weight, maintenance of low airway driving pressure, and the use of PEEP. FiO2 should be kept at the lowest possible to keep arterial oxygen saturation above 90%. Unless contraindicated, permissive hypercapnia is usually allowed to achieve these goals.

At the conclusion of surgery, two lung ventilation is resumed, and the patient is returned to the supine position. Bronchoscopy is done if needed. An arterial blood gas is usually drawn to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and the patient is extubated if deemed appropriate. Some patients may require continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) after extubation. Such non-invasive ventilatory strategies improve oxygenation without increasing the incidence of complications.

Postoperative care is of great importance to decrease the incidence of complications. Ideally, patients should be managed in an intensive care unit. Extubation should be done early if deemed appropriate. Oxygen should be supplemented, if necessary, to maintain saturation while avoiding positive pressure whenever possible. Invasive monitoring should be continued. Care should be taken not to react to hypotension with fluid boluses as this may result in pulmonary edema and subsequent increase in morbidity and mortality. The chest tube, if present, should be off suction. The multimodal analgesic strategy should be employed. Esophageal dysmotility should be anticipated, and diet should be advanced gradually.
