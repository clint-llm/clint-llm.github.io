The history in patients with a complaint of radicular pain or muscle weakness should include inquiring about occupational risk factors, history of trauma and pain pattern.Â Cervical radiculopathy is almost always unilateral, although, in rare cases, both nerves at a given level may be impacted. Those rare presentations can confound physical diagnosis and require acceleration to advanced imaging especially in cases of trauma.

On physical examination, positioning the patient to isolate individual reflex arcs is key. Given the individual variation in deep tendon reflexes comparing side to side is more important than overall magnitude. If there is nerve impingement, the affected side will be reduced relative to the unaffected side. Reduction in strength of muscles innervated by the affected nerve is also significant physical finding.

Spurling test, which compresses the foramina, is useful in diagnosing likely radiculopathy. With the head extended, the head should then be rotated. The test is positive if the pain radiates down the upper limb of the ipsilateral side of the rotation.

In some cases, cervical traction can provide relief of radicular pain.
