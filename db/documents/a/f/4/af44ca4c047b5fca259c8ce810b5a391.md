A pudendal nerve block is historically a common regional anesthesia technique to provide perineal anesthesia during obstetric procedures, including vaginal birth during the second stage of labor, vaginal repairs, and anorectal surgeries such as hemorrhoidectomies.

Pudendal nerve blocks are also used to treat the pain associated with pudendal neuralgia and aid in its diagnosis. Patients describe the pudendal neuralgia pain as a burning sensation and hyperalgesia in the external genital and perineal region. It may also be described as a tingling, aching, stabbing, or electric-shock type of discomfort.

Most pudendal neuralgia is unilateral; however, there are reports of bilateral neuralgia in bicyclists.

A successful pudendal nerve block is one of the key tests to help confirm a diagnosis of pudendal entrapment and neuralgia.
