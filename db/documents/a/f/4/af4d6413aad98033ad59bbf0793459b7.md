The identification of seronegative spondyloarthropathies can follow the presentation of inflammatory back pain. The etiology of these conditions is complex, but in general, is associated with a precipitating systemic inflammatory response to a known or unknown source. This systemic inflammation causes local tissue alterations that can persist in the local joint environment. The persistence of inflammation through pathways that continue to be identified and described, such as interleukin-17 and tumor necrosis factor, mediates a cycle of ongoing unbalanced bone remodeling and resulting axial bone loss. These inflammatory and resulting structural changes, demonstrated classically on imaging by vertebral bone fusion noted in ankylosing spondylitis, suggest a source for the insidious onset of chronic pain noted in patients with IBP and have helped to guide research into avenues of intervention.
