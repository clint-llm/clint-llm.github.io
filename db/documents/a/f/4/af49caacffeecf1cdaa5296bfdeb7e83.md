Before starting fibrate therapy, patients should start on an adequate lipid-lowering diet. It should be used only as an adjunct to lipid-lowering diet and medication and not as a first-line mode of therapy.

Fibrates are administered orally, ideally as once a day tablets. According to the FDA, the dosing of fibrates in adults is as follows, adjusted for the patient profile :

- Primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia - Start with 120 mg daily.

- Severe hypertriglyceridemia - The dose ranges from 40 mg to 120 mg daily and is adjusted according to lipid levels.

- Renally impaired patients - Initiate with 40 mg per day. Conduct regular renal function tests and serum cholesterol levels and up-titrate the drug as required.

- Geriatric patients -Â The dosing is per the renal function of the patient.

The above regime is for fenofibrate, which is available as 40 mg and 120 mg tablets. The patient's response to it must be measured every 4 to 8 weeks, followed by adjusting the drug dosage.
