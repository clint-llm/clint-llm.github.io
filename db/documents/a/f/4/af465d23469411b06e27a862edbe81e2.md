The cause of FFI has been identified as an autosomal dominant mutation at the codon 178 of the PRNP gene, locatedÂ on the short (p) arm of chromosome 20 at position p13 responsible for making the prion protein PrPC.

The disease-causing mutation consists of substitution from the normal aspartic acid (Asp) to asparagine (Asn). The presence of methionine at codon 129 is distinct for FFI compared to valine at the same position in familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (fCJD). Furthermore, an aggressive form of the disease has been linked to the configuration of the nonmutated allele (Met) at codon 129 of the disease-causing mutated gene. The more aggressive variant has methionine (Met-Met) on the nonmutated allele compared to when it has valine (Met-Val).

Evidence suggests that the onset of the disease depends on the critical amount of PrP conversion to the faulty prion protein.
