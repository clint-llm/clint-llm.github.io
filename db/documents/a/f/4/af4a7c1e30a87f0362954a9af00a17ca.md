Pathologically, the body fat and muscle mass are reduced in the fetus, resulting in decreased subcutaneous fat, as well as body nitrogen and protein contents. The reduction in the maternal-fetal transfer of nutrients due to placental insufficiency, namely glucose, amino acids, and minerals, leads to lesser deposition of glycogen in the liver and muscles, and of minerals in the bones. As the fetus continues to be under stress, the blood flow is diverted away from less vital organs and redirected preferentially to the brain, heart, adrenal glands, and placenta.
