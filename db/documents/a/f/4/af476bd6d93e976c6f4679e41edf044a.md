Herpes keratitis is a very common infection that is often first seen by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, or the emergency department physician. These clinicians should always consult with the ophthalmologist before starting any treatment. The disease needs to be dealt with in time to avoid morbidity. Coordination among healthcare professionals is vital for better patient outcome. Ophthalmologists, opticians, dermatologists, nurses, and pharmacists all need to work in coherence to tackle the disease and all the possible complications. Even after treatment, the patient should be closely followed until the symptoms have subsided, and the visual acuity is normal. Surgeons also need to be onboard since surgery may be the only last resort. Interprofessional communication is the key to manage the problem at its core appropriately.

An interprofessional healthcare team approach is necessary. The physicians will decide the course of treatment and prescribe appropriate therapy. Nursing can assist in patient education about the disease, as well as assess therapeutic effectiveness and patient compliance. Pharmacists should verify dosing and perform medication reconciliation to ensure the absence of drug-drug interactions. Any concerns form nursing or pharmacy should be reported to the treating physicians promptly. Herpes keratitis management will be optimized by this type of interprofessional, collaborative approach, leading to better patient outcomes. [Level 5]
