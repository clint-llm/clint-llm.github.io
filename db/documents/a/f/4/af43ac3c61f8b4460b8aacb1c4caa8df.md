A thorough clinical history is vital in establishing the cause of dwarfism. The child's clinical record should include relevant data from gestation to birth, developmental milestones, and puberty emergence. A pedigree chart can be formulated to mention the family history of short stature. A psychological assessment of the patient is crucial as this disorder is associated with social stigmatization and extensive mental pressure. Anthropometric measurements are a part of regular child visits. These measurements include body weight, height vertex, truncal height, and limb length, plotted on a growth chart to compare with the mean parameters for that age, sex, and population.
