Pre-clinical investigations answer basic questions regarding a drug's safety; however, they are not a substitute for studies that evaluate the effects of a drug on the human body.

The drug development process' ultimate goal is to introduce a new or significantly improved/alteredÂ compound, with proven therapeutic effect, to the market. Hence, the transition from pre-clinical research to clinical phases marks a critical juncture, as many potential medications do not progress beyond this point. Trials of first-in-class drugs are also helpful in providing the most rigorous testing of causal mechanisms in human disease.
