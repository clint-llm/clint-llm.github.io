**Hyposecretion**

**Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI)**

CDI is the most common form of pathology secondary to low ADH secretion by the posterior pituitary. Decreased levels of ADH will increase the number of binding receptors in the collecting duct. However, this will result in excess free water in the urine. Approximately 50% of the cases have no clear etiology and are labeled as idiopathic central diabetes insipidus. The other 50% belong to different categories, including familial, traumatic, and various disorders of hypothalamus and pituitary, for example, Sheehan syndrome, tumors, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, syphilis, eosinophilic granuloma, and/or encephalitis.

**Oxytocin Insufficiency**

Hyposecretion of oxytocin is not a common pathology but does transpire on rare occasions. This occurs when the level of oxytocin is well below the baseline margins. Low levels of oxytocin would halt uterine contraction and milk ejection during the birthing process. Panhypopituitarism is a condition where all anterior and posterior pituitary hormone levels are below normal, compromising their respective organs and can potentially be the cause of oxytocin insufficiency.

**Hypersecretion**

**Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone**

SIADH is excess ADH production from the posterior pituitary or an ectopic source. Elevated levels result in excess water retention and hypervolemic hyponatremia. However, edema or third spacing does not occur because hypervolemia activates natriuresis, which excretes water from the urine. SIADH also inhibits the production of renin and aldosterone secondary to volume expansion and high blood pressure, leading to diuresis. SIADH etiologies are tumors, malignancies, stroke, trauma, infection, medications, and/or anesthesia.

**Oxytocin Toxicity**

This is a very rare situation and occurs when the level of oxytocin is above the baseline margins. High concentrations of oxytocin result in an overactive uterus, causing hypertrophy and limiting pregnancy due to insufficient space to hold the fetus.
