HGB combines with CO 220 times more intensely than it does with oxygen. In the air in a standard room (21% O2), the half-life of CO is 320 minutes. In 100% O2, the half-life of CO is less than 90 minutes. With hyperbaric oxygen at a pressure of 3 ATA (atmospheres absolute), the half-life of CO is decreased to 23 minutes. The only adequate treatment for significant CO poisoning is hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT).
