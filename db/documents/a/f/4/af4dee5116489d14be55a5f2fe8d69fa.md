The pathologic process associated with somatostatin is the somatostatinoma. It is a rare NET that develops in the pancreas or duodenum and releases large amounts of somatostatin. This illness presents a distinct clinical picture that includes cholelithiasis, diabetes mellitus, weight loss, and steatorrhea. The inhibitory effect of somatostatin leads to decreased gallbladder emptying as well as reduced cholecystokinin production, which results in gallstones. Increased somatostatin reduces insulin production resulting in diabetes. Lastly, the inhibition of pancreatic enzymes leads to the development of steatorrhea and weight loss.
