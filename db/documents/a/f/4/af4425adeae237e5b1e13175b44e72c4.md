The medial pectoral nerve arises posterior to the axillary artery, curves forward between the axillary artery and vein before receiving a communicating branch from the lateral pectoral nerve. The medial pectoral nerve enters the pectoralis minor muscle in which it gives off several branches that supply the muscle. The nerve then perforates the pectoralis minor muscle to reach the pectoralis major muscle. The pectoralis major muscle consists of a clavicular part and a sternal part. The sternal portion receives innervation from the medial pectoral nerve, which functions to extend the arm at the shoulder from a flexed position. Due to the insertion of the pectoralis minor muscle to the coracoid apophysis, this muscle helps produce a medial rotation of the scapula against resistance, with the scapula and the upper limb fixed. Therefore, an injury to the medial pectoral nerve can lead to an inability to elevate the shoulder. The pectoralis minor muscle can also work as an accessory muscle for forced inspiration.

The medial pectoral nerve arises from the medial cord of the brachial plexus with C8 and T1 nerve roots.
