The purpose of creating a sterile field is to reduce the number of microbes present to as few as possible. The sterile field is used in many situations outside the operating room as well as inside the operating room when performing surgical cases. Sterile fields should be used outside the operating room when performing any procedure that could introduce microbes into a patient. A few examples would be inserting a foley catheter, an arterial line, and a central line. Inside the operating room, sterile fields are created when practitioners identify the back table that will be used, the mayo stand that will go up to the field, and finally, the patient and the surgical site itself. This review describes the preparation of a sterile field and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in ensuring antisepsis.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the technique of maintaining a sterile technique.
- Review the indications for a sterile technique.
- Summarize the clinical relevance of a sterile technique.
- Explain the importance of care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the maintenance of sterile techniques during surgical/medical procedures and improve outcomes.
