Popliteal artery aneurysms are true aneurysms as they involve all layers of the arterial wall. Aneurysmal dilation of the popliteal artery is defined as enlargement of the artery to 1.5 times the normal diameter. Thus, with a normal diameter ranging between 0.5cm and 1.1cm, a popliteal artery is considered aneurysmal at 1.5cm or greater. In addition to generating emboli leading to acute limb ischemia, these aneurysms are prone to filling with mural thrombus which can occlude the artery. This activity outlines the importance of early diagnosis of thrombosed popliteal aneurysms, reviews management options and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of a popliteal artery aneurysm.
- Explain the physical findings of a patient with a thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysm.
- Explain treatment considerations for patients with thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysms.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by popliteal artery aneurysms.
