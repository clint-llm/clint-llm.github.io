**Embryonic Stage –**3-6 weeks

The respiratory diverticulum appears on the ventral wall of the primitive foregut endoderm, posterior to the pharynx.  The ventral wall rostral to the lung buds now pinches off from the dorsal wall to form a parallel tube which, after caudal elongation, forms the trachea anteriorly and the esophagus posteriorly. Following the fourth week of development, the caudal end of the trachea bifurcates to form the left and right primary bronchial buds which continue to grow into the adjacent layer of splanchnopleuric mesoderm-derived pleural mesenchyme. The formation of the primary bronchial buds marks the beginning of branching morphogenesis. At the end of the fifth week, the primary bronchial buds divide asymmetrically to form the secondary bronchial buds, two on the left and three on the right, which will give rise to future lobes of each lung. The final round of branching in the embryonic stage occurs at the end of the sixth week of development with the division of the secondary bronchial buds into tertiary bronchial buds on each side which will eventually give rise to the bronchopulmonary segments of the mature lung.

Parietal and visceral pleura of the lungs form from somatopleuric and splanchnopleuric layers of mesoderm respectively during weeks 5 to 7. These pleuroperitoneal will later extend caudally and fuse with the posterior edge of the septum transversum to close the thoracic cavity and separate it from the abdominal cavity below.

At the end of the embryonic stage, the larynx, trachea, lung primordia, lobe of the lungs and the bronchopulmonary segments have formed.

**Pseudoglandular Stage –**5-17 weeks

This stage is primarily responsible for the generation of the bronchial tree. The cuboidal epithelium lends the lungs to look similar to exocrine glands, which loosely embed in the extensive pleural mesenchyme in this phase of development. During this stage, the tertiary bronchial buds undergo extensive branching morphogenesis to form the first 20 generations of the respiratory tree in humans by the end of week 16.

At the end of this stage, the respiratory tree has developed as far as the terminal bronchioles, with the formation of an arterial system, cartilage, and smooth muscle. As the respiratory bronchioles have not developed yet, infants born at this stage will not be able to facilitate gas exchange and hence unable to survive.

**Canalicular Stage**– 16-25 weeks

This stage marks the division between the conducting and respiratory units in the respiratory tree. Elongation and growth of the existing terminal bronchioles form an acinus composed of respiratory bronchioles, each of which gives rise to 3 to 6 alveolar ducts. Intensive angiogenesis of the splanchnic mesenchyme in the mesodermal tissue surrounding the acinus creates a dense capillary network that begins to form the blood-air barrier. During week 20, lamellar bodies begin to appear in the cytoplasm of the cuboidal type II pneumocytes lining the distal epithelium. Lamellar bodies store pulmonary surfactant, composed of lipids and Surfactant Proteins A-C, before exocytotic release into the alveoli.

At this stage, some respiration is possible due to the formation of the gas exchanging portion of the lungs; therefore, infants born at this stage can survive if provided with intensive care. However, they often do not survive due to the lack of surface area for gas exchange and limited production of pulmonary surfactant by type II pneumocytes.

**Saccular Stage –**24 weeks-birth

During this stage, the gas-exchange surface area of the lungs significantly expands. Growth of the terminal airways reduces the amount of surrounding mesodermal tissue and forms clusters of enlarged airspaces known as terminal sacs or ‘saccules.’ Each saccule is separated by thick primary septa containing a double capillary network, with a central connective tissue layer. Maturation and differentiation of type II pneumocytes into type I pneumocytes results in thin-walled terminal sacs. Capillaries invade the thin walls of the sacculi to form the blood-air barrier composed of type I pneumocytes, thin basement membrane of the capillaries, and endothelium, producing a functional surface for efficient gas exchange.

Pulmonary surfactant production begins at 24 weeks; however, the production of adequate amounts to prevent atelectasis is not until 32 weeks. Therefore infants born after 32 weeks have a much higher chance of survival than those born at 24 weeks.

**Alveolar Stage –**36 weeks – 8 years

Prior to birth, immature alveoli appear as bulges from the sacculi which invade the primary septa. As the sacculi continue to increase in size, the protrusions in the primary septa become larger; these new longer and thinner septations are known as secondary septa and are responsible for the final division of the respiratory tree of sacculi into alveoli. Septation occurs at sites where there is increased fibroblast activity and secretion of collagen and elastin fibers into the interstitium. The process of alveolar division continues until 3 years of age, with the majority of divisions occurring within the first 6 months. To create a thinner diffusion barrier. The double-layer capillary network fuse into a single network, each one closely associated with two alveoli as maturation progresses.

Until the third year of life, enlargement of lungs is a consequence of the increasing number of alveoli; after this point, both the number and size of alveoli increases until the mature lungs form at around 8 years of age.
