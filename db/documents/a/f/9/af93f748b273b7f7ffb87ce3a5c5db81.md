Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is an immunodeficiency disorder involving both B and T cells and is characterized by an inability of leukocytes to migrate to the site of infection to kill offending microbes. This activity describes the evaluation and management of leukocyte adhesion deficiency and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the different types of leukocyte adhesion deficiency defects in the etiology of leukocyte adhesion deficiency.
- Identify the deficient integrins in the pathophysiology of leukocyte adhesion deficiency.
- Summarize the immunological investigations used in the evaluation of leukocyte adhesion deficiency.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to counsel and provide psychological support to the parents of a child with leukocyte adhesion deficiency.
