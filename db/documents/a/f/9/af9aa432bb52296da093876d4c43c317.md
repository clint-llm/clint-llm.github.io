The ampicillin/sulbactam combination shows synergy to cover strains of bacteria resistant to ampicillin, thus providing broader coverage. This combo adds a beta-lactamase inhibitor to ampicillin to provide extended coverage against potentially resistant bacteria. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent to interprofessional team members to use ampicillin-sulbactam appropriately for various indications with an eye towards antimicrobial stewardship.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for ampicillin-sulbactam.
- Describe the mechanism of action of ampicillin-sulbactam.
- Review the possible adverse effects associated with the use of ampicillin-sulbactam.
- Outline the role of interprofessional coordination to restrict the unwarranted use of ampicillin-sulbactam to avoid contributing to antimicrobial resistance.
