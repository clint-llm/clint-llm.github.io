Before performing any invasive procedure, a thorough evaluation of the patient’s past medical and surgical history is necessary. The patient's current imaging studies should undergo review, and if needed, further cross-sectional imaging ordered as appropriate. To determine risk factors related to coagulopathies encountered during the procedure, the minimum serological workup should include a CBC, platelet count, INR, and aPTT. When clinically appropriate, the INR should be corrected to be less than 1.5, and the target value for platelets should be greater than 50,000 per microliter.
