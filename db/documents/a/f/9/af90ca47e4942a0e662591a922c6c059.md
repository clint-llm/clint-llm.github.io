The diver should be stabilized with basic and advanced cardiac life support. Intravenous access should be obtained along with the application of supplemental oxygen. Administration of crystalloid intravenous fluid for hydration is recommended. Perform intubation in patients who have an unstable airway or have persistent hypoxia despite breathing 100% oxygen.

No specific treatment is required for mild cases of pneumomediastinum as air will reabsorb on its own.

Treatment for arterial gas embolism related to pulmonary barotrauma should ideally be completed within the first two hours.Â This provides the most benefit and best chance of complete resolution of symptoms. Any delays in recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) of more than six hours are associated with worse outcomes.
