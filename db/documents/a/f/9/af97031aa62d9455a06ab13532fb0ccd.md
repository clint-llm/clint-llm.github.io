Lymphatic filariasis is a rare but disfiguring disease that can lead to marked morbidity if not considered. Several diagnostic and treatment recommendations are listed above. Physicians will have to work in tandem with nursing, administration, and public health officials in both confirming the diagnosis and successfully treating patients. Depending on the severity of disfigurement, they may require additional surgical consultation. The patient may need wound care and further education in hygiene and continued to follow up to prevent further attacks, which would lead to worse outcomes.
