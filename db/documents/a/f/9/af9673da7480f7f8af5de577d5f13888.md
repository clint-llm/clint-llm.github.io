Managing incisional hernia requires an interprofessional team. The condition has many risk factors and the key is to prevent the problem in the first place.

Prevention of an incisional hernia is an essential concept in abdominal surgery. There are several principles and recommendations that can minimize the risk of incisional hernias. Some of these recommendations are: using slowly absorbing monofilament suture, suture to wound length ratio not less than 4:1 has been shown to decrease incisional hernia rates, prevention of infections, less tissue traumatic techniques, and optimizing postoperative patient care

In some high-risk patients and cases, the incisional hernia rate is exceptionally high despite the adequate closure. Open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair and formation of permanent colostomies are associated with high incisional/ parastomal hernia rates.  Prophylactic mesh augmentation has been used in these cases.

The dietitian should encourage the patient to lose weight as obesity is a major risk factor for incisional hernia. The pharmacist should monitor patients on corticosteroids as they may affect wound healing. If possible, alternative drugs should be used or the steroid use should be shortened. The nurse should educate the patient on adequate control of blood glucose as diabetes is a risk factor for wound infections. Close communication between the team is vital if one wants to improve outcomes.
