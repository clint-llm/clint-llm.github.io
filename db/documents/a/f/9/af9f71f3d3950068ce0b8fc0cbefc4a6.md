Safe and effective use of thoracic segmental spinal anesthesia requires an interprofessional team approach, including anesthesiologists, nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating to achieve optimal patient results.Â The nurse assists the anesthesiologist in performing the procedure and ensures the patient is comfortable and feels safe. Close monitoring of the patient and their vitals by nurses during the procedure and postoperatively is key to safety.
