Complications from this disease can have both localized and systemic effects, including:

- Acute peri-pancreatic fluid collection, seen as a homogenous fluid collection adjacent to the pancreas on CT imaging, usually beginning <4 weeks after symptoms onset.

- Pancreatic pseudocyst, seen as a walled-off fluid collection, usually arising >4 weeks from symptom onset.

- Necrotizing pancreatitis (5% to 10%), seen as an intra/extra-pancreatic heterogeneous fluid collection and necrosis

- Walled-off necrosis, seen as a heterogeneous collection of fluid and necrosis with a well-defined wall, usually occurring >4 weeks from symptom onset.

Systemic complications include sepsis, bacteremia from the migration of intestinal flora, pleural effusions, ARDS, and shock.

Chronic pancreatitis patients are also at increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer, pancreatic diabetes, bile duct obstruction, and splenic vein thrombosis.
