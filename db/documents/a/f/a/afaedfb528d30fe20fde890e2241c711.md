Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality.

Though differentiation between ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is pivotal,Â over the years, several electrocardiographic patterns associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events have been described.

The De Winter pattern, first described in detail in 2008 and consisting of specific changes in the ECG, has been associated with an acute presentation of a left anterior descending (LAD) artery occlusion.
