In the ensuing years, researchers have discovered that the action of the complement is the result of interactions among a complex group of more than 30 glycoproteins. Most complement components are synthesized in the liver by hepatocytes, although the production of some is also by other cell types, including blood monocytes, tissue macrophages, fibroblasts, epithelial cells of gastrointestinal tracts, and genitourinary tracts.

According to the "evolutionary theory,‚Äù the most vital components of nature are revered by multitasking them. The complement system is one such example. C3 and FB, like components of the complement cascade, are the earliest part of the cascade. It evolved half a billion years ago as a primitive form of C3 and has been identified in sponges considered as living fossils.
