For patients with chronic pulmonary or cardiac diseases, there is often a need for oxygen therapy to continue after discharge from hospitalization. Providing oxygen for patients at home has many benefits when given appropriately.

Oxygen supplementation at home includes:

- Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in which oxygen is delivered for patients with chronic hypoxemia, for at least 15 hours daily.

- Ambulatory oxygen therapy (AOT): Oxygen supplementation during exercise and daily activities for patients who are not hypoxemic at rest but who develop hypoxemia on exercise.

- Nocturnal oxygen therapy (NOT) in which oxygen administered overnight alone with no oxygen therapy during daytime hours.

- Short burst oxygen in which a brief and intermittent oxygen supplementation used as needed in the absence of hypoxemia.

- Palliative oxygen therapy (POT): The use of oxygen for relieving breathlessness in advanced or life-limiting disease in the absence of known hypoxemia.

These methods of oxygen delivery at home have different degrees of supporting evidence.
