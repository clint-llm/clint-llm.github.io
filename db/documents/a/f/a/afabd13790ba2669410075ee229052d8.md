Children who experience abuse and are returned to abusive environments are most likely to experience continued abuse. Diligent history taking, in parallel with a thorough physical examination, can reveal 'red flags' and prevent further abuse via appropriate interventions. The earlier the abuse is halted the more positive the prognosis. However, unchecked maltreatment/neglect can lead to dire consequences.
