There is a wide range of indications for palliative radiation therapy. Alleviation of pain is the most obvious indication as metastases, such as those to the vertebrae or proximal femur, may result in significant and debilitating pain. Additionally, it also may be a preventative measure of incurring a pathologic fracture in the spine or extremities. Radiation therapy may be used to control a fungating or ulcerative mass. In highly vascular tumors, radiation therapy can be used to help control bleeding. Finally, although less utilized, radiation therapy can be used in oncologic emergencies such as spinal cord or brain compression.
