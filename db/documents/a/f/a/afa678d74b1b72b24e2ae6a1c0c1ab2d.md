**Benefits**

Overall cardiac rehabilitation increases the quality of life and decreases health care costs.

**Goals**

As stated above, cardiac rehabilitation goals can be designated into two broad categories:

- Short-term
- 
- Control cardiac symptoms
- Enhance functional capacity
- Limit unfavorable psychological and physiologic effects of cardiac illness
- Boost psychosocial and vocational status

- Long-term
- 
- Alter natural history of coronary artery disease
- Stabilize or reverse the progression of atherosclerosis
- Lessen the risk of sudden death and reinfarction

**Future Research**

In a systematic review of 19 random clinical trials, complex e-coaching was found to be an effective method of delivering therapies targeting physical capacity, clinical status, and psychosocial health; however, detailed protocols were not well described. Therefore, determining which aspects of e-coaching have the most benefit and need to be further developed have not been determined. In addition, basic e-coaching was not found to be effective.
