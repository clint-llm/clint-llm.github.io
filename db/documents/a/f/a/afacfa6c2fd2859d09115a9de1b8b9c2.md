The estimated prevalence of polymyositis and dermatomyositis (PM/DM) is 5 to 22 per 100,000 persons, and the incidence is approximately 1.2 to 19 per million persons at risk per year. The incidence of myositis is increasing over time due to an increase in the detection rate. Dermatomyositis is bimodal in age distribution, with one peak at 5 to 15 years and another at 45 to 60 years. Polymyositis rarely occurs in the pediatric age group, and the mean age is between 50 and 60 years. The overall female-to-male incidence ratio is 2 to 3:1. In the United States, the Black race to White race ratio of incidence is 3 to 4:1. In Europe, the prevalence significantly increases from the north to the south, and this may be due to either environmental or genetic reasons.
