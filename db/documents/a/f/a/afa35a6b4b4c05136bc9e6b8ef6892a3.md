Early involvement of a surgical provider, preferably the surgeon who performed the fascial closure, is prudent for the evaluation and management of suspected dehiscence. In the stable patient with no evidence of evisceration, imaging should be obtained to evaluate for the presence and size of the fascial defect; abdominopelvic CT with contrast provides excellent anatomic details and can also identify additional pathology including superficial/deep/organ space abscesses and herniation of abdominal contents through the fascial defect.

As noted previously, the opening of the incision is not a recommended process, as this can lead to evisceration and the need for an emergent operative procedure. Instead, radiologic evaluation can guide decision-making as to whether elective/urgent operative intervention is necessary.
