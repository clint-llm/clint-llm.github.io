Cardiac sarcoidosis can involve pericardial, myocardial, and endocardial tissue, although it most commonly involves the myocardium.

The most common manifestations include AV blocks followed by ventricular arrhythmias, bundle branch blocks, and supraventricular arrhythmias, of which atrial fibrillation is most common. Besides the intraventricular septum, sarcoid granulomas can involve the left ventricle and cause dilated cardiomyopathy, mitral valve dysfunction, papillary muscle involvement, and left ventricular aneurysm. Extensive involvement of the myocardium usually results in restrictive cardiomyopathy leading to left ventricular dysfunction in up to 80% of cases. Still, clinical heart failure is seen in less than 30% of cases.

Right ventricular involvement in sarcoidosis is usually a consequence of pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, or left ventricular dysfunction causing right heart failure but can also be from granulomatous infiltration of the right ventricle.
