In 1954, Dubin and Johnson described a new clinicopathological entity consisting of chronic idiopathic jaundice with unidentified pigment in the liver in 12 cases. In the same year, Sprinz and Nelson published a report of four cases with persistent non-hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia associated with lipochrome-like pigment in the liver cells; soon, the syndrome had come to be known as Dubin Johnson syndrome (DJS). This relatively rare disorder is a variety of hereditary hyperbilirubinemia and is characterized by low-grade elevation of conjugated bilirubin and no other signs of hepatic injury. This activity describes the pathophysiology of Dubin johnson syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Recall the presentation of Dubin johnson syndrome.
- Describe the laboratory features of Dubin johnson syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment options for Dubin johnson syndrome.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by Dubin johnson syndrome.
