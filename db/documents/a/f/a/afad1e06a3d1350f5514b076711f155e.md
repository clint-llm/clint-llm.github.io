Beta receptors are found all over the body and induce a broad range of physiologic effects. The blockade of these receptors with beta-blocker medications can lead to many adverse effects. Bradycardia and hypotension are two adverse effects that may commonly occur. Fatigue, dizziness, nausea, and constipation are also widely reported. Some patients report sexual dysfunction and erectile dysfunction.

Less commonly, bronchospasm presents in patients on beta-blockers. Asthmatic patients are at a higher risk.

Some patients report insomnia, sleep changes, and nightmares while using beta-blockers. This effect is more pronounced with beta-blockers that cross the blood-brain barrier. Some patients can experience fatigue or weight gain while on beta blockers. Managing these adverse events involves discontinuing the medication. Certain beta blockers are more likely to induce weight gain or fatigue.

Carvedilol may increase edema in some patients.

Sotalol blocks the potassium channels in the heart and thereby induces QT prolongation. It increases the risk of torsades de pointes.

All beta-blockers, especially in patients with cardiac risk factors, carry a risk of heart block.
