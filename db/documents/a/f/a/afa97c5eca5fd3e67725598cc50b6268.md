Definitive diagnosis of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis requires a skin punch biopsy demonstrating a dense neutrophilic infiltrate of the eccrine unit with necrosis and dermal edema. A routine complete blood count (CBC) should be ordered to confirmed neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis cases (preliminary workup for possible underlying hematological malignancy). Nonspecific inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can be considered. Tissue culture is critical for detecting infectious causes.
