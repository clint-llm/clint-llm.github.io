The anatomy of the wrist joint is complex, composed ofÂ numerous bones, ligaments, tendons, and cartilaginous structures. Of note, there are 8 carpal bones: scaphoid, lunate, triquetral, pisiform, trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate. The articulations of the wrist are composed of the distal radius with the scaphoid and lunate carpal bones and with the distal ulna. The lunate is the most commonly dislocated of the carpal bones, while the scaphoid is most prone to fracture. The scaphoid can be palpated in the anatomical snuffbox, which is a small triangular area on the dorsal surface of the hand between the extensor pollicis longus (medially) and the extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus (laterally). The major ligament of the wrist is the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), which keeps the wrist joint stable while pronating and supinating the arm. Each of these structures has the propensity to be injured and therefore is suitable for splinting.
