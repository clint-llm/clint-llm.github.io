The prognosis for benign orbital tumors is often good but can vary depending on the tissue of origin and the tumor location. Long-term morbidity from these lesions stems primarily from the space-occupying effect on surrounding structures, such as the optic nerve.

Benign orbital tumors may be small, discovered incidentally, and/or have an indolent course. However, certain lesions may grow large enough to cause proptosis, direct compression of the globe, optic neuropathy, or diplopia from extraocular muscle restriction. Additionally, the location of the tumor and its proximity to vital structures can impact visual prognosis. Regarding optic nerve sheath meningiomas, for example, surgical resection is often avoided due to the risk of postoperative blindness.
