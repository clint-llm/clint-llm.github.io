Silent myocardial ischemia is a condition of reduced oxygen-rich blood flow to the heart that occurs in the absence of chest discomfort or other symptoms of angina, e.g., dyspnea, nausea, diaphoresis, etc. This is accompanied by ST-segment changes on EKG, reversible regional wall motion abnormalities, or perfusion defects in scintigraphy studies. Patients with silent myocardial ischemia need an aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach as they have a greater chance of developing new coronary events than those with no silent ischemia. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of silent myocardial ischemia and addresses the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of silent myocardial ischemia.
- Discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic approach needed in a patient with silent myocardial ischemia.
- Outline the etiology and epidemiology of silent myocardial ischemia.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team in educating patients regarding smoking cessation, control of blood cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, regular exercise, dietary modification and medication compliance, which will improve morbidity and mortality in those with silent myocardial ischemia.
