The diagnosis and management of wrist sprain are not easy. Wrist sprain carries high morbidity, and thus, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team

The evaluation for other causes of wrist pain to rule out bony or neurovascular injuries that have potentially severe long-term sequelae is the most crucial initial step in treating a wrist sprain. Having providers familiar with interpreting hand radiographs and potentially a hand MRI will aid significantly in the diagnosticÂ evaluation of a hand sprain. Upon making the diagnosis, most cases of a wrist sprain will improve in a short period without sequela. For severe injuries, coordination with specialists trained in hand surgery may be necessary. For optimal care and recovery, a patient should undergo physical or occupational therapy. The pharmacist or pain specialist should assist the team with managing pain. Orthopedic specialty-trained nurses are an invaluable asset, assisting during and around any operative procedure, answering patient questions, and coordinating post-operative therapy by acting as a bridge between the therapist and the clinician. Open communication between the team members is essential if one wants to improve outcomes. [Level IV]
