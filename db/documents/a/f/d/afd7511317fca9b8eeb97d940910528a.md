The Levator Ani Muscle consists of the following parts

- Pubococcygeus

- Pubovaginalis
- Puboprostaticus
- Puboperineal
- Puboanal

- Puborectalis

- Illiococcygeus

We must remember, however, that the current anatomical literature does not agree in describing the complexity of the levator ani and the muscles of the pelvic floor. There is the pelvic diaphragm, the urogenital diaphragm, the endopelvic fascia, the visceral and somatic ligaments, and the ischiococcygeus muscle. Furthermore, the vectors of the muscle fibers, according to tractography studies, demonstrate how a highly chaotic orientation exists; this arrangement allows an optimal ability to adapt to different functional requests.
