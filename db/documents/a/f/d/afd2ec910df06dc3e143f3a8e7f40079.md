Many quality metrics in healthcare evaluate the effectiveness of diabetes prevention and treatment. Obesity is a significant risk factor for T2DM and contributes to its severity. Early screening of patients with obesity and intensive treatment can result in long-term improvement or remission of the disease. Strictly controlling diabetes decreases complications such as ketoacidosis, diabetic ulcers, amputations, soft tissue infections, and osteomyelitis. Furthermore, aggressively managing HbA1c levels reduces the risk of coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease.
