Histopathology of pilomatrixoma shows a well-demarcated tumor with a surrounding capsule. Dermal cells extend into the subcutaneous tissue. There are islands of epithelial cells that contain basaloid matrical cells, shadow, ghost, or anucleated cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, foreign body giant cells, and calcifications.

Pilomatrix carcinoma shows basaloid cells, atypia, and a high mitotic rate on histology. Ghost cells are present. Not many calcifications are seen. The histological features between pilomatrixoma and pilomatrix carcinoma are similar and can be difficult to differentiate.
