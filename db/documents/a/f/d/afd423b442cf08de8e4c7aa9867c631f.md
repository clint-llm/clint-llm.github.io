**Osteosarcoma**

- Osteoblastoma – it can be very difficult to distinguish between low-grade osteosarcoma and an aggressive subtype of osteoblastoma. Osteoblastomas are benign and do not metastasize.

- Ossifying fibroma – can be distinguished by absent extracortical bone loss.

- Osteomyelitis – will produce a similar moth-eaten appearance on radiographs with extra-cortical bone loss but has a differing clinical course and is unlikely to cause paraesthesia, a feature of perineural invasion.

**Fibrous dysplasia**

The primary differential for fibrous dysplasia is other fibro-osseous conditions.

- Ossifying fibroma – histologically indistinct from fibrous dysplasia, this is more commonly in tooth-bearing areas and has well-defined radiolucency.

- Segmental odontomaxillary dysplasia – this causes failure of maxillary pre-molar eruption with gingival hyperplasia.

- Paget’s disease – seen in an older population, more commonly associated with pain and altered bone profile.

**Central giant cell granuloma**

Giant cell granulomas can be seen in other systemic conditions; it is, therefore, vital to exclude these.

- Brown’s tumor of hyperparathyroidism – histologically indistinguishable but normally present in multiple and with deranged bone profile results.

- Cherubism – this is an autosomal dominant disorder, most commonly caused by a mutation in SH3P2. It causes widespread and multiple osteolytic lesions of, primarily, the posterior mandible. Onset is in childhood, producing a classical, symmetric full-cheek appearance.

- Noonan syndrome

- Neurofibromatosis type I

- Aneurysmal bone cysts

**Osteoma**

- Bony exostoses – differentiated by lack of further growth following puberty, most are lobulated and multifocal.

- Osteoid osteoma – pain is a more prominent feature, and faster expansion is present.

- Late-stage, central ossifying fibroma – borders are well defined, with a surrounding sclerotic border presenting as a thin radiolucent line.

- Complex odontoma – demonstrates greater density on radiographic assessment.

**Osteochondroma**

Generally, due to their pathognomonic radiographic features, osteochondromas can be identified from plain films.

- Malignant lesions, i.e., chondrosarcomas and osteosarcomas - will have aggressive spread, causing surrounding soft tissue damage, leading to symptoms such as paraesthesia.

- Condylar hyperplasia – proportionate growth with regular contours of the condyle.

- Hemimandibular hyperplasia – Anomaly of the entire mandible involving ramus and body.

**Osteoblastoma**

- Osteoid osteoma – may represent an early phase of the disease or be a separate entity. Clinically distinguished by smaller size (<2cm), pain worse at night, and good response to salicylates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories.

- Low-grade osteosarcoma – distinction can be difficult with similar histology. Osteosarcoma can cause lung metastases and is more likely to cause surrounding neural dysfunction.

- Cementoblastoma – round radiopacity, normally at apical half of single-rooted tooth causing pain, odontogenic in origin.

- Ossifying fibroma – mixed radiolucency, spherical in shape, pain is not a prominent feature.
