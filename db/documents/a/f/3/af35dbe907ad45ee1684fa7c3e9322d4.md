Most patients with epiretinal membrane (ERM) do not require treatment if it doesnâ€™t affect vision or cause significant metamorphopsia. Blue Mountains study

Non-surgical management includes the use of vitreopharmacolysis with ocriplasmin. Ocriplasmin is a recombinant proteolytic enzyme approved by the FDA for intravitreal injection for the treatment of symptomatic VMT. Ocriplasmin can relieve the VMT associated with ERM, which might provide relief from the associated metamorphopsia. It does not affect ERM. Its use in patients with both ERM and VMT is controversial. In patients unfit for lengthy retinal surgical procedures, intravitreal ocriplasmin can treat visual disturbances induced by VTM.

Surgical management involves pars-plana vitrectomy (PPV) with ERM and ILM peeling. PPV with membrane peeling has been used successfully for many decades, with an excellent visual outcome and a reduced recurrence rate. ILM is thought to provide a platform for the proliferation of fibroblasts, glial cells, and astrocytes for the retina to form ERM.

Dye assisted ILM peeling has resulted in better visual outcomes, fewer recurrence rates, and reduced retinal striae.
