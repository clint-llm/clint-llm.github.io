- Truncus arteriosus is the most common lesion confused withÂ an AP window but has a truncal valve instead of two semilunar valves. The early pathophysiology is similar.

- Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) has similar physiology. A "window" type PDA is a connection from the proximal descending aorta and left pulmonary artery near the bifurcation. The AP window is a connection of the ascending aorta and main pulmonary artery.

- A large ventricular septal defect has similar physiology but should be easily distinguished from an AP window.
