A patient presenting with signs and symptoms of bone disease or structural deformities is evaluated using PTH, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, and phosphate levels. Although a history of CKD or ESRD can effectively establish the diagnosis, other bone diseases should be ruled out:

- Osteopenia

- Osteomalacia

- Osteoporosis

- Vitamin D resistant rickets

- Osteopetrosis

- Paget's disease
