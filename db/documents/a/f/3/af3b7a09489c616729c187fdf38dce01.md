Fluorescent cell markers have been used to construct a map of the apical ectodermal ridge. The cells located in the posterior region give rise to the ectodermal ridge, and the anterior region cells leave the ridge as the bud grows distally. Retinoic acid may be used to alter this normal progression of the apical ridge to create a mirror-image duplication. Labeling experiments have also demonstrated that the cells from the underlying mesenchyme do not keep in line with the ridge as it expands in the anterior direction.
