Ultimately, the greatest tactic regarding scorpionfish, lionfish, and stonefish injury is avoidance. Divers across the globe should be aware of the distribution of these fish and their appearance. Aquarium handlers or fishers should avoid handling the fish with their hands or use puncture-proof gloves and be wary that Scorpaenidae fish are still venomous up to 48 hours after death. Individuals who wade in coastal waters may shuffle their feet or clear their path with a walking stick to ward off rather than unsuspectedly confront the toxic fish. Protective footwear and leg guards may also help prevent injury although stonefish spines can penetrate the standard tennis shoe.
