**History**

A thorough history and physical exam are essential parts of the diagnostic process. Upon history taking, patients with acute aortic insufficiency may complain of cough, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, and chest pain. However, patients with chronic aortic regurgitation can often be asymptomatic for a lengthy amount of time before they exhibit exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, syncope, and/or chest pain.

**Physical Exam**

In general, aortic regurgitation diastolic murmurs are accentuated by maneuvers that increase afterload such as handgrip. Patients with acute aortic insufficiency can present as if they are experiencing a rapid onset of cardiogenic shock. They appear ill, hypotensive, and tachycardic. They can present with normal or mildly elevated pulse pressure, normal apical impulse, diminished S1 from early mitral valve closure, or an S3.

Patients with chronic aortic insufficiency will have a widened pulse pressure, may likely have a laterally and inferiorly displaced apical impulse, a high-frequency decrescendo diastolic murmur best heard at the 3rd or 4th intercostal space at the left sternal border, Austin Flint murmur, diminished S1, soft S2. If the pulse pressure is noticed to become more narrow and the patient has an S3, this may be a sign the patient has developed heart failure.

Listed below are various eponymous signs that have been described and associated with aortic insufficiency, but these may or may not always be seen

- **Austin Flint murmur**: This is believed to occur due to the regurgitant jet of the aortic regurgitation causing premature closing of the mitral valve. This mimics functional mitral stenosis and is described as a low-pitched and rumbling mid to late diastolic or presystolic mitral murmur best heard at the apex.

- **Pulsus bisferiens**: A biphasic pulse with two systolic peaks seen on pressure tracings.

- **Corrigan sign**: A bounding pulse in large arteries such as the carotids that expands and suddenly collapses and empties between beats.

- **De Musset sign**: Head nodding with every heartbeat.

- **Muller sign**: Systolic pulsation of the uvula.

- **Quincke sign**: Repeatedly alternating blushing and blanching of capillaries in the nail folds upon palpation.

- **Traube sign:**Pistol shot sounds heard on the femoral artery upon compression of the artery.

- **Waterhammer Pulse**: Peripheral arterial pulses are rapidly dissipated or "bounding". This finding can be accentuated by raising the extremities.
