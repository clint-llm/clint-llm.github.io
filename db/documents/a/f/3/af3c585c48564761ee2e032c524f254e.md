# Continuing Education Activity

Heterotopic ossification is frequently observed in the rehabilitation population. It consists of the formation of mature, lamellar bone in extraskeletal soft tissue where bone does not usually exist. Patient populations at risk of developing heterotopic ossification include patients with burns, strokes, spinal cord injuries, traumatic amputations, joint replacements, and traumatic brain injuries. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of heterotopic ossification and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of heterotopic ossification.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with heterotopic ossification.
- Review the management options available for heterotopic ossification.
- Explain the importance of enhancing coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with heterotopic ossification.

# Introduction

Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a frequent complication in the rehabilitation setting which consists of the formation of mature, lamellar bone in the extraskeletal soft tissue where bone does not usually exist. Patient populations at risk of developing HO are those with burns, stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), traumatic amputation, joint replacement, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). There are other genetic causes of HO such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy and progressive osseous heteroplasia that are not related to rehabilitation complications and will not be discussed here.

# Etiology

There are 2 main categories of HO: traumatic (fracture, arthroplasty, muscular trauma, joint dislocation, burns) versus neurogenic (stroke, SCI, TBI, brain tumors)

# Epidemiology

In the total hip arthroplasty population, the incidence varies. In those with high-risk factors, incidence can be as high as 90%. Overall rates for developing HO in the THA population is closer to 53%. HO is twice as common in males versus females, but it is noted that females older than 65 years old have an increased risk of developing HO. The incidence of neurogenic HO is 10% to 20%. When differentiating between the incidence of HO in adult SCI patients is 20% to 30% and in adult TBI patients is 10% to 20%

# Pathophysiology

The exact mechanism of HO in traumatic and neurogenic HO is unknown

# Histopathology

Microscopic examination of biopsy in myositis ossificans revealed an outer zone of hypercellular spindle cells and woven bone surrounding an inner zone of trapped muscle with normal osteoblasts continuing to lay down bone. To distinguish HO from osteosarcoma, HO is zonation from central immature fibrous tissue to peripheral mature bone is characteristic of HO. This helps distinguish HO from osteosarcoma, in which the central zone consists of mature bone

# History and Physical

HO usually occurs 3 to 12 weeks after inciting injury

# Evaluation

**Laboratory Studies**

Alkaline phosphatase is historically the most commonly ordered lab, but may not be elevated early on in HO formation

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is another inflammatory marker that is used. ESR greater than 35 mm/hr can indicate the development of HO

**Imaging**

Plain film radiographs show circumferential bone formation around or near a joint with a radiolucent center (figure 1). X-ray is specific for HO but not sensitive in early disease. Plain films may not be positive until 3 to 4 weeks after HO appears on bone scan. Therefore the triple phase bone scan is the most sensitive. A bone scan can reveal HO as early as 2.5 weeks after injury

CT may be used to delineate the area of bone formation in preparation for surgical, but their role in evaluation/diagnosis of HO is not established

# Treatment / Management

**Prophylaxis**

The approach to prophylaxis involves identifying patients with high risk of developing HO. Routine prophylaxis is not recommended. Current recommendations for prevention of HO are gentle ROM exercises, indomethacin, etidronate, and external beam radiation, which is primarily used after joint arthroplasty. It is also important to manage risk factors, such as spasticity, in the prevention of HO. Indomethacin is the most commonly used NSAIDs used for prophylaxis

Etidronate is a bisphosphonate that has been approved for prevention of heterotopic ossification in spinal cord injuries and complication of total hip arthroplasty. For spinal cord injury associated HO, the recommended treatment is 20 mg/kg per day for 2 weeks then 10 mg/kg per day for 10 weeks for a total treatment period of 12 weeks. For total hip arthroplasty, recommended treatment is 20 mg/kg per day for 1 month preoperatively and then the same dosing for 3 months postoperatively

External beam radiation is most commonly used after total joint arthroplasty. A single dose of 700 to 800 g (centigray) is administered up to 24 hours preoperatively or within 72 hours postoperatively

**Treatment**

Current treatment recommendations consist of mobilization with ROM exercises, indomethacin, etidronate, and surgical resection.

Indomethacin and etidronate are also used to help arrest bone formation in HO, but efficacy in the traumatic brain injury population has not been clearly proven. The most effective treatment option in the TBI population is surgical resection. In the SCI population, the most effective NSAID treatment regiments are either Rofecoxib 25 mg per day for 4 weeks or indomethacin 75 mg daily for 3 weeks.

# Differential Diagnosis

In the spinal cord injury population, DVT, cellulitis, abscess hematoma, and tumor (osteosarcoma, osteochondroma) are the most common differential diagnoses that should be ruled out, especially if plain film x-ray is negative. Other common differential diagnoses are hardware infection, thrombophlebitis, and osteomyelitis

# Staging

Staging is most often used for surgical planning and is not used much in rehabilitation management. Brooker Classification System, used for severity of HO in the hip, is the most commonly used staging system

Brooker classification divides the extent of HO formation in the hip into 4 classes:

- Class 1: Islands of bone within the soft tissues around the hip

- Class 2: Bone spurs that originate from the pelvis or proximal end of the femur, leaving at least 1 cm between opposing bone surfaces

- Class 3: Bone spurs originating from the pelvis or proximal end of the femur, reduced space between opposing bone surfaces to less than 1 cm

- Class 4: Ankylosis of the hip

The "Della Valle" classification system

- Grade A: Absence of HO (or if bone is present, it may be greater than or equal to 1 island of bone of less than 1 cm in length

- Grade B: Presence of greater than or equal to 1 islands of bone at least 1 cm in length with 1 cm distance between opposing surfaces of bone

- Grade C: Bone spurs arising from the pelvis or femur with less than 1 cm between opposing surfaces or bone ankylosis

# Prognosis

Complications of HO present itself through decreased function and mobility, peripheral nerve entrapment, and pressure ulcers. Up to 70% of cases involving HA are asymptomatic. Ankylosis, vascular compression, and lymphedema can also be complications manifested in HO

# Consultations

General or orthopedic surgery should be consulted once the bone has matured and if HO is causing limitations in patients function, mobility, ability to provide self-care and perform ADLs or if the caretaker has a hard time performing ADLs, including hygiene and daily self-care.

# Pearls and Other Issues

- HO is a common rehabilitation complication after joint arthroplasty, TBI, stroke, SCI, and burns.

- Prevention should be a priority in those with a high amount of identifiable risk factors.

- Risk factors include spasticity, older age, pressure ulcer, the presence of DVT, having a tracheostomy, long bone fractures, prior injury to the same area, edema, immobility, long-term coma and severity of the injury.

- Evaluation: Triple-phase bone scan is most sensitive. Plain film radiograph is specific, but may not show up until the bone has matured in up to 6 weeks.

- Prevention with ROM, control of spasticity, NSAIDs (indomethacin, COX-2 inhibitors), bisphosphonates (etidronate) and external beam radiation in joint replacement.

- Treatment with ROM, NSAIDs (SCI population), Bisphosphonates (SCI and THA), and surgery (TBI population)

- Absolute treatment with surgery only after HO has fully matured, which can take up to 12 to 18 months.

- Current pharmacological treatment options are limited, unsafe, and only prevent the progression of the disease. The bone that has already formed can already limit a person's function and still need surgical revision despite ROM exercises and pharmacological intervention. There is limited research on effective options for prophylaxis/treatment, when to start treatment, and continued research on the effectiveness of novel treatments in specific patient populations.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

HO is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes orthopedic nurses. The condition is not only difficult to diagnose because of lack of specific markers but its treatment is not satisfactory. Current treatment recommendations consist of mobilization with ROM exercises, indomethacin, etidronate, and surgical resection. Early treatment with a passive range of motion exercises should be implemented once the presence of HO is confirmed to prevent ankylosing of joints. Absolute treatment consists of surgical resection of mature bone once the HO has fully matured. Surgical consultation with an orthopedic surgeon is warranted only if there will be an improvement in function as demonstrated by mobility, transfers, hygiene, and ADLs.
