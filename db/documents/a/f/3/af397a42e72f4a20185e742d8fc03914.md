Howell-Jolly bodies are DNA-containing inclusions found after erythrocyte maturation. The composition of the DNA is still unknown to this day. However, studies show that they are of centromeric origin. Smaller Howell-Jolly bodies contain nuclear material from 1 to 2 centromeres, and larger Howell-Jolly bodies contain nuclear fragments from up to 8 centromeres. Centromeres from chromosomes 1, 5, 7, 8, and 18 are the most frequently observed fragments. The average size of Howell-Jolly bodies is 0.73 micrometers.
