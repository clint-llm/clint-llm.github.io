The procedure is relatively non-invasive with few adverse effects; however, potential complications could include extravasation of radiopharmaceuticals and allergic reaction to radiopharmaceuticals. Extravasation of technetium 99m has not been shown to cause significant harmful effects to the tissue involved, and usually, surgical intervention would not be necessary. Allergic reactions to radiopharmaceuticals are rare, but if they happen or are at risk of occurring, appropriate steps are given by the American College of Radiology, which includes preparation with corticosteroids and antihistamines as well as emergent medications pending the development of any symptoms; these would include epinephrine and labetalol.
