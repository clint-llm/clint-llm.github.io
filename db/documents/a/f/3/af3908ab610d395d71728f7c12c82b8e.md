Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is a low-grade, B-cell lymphoma. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia overlap, with IgM paraprotein being the differentiating criteria only present in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. Diagnosis of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is challenging due to the lack of distinct diagnostic features; rendering the diagnosis is usually through exclusion. Serial measurement of IgM by protein electrophoresis usually monitors the effect of therapy in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, along with signs and symptoms of active disease. A repeat bone marrow biopsy may be required to assess the response to treatment. Most patients with minimal disease require close observation and have a good overall prognosis.
