Venous dural sinus air embolism is an inherent risk due to the valveless nature of scalp veins. Injecting air into the scalp vein catheter and leaving it open to air when the infant is in head-up tilt position must be avoided. Preventative measures include supine or Trendelenburg position during daily management of the catheter. An air occlusive dressing should be used once the catheter is removed.

Puncture site infection may occur if the area is not cleaned properly before needle insertion or if the needle is left in place for an extended period. Research shows that peripheral IVs in children may have a longer duration until bacterial colonization compared to adults. This may be up to 6 days. If IV access is needed for more than one week, a peripherally inserted venous catheter may be considered.

Scalp vein needles provide a lesser risk of infection when compared to plastic catheters. Teflon catheters have the highest rate of phlebitis. Other potential complications include scalp abscess, alopecia, intracranial abscess, thrombophlebitis, and scalp necrotizing fasciitis, all of which are rare.
