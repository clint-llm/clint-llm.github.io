The skin serves as a protective barrier preventing normal skin flora and other microbial pathogens from reaching the subcutaneous tissue and lymphatic system. When a break in the skin occurs, it allows for normal skin flora and other bacteria to enter into the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. The introduction of these bacteria below the skin surface can lead to an acute superficial infection affecting the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, causing cellulitis. Cellulitis most commonly results from infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (i.e., Streptococcus pyogenes).

Risk factors for cellulitis include any culprit that could cause a breakdown in the skin barrier such as skin injuries, surgical incisions, intravenous site punctures, fissures between toes, insect bites, animal bites, and other skin infections.
