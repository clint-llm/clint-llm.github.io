By definition, a cutaneous horn is a well-circumscribed, hyperkeratotic lesion with a height that is more than half of the diameter of its base. It can arise from any part of the skin or mucosa, with its pathophysiology being dependent upon the underlying disease. Those associated with benign disease processes tend to grow slowly over a few months to years.

Montgomery (1941) classified cutaneous horns into 5 types. These subtypes were distinguished from each other by appearance, histological structure, and causation.

- Cutaneous horn arising from an epidermoid cyst

- Mucosal horn arising from a mucous membrane

- Verrucous cutaneous horn resulting from a wart

- Papillomatous cutaneous horn developing from the keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium

- Filiform cutaneous horn arising from normal or hyperkeratotic skin

Contemporarily, the dermatology community has moved away from Montgomery’s classic subtypes into one more focused on the underlying etiology behind the lesion. While patients may still be described as having a Montgomery Type 5 cutaneous horn,
