In utero, duodenal atresia, a proximal gastrointestinal tract obstruction, causes polyhydramnios by interfering with the gastrointestinal absorption of amniotic fluid swallowed by the fetus distal to the level of intestinal obstruction. Polyhydramnios is defined as abnormally large amounts of amniotic fluid in the gestational sac during pregnancy. Antenatal ultrasound is diagnostic for polyhydramnios when the amniotic fluid index is greater than 25 cm or when the total amniotic fluid is estimated to be greater than 1500 to 2000 ml. In duodenal atresia, the amniotic fluid that is swallowed by the fetus is prevented from moving distally to be absorbed by the fetal gastrointestinal tract and transferred to the maternal circulation through the placenta.  Rather it is refluxed back into the amniotic fluid. Eighty percent of cases of polyhydramnios are due to maternal or idiopathic causes. Maternal causes include congestive heart failure and gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes can cause fetal hyperglycemia and fetal polyuria.  Fetal causes include congenital anomalies that interfere with swallowing and intestinal obstruction, including duodenal atresia. Other anomalies causing polyhydramnios include esophageal atresia, head and neck masses, thoracic masses, and supratentorial disorders that disrupt swallowing. In addition, Polyhydramnios increases the risk of cord prolapse, placental abruption, and preterm delivery.
