Patients suffering from aphasia, who were once educated and literate, are now unable to communicate their basic wants and needs. Many have intact awareness of their deficit and may become frustrated, even violent. They may feel that they have lost control of their life and feel isolated, which will lead to severe depression.

Many patients with aphasia often have co-occurring non-linguistic cognitive deficits. This often involves attention and working memory. This can involve the verbal domain as well as the visuospatial domain.
