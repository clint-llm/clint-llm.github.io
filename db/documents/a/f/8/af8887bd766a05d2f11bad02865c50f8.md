Atypical hyperplasia of the breast is defined as abnormal epithelial proliferative breast lesions that are not qualitatively or quantitatively abnormal enough to be classified as carcinoma in situ. Atypical hyperplasia is a premalignant condition and may occur in either ductal or lobular epithelium. This activity describes the evaluation, surveillance, and management of atypical breast hyperplasia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the evaluation of atypical breast hyperplasia.
- Explain the management of atypical breast hyperplasia.
- Review the surveillance protocol for patients with atypical breast hyperplasia.
- Summarize a structured interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients with atypical breast hyperplasia.
