DEXA imaging serves a sentinel role in the evaluation of osteoporosis as the International Society of Clinical Densitometry, the United States Preventative Services Task Force, and the National Osteoporosis Foundation recommend all women over the age of 65 have their bone mineral density evaluated. It is considered the gold standard for diagnosing osteoporosis and predicting fracture risk with algorithms like the Fracture Risk Assessment tool. Although DEXA imaging has excellent reported accuracy and precision, consideration should be made if comparing results across different instruments from different manufacturers unless cross-calibration has been assured. Evaluation of primary and secondary osteoporosis cannot be elucidated with DEXA imaging. ThisÂ was exemplified by Tannenbaum and colleagues when 55 out of 173 women with the diagnosis of primary osteoporosis were found to have a secondary cause with hypercalciuria, malabsorption, hyperparathyroidism, and vitamin-D deficiency. DEXA imaging is the best clinical tool for assessing bone mineral density in the evaluation of osteoporosis and its validity is evident given its ubiquity among international guidelines.
