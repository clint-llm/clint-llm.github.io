The adverse effects of edrophonium occur due to the increased levels of acetylcholine binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The more serious adverse effects are cardiac arrhythmias, especially bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and cardiac arrest. The muscarinic cholinergic adverse effects also include bronchoconstriction due to airway smooth muscle contraction secondary to increased stimulation of muscarinic receptors. Other adverse effects include bronchial secretions, diarrhea, salivation, lacrimation, increased urinary frequency and urgency, and miosis. Clinicians can attenuate most of the adverse effects with the simultaneous administration of atropine, which functions as a muscarinic receptor antagonist to prevent developing these cholinergic adverse effects.
