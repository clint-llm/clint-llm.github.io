Prognosis is favorable with treatment. However, the morbidity and mortality of RVT depend on its underlying cause. For example, in cases of RVT secondary to malignancy, complications can arise from the malignancy itself or result in thromboembolism at other sites such as DVT or PE. Prognosis of RVT due to nephrotic syndrome as per a retrospective cohort studyÂ showed a 40% mortality at 6 months in 27 patients with RVT.
