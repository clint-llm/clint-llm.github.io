Following investigations is a part of the comprehensive evaluation of PAVSD patients:

- Pulse oximetry to evaluate oxygen saturation (especially in dark-skinned infants where cyanosis may be missed on physical exam).

- Arterial blood gasses.

- Baseline hemoglobin and blood cell indices.

- Genetic testing particularly if other congenital defects are present.

- Chest X-ray (absent pulmonary artery shadow, boot-shaped heart or cardiomegaly, poor lung vasculature markings, etc).

- Echocardiography (pulmonary valve atresia, overriding of the aorta, VSD, ASD, some MAPCA if present, the pressure gradient across valves, ejection fraction).

- MRI/CT (important to delineate vascular anatomy before surgery to plan correction, may reveal other MAPCA which are hard to see on echocardiography).

- Cardiac categorization and angiography (anatomy, size, and distribution of the arterial vasculature, pressure in the right ventricle, the pressure gradient across the pulmonary valve).
