Some studies have reported a worse prognosis in patients with severe CKD-aP, although the mechanism is unknown. Reports suggest increased mortality risk among patients with uremic pruritus. The prognosis of uremic patients with severe pruritus is significantly worse than the others. A study reported that severe pruritus was independently associated with mortality even after adjusting for various other clinical factors, such as diabetes mellitus, age, β2-microglobulin, and albumin.
