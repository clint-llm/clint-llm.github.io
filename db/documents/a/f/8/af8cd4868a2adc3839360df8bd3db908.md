Embolic stroke commonly causes morbidity and mortality if not recognized and treated early as time is crucial for acute stroke management. To improve the outcome, it is essential to educate the public, the first responders in addition to the health care team, to recognize the clinical features of stroke and act accordingly. In addition, it is of utmost importance to improve the health care practitioners' understanding of how to promptly evaluate and treat embolic strokes efficiently in order to positively impact patients' outcomes and decrease stroke recurrence rate. While the stroke neurologist is almost always involved in the care of patients with an acute embolic stroke, it is important to work and communicate with an interprofessional team that includes the ED physician, the neuroradiologist, and the interventionist. In acute stroke patients who are TPA candidates, the pharmacist will ensure that the patient has no contraindication for TPA, prepare TPA, and calculate the appropriate weight-based dose. The neuroradiologist also plays a vital role in determining the cause of embolic stroke and identify large vessel occlusions and candidates for mechanical thrombectomy. Without providing a proper history and communication, the neuroradiologist may not be sure what to look for and may miss subtle findings. The nurses are also vital members of the interprofessionalÂ team as they will monitor the patient's vital signs, especially ED and ICU nurses who monitor the neurological status post-TPA closely and inform the caring physician if any change in the neurological exam concerns for complications. Stroke coordinators in comprehensive stroke centers assist with the education of the patient and family. Psychologists screen stroke patients for depression, administration of a structured depression inventory is recommended to routinely screen for poststroke depression according to the American Heart Association /American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines.[Level 1]

An interprofessional team, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and rehabilitation team is essential to improve outcomes. The AHA/ASA evidence-based guidelines recommended the use of comprehensive specialized stroke care (stroke units) that incorporates rehabilitation.
