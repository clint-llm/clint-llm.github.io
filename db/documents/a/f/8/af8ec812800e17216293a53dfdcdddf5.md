Apert syndrome is another genetically inherited syndrome characterized by craniosynostosis (premature fusion of coronal sutures) resulting in skull and facial deformities and syndactyly. The syndrome was first described in 1906 by French physician Eugene Apert when he described nine people with similar facial and extremity characteristics.
