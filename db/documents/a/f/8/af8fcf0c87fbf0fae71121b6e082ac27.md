Patients with palatal malignancies should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of otolaryngologists, plastic surgeons, general surgeons, pathologists, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and primary care physicians. Oral palatal malignancies present with varying histologies and severities, often requiring multimodal therapy involving surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.

Close communication and collaboration between the surgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists can provide a tailored approach for each patient. Difficulties in swallow and speech are common complaints before and after treatment for oral malignancies. Therefore, patients may need a consultation with general surgery for gastric tube placement to ensure optimal nutrition perioperatively. Early post-treatment intervention by a speech-language pathologist can help patients regain some pre-treatment function to prevent malnutrition, dependence on enteric feeding, and communication difficulties.

Recurrence of palatal malignancies can occur several years, even decades, after initial treatment. Thus, routine close follow-up by the otolaryngologist and primary care physician is advocated. Finally, patients may develop depression, social anxiety, and avoidance due to their cancer diagnosis, visible surgical scarring, and speech difficulties. Formal peer support groups and consultation with a psychologist can aid patients in addressing their concerns.
