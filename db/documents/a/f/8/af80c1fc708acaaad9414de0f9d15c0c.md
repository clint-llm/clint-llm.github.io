Loose anagen syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant or sporadic fashion. Clinically it manifests as diffuse non-scarring alopecia in children. Recognition of this self-limited condition is important as it should be distinguished from other infectious, reactive, or inherited alopecia. This activity outlines the diagnostic and therapeutic options for loose anagen syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of loose anagen syndrome.
- Review the typical presentation of loose anagen syndrome. 
- Outline management options for patients affected by loose anagen syndrome.
- Explain the need for a well-integrated, interprofessional team approach to improve care for patients with loose anagen syndrome.
