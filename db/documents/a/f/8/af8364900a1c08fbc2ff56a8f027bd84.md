**Indications for Mechanical Ventilation**

The most common indication for intubation and mechanical ventilation is in cases of acute respiratory failure, either hypoxic or hypercapnic.

Other important indications include a decreased level of consciousness with an inability to protect the airway, respiratory distress that failed non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, cases of massive hemoptysis, severe angioedema, or any case of airway compromise such as airway burns, cardiac arrest, and shock.

Common elective indications for mechanical ventilation are surgical procedures and neuromuscular disorders.

**Contraindications**

There are no direct contraindications for mechanical ventilation as it is a life-saving measure in a critically ill patient, and all patients should be offered the opportunity to benefit from this if needed.

The only absolute contraindication for mechanical ventilation is if it is against the patient's stated wishes for artificial life-sustaining measures.

The only relative contraindication is if non-invasive ventilation is available and its use is expected to resolve the need for mechanical ventilation. This should be started first as it has fewer complications than mechanical ventilation.

**Preparation**

In order to initiate mechanical ventilation, certain measures should be taken. Proper placement of the endotracheal tube must be verified. This may be done by end-tidal capnography or a combination of clinical and radiological findings.

Proper cardiovascular support should be ensured with fluids or vasopressors as indicated on a case-by-case basis.

Ensure that proper sedation and analgesia are available. The plastic tube in the patient's throat is painful and uncomfortable, and if the patient is restless or fighting the tube or the vent, it will make it much more difficult to control the different ventilation and oxygenation parameters.

**Modes of Ventilation**

After intubating a patient and connecting to the ventilator, it is time to select the mode of ventilation to be used. Several principles need to be grasped in order to do this consistently for the patient's benefit.

As mentioned, compliance is the change in volume divided by the change in pressure. When mechanically ventilating a patient, one can select how the ventilator will deliver the breaths. The ventilator can be set up to either deliver a set amount of volume or a set amount of pressure, and it is up to the clinician to decide which would be more beneficial for the patient. When selecting what the ventilator will deliver, you are selecting which will be the dependent and which will be the independent variable in the lung compliance equation.

If we select to start the patient on volume-controlled ventilation, the ventilator will always deliver the same amount of volume (independent variable), and the generated pressure will be dependent on compliance. If compliance is poor, the pressure will be high, and barotrauma could ensue.

If on the other hand, we decide to start the patient on pressure-controlled ventilation, the ventilator will always deliver the same pressure during the respiratory cycle. However, the tidal volume will depend on lung compliance, and in cases where compliance frequently changes (like in asthma), this will generate unreliable tidal volumes and may cause hypercapnia or hyperventilation.

After selecting how the breath is delivered (by pressure or volume), the clinician has to decide which mode of ventilation to use. This means selecting if the ventilator will assist all the patient's breaths, some patient's breaths, or none of them and also selecting if the ventilator will deliver breaths even if the patient is not breathing on its own.

Other parameters that should be considered are how fast the breath is delivered (flow), what will be the waveform of that flow (decelerating waveform mimics physiological breaths and is more comfortable for the patient, while square waveforms in which the flow is given at full speed during all inhalation, are more uncomfortable for the patient but deliver quicker inspiratory times), and at what rate will breaths be delivered. All these parameters should be adjusted to achieve patient comfort, desired blood gasses, and prevent air trapping.

There are many different modes of ventilation that vary minimally between each other. In this review, we will focus on the most common modes of ventilation and their clinical use. The mode of ventilation includes assist control (AC), pressure support (PS), synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV), and airway pressure release ventilation (APRV).

**Assist Control Ventilation (AC)**

Assist control is when the ventilator will assist the patient by delivering support for every breath the patient takes (that is the assist part), and the ventilator will have control over the respiratory rate if it goes below the set rate (control part). In assist control, if the rate is set at 12 and the patient breathes at 18, the ventilator will assist with the 18 breaths, but if the rate drops to 8, the ventilator will take over control of the respiratory rate and deliver 12 breaths in a minute.

In assist control ventilation, the breath can be delivered by either giving volume or giving pressure. This is termed volume-assist control or pressure-assist control ventilation. In order to maintain simplicity, and understand that given that ventilation is commonly a major problem than pressure and that volume control is used overwhelmingly more commonly than pressure control, the focus for the remainder of this review will use the term "volume control" interchangeably when discussing assist control.

Assist control (volume control) is the mode of choice used in the majority of intensive care units throughout the United States because it is easy to use. Four settings can be easily adjusted in the ventilator (respiratory rate, tidal volume, FiO2, and PEEP). The volume delivered by the ventilator in each breath in assist control will always be the same, regardless of the breath being initiated by the patient or the ventilator, and regardless of compliance, peak, or plateau pressures in the lungs.

Each breath can be time-triggered (if the patient's respiratory rate is below the set ventilator rate, the machine will deliver breaths at a set interval of time) or patient-triggered if the patient initiates a breath on its own. This makes assist control a very comfortable mode for the patient as each of his or her efforts will be supplemented by the ventilator.

After making changes on the vent or after starting a patient on mechanical ventilation, careful consideration of checking arterial blood gases should be made and the oxygen saturation on the monitor should be followed to determine if further changes should be made to the ventilator.

The advantages of AC mode are increased comfort, easy corrections for respiratory acidosis/alkalosis, and low work breathing for the patient. Some disadvantages include that being a volume-cycled mode, pressures cannot be directly controlled which may cause barotrauma, the patient can develop hyperventilation with breath stacking, auto-PEEP, and respiratory alkalosis.

**Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV)**

SIMV is another frequently used mode of ventilation, although its use had been falling out of favor given its less reliable tidal volumes and failure to show better outcomes when compared to AC.

"Synchronized" means that the ventilator will adjust the delivery of its breaths with the patient's efforts. "Intermittent" means that not all breaths are necessarily supported, and "mandatory ventilation" means that, as with AC, a set rate is selected and the ventilator will deliver these mandatory breaths each minute regardless of the patient's respiratory efforts. The mandatory breaths can be triggered by the patient or by time if the patient's RR is slower than the ventilator RR (as with AC). The difference from AC is that in SIMV the ventilator only will deliver the breaths that the rate is set up to deliver, any breath taken by the patient above this rate will not receive a full tidal volume or pressure support. This means that for each breath the patient takes above the set RR, the tidal volume pulled by the patient will depend solely on lung compliance and patient effort. This has been proposed as a method of "training" the diaphragm in order to maintain the muscular tone and wean off patients from the ventilator faster. Nonetheless, multiple studies have failed to show any advantages to SIMV. Furthermore, SIMV generates higher work of breathing than AC, which negatively impacts outcomes as well as generates respiratory fatigue. A general rule to go by is that the patient will be liberated from the ventilator when he or she is ready, and no specific mode of ventilation will make this faster. In the meantime, it is better to keep the patient as comfortable as possible and SIMV may not be the best mode to achieve this.

**Pressure Support Ventilation****(PSV)**

PSV is a ventilator mode that relies completely on patient-triggered breaths. As the name implies it is a pressure-driven mode of ventilation. In this setting all breaths are patient-triggered as the ventilator has no backup rate, so each breath has to be started by the patient. In this mode, the ventilator will cycle between two different pressures (PEEP and pressure support). PEEP will be the remaining pressure at the end of exhalation, and pressure support is the pressure above the PEEP that the ventilator will administer during each breath for support of ventilation. This means that if a patient is set up in PSV 10/5, the patient will receive 5 cm H2O of PEEP, and during inhalation, he will receive 15 cm H2O of support (10 PS above PEEP).

Because there is no backup rate, this mode is not for use in patients with decreased consciousness, shock, or cardiac arrest. The tidal volumes will depend solely on the patient's effort and lung compliance.

PSV often is used for ventilator weaning as it only augments patients breathing efforts but does not deliver a set tidal volume or respiratory rate.

The biggest drawback of PSV is its unreliable tidal volumes that may generate CO2 retention and acidosis as well as the higher work of breathing which can lead to respiratory fatigue.

To address this concern, a new algorithm for PSV was created called volume support ventilation (VSV). VSV is a similar mode to PSV, but in this mode, the tidal volume is used as feedback control, as the pressure support given to the patient will be constantly adjusted to the tidal volume. In this setting, if the tidal volume is decreasing, the ventilator will increase the pressure support to decrease the tidal volume and if the tidal volume increases the pressure support will decrease in order to keep the tidal volume close to the desired minute ventilation. There is some evidence suggesting that the use of VSV may decrease assisted ventilation time, total weaning time, and total T-piece time as well as a decreased need for sedation.

**Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV)**

As the name suggests, in APRV mode the ventilator will deliver a constant high airway pressure that will deliver oxygenation, and ventilation will be served by releasing that pressure.

This mode has recently gained popularity as an alternative for difficult-to-oxygenate patients with ARDS in whom other modes of ventilation fail to reach the set targets. APRV has been described as a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with an intermittent release phase. What this means is that the ventilator applies a continuous high pressure (P high) for a set amount of time (T high) and then releases that pressure, usually going back to zero (P low) for a much shorter period of time (T low).

The idea behind this is that during T high (which covers 80% to 95% of the cycle), there is constant alveolar recruitment, which improves oxygenation as the time maintained on high pressure is much longer than in other types of ventilation (open lung strategy). This reduces the repetitive inflation and deflation of the lungs that happens with other ventilator modes, preventing ventilator-induced lung injury. During this time (T high) the patient is free to breathe spontaneously (which makes it comfortable) but he will be pulling low tidal volumes as exhaling against such pressure is harder. Then, when T high is reached, the pressure in the ventilator will go down to P low (usually zero). This allows for air to be rushed out of the airways allowing for passive exhalation until T low is reached and the vent delivers another breath. To prevent airway collapse during this time the T low is set short, usually around 0.4-0.8 seconds. What happens here is that when the ventilator pressure goes to zero, the elastic recoil of the lungs pushes air out, but the time is not enough for all the air to leave the lungs, so the alveolar and airway pressure does not reach zero and there is no airway collapse.  This time is usually set up so that T low ends when the exhalation flow drops to 50% of the initial flow.

Minute ventilation, then, will depend on T low and the patient's tidal volumes during T high.

Indications for the use of APRV:

- ARDS that is difficult to oxygenate with AC

- Acute lung injury

- Postoperative atelectasis.

****Advantages of APRV:

- APRV is a good mode for lung protection ventilation. The ability to set the P high means that the operator has control over the plateau pressure which can significantly lower the incidence of barotrauma

- Because the patient initiates his respiratory efforts, there is better gas distribution secondary to improved V/Q matching.

- Constant high pressure means more recruitment (open lung strategy)

- APRV may improve oxygenation in ARDS patients who are difficult to oxygenate on AC

- APRV may reduce the need for sedation and neuromuscular blocking agents as the patient may be more comfortable than with other modes.

Disadvantages and contraindications:

- Given that spontaneous breathing is an important aspect of APRV, it is not ideal for heavily sedated patients

- No data for APRV use in neuromuscular disorders or obstructive lung disease and its use should be avoided in these patient populations

- Theoretically, constant high intrathoracic pressure could generate high pulmonary artery pressure and worsen intracardiac shunts in patients with Eisenmenger physiology

- Strong clinical reasoning should be employed when selecting APRV as the mode of ventilation over more conventional modes such as AC.
