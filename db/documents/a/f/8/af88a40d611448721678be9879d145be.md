There are different ways that esophageal diverticulum can form. Pulsion diverticula occur when there is an inadequate relaxation of either the upper or lower esophageal sphincter resulting in increased intraluminal pressure and subsequent herniation of the esophageal wall at an area of weakness.

In the lower esophagus, epiphrenic diverticulum is also known as pulsion diverticulum. The wall of the esophagus is pushed as a result of incoordination between the lower esophageal sphincter and the lower esophagus.

Zenker diverticulum occurs in between the muscle fibers where there is a weakness. A bulge will form and over time, the intraluminal pressure will enlarge the diverticulum. It does not appear that the cause of Zenker diverticulum is associated with incoordination between pharyngeal contraction and relaxation of the upper sphincter.

To date, there is no evidence that reflux plays a role in the etiology of esophageal diverticulum
