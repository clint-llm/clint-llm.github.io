Obesity is a complex medical disease and a significant public health issue in the United States as it has become a worsening epidemic. Obesity is defined by the body mass index (BMI), which is calculated using one’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of one’s height (in meters). According to the BMI classification, a BMI equal to or greater than 25 is overweight, and a value equal to or greater than 30 is obese.
