Upon diagnosis, the patient should be counseled regarding the slow-growing and locally aggressiveÂ nature of the tumor. The treatment depends on the stage, but largely involves surgical resection followed by radiation therapy in the presence of high-risk features. The patient should, however, be educated about the possibility of recurrence of the malignancy even as late as more than 5 years after the initial surgery, so periodic medical follow-up should be reinforced.
