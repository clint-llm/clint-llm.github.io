Canaliculitis is an uncommon condition, which is often challenging to the ophthalmologist as it is frequently misdiagnosed and very difficult to eradicate. Secondary canaliculitis due to punctal plugs is very common. Practitioners should always look for this during follow-up of patients with punctal plug for dry eye. Often, the patient will not remember having had plugs inserted.
