Within the upper part of the interscalene triangle lie the anterior rami of the third through fifth cervical spinal nerves. The base of the triangle is the location of the brachial plexus.

The phrenic nerve is oblique to the anterior scalene and passes anteriorly to the subclavian artery (C3, C4, C5). The phrenic nerve controls the diaphragmatic muscles for breathing, and although the phrenic nerve is not within the triangle, it is similar to the subclavian vein in that, because of its relative location to the triangle, it is easily prone to compromise from pathologies affecting the interscalene triangle.
