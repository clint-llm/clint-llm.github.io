**In optic neuropathy,**RAPD magnitude often correlates with the degree of visual acuity loss, while in maculopathy, vision is impaired to a greater magnitude compared to RAPD.

**In glaucoma –**the presence of RAPD is objective evidence of visual field loss.

**In retinal vein occlusion –**An RAPD >0.9 log units is associated with extensive capillary nonperfusion and poor visual acuity (Usually< 3/60).

**In retinal detachment –**An RAPD usually occurs in retinal detachment involving the macula, and post-operative visual acuity is usually lower in detachments involving the macula.

**In cataract**– if the patient has RAPD in the same eye as cataract, then post-operative visual gain tends to be poor due to associated defects in the anterior visual pathway.
