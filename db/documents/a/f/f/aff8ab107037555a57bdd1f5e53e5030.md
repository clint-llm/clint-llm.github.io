Patient education is considered one of the main cornerstones in managing cases of chylous ascites (CA) and its underlying etiologies. Patients must be aware of the importance of dietary modification as the main and initial step in managing CA. For symptomatic treatment of chylous ascites, a diet that is high in protein and low in fat with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) is recommended. MCTs are found in palm and coconut oil, full-fat milk, cheese, and butter, which contain capric and lauric acid. Other oils and fats, including nuts, red meat, fish, olive oil, and avocado should be avoided because they contain (LCT).
