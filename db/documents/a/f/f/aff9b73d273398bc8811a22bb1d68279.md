Neurogenic shock is the result of autonomic dysregulation following spinal cord injury, usually secondary to trauma. This dysregulation is due to a loss of sympathetic tone and an unopposed parasympathetic response. A review of the trauma database showed the incidence of neurogenic shock in 19.3% of cervical spine injuries and 7% of thoracic spine injuries. Other causes of neurogenic shock that are far less common include spinal anesthesia, Guillain-Barre syndrome, autonomic nervous system toxins, transverse myelitis, and other neuropathies. The pediatric population reports neurogenic shock in children with trisomy 21, skeletal dysplasia, and tonsillopharyngitis. Neurogenic shock remains a diagnosis of exclusion in a traumatic patient—Advanced Trauma Life Support states that hemorrhagic shock is the more common cause of hypotension. Once that has been managed appropriately, the neurogenic shock should be considered.
