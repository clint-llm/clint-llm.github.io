This is an uncomfortable procedure for the patient. It is most often done when disease is suspected. It may also be done as part of a screening process.

The examiner should explain the reasons for the procedure and obtain verbal consent. Reasons to perform the procedure include:

- Change in bowel habit

- Prostate evaluation

- Rectal bleeding

- Urinary or fecal incontinence

- A secondary approach to vaginal and cervical exam

It is, of course, useful and should be performed in patients with a GI bleed, where the practitioner can look for hemorrhoids, fissures, and gross blood.  It is also helpful in evaluating constipation, to evaluate sensation, tone, and coordination of contraction.  For fecal incontinence, again, evaluating rectal tone is essential.

**Rectal Exam in Children**

This exam should be avoided; if essential, use the fifth rather than the index finger.

**Rectal Exam in Elderly**

Rectal examination is more often required in elderly patients because diseases affecting the bowel arise more often in elderly patients. The left lateral position may be uncomfortable. Time should be taken to achieve a comfortable position that allows examination.
