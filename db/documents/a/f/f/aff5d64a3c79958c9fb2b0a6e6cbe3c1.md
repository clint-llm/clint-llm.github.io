MVP is a common valvular disorder that affects up to 3% of the general population. This disorder affects approximately seven to eight million individuals in the United States and more than 16 million people globally. MVP can be classified as primary or secondary.

Primary mitral valve prolapse is characterized by myxomatous degeneration in the absence of any connective tissue pathology.

Secondary MVP can be multifactorial and can be seen with Ehler-Danlos Syndrome, Marfan syndrome, polycystic kidney disease, graves' disease, and pectus excavatum. MVP can be associated with significant mitral valve regurgitation (4%), bacterial endocarditis, congestive heart failure, and even sudden death.

Genetic causes may be familial or sporadic and may include autosomal dominant inherited variants with affected chromosomes, including MMVP1 - chromosome 16p11.2-p12, MMVP2 - chromosome 11p15, and MMVP3 - chromosome 13q31.3-q32. Less commonly, it may be affected, and x linked mutation on chromosome Xq28 with missense mutation including P637Q, G288R, and V711D or can include in-frame 1944 base pair deletion.
