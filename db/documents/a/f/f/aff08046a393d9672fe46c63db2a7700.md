Previously carried out enucleation procedure has been abandoned because of high associated rates of recurrence. Presently pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland is treated either with superficial (Patey's operation) or total parotidectomy with the latter being the more frequently performed procedure due to lower incidence of recurrence. Meticulous technique is required to preserve the facial nerve. The tumors of the submandibular glands are treated with simple excision procedure with preservation of adjacent nerve including the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, and the lingual nerve.

When in the minor salivary glands, a five mm margin should be obtained. These tumors do not invade into periosteum. Thus, the bone need not be resected. When tumor bed recurrences occur, they show significant resistance to treatment, with management options including monitoring only, surgery, and radiotherapy.

Pleomorphic adenomas harbor a small risk of malignant transformation. The malignant potential is proportional to the time the lesion is in situ (1.5% in the first five years, 9.5% after 15 years). Therefore, excision is warranted in almost all cases. Other risk factors for malignancy include advanced age, radiation therapy, large size, and recurrent tumors.
