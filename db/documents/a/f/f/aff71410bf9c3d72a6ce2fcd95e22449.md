Medial epicondylitis is a diagnosis that can be made in the primary care office based on history and physical examination. It is important to remember that early identification and treatment is the key to adequate symptom improvement and return to the prior level of function. This is best accomplished with an interprofessional team approach. Prompt activity modification and initiation of non-opioid analgesics are helpful in the early/acute phase. Physical therapy is useful for patients not only in the treatment phase of the condition but in developing an effective prevention program to avoid recurrence of symptoms upon return to work/sport. Referrals should include a summary of the history of present illness, physical exam, a detailed social history (including occupation, hobbies, and sports), patientâ€™s goals of treatment, and treatments already trialed. This information sharing allows for a more complete and holistic view of the patient's problem and allows all healthcare providers access to the tools and information necessary to treat the individual and improve his or her quality of life.
