Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes are the myelin-forming cells of the nervous system. For the most part, Schwann cells are present in the periphery, and oligodendrocytes are in the central nervous system; however, Schwann cells can invade into the CNS when the glial-limiting membrane becomes disrupted. Myelin is composed of layered phospholipid membranes and serves to support and insulate axons, allowing for faster impulse transduction. Saltatory conduction occurs as the impulses jump across sodium ion-rich nodes of Ranvier. One oligodendrocyte myelinates multiple axons. Oligodendrocytes are in general terminally differentiated due to exposure to transcription factor Sox10, and incapable of replication upon injury.

Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the brain. They communicate through gap junctions and are involved in the release and uptake of chemicals at synapses. Astrocytes have glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) containing processes. They are involved in gliosis in response to injury.  Astrocytes provide substrates for the production of ATP for neurons and are involved in potassium metabolism and water uptake for the maintenance of homeostasis. The foot processes of astrocytes that surround capillaries or extend to subpial or subependymal zones also play an important role in the blood-brain-barrier structure and function.

Microglia are the mesoderm-derived, resident macrophages of the CNS. As such, they phagocytose and remove foreign or damaged material, cells, or organisms. They first proliferate, then extend the length of their nuclei, then either form aggregates around tissue necrosis or form aggregates around the cell bodies of dying neurons. Upon activation, astrocytes can also release reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as COX-2, CB2, and P2X7. The belief is that these ROS may contribute to neurodegenerative conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis.

Ependymal cells line the ventricles and fluid-filled compartments of the CNS and provide a semi-permeable layer. Ependymal cells are involved in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) secretion.  The ependyma detoxifies a variety of substances in the CSF in its role as a protective barrier between the brain and the CSF. The ependyma is also a source of NSCs which are capable of differentiating into neurons and glial cells.  In cases of inflammation or ventricular dilation, ependymal cells can combine with subependymal astrocytes in the formation of ependymal granulations; however, this response to insult does not appear to be significant in most cases.
