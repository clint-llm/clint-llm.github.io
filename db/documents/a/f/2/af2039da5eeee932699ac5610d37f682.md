In normal hearing, an individual will hear equally on both sides of the ear. The Weber test is a test of lateralization and is most useful in those with asymmetrical hearing loss.

**Weber Test Principles**

The inner ear is more sensitive to sound via air conduction than bone conduction (in other words, air conduction is better than bone conduction).

In the presence of a purely unilateral conductive hearing loss, there is a relative improvement in the ability to hear a bone-conducted sound. This can be explained by the following:

- Masking effect: The sound heard via the affected ear has less environmental noise reaching the cochlea via air conduction (for example, the environmental noise is masked) compared to the unaffected ear, which receives sounds from both bone conduction and air conduction. Therefore, the affected ear is more sensitive to bone-conducted sound.

- Occlusion effect: Most of the sound transmitted via bone conduction travels to the cochlea. However, some of the low-frequency sounds dissipate out of the canal. A conductive hearing loss (in other words, when an occlusion is present) will prevent external dissipation of these frequencies and lead to increased cochlear stimulation and loudness in the affected ear.

In the presence of sensorineural hearing loss, the sound will be perceived louder in the unaffected ear, which has a better cochlea.
