CAD remains the number one cause of death for men and women worldwide. In the United States, around 1.5 million Americans suffer from AMI annually, and one-third of these die. Survivors of AMI have a poor prognosis with a 1.5 to 15 times greaterÂ risk of mortality and morbidity than the rest of the population. Historical figures among survivors of AMI show that 25% of the men and 38% of women die within one year after having an AMI, 18% of men and 34% of women have a second MI within six years of AMI, and 22% of men and 46% of women are diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF) due to ischemic cardiomyopathy.

The prognosis depends on the following factors:

- Presence of angina symptoms

- Left ventricular ejection fraction

- Number, location, and extent of coronary artery involvement

- Coronary revascularization status

- Cardiac arrhythmias

- Compliance with medical therapy

- Aggressive risk control
