Because of the diverse presentation of Behcet disease, it is best managed by an interprofessional healthcare team that consists of an ophthalmologist, rheumatologist, internist, cardiologist, neurologist, dermatologist, vascular surgeon, and gastroenterologist. Nursing and pharmacists round out the team. There is no cure for the disease, and treatment is aimed at preventing organ damage. The disorder is not easy to diagnose and often requires consultation from multiple specialists. Each of these specialists mustÂ document and share their findings and recommendations with the rest of the interprofessional team.

Besides corticosteroids, these patients need other anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive agents. The pharmacist should educate the patient on the importance of medication compliance and signs of adverse events so they can call the pharmacist or the prescriber. In addition, the involvement of the wound care team may be needed in patients who develop skin ulcers, fistulas, and rashes. Nurses can counsel the patients on their condition, advise them on wound care, and review what symptoms should prompt a call to the appropriate clinician. Surgery may sometimes be required as well. Because the condition is rare in North America, the team should be in close communication, which may be vital to preventing complications of Behcet disease. [Level 5]
