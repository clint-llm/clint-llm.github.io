The diagnosis and management of restless leg syndrome are complex. The condition can be disabling and is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a nurse practitioner, neurologist, internist, physical therapist, and primary care provider.

The primary care provider should emphasize the importance of good sleep hygiene. The patient should be discouraged from consuming alcohol and caffeinated beverages. The physical therapist should educate the patient on the types of exercise that can be done while in bed. Since many patients develop anxiety and depression, a mental health nurse should be consulted. The pharmacist should educate the patient on the types of drugs used to treat restless leg syndrome and their potential adverse effects.

While many drugs are used to treat this disorder, none has been shown to be superior to other classes. Plus, these drugs are not reliable or consistent in their efficacy. Relapses are common. More important, many patients develop adverse reactions to the drug, and non-compliance is a major problem in the long run. Overall, the quality of life of patients with RLS is poor.

To prevent this disorder's high morbidity, close communication between the team members is vital to ensure that the patient is receiving optimal care and support.
