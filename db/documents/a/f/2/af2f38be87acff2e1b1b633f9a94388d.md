Coronary artery fistulas are aberrant connections between coronary arteries and other structures, such as other branches of arteries or heart chambers. They are largely asymptomatic but can lead to several life-threatening complications. As a result, appropriate diagnosis with coronary angiography and treatment with catheterization closure is necessary. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of coronary artery fistulas and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of coronary artery fistulas.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of patients with a coronary artery fistula.
- Outline the management options available for coronary artery fistulas.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the care of patients with coronary artery fistulas and improve outcomes.
