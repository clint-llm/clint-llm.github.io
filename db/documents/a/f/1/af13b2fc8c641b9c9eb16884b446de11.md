It is most important to differentiate between acute viral versus bacterial rhinosinusitis. Allergic rhinitis is also a common condition requiring elucidation. Fungal infections may also cause rhinosinusitis. Invasive fungal sinusitis is a serious form of this infection that is more common in immunocompromised patients. It is associated with a high mortality rate. Other less common diagnoses to consider in the differential diagnosis include:

- Nasal foreign body

- Enlarged or infected adenoids

- Structural abnormalities, i.e., deviated septum, sinonasal neoplasm

- Disorders affecting ciliary function, i.e., primary ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis

- Referred pain, i.e., dental infection or abscess

- Upper respiratory infection
