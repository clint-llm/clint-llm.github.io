The varicella-zoster vaccine contains live attenuated varicella-zoster vaccine (Oka strain). This vaccine induces both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. It produces an IgG humoral immune response in individuals, and the cell-mediated immune response is by varicella-zoster-specific activation of both CD4+ T-helper and CD8+ T-lymphocyte cells. The duration of protection is currently still unknown; however, there is evidence shown in some efficacy trials that the vaccine can offer continued protection for up to ten years after vaccination.
