Aprepitant (oral/intravenous) and fosaprepitant (intravenous prodrug) are indicated to prevent nausea and vomiting in cancer patients. Initially, the development of aprepitant was for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting(CINV); currently, its use and indications have since expanded to include post-operative nausea and vomiting(PONV). Aprepitant now has FDA approval for both indications.

Research suggests that aprepitant may have antiproliferative, anti-angiogenic, and antimetastatic effects.
