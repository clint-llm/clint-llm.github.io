Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria occurs due to the development of a genetic mutation in hematopoietic stem cells. This mutation of the X-linked gene phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIGA), produces a deficiency in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) protein, which is responsible for anchoring other protein moieties to the surface of erythrocytes.

Proteins responsible for the regulation of complement activity, specifically CD55 and CD59, are thereby prevented from attaching to PNH affected cells. The resultant loss of complement inhibition produces chronic complement-mediated hemolysis of PNH cells. This chronic state of hemolysis can be exacerbated if the complement system is activated by stress due to surgery, trauma, or other triggers for inflammation.
