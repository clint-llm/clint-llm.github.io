The differential diagnosis for patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is broad, and the patient’s initial presentation should guide workup evaluation.

- Even though epistaxis can be seen in patients with HHT, it is also be observed in patients with hematologic disorders and coagulopathy.

- Dyspnea can be found in a multitude of pathologies, including congestive heart failure, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, and others.

- Patients with incidental nodules on chest x-ray should be evaluated with CT for malignancy.

- Patients with liver disease and hepato-pulmonary syndrome can also present with platypnea-orthodeoxia from microscopic intrapulmonary arteriovenous dilatations.
