Given the synkinesis required to coordinate near vision properly, any pathology that hinders convergence, ciliary contraction, or pupillary constriction can disrupt the reflex.

Since parasympathetic fibers of the oculomotor nerve mediate ciliary contraction and pupillary constriction, parasympatholytics like atropine results in loss of accommodation and parasympathomimetics like pilocarpine induce accommodation.

Vision is not a prerequisite for accommodation reflex. InÂ afferent pupillary defects as in optic nerve lesions, the pupil does not react to light reflex, but near reflex will be present. Interestingly, even though the same neural machinery is involved in both the accommodation reflex and the pupillary light reflex, certain conditions demonstrate a dissociation between the two pathways; this is called light-near dissociation.

Other pupillary defects that can disrupt accommodation include Gardener pupil,

In Horner syndrome, although there is miosis of the pupil, light reflex and near reflex will be normal. There are reports of some cases in which the accommodative amplitude has increased.

As part of normal aging, there is a gradual loss of accommodation termed presbyopia, which refers to the hardening of the lens expected with age, with decreased ciliary muscular tension, that contributes to the loss of accommodation

Recently, dry eye has been linked to accommodative microfluctuations as well,
