Numerous studies on the epidemiology of spider veins concluded that most adults will eventually develop some form of spider veins during their life. The typical age of presentation is between 30 and 50 years old.

Some evidence suggests that smoking is linked to spider veins,Â and other studies have found that local trauma or a personal history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) increases the risk of developing spider veins in the affected limb.
