A task trainer allows an instructor to validate a skill before allowing a novice to perform that skill on a human life. From an ethical perspective, clinicians-in-training needs as much experience performing procedures to increase their technical and clinical proficiency to maximize patient safety when they need to perform procedures on real patients.

Spaced repetition is an effective method to increase the efficacy of learning and has tremendous potential to improve educational outcomes.

Studies have shown that attendings with varying years of experience may continue practicing procedures they are comfortable with rather than learning new techniques.

Simulation scenarios involving task trainers allow for training in both high-stakes, low-frequency, and common procedures in a safe environment.
