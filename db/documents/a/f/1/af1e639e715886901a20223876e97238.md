The incidence of endometrial cancer has been shown to vary by race and ethnicity, with the highest rates among non-Hispanic White (NHW) women, and the lowest rates among Asian women with the worst survival rates among black women.

Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy in the Western world, and endometrial hyperplasia is its precursor.  Although historically considered a disease of postmenopausal women, the incidence of EC is rising, with alarming increases described in the 40–44-year-old age group. In the USA, EC is the fourth most common malignancy in women, with 1 in 37 women getting EC. According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), a diagnosis of about 65,620 uterine cancer cases will be made in 2020 in the US.

The incidence of endometrial hyperplasia is estimated to be at least three times higher than endometrial cancer, and if left untreated, it can progress to cancer.

A nested case-control study of EH progression, using extensive histopathology reports, concluded that AH was 14 times more likely to progress to endometrial carcinoma as compared to the women that presented with disordered proliferative endometrium without hyperplasia. Endometrial hyperplasia without atypia was unlikely to develop into endometrial carcinoma.
