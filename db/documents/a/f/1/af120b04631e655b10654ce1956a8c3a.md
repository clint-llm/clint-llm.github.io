Septic embolism is an obstruction of a blood vessel, typically by an infected thrombus that has traveled through the bloodstream from a distant infectious source and blocked a blood vessel. Septic emboli result in two insultsâ€”the early embolic/ischemic insult due to vascular occlusion that may lead to infarction and the infectious insult that leads to inflammation and possible abscess formation. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of septic emboli and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of septic emboli medical conditions.
- Review the history, physical, and evaluation of septic emboli.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for septic emboli.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of septic emboli and improve outcomes.
