**Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act**

The FDCA is a piece of federal legislation on which all medication regulation laws are based. This pivotal law established safety guidelines for the manufacturing and distributing of all medical drugs and devices. This law allowed the federal government to regulate pharmaceuticals and medical devices, enforce these safety guidelines nationwide, and prevent drug manufacturers from peddling false or unproven claims.

The FDA was able to counteract unsafe drugs from entering the U.S. market by instituting strict labeling and packaging laws under the FDCA. Before implementing the FDCA, manufacturers were not required to list the medication's ingredients on the label or describe the expected effects or adverse events associated with the drug. Now, under the FDCA and enforcement by the FDA, patients and practitioners know the ingredients of the medication and the possible side effects associated with it.

Additionally, the FDCA established guidelines for the manufacturing and distribution of new drugs as well as the safety requirements that must be met in a series of clinical trials before the drug is available to the public. Clinical trials serve the public by regulating medications at every step of the process to ensure that every approved drug is safe and would not cause undue harm to the patient.

After thalidomide was widely used by pregnant women and caused numerous fetal and newborn defects, the FDA amended the FDCA to require all drug manufacturers to evaluate the drug's safety in pregnancy. Eventually, the FDCA propelled medicine within the United States into the 20th century safely.

**Controlled Substances Act**

The CSA determines how prescription drugs are categorized, distributed, and stored safely. The CSA created a method to categorize medications based on their safety, purpose or method of use, and abuse or addiction potential. Founding a scheduling system to categorize drugs helped the FDA and DEA regulate controlled substances on the market. By monitoring controlled substances, the DEA was able to track the production and distribution of medications with the potential for abuse and regulate prescribing practices of these medications.

The CSA requires specific information on written and electronic prescriptions for controlled substances and specifies the practitioners authorized to issue these prescriptions. Prescribers must include their DEA number on the prescription to facilitate the DEA's ability to regulate the type and quantity of drugs being prescribed by each practitioner. It is at the discretion of the DEA when and if to audit a practitioner's prescription records.

The CSA improved safety measures, established a legal framework for regulating controlled substances, and curbed addiction and death from overdose.

**Poison Prevention and Packaging Act**

Prior to the PPPA, accidental poisonings via household goods and medications were the highest cause of injury to children five years and under in the United States. This fact led the FDA to implement the PPPA and give oversight and enforcement duties to the CPSC.

The PPPA made the packaging of controlled substances and medications safer for children five years and under by mandating a child-resistant cap on prescription bottles. Few medications were exempt from this rule, mainly due to the patient's need to easily access these medications during a medical emergency.

The PPPA also allows patients to request a non-child-resistant cap on their prescription bottle from the pharmacy. Since its implementation in 1970, the PPPA has led to a decrease in child injuries, with data showing an 80% decline in poisoning fatality among children five years and under from 1972 to 2020.

**Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act**

The CMEA was established to decrease the use of OTC pseudoephedrine in producing illegal drugs, such as methamphetamines. Before the CMEA, several OTC products contained large amounts of pseudoephedrine and were easily accessible to the public.

Since the enforcement of the CMEA, the availability of these OTC products has decreased dramatically. Now, patients must purchase all pseudoephedrine-containing products from behind the pharmacy counter and present their photo identification for pharmacy records. There is a limit on the amount of pseudoephedrine-containing products that may be purchased daily and monthly.

This process allows the FDA to identify a pattern of "pharmacy shopping" if purchasers visit multiple pharmacies to obtain as many ephedrine-containing products as is permitted. The CMEA established a strict punishment for manufacturing methamphetamines, which may result in up to 20 years in prison per offense.
