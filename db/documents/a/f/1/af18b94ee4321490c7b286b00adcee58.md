As most patients with renal osteodystrophy are asymptomatic, investigations should be performed only in cases with a high degree of suspicion. Although a bone biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis, this is not always feasible in clinical medicine. Blood tests for markers of bone metabolism coupled with radiological imaging, can help to narrow down the differentials in these patients:

- Parathyroid hormone - PTH plays a major role in the pathogenesis of renal osteodystrophy, and it can be used to distinguish between high and low bone turnover states.

- Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase - bsALP is an indicator of osteoblastic activity. Low levels of bsALP can suggest a low bone turnover disease. bsALP or ALP can be combined with PTH to help establish the diagnosis.

- Osteocalcin and propeptide of type I collagen [PICP] - These markers of bone formation can be found in the blood of patients with osteodystrophy, but studies have shown a poor association between the markers and the disease, hence they are not used frequently in clinical practice.

Radiological evidence - Hyperparathyroidism resulting in osteitis fibrosa leads to skeletal changes, which can be evidence of underlying renal osteodystrophy. Subperiosteal resorption, endosteal resorption, and osteolysis can be seen in the skull, clavicle, or the distal phalanges. A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan can be used to measure bone mineral density, although studies have not shown this to be very useful.

The only confirmatory test is a bone biopsy followed by double tetracycline labeling, which can also accurately pinpoint the histological pattern of bone disease in the patient.
