The pathogenesis of IgA pemphigus is related to IgA autoantibodies that target desmosomal and non-desmosomal keratinocyte cell surface components. These components are cell-to-cell-adhering molecules, including desmoglein-1, desmoglein-3, and desmocollin-1. Desmogleins and desmocollin are glycoproteins that belong to a superfamily of cadherin molecules. The antigen of the subcorneal pustular dermatosis subtype was identified as desmocollin-1,
