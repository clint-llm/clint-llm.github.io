The management of solitary lesions of juvenile xanthogranuloma is often straightforward with routine observation. When multiple lesions are present and or there is the involvement of vital structures, management is best accomplished with an interprofessional team. While skin lesions can be excised, those occurring in other parts of the body may cause compression or obstruction of vital tissues. The outcomes for patients with skin-only lesions is favorable but those with lesions in the CNS may suffer from complications of surgery.
