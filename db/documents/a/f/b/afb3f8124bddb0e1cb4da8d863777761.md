An interprofessional team consisting of physicians, nurses, and pharmacists is needed to successfully manage patients treated with HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors such as pravastatin. Providers must be knowledgeable regarding the symptoms of toxicity. Other specialty physicians, such as nephrologists and toxicologists, may be consulted to ensure the best patient outcome. Patient education is necessary for individuals with hepatic or renal impairment. Clinicians and pharmacists must advise patients to report any signs or symptoms of hepatic injury (abnormal fatigue, weight loss, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice). Pharmacists should also check for drug interactions and inform the prescriber of any concerns. The primary care physician or the nurse practitioner must also counsel the patient on the importance of reading labels to avoid overdosing to prevent any drug-related toxicities. Pravastatin therapy requires a communicative team dynamic, successfully coordinating to manage any adverse effects and provide patient care to obtain the best outcomes. [Level 5]
