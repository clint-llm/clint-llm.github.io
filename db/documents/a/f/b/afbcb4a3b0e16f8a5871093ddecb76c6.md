The most common toxicity associated with fenofibrate is myopathy when given with statin medicines concurrently. If rhabdomyolysis is excluded and other muscle-related diseases are suspected, the statin-associated muscle symptoms clinical index (SAMS-CI) should be evaluated to determine if muscle symptoms are due to statin therapy. Discontinuing fenofibrate, administering vitamin D replacement (for low vitamin D levels), and switching the medication are all possible options depending on the cause of myopathy.

There is no specific treatment available for the overdose of fenofibrate. General supportive care is recommended for the patient. The vital signs and clinical status should be monitored if an overdose occurs. If needed, the elimination of unabsorbed drugs should be attained by emesis or gastric lavage. Monitoring of clear airway is also recommended. As fenofibric acid has high plasma proteins binding, hemodialysis for eliminating drugs should not be considered.
