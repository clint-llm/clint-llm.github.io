Clinically, autoimmune pancreatitis can manifest with symptoms related to biliary or pancreatic involvement. Patients can present with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, with or without attacks of pancreatitis. Obstructive jaundice is a common presentation that can be accompanied by non-specific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or weight loss depending on the degree of biliary or pancreatic strictures and involvement.

Patients can also have manifestations of other organ system involvement such as salivary glands, thyroid, and renal involvement in association with autoimmune pancreatitis. This is usually as a part of systemic IgG4 related disorders.
