- Azithromycin is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis or SJS) to azithromycin or another macrolide antimicrobial. In addition, clinicians should be cautious regarding the concomitant use of azithromycin and other medications that prolong the QTc interval (e.g., antipsychotics).

- Azithromycin is contraindicated for patients taking the first-generation antipsychotic pimozide. Macrolide antimicrobials inhibit CYP3A4, the same cytochrome that metabolizes pimozide; concomitant use of azithromycin with pimozide can cause dangerous plasma concentrations of pimozide, leading to QTc prolongation and, potentially, lethal arrhythmias. While azithromycin is a poor inhibitor of CYP3A4 relative to other macrolides, avoidance of this interaction is still advisable.

- Additionally, azithromycin is an inhibitor of p-glycoprotein/ABCB1, a cell membrane glycoprotein transporter.Â Drugs that are substrates of P-glycoprotein, particularly those that are also substrates of CYP3A4, may represent a relative contraindication to azithromycin. Examples include colchicine and small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists.

- Azithromycin effectively preserves FEV and ameliorates bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) with no effect on overall survival in lung transplant patients; however, a study comparing azithromycin with placebo for the prevention of BO in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients demonstrated decreased BO-free and overall survival with azithromycin.
