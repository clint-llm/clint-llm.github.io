The differential diagnosis of toxic alcohol ingestion includes other etiologies of metabolic acidosis, as well as various alcohols that may also be ingested. Important toxicological considerations for metabolic acidosis are salicylates, acetaminophen, iron, carbon monoxide, cyanide, alcoholic ketoacidosis, and ingestion of other alcohols, such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, or toluene. Ingestion of agents containing more than one alcohol or toxic substance should also be considered.Â Nontoxicological considerations should include diabetic ketoacidosis, sepsis, and uremia.
