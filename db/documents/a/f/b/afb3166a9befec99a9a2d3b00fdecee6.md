The management of tibial fractures requires an interprofessional team that includes an orthopedic surgeon, emergency department physician, radiologist, nurse, and a physical therapist. These fractures have very high morbidity and the nurse monitoring the patient should be aware of the risks of deep vein thrombosis and compartment syndrome. The leg has to be monitored for pulse, color, temperature and neuropathic changes to ensure that compartment syndrome is not developing. Even after treatment, most patients need a prolonged recovery period combined with physical therapy. The outcomes are good for simple tibial fractures but complex fractures can result in residual pain, prolonged wound healing and difficulty with gait.
