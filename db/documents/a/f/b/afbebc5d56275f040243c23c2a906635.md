When the soft tissues of the hand are damaged due to trauma, subsequent wound healing has 3 phases; inflammatory, proliferation, and maturation.

Fractures of the hand due to trauma will heal via primary or secondary bone healing dependent on the fracture reduction and level of stability present. Primary (direct) bone healing occurs when there is anatomical reduction; secondary bone healing is more common and results in callus formation. Fractures can lead to hand stiffness through inflammation and immobility (from pain and or splinting). Fractures of the hand are often associated with concurrent soft tissue, tendon, or ligament injury.
