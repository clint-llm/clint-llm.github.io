Tc-99m sulfur colloid is injected through the veins and is subsequently taken up by the mononuclear phagocyte system (aka reticuloendothelial system) of the patientâ€™s liver, spleen, and bone marrow.

In recent years, attenuation-corrected single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scanning has led to the ability to quantitate uptake in the spleen and liver. SPECT scanning also provides three-dimensional images of the liver and spleen.
