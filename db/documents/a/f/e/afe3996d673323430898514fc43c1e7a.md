The pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis can occur by the following mechanisms: pancreatic duct and acinar injury. In acute pancreatitis, digestive enzymes within the pancreas are not secreted properly, and this leads to auto-digestion and inflammation of the pancreas.

Alcohol can cause acute pancreatitis through direct toxicity and immunologic processes.

Chronic pancreatitis can occur by repeated acute attacks which leads to inflammatory infiltrates and fibrosis within the pancreas. Over time, this leads to pancreatic insufficiency.
