- Von Willebrand disease in females is often a more clinically severe disease due to menorrhagia.

- Von Willebrand factor levels vary with physiological stress. Some patients may occasionally be noted to have normal von Willebrand factor levels. A clinically suspect patient should be retested in a few weeks if initial von Willebrand factor levels are normal.

- Von Willebrand factor levels are adjusted according to ABO blood grouping.

- Sodium levels require measurement in patients taking DDAVP as multiple doses along with free fluid intake can cause severe Hyponatremia. Similarly, NSAIDs should be used with caution as they can worsen hyponatremia.

- Prolonged DDAVP use can lead to tachyphylaxis.

- DDAVP and anti-fibrinolytic agents carry a thrombosis risk. Von Willebrand factor replacement therapy is preferable in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease.

- Tranexamic acid is not recommended in gross haematuria. Clots can form and cause ureteric or urethral obstruction.

- Though generally avoided due to viral transmission risk, cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) can be used in life-threatening scenarios.

- DDAVP dosing is 0.3 micrograms/Kg administered over 20 to 30 minutes.
