Pneumatosis intestinalis is associated with several complications, which are divided into intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations. Intestinal complications are mainly obstructions caused by gas cysts. This can lead to fecal impactions, which, if left untreated, can cause perforations due to colonic ulcers from long-standing increased intracolonic pressure. Perforation can lead to acute abdomen, septic shock, peritonitis, and other life-threatening conditions.

The presence of pneumatosis intestinalis with portal venous gas usually correlates with bowel ischemia in approximately 70% of cases. Extraintestinal complications are adhesions and compression of nearby structures. Cysts can cause outpouchings that directly compress adjacent organs. Rupture of these cysts can cause pneumoperitoneum, which requires urgent surgical intervention. Complications usually occur in approximately 3% of secondary pneumatosis intestinalis.Â Mortality from these complications can range from 50% to 75%, especially those with bowel ischemia.
