The ultimate goal of experiential learning through simulation is to improve clinical practice and patient safety. Several studies have analyzed the outcome and benefit of simulation in healthcare, including improved teamwork, procedural skills, leadership, communication, and clinical outcomes.

- Okuda reviewed the utility of simulation in medical education with a focus on the evidence.

- Barsuk showed residents involved in simulation-based learning performed thoracentesis with low rates of complications.

- Schmidt-Huber demonstrated leadership skills developed in simulation training.
