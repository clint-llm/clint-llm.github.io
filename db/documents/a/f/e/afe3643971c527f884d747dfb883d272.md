Before the procedure, the laboratory values obtained are as follows: complete blood count, coagulation profile, blood urea nitrogen(BUN), creatinine, serum albumin, and liver function tests(LFTs). The ascitic fluid is obtained by paracentesis and examined for total polymorph count, protein, and albumin and culture. The serum-ascitic fluid albumin gradient (SAAG) is calculated to establish the cause of ascites. SAAG >1.1g/dl excludes cancer as the cause of ascites. Broad-spectrum prophylactic antibiotics are administered to the patient intravenously before the procedure and for a week after the procedure to prevent the risk of infection. The patient requires moderate sedation for the procedure, mostly in an outpatient setting.
