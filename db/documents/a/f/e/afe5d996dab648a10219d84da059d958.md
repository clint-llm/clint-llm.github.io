Often changes to mechanical ventilator settings are performed by health care providers that have limited training in specific functions of the ventilator in use. Mechanical ventilators are sophisticated and require training to ensure positive outcomes and limit harm. Inappropriate setting changes, failure to change alarms, changing settings without appropriate orders, and failure to communicate changes to the medical team can result in poor patient outcomes. This activity is intended to guide health professionals to ensure that all personnel trained are trained to set up, install, and make appropriate adjustments to mechanical ventilation. An interprofessional approach with communication between all members of the interprofessional team will result in the safest delivery of care and produce the best outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the communication needed between health professionals in treating a patient on a ventilator.
- Outline the activities required to evaluate ventilator settings.
- Describe the importance of alarms in the management of a patient on a ventilator.
- Explain the importance of screening steps of a patient on a ventilator and how good communication improves care coordination among the interprofessional team producing the best outcomes.
