Atopy is a predisposition to respond immunologically to diverse antigens/allergens, leading to  CD4+ Th2 differentiation and overproduction of immunoglobulin E (IgE). The clinical consequence of this is the propensity to develop hypersensitivity reactions to allergens. Allergic bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis are the most common manifestations of atopy followed by atopic dermatitis and food allergy. Two or more clinical diseases can coexist in an individual at the same time or at different times.

Other diseases described as atopic are allergic conjunctivitis, IgE-mediated drug allergy, insect bites, urticaria and angioedema, and anaphylactic shock.
