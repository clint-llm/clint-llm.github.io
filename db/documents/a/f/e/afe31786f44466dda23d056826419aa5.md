Children diagnosed with Diamond Blackfan anemia are predisposed to cancer. Although the risk of developing cancer is lower in patients with DBA compared to those diagnosed with Fanconi anemia, the risk is still higher than the general population belonging to the same age group. Reports exist of both solid and liquid malignancies with DBA in international registries. Acute myeloid leukemia is the most common hematologic malignancy, and osteogenic sarcoma is the most common solid organ malignancy diagnosed in children in DBA.

Chronic anemia can lead to growth retardation and poor psychomotor development in children. Severe anemia can also lead to hyperdynamic circulation, which increases the work of the heart and hence, the risk of cardiac failure, especially in those with pre-existing heart disease and the elderly. In pregnancy, it can prompt premature labor, abnormally low birth weight. In pregnant patients with severe anemia, there are reports of increased maternal and fetal mortality. Overall, anemia can cause low energy, constant fatigue, and in general, poor quality of life.

Patients with PRCA who receive chronic transfusions eventually develop iron overload and related toxicities. Immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine or chronic steroid therapy can lead to myelosuppression and, eventually, opportunistic infections. The use of corticosteroids, whether short-term high dose therapy or long-term maintenance therapy, correlates with multiple adverse events.
