The prevalence of OHS is reported to have a highly variable prevalence in published studies. There is a global epidemic of obesity affecting all ages, including children, adolescents, and adults; hence the prevalence of OHS is also increasing in these age groups. Currently, 35% of the United States population suffers from obesity, and the prevalence of morbid obesity (body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg/m^2).

The incidence rate of OHS is seen at higher rates in men than in women, older individuals,Â and African Americans than in the White race population.

The prevalence of OHS has been reported to be higher in men; however, among patients referred to the sleep disorders clinic, OHS was more prevalent in women than men.
