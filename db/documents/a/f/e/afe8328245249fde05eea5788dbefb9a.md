The thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by disseminated thrombus formation in arterioles and capillaries.

In the case of TTP, microthrombi are composed of vWF, platelets and very little fibrin. These findings differ with the other forms of TMA as a hemolytic uremic syndrome, where the fibrin is a relevant component. Thrombi are present in all tissues, but lung and liver are less affected because the low shear forces experimented in these low blood pressure system.

Despite widespread thrombi, tissues exhibit little necrosis which may suggest that the occlusion is not persistent enough to cause necrosis. This is consistent with the intermittent course of some clinical signs, especially neurological findings.

The morphologic abnormalities appreciated in erythrocytes (schistocytes) are secondary to the pass of them through a partially occluded vessel, which exhibits high shear forces.
