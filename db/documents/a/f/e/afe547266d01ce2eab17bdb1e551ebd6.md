Astereognosis is the inability to identify objects by feel only, in the absence of input from the visual system. Stereognosis is the ability to know ('gnosis'- knowledge) the three-dimensional form of an object ('stereo'- solid) with tactile manipulation.

Astereognosis may also be defined as the impairment of recognition of the objects by somatosensory discrimination of the size, texture, weight, and shape of the objects, in the absence of any major somatosensory deficit.

The primary recognition deficit, called morphognosia, is the impairment in recognition of the physical features of the object. The secondary recognition deficit is a specific impairment in object recognition with spared primary recognition. The patient can feel the object and sense the dimensions and texture but is unable to correlate with the stored information and identify.
