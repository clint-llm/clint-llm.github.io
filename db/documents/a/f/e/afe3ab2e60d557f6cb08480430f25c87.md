The prognosis of osteochondritis dissecans of the knee depends on patient age, location and appearance of the lesion on imaging. In general, younger patients do better than adults withÂ osteochondritis dissecans of the knee. Specifically, pediatric patients with open distal femoral physes have the best prognosis for complete recovery with conservative measures. Adults with the disease often progress to arthritis if not treated.
