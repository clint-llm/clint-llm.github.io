In the United States, there are approximately 1000 deaths per year, as a result of electrical injuries. Of these, approximately 400 are due to high-voltage electrical injuries, and lightning causes 50 to 300.

There are also at least 30,000 shock incidents per year that are non-fatal. Each year, approximately 5% of all burn unit admissions in the United States occur as a result of electrical injuries.

Approximately 20% of all electrical injuries occur in children. The incidence is highest in toddlers and adolescents.

In adults, these injuries occur mostly in occupational settings and are the fourth-leading cause of workplace-related traumatic death, whereas, in children, electrical injuries occur most often at home.
