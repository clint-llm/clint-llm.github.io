Mediastinal germ cell tumors are thought to arise from the abnormal migration of germ cells during embryogenesis. Younger males are most commonly affected. Biomarker screening (AFP, B-hCG, LDH) is necessary for patients with an anterior mediastinal mass, even when symptoms are absent. Screening for Klinefelter symptoms is required with a cytogenetic analysis as it is a reported association. Early recognition and treatment can lead to more favorable outcomes.
