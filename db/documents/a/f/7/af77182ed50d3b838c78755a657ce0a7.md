**Stage 1 Norwood Complications**

- BT shunt thrombosis reduces pulmonary blood flow and results in life-threatening hypoxemia.

- Coronary steal due to excessive pulmonary blood flow through the BT shunt resulting in inadequate systemic perfusion, which can lead to sudden death.

- Arrhythmias

- Respiratory failure

- Bleeding

- Infection

- Renal dysfunction

**Stage 2**

- Decreased pulmonary flow leading to hypoxia and decreased cardiac output

- Arrhythmias

- Thromboembolic events

**Stage 3**

- Failing Fontan physiology

- Atrial arrhythmias

- Plastic bronchitis (3% to 10%)

- Protein-losing enteropathy (1%)

- Liver congestion, cirrhosis, and increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma

- Pulmonary thromboembolic events
