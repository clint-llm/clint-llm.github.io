Nephrocalcinosis refers to generalized calcium deposition in the kidney and does not include the focal calcium deposition associated with focal renal injury. It is caused by diseases that cause hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphaturia, and hyperoxaluria.

Calcium phosphate crystal formation occurs in alkaline urine pH. It has associations with many diseases which operate through the underlying mechanisms.

- Hypercalciuria with hypercalcemia

- Hypercalciuria without hypercalcemia

- Hyper-phosphaturia with hyperphosphatemia

- Hyper-phosphaturia without hyperphosphatemia

**1.Â Conditions causing both hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria**

- Primary hyperparathyroidism

- Vitamin D therapy

- Sarcoidosis

- Milk-alkali syndrome

- Congenital hypothyroidism

**2. Conditions causing hypercalciuria without hypercalcemia**

- Distal renal tubular acidosis

- Medullary sponge kidney

- Neonatal nephrocalcinosis and loop diuretics

- Inherited tubulopathies

- Chronic hypokalemia

- Beta thalassemia

**3. Conditions causing Hyper-phosphaturia and hyperphosphatemia**

- Tumor lysis syndrome

- Oral sodium phosphate bowel preparations

**4. Conditions causing Hyper-phosphaturia without hyperphosphatemia**

- Inherited tubulopathies such as Dent disease, Lowe syndrome

- X-linked, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets.
