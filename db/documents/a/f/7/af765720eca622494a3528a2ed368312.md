Repaglinide is a drug used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2. It belongs to a class of antihyperglycemic agents known as meglitinides, along with nateglinide. Meglitinides work to reduce blood glucose levels by stimulating endogenous insulin production. The present recommended starting dose is dependent on hemoglobin A1c levels, with those below 8% (64 mmol/mol) urged to start with 0.5 mg pre-prandially and those above 8% to start with 1 to 2 mg.

Repaglinide may be used as monotherapy (supplemental to exercise and diet control) or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents (metformin or others, if metformin is not tolerated/contraindicated). The exception is using sulfonylureas (e.g., gliclazide, glipizide), which is a contraindication for dual therapy with meglitinides. Research has suggested that repaglinide is a favorable treatment choice in patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.

Repaglinide is FDA class C during pregnancy, meaning its use requires caution. There has been no evidence to support its safe use during breastfeeding, and thus an alternative is recommended.

The safety of repaglinide in children under the age of 18 has not been established and, as such, is not recommended.

Repaglinide should be taken shortly before meals and should be omitted when skipping meals.
