A detailed history and physical exam is the first and foremost step that delineates the course of investigation and plan of treatment. History regarding the nature of pain, its location, severity, onset, and the use of a pain diary to chart out its cyclic or noncyclic pattern can provide valuable information leading towards an accurate diagnosis.

The physical examination further helps to identify any alarming feature that needs special attention. Emphasis should be made to explore the chest wall along with breast examination to differentiate extramammary pain from true mastalgia. The breast should be adequately explored with the review of all four quadrants. Supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and axillary regional lymph nodes should be palpated, and the breast should be examined for any lump, skin changes, nipple retraction, color change, ulceration, swelling, or edema, inflammation, scars, or abnormal nipple discharge. The examination should also involve elevation of breast tissue with one hand and palpating the underlying chest wall with the other hand to look for any chest wall deformity.

Any abnormal finding identified is carefully documented, and the patient should be referred to a specialist for further evaluation.
