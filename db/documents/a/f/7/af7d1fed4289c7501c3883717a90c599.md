Balanitis can occur at any age. It affects approximately 1 in every 25 boys and 1 in 30 uncircumcised males during their life. Boys under 4 years of age and uncircumcised men are the highest risk group.  Balanitis is more likely to occur if there is phimosis, a condition where a tight foreskin can’t retract back over the penis. When boys reach approximately the age of 5 years, the foreskin becomes easy to retract, and the risk of balanitis falls. Data from meta-analyses showed that circumcised males have a 68% lower prevalence of balanitis than uncircumcised males and that individuals with balanitis have a 3.8-fold increase in the risk of penile cancer.
