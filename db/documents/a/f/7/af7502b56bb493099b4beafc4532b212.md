Hunter syndrome is a rare congenital metabolic disease. It was first reported in 1917 by a Canadian physician Charles Hunter in two brothers in a family. Both the brothers had short stature, inguinal hernia, macroglossia, enlarged skull, decreased hearing, coarse facial features, protruded abdomen with hepatosplenomegaly, umbilical hernia, and skeletal deformities. The younger brother had CNS symptoms, while the older brother did not have CNS involvement.

The estimated incidence is 1 in 162,000 live male births.
