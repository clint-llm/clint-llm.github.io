Prostaglandins and thromboxanes have critical functions throughout the body. Unfortunately, the wide range of functions results in a host of side effects for NSAIDs like sulindac. Blood vessels, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and kidneys are a few examples of critical organ systems impacted by sulindac.

- Sulindac is commonly associated with nausea and vomiting, stomach pain, indigestion, diarrhea, constipation, gas, anxiety, dizziness, tinnitus, and urticaria.

- The most common and severe side effect of NSAID use involves ulceration of the GI tract, as GI mucosa appears to be protected by various prostaglandins. Sulindac is commonly thought to have associations with lower rates of GI-related complications when compared to other non-selective NSAIDs; however, this has come into question, and the GI side effects related to NSAID use appear to be primarily mediated through COX-1, as COX-2 selective NSAIDs are associated with lower risks of GI complications. These side effects become exacerbated by the simultaneous use of alcohol and or steroids.

- Sulindac also correlates with renal side effects. Certain prostaglandins are involved in dilating the afferent arteriole- inhibition of this prostaglandin-mediated mechanism may result in a reduced GFR, thus, the risk of acute kidney injury. Sulindac and other NSAIDs may also be nephrotoxic and may induce renal papillary necrosis and interstitial nephritis. This condition may become exacerbated with the simultaneous use of other nephrotoxic agents.

- Sulindac is associated with various critical adverse effects, including changes in vision, hepatoxicity, pancreatitis, anemia, and steven-johnson syndrome.
