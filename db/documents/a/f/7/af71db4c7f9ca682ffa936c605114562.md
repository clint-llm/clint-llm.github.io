CPA tumors are mostly benign, slow-growing tumors with low potential for malignancy (~1%).

- Sporadic: These are unilateral tumors and most commonly present between the fourth and sixth decade of life.

- Those associated with neurofibromatosis (NF) type 2: The most common presentation is bilateral acoustic neuromas in younger patients with a positive family history. NF2 results from a mutation at the chromosome 22q12. This mutation leads to an increased risk of other intracranial tumors as well.

**Schwannomas**are the primary lesion of cranial nerves involving trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, vagus, and sometimes even accessory cranial nerve.

**Meningiomas**arise from the proliferation of arachnoid meningothelial cells, most commonly from the dura of petrous temporal bone or internal auditory meatus.

**Epidermoid tumors**arise from congenital misplacement of ectodermal cells during the closure of the neural tube.

**Arachnoid cysts**are CSF filled cysts that arise from the splitting of embryonic arachnoid membranes.
