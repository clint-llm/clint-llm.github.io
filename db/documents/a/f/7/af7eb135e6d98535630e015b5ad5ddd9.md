In terms of the presentation of congenital pulmonary airway malformation, there is wide variability. Children can be symptomatic at birth or go through their entire infancy into childhood without exhibiting symptoms. With the advent of prenatal ultrasonography to diagnose CPAM, there has been an increase in the number of prenatal diagnoses, leading to an overall decrease in the percentage of symptomatic CPAM. Asymptomatic newborns have the potential for complications during childhood, such as respiratory infection or malignancy. Symptomatic newborns present with respiratory distress, with severity increasing with size due to compression of the adjacent airways. The various types of CPAM present with specific clinical features.

Type 0 is incompatible with life due to almost no gas exchange occurring.

Type 1 presents with increased respiratory effort, tachypnea, and cyanosis.

Type 2 presents similarly with respiratory distress, and also with other congenital anomalies (renal agenesis, cardiovascular defects, diaphragmatic hernia).

Type 3 lesions can expand the entire lung and can lead to fetal hydrops from pulmonary hypoplasia.

Type 4 CPAMs can often present as pneumothorax, and are often similar in presentation to Type 1. There is also a small risk of infection, malignancy, air leak, or bleeding.
