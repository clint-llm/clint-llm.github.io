The first 5 MSR listed above; however not the jaw jerk, occur when stretch receptors within the muscle are activated; the clinician taps a part of the body to create a small amount of lengthening (stretch) in a muscle. This activates stretch receptors in the muscle spindle, of which the cell bodies are in the dorsal root ganglia, and an afferent impulse is conducted via these Ia afferent neurons to the spinal cord where they directly synapse on an alpha motor neuron. This activated motor neuron transmits the efferent impulse back to the muscle leading to contraction. When an MSR is initiated there is also a signal that branches off from the Ia afferent stretch neuron and activates an inhibitory interneuron that will prevent the opposing (flexor or extensor) muscle group from activating during the reflex. For instance, at the knee, the quadriceps opposes the hamstring, so when the knee jerk reflex is elicited it inhibits the hamstring motor neurons while the quadriceps are stimulated to contract. The monosynaptic junction of the muscle spindle stretch afferent neuron and the motor neuron is modulated by the descending corticospinal tract which generally has a dampening effect on the reflex. This reflex arc has musculoskeletal components as well as peripheral nervous and central nervous components, therefore a broad range of pathology can manifest in alterations of reflexes. The lower motor neuron components of the reflex are the peripheral nerve and spinal segment while the upper motor neuron component innervating the reflex arc is the descending corticospinal tract. Pathology in one or the other produces different changes in the reflex (see clinical significance below).

The jaw jerk is conceptualized in a similar manner. There is an afferent signal in the form of proprioceptive signals being transmitted along the mandibular nerve to the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. These pseudounipolar neurons send bilateral projections to the efferent motor neurons (in the motor nuclei of the trigeminal in the pons) which sends the motor impulse out to the masseter muscles to contract on both sides of the jaw. The modulating upper motor neuron innervation comes from the corticobulbar rather than the corticospinal tract.

Below are the 6 commonly tested MSRs, in the following format:

**Name: Spinal level, peripheral nerve, location struck to elicit**

- Biceps: C5-C6, musculocutaneous, just anterior to the elbow

- Triceps: C7-C8 (predominantly 7), radial, just posterior to the elbow

- Brachioradialis: C5-C6, radial, about 10 cm above the wrist on the radial aspect of the forearm

- Knee (quadriceps, patellar): L2-L4 (predominately L4), femoral, just inferior to the patella

- Ankle (Achilles): S1, tibial, posterior to the ankle joint on the Achilles tendon (or for alternative location see below)

- Jaw Jerk (masseter): Pons, mandibular branch of trigeminal, chin (mental protuberance)

The following is a frequently used, and most accurate, nursery rhyme style mnemonic has been used to help students remember the reflexes:

One-two, buckle my shoe. Three-four, kick the door. Five-six, pick up sticks. Seven-eight, lay them straight. S1,2 ankle jerk; L3,4 knee jerk; C5,6 biceps and brachioradialis; C7,8 triceps.

The Achilles reflex can also be elicited, in an equally effective manner,
