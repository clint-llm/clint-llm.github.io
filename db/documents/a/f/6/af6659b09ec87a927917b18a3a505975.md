The correction of breast ptosis is achieved via various surgical approaches. The type of surgery is selected according to the degree of ptosis and whether the patient wishes to correct breast shape, volume, or both. The overall goals are having a pleasing breast contour, a well-positioned nipple, breast symmetry, upper pole fullness, and a non-redundant skin envelope.

All surgical approaches have advantages and disadvantages, and different degrees of scar burden, which is a frequent source of litigation. The probability of a lawsuit can be decreased by adequately managing the patientâ€™s expectations, establishing open communication and good rapport with the patient, and having well-documented consent.

Individual indications for each technique are described below (see Technique).
