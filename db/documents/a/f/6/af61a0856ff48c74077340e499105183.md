Evaluation of dysuria starts with detailed history taking and a thorough physical examination. Associated signs and symptoms of hematuria, suprapubic tenderness, urinary frequency, urgency, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, low back pain, flank pain, joint pain, rash, etc., require close follow-up.

Urinalysis is the most useful test to start the work up in a patient with dysuria. Urinalyses positive for nitrites carries a high predictive value of a positive urine culture (75% to 95%). Positive leukocytes (anything more than a trace positive) is also highly predictive but slightly less than nitrites (65% to 85%). The presence of both positive nitrites and leukocytes on a dipstick is extremely predictive.

Gram stain microscopy showing Gram-negative diplococci is diagnostic for gonorrhea. Typically, microscopic examination of urethral secretions demonstrating 5 WBC or more per oil immersion microscopic field was diagnostic for urethritis, but some have suggested this cutoff be lowered to just 2 WBC.

Patients who do not respond to initial treatment and those with risk factors for a possible complicated urinary tract infection should have a full urine culture and sensitivity analysis performed.

It is important to check a complete blood count and a metabolic panel, including serum creatinine, if a systemic infection is suspected, especially if the patient is having nausea, vomiting, fever, or chills. Blood cultures need to be done if there is a suspicion of systemic spread of infection. In severe cases, hospitalization should be considered.

If sexually transmitted infections are suspected, such as in younger, sexually active patients, then a urethral or vaginal probe should be performed. Samples should be obtained to diagnose Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis.

**Urethral pain syndrome, formerly urethral syndrome,**typically presents with dysuria as one of the key symptoms. Other symptoms of urethral pain syndrome include urinary frequency and suprapubic discomfort.

**Reactive arthritis, formerly called Reiter's syndrome,**was historically used to describe the combination of urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis. Arthritis is usually a post-infectious, autoimmune response. Reiter's syndrome reflects only a portion of all patients with reactive arthritis. It is defined as arthritis which follows an infection that cannot be cultured from the affected joint. When triggered by a sexually transmitted organism, the condition is called sexually acquired reactive arthritis. It usually presents in younger adults, with gastrointestinal and genitourinary infections being the most common triggering events. The most common causative genitourinary organism isChlamydia trachomatis, followed by Chlamydia pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Mycoplasma genitalium. Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), used as an immunotherapy for bladder cancer, has also been identified as a rare cause, affecting about 1% - 2% of treated patients.

Recently, reactive arthritis cases have been reported following COVID-19 infections.
