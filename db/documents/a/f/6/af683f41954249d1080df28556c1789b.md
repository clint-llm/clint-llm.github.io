As mentioned, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is characterized by a triad of multiple seizure types, characteristic electroencephalogram (EEG) findings, and intellectual impairment.

- **Seizures**: Seizures begin in early childhood, usually between the ages of 1 and 7 years, peaking at around 3 years.

- **Characteristic EEG pattern:**PleaseÂ see the "Evaluation" section.

- **Intellectual Impairment:**The initial growth in a child with LGS is unremarkable. The decline is seen only after the seizures start and is in the form of developmental delay, intellectual impairment, diminished learning abilities, and behavioral problems. This decline is observed in the majority of the patients and gets worsens with age.
