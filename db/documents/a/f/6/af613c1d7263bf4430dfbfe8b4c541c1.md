Treprostinil is a chemically stable prostacyclin analog. Its principal pharmacologic action is direct vasodilation, which causes reduction of pulmonary and systemic arterial pressure, reducing right and left ventricular afterload; therefore improves the cardiac output. It also has an antiplatelet effect.
