The management of tropical sprue is based on a multimodal approach. The treatment is usually done in the outpatient setting. It focuses on treating malnutrition via mineral and vitamin supplementation and correction of the underlying etiology. There are only a few patients that present to the ED with dehydration and weight loss. These patients will need urgent evaluation and initiation of fluid and electrolyte replacement.

- Severe dehydration,

- Electrolyte imbalance, and

- Symptomatic anemia

The treatment includes antibiotics, parenteral vitamin supplementation (vitamin B12 and folate), fluid therapy, electrolyte replacement, and blood transfusion in few cases. Combination therapy of Tetracycline 250 mg PO four times daily and oral folic acid 5 mg daily is given for 3 to 6 months.

The patients should be evaluated for response to therapy. They should be regularly assessed for a couple of months after treatment to look for improvement of symptoms, weight gain, and correction of blood counts and electrolyte abnormalities.
