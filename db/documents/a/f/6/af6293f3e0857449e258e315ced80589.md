The primary use of nadolol is in the treatment of angina and hypertension.

Interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists, should be cautious while withdrawing or stopping the drug as it can cause life-threatening rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and signs and symptoms of angina. Nadolol should be used cautiously with diuretics as it can potentiate the effect of hypotension by nadolol.

To improve outcomes and lower morbidity, the pharmacist should educate the patient on medication compliance and avoid using other drugs/herbs without consulting the physician. The pharmacist should also perform medication reconciliation to monitor any potential interactions and report these to the rest of the healthcare team. Nursing staff will have more frequent contact with patients and should gauge treatment success and observe for adverse effects. These factors must get communicated to the prescribing clinicians for dose and/or drug changes to the therapy regimen. Nadolol therapy requires the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results and minimize adverse events.
