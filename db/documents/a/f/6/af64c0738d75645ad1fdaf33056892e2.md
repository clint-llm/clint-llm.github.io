Due to muscle necrosis, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure are common; treatment is with intravenous fluids and dialysis.

Incomplete fasciotomies can create a need for a revision fasciotomy either for extension of fascial opening or opening a missed compartment. Compartments are most commonly missed when the anatomy is highly distorted, such as in cases of high-energy trauma or patients with previous surgery and scarring. In these patients, the associated mortality increased by four times.

Also, patients who underwent a delayed fasciotomy had twice the amputation rate and three times the mortality. It bears mention that in some cases, even with timely fasciotomies, the affected limb may not regain normal functionality and may result in an amputation.
