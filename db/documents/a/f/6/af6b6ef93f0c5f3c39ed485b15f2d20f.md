The embryologic derivation of the muscular boundaries of the posterior neck triangle includes the sixth branchial arch mesoderm. The sixth branchial arch mesoderm eventually separates into two independent masses that become the trapezius muscle and sternocleidomastoid muscle. Both the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are formed partially from neural crest derivatives and partly from somites.
