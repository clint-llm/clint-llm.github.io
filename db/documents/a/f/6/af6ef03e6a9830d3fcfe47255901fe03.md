The most common adverse effects are GI symptoms, including flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. A high carbohydrate diet may worsen the GI adverse effects. GI symptoms tend to become reduced throughout treatment. Adherence to acarbose pharmacotherapy can be a problem because of side effects.

Elevated serum transaminases may occur during acarbose therapy. Elevations usually are asymptomatic and reversible once stopping drug therapy.

Hypoglycemia should not occur with acarbose monotherapy. However, the therapy can increase the risk of hypoglycemia when used with antidiabetic agents that cause hypoglycemia, such as sulfonylureas or insulins.

Post-marketing reports include cases where there were rare occurrences of pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis with alpha-glucosidase inhibitor use.
