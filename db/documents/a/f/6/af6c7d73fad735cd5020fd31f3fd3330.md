An MRA scan takes less time than traditional catheter angiography and requires no recovery period. MRA is less costly than catheter angiography. Collaboration with shared indication and decision making and communication are key elements for a good outcome. The MRA is usually recommended by a specialist treating a specific disorder. It is important to orient the patient about the procedure as some patients are afraid of the machine or have physical limitations. Some patients are unable to lie flat or stay in the position for a long period of time.

It is very important for the referring physician to clearly annotate the indications for the study, so the neuroradiologist and MRA technician performs the preferred technique to yield the best diagnostic outcomes.
