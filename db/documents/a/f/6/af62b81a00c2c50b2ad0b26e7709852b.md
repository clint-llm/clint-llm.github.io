Distinct pathways control miosis and mydriasis (dilation of the pupil). The parasympathetic pathway causes miosis by activating the iris sphincter. These pathways arise within the brain stem and then extend along cranial nerve III to finally innervate the iris sphincter. This pathway is activated by the pupillary light reflex and accommodation.

Mydriasis is activated by the sympathetic pathway. Sympathetic fibers arise in the hypothalamus, extend to synapse at the C8-T2 spinal cord level, and finally course through the sympathetic chain to synapse with a third neuron in the superior cervical ganglion. Then, theseÂ third-order neurons traverse through the cavernous sinus alongside the periarterial carotid plexus until they enter the orbit and travel as the short and long ciliary nerves prior to innervating the dilator pupillae muscle.

As mentioned before, anisocoria can be broken down into three categories:

- An inhibition of constriction of the pupil on one side - the pathological pupil remains larger than the other pupil (pupil is dilated), and this difference is more pronounced in light conditions

- An inhibition of dilatation of the pupil on one side - the pathological pupil remains smaller than the other pupil (pupil is constricted), and this difference is more pronounced in dark conditions

- Difference pupil sizes that in which the difference remains the same in light and dark condition - the anisocoria is more likely to be physiologic with neither pupil having pathology
