In 1954 Walter Shelley and Harry Hurley determined that lipofuscin granules are responsible for the pigmentation of the sweat seen in apocrine chromhidrosis. Lipofuscin is a yellow-brown pigment that is usually found in the cytoplasm of cells of various organs and is not specific to apocrine glands.

Eccrine chromhidrosis is most often caused exogenously by the coloring of clear sweat with the ingestion of water-soluble dyes such as tartrazine, heavy metals such as copper, coloring and flavoring substances in food products, and drugs such as quinines, levodopa, tartrazine-coated bisacodyl, and rifampin.

Pseudochromhidrosis is an extrinsic process that occurs when the colorless sweat from eccrine glands subsequently develops color following exposure to exogenous influences like drugs that cause changes in the microflora on the skin surface.
