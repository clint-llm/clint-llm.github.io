Induction of general anesthesia, airway manipulation, and emergence represent the most critical times for perioperative respiratory complications in patients with asthma. Ensuring that expert team members are involved with the case is essential. As it pertains to children, the presence of an experienced pediatric anesthesiologist during airway management has been shown to reduce the risk for PRAE.

Choosing an inhaled induction over an intravenous is typically a major point of consideration in the pediatric population because most children do not tolerate pre-induction peripheral IV placement. All volatile anesthetics - sevoflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, have direct bronchodilating properties. However, at higher concentrations, desflurane increases bronchial smooth muscle tone and airway resistance and should be avoided in patients with asthma.

Neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs) are given to improve intubating conditions. In children, depolarizing NMBDs are often avoided, given the risk for hyperkalemic cardiac arrest in the setting of a possible undiagnosed myopathy. Topical lidocaine applied to the airway before endotracheal intubation is controversial as there is evidence to suggest an increased incidence of desaturation using this technique in children.

In the acute setting, the use of cardioselective beta-blockers (i.e., beta-1 > beta-2 antagonism) is preferred when indicated for patients with asthma.

Noninvasive airway management, such as placement of a supraglottic airway (SGA), is associated with a decreased risk of postoperative hypoxemia and coughing compared to the use of an endotracheal tube (ETT) in adults.

In patients with well-controlled asthma, routine mechanical ventilation can be used. However, when airflow obstruction is present, mechanical ventilation becomes a challenge. Bronchospasm causes an obstructive respiratory pattern, and prolongation of the expiratory phase of ventilation occurs. Allowing ample time for exhalation during mechanical ventilation is critical to avoiding dynamic hyperinflation (also known as auto-PEEP or breath-stacking), a feared complication of mechanical ventilation in patients with asthma.

Before emergence from general anesthesia, reversal of neuromuscular blockade is administered. The cautious use of cholinesterase inhibitors is vital because neostigmine may contribute to the risk of bronchoconstriction by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine. Alternatively, sugammadex may also be used for the reversal of the non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers - rocuronium and vecuronium, with no associated increased risk of bronchospasm. Extubation in a deep plane of anesthesia should theoretically decrease the risk of bronchospasm caused by the stimulus of the ETT. However, little research has been performed to show the benefit of this technique. A recent randomized control trial data failed to show a difference between awake versus deep extubation as it related to PRAE.
