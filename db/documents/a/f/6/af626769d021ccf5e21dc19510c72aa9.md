In 1992, a large university-based hospital estimated the incidence of chylous ascites (CA) to be approximately 1 in 20,000 admissions over 20 years. However, the incidence of CA has likely increased because of improved care and treatment of patients with cancer and their increased survival rates. CA is a morbid condition, and it is associated with high mortality rates depending on the underlying etiology (40% to 70%).
