Although epidermoid brain tumors can be visualized on computed tomography (CT) scans, they are best diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CT scans show a homogeneous hypodense lesion with irregular borders and without contrast enhancement but indistinguishable from an arachnoid cyst.

The most common locations are theÂ cerebellopontine angle and the parasellar area, and less frequently at the Sylvian fissure, suprasellar region, pineal region, or interhemispheric region. Some epidermoid tumors may have atypical radiological features and can be confused with other tumors.
