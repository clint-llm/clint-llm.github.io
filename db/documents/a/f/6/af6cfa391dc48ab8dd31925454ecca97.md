Antihistamines are a pharmaceutical class of drugs that act to treat histamine-mediated conditions. There are two main classes of histamine receptors: H-1 receptors and H-2 receptors. Antihistamine drugs that bind to H-1 receptors are generally used to treat allergies and allergic rhinitis. Drugs that bind to H-2 receptors can treat upper gastrointestinal conditions that are caused by excessive stomach acid. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse events, and other vital elements of antihistamine therapy in the clinical setting as relates to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients with conditions that respond to histamine receptor blockade.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of the different histamine receptor blockers.
- Identify the approved and off-label indications for the different histamine receptor blockers.
- Describe the adverse event profile and contraindications of the members of the antihistamine class.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance appropriate clinical outcomes with antihistamine therapy to treat indicated conditions, leading to optimal patient outcomes.
