Barbiturates like methohexital are contraindicated in acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP is a deficiency of the enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase in the pathway for heme biosynthesis. Acute attacks are usually intermittent and manifest as severe abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, psychiatric symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, and hyponatremia. Methohexital is strictly contraindicated in patients with a history of AIP.
