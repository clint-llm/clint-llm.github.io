In ophthalmology, a specialized form of microscopy called slit lamp biomicroscopy is used to visualize anterior and posterior structures of the eye. By using an adjustable slit beam of light, an observer can examine layers of the eye and appreciate depth. For example, an ophthalmologist may evaluate a cornealÂ abrasion in a patient and characterize the severity and extension of the lesion within the layers of the cornea. Several types of illumination techniques exist, including diffuse illumination, direct focal illumination, retroillumination, specular reflection, indirect proximal illumination, and sclerotic scatter.
