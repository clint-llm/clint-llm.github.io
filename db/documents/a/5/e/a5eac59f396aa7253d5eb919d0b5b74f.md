The diagnosis and management of lactose intolerance are with an interprofessional team that includes a nurse practitioner, primary care provider, pediatrician, gastroenterologist, and an allergist. Lactose intolerance is commonly confused with milk allergy. Lactose intolerance is a gastrointestinal disorder, while milk allergy is an autoimmune reaction against certain milk proteins. Milk allergy is life-threatening and presents early in infancy, while Lactose intolerance usually presents in adolescence or early adulthood. It is important to educate the patient that they should always check the ingredients on food labels for lactose on food products to avoid their use when they have lactose intolerance. However, some people with lactose intolerance can tolerate some milk and milk-containing products and may not need to avoid them completely. Prolonged avoidance of milk in people with lactose intolerance can result in calcium and vitamin D deficiency.
