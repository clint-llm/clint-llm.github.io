Since pruritus in the absence of primary skin lesions is the cardinal feature of pruritus gravidarum, the importance of a thorough history and a complete physical examination cannot be overemphasized.

The key laboratory finding in pruritus gravidarum is an increase in the concentration of serum bile acids. Usually, it is the first and only abnormal laboratory finding. The rise in serum bile acid levels follows pruritus.

Serum aminotransferases may be increased but do not exceed 1000 unit/L, distinguishing this condition from viral hepatitis.

Ultrasonography of the liver does not show any abnormalities. Histopathology may show cholestasis without inflammation, but a liver biopsy is not needed for diagnosis.
