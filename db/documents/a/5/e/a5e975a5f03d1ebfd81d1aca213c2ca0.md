The primary survey is designed to assess and treat any life-threatening injuries quickly. It should be completed very rapidly. The main causes of death in a trauma patient are airway obstruction, respiratory failure,Â massive hemorrhage, and brain injuries. Therefore, these are the areas targeted during the primary survey. The following are some of, but not all, the specific injuries that may be identified during a primary survey, which may be potentially life-threatening:

- Airway obstruction

- Tension pneumothorax

- Massive internal or external hemorrhage

- Open pneumothorax

- Flail chest

- Cardiac tamponade

- Intracranial bleed

- Increased intracranial pressure
