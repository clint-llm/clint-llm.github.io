Esophageal embryogenesis, though an independent process, is a part of cellular events that leads to the formation of lung, trachea, and esophagus in different and specific yet interlinked pathways, namely the increased expression of SOX2 in the dorsal portion of the foregut endoderm leading to esophageal differentiation and NKx2-1 expression in the ventral foregut endoderm resulting in differentiation of the respiratory system. These genes are timely expressed and spatially regulated in the foregut endoderm. Therefore, interruption of any of these pathways at any point during development can lead to various trachea-esophageal malformations.
