The evaluation of amenorrhea begins with a thorough medical history and physical examination. It is important first to rule out pregnancy as a patient ovulates before their first period. Inquire about pubertal development or cyclic abdominal pain, which may be caused by an imperforate hymen, transverse vaginal septum, or cervical atresia. Any history of anosmia, galactorrhoea, headaches, or visual changes may indicate a central nervous system or pituitary disorder. Inquire about medical history, general health, and lifestyle, particularly to identify chronic illness or exposure to radiation. Current medications should be reviewed. A history of extreme weight loss should be noted. Delayed menarche or androgen insensitivity syndrome can often be hereditary.

Physical examination includes measurement of height, weight, and BMI. Short stature and sexual infantilism are hallmarks of gonadal dysgenesis. Low body weight is associated with hypothalamic amenorrhea resulting from severe malnutrition or physical, psychological, or emotional stress. Breast tanner staging is a reliable indicator of estrogen production or exposure to exogenous estrogen. A goiter or thyroid nodule suggests thyroid disorder; both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be associated with amenorrhea. Stigmata of Turner's syndrome should be explored, including a webbed neck, widely spaced nipples, cubitus valgus, low hairline, high arched palate, multiple pigmented naevi, and short fourth metacarpals. Abdominal examination may reveal a mass that may result from hematometra or an ovarian neoplasm, but this is rare. A thorough examination of the external genitalia should be conducted. An imperforate hymen is diagnosed by the presence of a bulging membrane that distends during the Valsalva maneuver. A patent vagina and normal cervix exclude Mullerian vaginal agenesis, androgen insensitivity syndrome, and obstructive causes of amenorrhea such as an imperforate hymen or transverse vaginal septum. Rectal examination can detect any distended haematocolpos that may form above the obstruction when the uterus is present and functional.
