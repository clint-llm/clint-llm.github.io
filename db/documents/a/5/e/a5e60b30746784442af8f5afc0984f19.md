The most common chief complaint in patients suffering from sinus squeeze is localized frontal pain. Maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are less significant and infrequent. The pain can radiate up the crown of the head, and behind the orbits, lacrimation is frequently associated in these cases. Epistaxis is the second most common patient concern. Epistaxis is more closely associated with rapid ascent than descent.

Physical examination of the nasal mucosa may be normal or abnormal during an episode of sinus squeeze. Serous or bloody discharge can be observed up to a week after an inciting event. Discharge is commonly seen coming from the middle meatus located between the middle and inferior conchae.
