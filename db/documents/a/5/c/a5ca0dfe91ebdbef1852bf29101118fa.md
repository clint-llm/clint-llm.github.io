Recognizing and addressing HIV-associated lipodystrophy represents a challenge, given its multifactorial etiology and development over time. HIV infection and the use of specific antiretroviral agents are key factors in the development of the syndrome. Providers taking care of HIV-positive patients must closely follow glucose levels, lipid profile, and body habitus changes to detect metabolic changes secondary to antiretroviral drugs and make proper adjustments such as switching medications, adding hypoglycemic agents, or lipid-lowering drugs. Specialty nurses are key in educating patients about the potential side effects of ART and self-monitoring strategies to help identify these complications early. Pharmacists play a pivotal role in assisting clinicians in choosing an appropriate ART regimen and addressing dyslipidemia so that adverse drug effects and interactions are minimized.Â Consultation with a psychiatrist and/or mental health nurse is recommended for patients emotionally affected by body habitus and body image changes to help them cope with the treatment alterations so that treatment adherence is not affected and clinical complications are minimized. A well-coordinated interprofessional team can optimize clinical outcomes for patients with lipodystrophy.
