Patients with EVALI can present with a wide variety of symptoms within 90 days of using e-cigarette devices and related products and whose illnesses were not attributed to other causes. The constellation of symptoms ranges from respiratory such as cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath, which are most common, to gastrointestinal such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, to general symptoms, such as fever, chills, or weight loss. The main clinical manifestations are derived from 98 case-patients reported in 2020, predominantly men (79%) with a median age of 21 years.

Most patients report using products from informal sources, including friends, family, and online or in-person dealers. Knowing the particular substance used is noteworthy, as most EVALI patients report using THC-containing products before the onset of symptoms. Maintaining confidentiality and a non-judgmental attitude are paramount in conducting a successful patient interview. Some patients may not be comfortable talking about their vaping product use, especially those who use THC or CBD products. On examination, the patient can present with fever (33%), tachycardia in (63%), and tachypnea (43%).
