The human body maintains sodium and water homeostasis by concentrating the urine secondary to the action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and increased fluid intake by powerful thirst response. These mechanisms to protect against developing hypernatremia are impaired in certain vulnerable populations and conditions with vasopressin deficiency or unresponsiveness at the renal tubular level. Hypernatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration of greater than 145 meq/l This activity reviews the causes, presentation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of hypernatremia.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with hypernatremia.
- Summarize the treatment of hypernatremia.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by hypernatremia.
