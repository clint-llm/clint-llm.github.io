In cases of overdose of sulfonylureas such as glimepiride, hypoglycemia can occur. It is essential to recognize the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, which can fall into the following two categories:

- Autonomic symptoms such as tremor, palpitations, nausea, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and anxiety

- Neuroglycopenic symptoms such as confusion, fatigue, headache, drowsiness, coma, and seizures.

Rapid recognition and reversal of hypoglycemia are essential in improving prognosis in those that have overdosed on glimepiride.
