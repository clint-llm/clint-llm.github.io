Blood glucose monitoring is an essential part of management in clients with diabetes mellitus. Very high or very low blood glucose levels could impair cellular function and may be lethal if not managed appropriately. Stress-related hyperglycemia may also be seen in clients who have experienced an acute medical or surgical event.

**Hyperglycemia**

The etiologies of hyperglycemia include but are not limited to:

- Inadequate insulin administration in clients with type 1 diabetes mellitus

- Insulin resistance with or without frank type 2 diabetes mellitus

- Stress-related experiences such as critical illness

- The dawn phenomena - a hormone surge between 4 am and 5 am that causes a spike in blood glucose levels

Symptoms of hyperglycemia include polyuria (increased and frequent urination), polydipsia (increased thirst), blurred vision, headache, fatigue, and glucosuria. Acute symptoms of hyperglycemia are not usually seen at levels below 14 mmol/L or 250 mg/dL.

Episodes of hyperglycemia over an extended period may lead to either diabetic ketoacidosis or a hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state. Untreated hyperglycemia may cause the client to enter ketoacidosis, using fatty acids for gluconeogenesis to produce the energy required for cellular function. Ketoacidosis may be due to decreased insulin production, as seen in type 1 diabetes mellitus; this clinical condition is termed diabetic ketoacidosis and is a life-threatening scenario. The lack of insulin production may result in high serum levels of ketones and ketoacids. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis may include fruity breath, ketonuria, tachypnea, tachycardia, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, altered mentation, and coma.

Untreated hyperglycemia may also result in a hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state. This is a rare condition seen most commonly in clients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Profound hyperglycemia can result in significant glucosuria; because glucose is hydrophilic, the kidney produces exceedingly large volumes of urine, resulting in life-threatening dehydration and potential coma. Both diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar state require emergent management to reduce elevated blood glucose levels with insulin therapy.

Long-term hyperglycemia can potentially delay wound healing and damage nerves (peripheral neuropathy) and end-organs such as the eyes (diabetic retinopathy), kidneys (renal failure), the brain (stroke), and the heart (myocardial infarction).

**Hypoglycemia**

Symptoms of hypoglycemia are seen when low blood glucose levels deprive the body of essential fuel to sustain life.

Causes of hypoglycemia include but are not limited to insulin overdose, inadequate carbohydrate intake in relation to insulin use, and an imbalance between insulin administration, carbohydrate intake, and exercise.

Clients with hypoglycemia may present with confusion, sweating, tachycardia, blurred vision, lightheadedness, clumsiness, or seizure activity. Often clients do not recognize the onset of symptoms of hypoglycemia which may put them at high risk of injury while undertaking regular activities such as driving or while asleep.

Emergent treatment to restore normal blood glucose levels is imperative as some organs, such as the brain, do not store glucose and need a constant supply of blood glucose to sustain life. Antidiabetic therapy needs re-evaluation when BSL falls below 5.6 mmol/liter (100 mg/dL), and modification of antidiabetic treatment is essential if BSL drops below 3.9 mmol/liter (70 mg/dL).

Clients across the lifespan with diabetes mellitus have varying clinical presentations and underlying clinical pathologies. They may not always report the effects of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, which should involve monitoring for other signs and symptoms. Clients with renal insufficiency are at risk of hypoglycemia as the kidneys are primarily responsible for metabolizing exogenous insulin.

**Glycemic Care in the Clinical Setting**

For appropriate glycemic control in clients with diabetes mellitus in non-critical care settings, capillary blood glucose testing is the recommended testing method. Blood glucose testing is recommended before meals and bedtime for clients who can eat. Clients receiving enteral feeds or are nil by oris (NPO) should be tested every 4 to 6 hours. All hospitalized patients will benefit from an initial assessment of blood glucose, irrespective of a history of diabetes mellitus. Using glucose management protocols, with nurse-initiated treatment protocols, is ideal for managing hypoglycemia in the hospital setting.

**Community and Rehabilitation Setting-based Care**

Clients need education on the importance of regulating diet, exercise, and medications to prevent acute or chronic complications in extreme blood glucose fluctuations in conditions like diabetes mellitus. Further, clients need specific education to test for blood glucose, including appropriate handwashing before testing, calibrating the glucometer if required, using the lancet, acquiring a blood sample, interpreting results, and reporting and following up on results.
