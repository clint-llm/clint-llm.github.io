Doppler peripheral venous duplex US assessment requires an ultrasound machine with gray-scale B-mode, color-flow Doppler, and video recording capabilities for accurately recording vessel compressibility, laminar versus turbulent flow, and relevant pathology in peripheral vessels. A 5 MHz frequency linear or curved-linear transducer is generally suitable. Occasionally, a 2.5 MHz transducer or phased array transducer is utilized to facilitate the interrogation of deeper vessels. The display screen must be capable of demonstrating both direction and relative amplitude of moving blood.
