**Outcomes**

Once HPV is acquired, recurrences are common. However, for most patients with genital warts, there are treatments. In about 60% of cases, genital warts resolve spontaneously. Irrespective of the treatment of genital warts, the risk of cervical cancer is not altered.

The biggest concern with genital warts is the risk of cervical cancer. HPV is also known to be associated with anal and head and neck cancers. Individuals who are immunocompromised are also at riskÂ for developing dysplasia or cancer of the vagina and vulva.

Finally, in at least one-third of patients with HPV, there is the presence of other sexually transmitted infections.
