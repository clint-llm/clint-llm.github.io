An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach to chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) can help achieve the best possible outcomes. The diagnosis of CPH can be made by any medical provider by taking a thorough headache history. Treatment of CPH with indomethacin requiresÂ consideration of any risk factors for peptic ulcer disease, cardiovascular disease, concurrent antithrombotic medications, and renal function. Primary care providers and neurologists who most commonly diagnose and treat CPH may consult with a pharmacist regarding dosing schedule, a gastroenterologist regarding gastric safety of indomethacin, a cardiologist in the setting of a history of cardiovascular events, and a nephrologist to guide the safety of using indomethacin in the setting of renal insufficiency.
