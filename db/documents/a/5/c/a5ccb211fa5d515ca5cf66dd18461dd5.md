Branches from the ascending pharyngeal artery, coming off of the external carotid artery, provide blood supply to the superior cervical ganglia. Venous drainage is through the internal jugular vein through direct posterior branches. There is a noted deficiency in gross blood supply at the junction of the upper one third and lower two-thirds of the neck; this is important for surgical considerations mentioned in the later part of this activity.

The superior cervical ganglia are anterior to the retropharyngeal lymph nodes.
