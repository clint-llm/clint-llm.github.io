Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), also called slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE), is the most common hip pathology inÂ pre-adolescent and adolescent patients; however, the diagnosis can be delayed or missed. Primary care (family medicine, internal medicine, or pediatrics) and emergency medicine clinicians, including clinicians and advanced practice providers, should always consider SCFE in the differential diagnosis of pre-adolescent and adolescent patients with leg pain.

Patients with a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of SCFE must be immediately placed on strict non-weight bearing precautions and provided adequate analgesia; thus, effective interprofessional communication among clinicians (including specialists from orthopedics and radiology), nursing, pharmacists, physical therapists, and patient care technicians is paramount to ensure optimal care delivery. Urgent pediatric orthopedic consultation for definitive management should be prioritized. Clinicians should additionally consider clinical features of possible underlying endocrine or renal disorders and further evaluate patients as indicated in consultation with appropriate subspecialists. Interprofessional teamwork and open communication are crucial to optimal patient results. [Level 5]
