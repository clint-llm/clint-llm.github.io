The differential diagnosis includes herpes simplex infection, the most common cause followed by syphilis, and then distant chancroid. Clinical differentiation is difficult and inaccurate and may be made additionally challenging by co-infection with HIV or superimposed bacterial infection. Consideration should also be given to granuloma inguinale in the appropriate endemic setting and lymphogranuloma venereum if inguinal lymphadenitis is noted.
