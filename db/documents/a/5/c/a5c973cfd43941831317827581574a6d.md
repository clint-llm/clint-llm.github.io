Nasopharyngeal airway maneuvers can be very useful to medical professionals when needing to provide adequete airway management to patient's with respiratory complaints. During the initial airway management, nasopharyngeal airways devices can be utilized to help with oxygenation and ventilation of a patient that is difficult to oxygenate or ventilate via BVM. While nasopharyngeal airway devices are airway adjuncts for patients that are difficult to ventilate and oxygenate, they only act as a bridge to either a stabilized patient that is breathing without aid or a patient that requires a secure airway via endotracheal or nasotracheal (NT) intubation.
