The tendon tissue is an integral part of the concept of fascial continuity; that is, the tendon actively and passively participates in muscle performance and passive and active movements of the joints.

In a healthy tendon, the tendon-bone portion is usually aneural. Despite this assumption, a loss of innervation of the rest of the tendon tissue could cause the presence of chronic tendinopathies, particularly in the tendon-bone area.
