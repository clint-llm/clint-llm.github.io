Neurological sequelae may persist following recovery from initial infection with VEEV. Though there is no specific therapy for VEEV, modern medical technology has improved supportive treatments, and many patients will survive even encephalitic disease.

Pregnant women may be at distinct risk of complications from arbovirus infections. VEEV was classified as the first teratogenic arbovirus. Pregnant women are at risk for congenital disabilities, miscarriage, preterm delivery, and stillbirth. Vertical transmission from mother to fetus has been documented. Ten fetal autopsies performed during an outbreak demonstrated VEEV in the brains of aborted fetuses.
