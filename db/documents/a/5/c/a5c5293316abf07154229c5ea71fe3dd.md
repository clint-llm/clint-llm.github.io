Measuring serum and urine hormone levels can provide great insight when attempting to diagnose an endocrinological disorder, especially by cross-referencing multiple values. An example of this is the couple of TSH and T4. If TSH is undetectable and T4 and T3 show elevated, then the patient has primary hyperthyroidism, while if TSH measures elevated and T4 has decreased the patient has primary hypothyroidism.
