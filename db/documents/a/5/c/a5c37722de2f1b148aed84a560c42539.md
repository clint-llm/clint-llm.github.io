- Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of pneumonia.

- Prodromal symptoms include headache and fever, and patients subsequently develop a dry cough.

- It is frequently subclinical and thus underdiagnosed due to lack of symptoms or specific diagnostic criteria.

- Chest radiograph often does not show an infiltrate.

- Management is with antibiotics, generally azithromycin.

- Children, the elderly, and individuals with sickle cell disease are at risk of complications.

As for the prevention of infection, there are currently no vaccines for M. pneumoniae. Several studies looked at the efficacy of azithromycin prophylaxis in military training facilities and other closed settings. However, there are still no recommendations for these practices. Hospitalized patients with M. pneumoniae infection should be placed on droplet precautions for the full duration of their illness.
