Prematurity is the leading cause of perinatal death followed by intrauterine fetal growth restriction, which complicates approximately 4% to 6% of known pregnancies. Placental insufficiency is a potential cause of preterm labor, pre-eclampsia, IUGR, and stillbirth, which can affect 10Â to 15% of pregnancies. For an IUGR fetus, the risk of spontaneous preterm labor is three-fold greater when compared to a non-growth restricted fetus, and there is also a five to six times higher risk for the development of perinatal death.
