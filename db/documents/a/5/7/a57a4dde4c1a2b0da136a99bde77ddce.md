There are many pieces of equipment required for the procedure, but they can be divided into several categories for ease of memory. The authors prefer to categorize according to specific steps or parts of the procedure: (I) tube, (II) procedure, (III) safety, (IV) monitoring prior and after the procedure, (V) emergency equipment, and (VI) documentation.

The equipment required for (I) tube change are:

- Two tracheostomy tubes of appropriate make or type, where one is the same size, and the other is smaller, which can be used when stomal obstruction or collapse is encountered.

- 10 ml syringe for suction through a subglottic port if present, cuff deflation, and inflation

- Cuff pressure manometer if the tube has a cuff

- Dressing pack containing gauzes and tracheostomy stoma dressing

- Sodium chloride (0.9%) for cleaning

- Tracheostomy tube tapes, ties or dedicated holder

Next, the equipment required for (II) procedure are:

- Shoulder roll or pillow for patient positioning

- Pre-oxygenation with an oxygen mask or Ambu bag

- Suture removal kit

- Flashlight

- Water-based lubricating gel

- Suction equipment and suction catheters

For patient and personnel safety:

- Patient consent, if appropriate

- Mask, gown, protective eyewear, and gloves

For monitoring prior to and after the procedure:

- Pressure manometer

- Waveform capnography or carbon dioxide detector

- Oxygen saturation probe and machine

- Fibreoptic scope

- Stethoscope

Equipment that must be present during tube change for emergency or to assist in difficult situations are:

- Tracheal dilators

- Crash trolley containing an array of airway devices

- Airway exchange device or catheter

- Resuscitation equipment

Other types of equipment that may be useful during tracheostomy tube change are microbial swab if an infection is suspected, and silver nitrate cautery sticks for superficial granulation tissue.
