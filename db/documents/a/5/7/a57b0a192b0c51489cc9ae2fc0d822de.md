Tendons are innervated by nerve branches from both the muscle belly and the sensitive branches distributed to the skin. Innervation is scarce. Nerves are localized to the paratenon, endotenon, and epitenon.

Nerve branches form trunks parallel to the tendon's central axis, anastomosed with branches with a transverse and oblique course. The nerve endings are of various types; some end in the musculotendinous organs of the Golgi or the corpuscles of Pacini or Ruffini, while others terminate in free arborizations.Â Innervation accompanies the vascular supply.

The sympathetic innervation of a tendon follows the vascular supply and stimulates vasoconstriction. Vasodilation is stimulated by either sensory fibers similar to parasympathetic fibers or by separate small-diameter sensory fibers.
