Ultrasound can be used to evaluate musculoskeletal complaints in a patient with suspected or known amyloidosis. Ultrasound is useful as a screening tool for the presence of a mass, can provide additional information regarding mass composition, such as fluid or microcalcification, and may evaluate the integrity of structures, such as nerves and tendons, with both static and dynamic acquisition. Soft tissue infiltration, calcification, and joint effusions may be visible.

Ultrasound can also monitor known or new soft tissue lesions, as seen in the ultrasound images for patient 2. Ultrasound-guided biopsy is a valuable intervention for tissue sampling of suspected soft tissue amyloidomas.
