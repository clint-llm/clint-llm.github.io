Serum sickness is caused by drugs containing a protein moiety of other species (heterologous protein), such as antivenins, vaccines, antitoxin, and streptokinase. The heterologous protein can act as an antigen triggering the immune response. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies prepared from rabbit, horse, or mouse serum-like anti-thymocyte globulin, OKT-3, have been found to cause type III hypersensitivity reactions.

Serum sickness-like reactions (SSLR) can be seen with synthetic monoclonal antibodies (chimeric protein). Infliximab, used in the management of rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn disease, and omalizumab, used to treat asthma, are known to be associated with SSLR.

Stings from insects, ticks, and mosquito bites may cause serum sickness.

Infectious diseases like hepatitis B and bacterial endocarditis present a continuous source of antigen to form circulating immune complexes.

Other examples of medications implicated in type III hypersensitivity reactions are cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin, furazolidone, griseofulvin, lincomycin, metronidazole, para-aminosalicylic acid, penicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, tetracycline, allopurinol, barbiturates, bupropion, captopril, carbamazepine, fluoxetine, and penicillamine.
