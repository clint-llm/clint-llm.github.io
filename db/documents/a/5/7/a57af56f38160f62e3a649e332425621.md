As a purely cosmetic problem, spider veins warrant input from an interprofessional team involved in aesthetic medicine, including dermatologists, aestheticians, and plastic surgeons. Patients may first present to their general practitioner, who then refers them to a dermatologist or plastic surgeon. In many healthcare economies, spider vein treatment is considered as aesthetic; thus, government or insurance funding may be limited. A significant commercial market exists, and the astute practitioner will counsel patients to seek care with reputable aesthetic medicine providers. The treating practitioner must have an honest and frank discussion with the patient about the aims, risks, and benefits, and out-of-pocket costs of any treatment plan, and allow the patient to make an informed decision.
