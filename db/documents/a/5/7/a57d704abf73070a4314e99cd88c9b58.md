Even though laboratory tube collection is mainly the responsibility of the clinical laboratory and its staff, team interventions in the clinic and hospital settings can still help in the total quality implementation of such laboratory practices. For instance, non-laboratory personnel such as nurses and clinicians should at least become oriented or aware of the order of draw so that when they get to see laboratory staff or phlebotomists at the bedside engaging in improper procedures, they can immediately call attention to it before there is an adverse clinical impact to the patient. Assisting a colleague at work can have a significant effect on patient care.

Moreover, during conferences or departmentÂ meetings, the laboratory manager (or pathologist) can discuss the importance of proper laboratory tube collection with the administration, clinical staff, purchasing department, and human resources. Aside from non-laboratory health personnel, non-clinical personnel must be included in the team to increase the scope of knowledge. While interprofessional teams' goal is to improve overall patient care, it should be emphasized that helping other colleagues should not be intended to blame a health professional but rather to lift everyone in the team and provide corrective action.
