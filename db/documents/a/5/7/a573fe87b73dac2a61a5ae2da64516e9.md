Before transplantation was an option, patients with end-stage kidney disease didn't have excellent treatment options. Once the design of hemodialysis was established, survival was improved. Once the advent of kidney transplantation was set into gear, patients with ESRD were seen to have better long-term survival if they were placed on the waiting list and eventually underwent kidney transplantation than those who stayed on dialysis. Additionally and importantly, those who underwent transplantation experienced a better quality of life and a projected survival benefit of 10 years over those who remained on dialysis.
