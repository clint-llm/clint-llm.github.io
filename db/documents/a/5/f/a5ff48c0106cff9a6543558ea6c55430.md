Anal fissures are best managed by an interprofessional team.  Anal fissures are common presentations in the emergency department, urgent care, or the primary care provider. Even though benign, these lesions can cause significant pain and affect the quality of life. Because of the high number of patients with anal fissures, it is impossible for a surgeon to see them all; hence, based on current guidelines, acute cases are usually managed by the primary care provider or nurse practitioner with lifestyle changes, laxatives, and diet. The pharmacist, nurse practitioner, and primary care provider must educate the patient on avoiding constipation; this not only leads to a decreased incidence of anal fissures but helps reduce the cost of managing the anal fissure. A dietary consult with a nurse educator or dietician is highly recommended as patients need to know which foods they should be eating to avoid constipation.

Often nurses and pharmacists help patients with anal fissures and can provide education about medication used to relieve pain and how to perform sitz baths. If there are untoward consequences or increased pain, the nurse and pharmacist should help the interprofessional team provide a solution. Patients who fail to respond to conservative measures should be referred to a specialist.

The condition can be treated in many ways; however, it is essential to refer the patient to a colorectal surgeon who has more experience with this disorder than most other healthcare providers when medical treatments fail.

**Outcomes**

The prognosis for most patients is good as long as they make changes in their lifestyle and diet. For recalcitrant cases, surgery may be an option. But even after surgical treatment, these lesions recur in 4-6% of patients.
