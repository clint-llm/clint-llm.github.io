Androgen insensitivity syndrome may subclassify in the form of the following clinical entities: complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS), and mild androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS).

**CAIS**

There are various forms of presentations of CAIS in different age groups, varying from infants to adolescent females. CAIS will present very commonly as primary amenorrhea in adolescent females or incidental finding of testes in females undergoing inguinal hernia repair. Physical examination reveals a female phenotype at birth, which will be a mismatch from the results of prenatal fetal sexing (Y chromosome on DNA analysis). The vagina is blind-ending with no uterus. Gonads are present in the lower abdomen or inguinal canal. At puberty, with the normal growth spurt, there is breast development secondary to the conversion of androgens to estrogens and a taller female phenotype secondary to the effect of the Y chromosome.

**PAIS**

PAIS results in a varied phenotype from the residual androgen receptor function. Symptoms vary from severe under-masculinization with female genitalia to male genitalia. The physical examination will be pertinent for hypospadias, bifid scrotum, and micropenis.

**MAIS**

This usually presents as a normal male phenotype with isolated micropenis. In adulthood, it may be associated with gynecomastia and infertility.
