When food gets introduced into the stomach, a coordinated response via stretch receptors, neuropeptides, and the enteric nervous system activate the gastrocolic reflex, which in turn increases the motility in the colon to make room for more food. Migrating motor complexes induce food bolus movement through slow waves and faster segments of increased electrical activity, know as spike waves; this is very similar to how the stomach and small intestine move food. The large bowel also employs stronger, more frequent contractions known as mass movements in response to signals from mechanical stretch receptors in the stomach and the products of digestion in the small intestine. The enteric nervous system controls these mass movements and is most active in the transverse and left colon, which helps move food toward the rectum for defecation, which is the reason behind the urge to defecate following ingestion of a meal.
