Salivary glands are made up of three cell types: acinar cells, ductal cells, and myoepithelial cells. The myoepithelial cells are a crucial component of the glands as they wrap around both the ductal cells and acinar cells and contract to squeeze the saliva out of the gland. On hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining, the sublingual gland stains lighter than the parotid and submandibular glands. This staining is due to the heavy presence of glycolipids found in the sublingual gland secretions that give it a clear cytoplasmic appearance histologically. The ducts are lined with simple columnar epithelium and surrounded by a basal layer of myoepithelial cells. Enzymes (such as salivary peroxidase and salivary amylase) and peptides (including defensins, agglutinins, and cystatins) are stored in granules within the acinar cells, awaiting the signal for release as a component of the saliva. These granules stain darkly with hematoxylin, gray with mucicarmine, black with anti-smooth muscle actin (SMA), and rich brown with anti-amylase. Damage to the salivary glands is often evidenced histologically as the columnar cells become almost cuboidal, and the adipose tissue and surrounding stroma occupy more space as the cells balloon outwards.
