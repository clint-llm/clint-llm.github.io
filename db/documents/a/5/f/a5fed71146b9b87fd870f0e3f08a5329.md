Congenital lacrimal fistula is an uncommon condition that should be suspected both in pediatric and adult populations presenting with persistent epiphora without any other acknowledged causes. In some cases, the course of such abnormal ducts may be blinded and not in communication with the skin, which may render the clinical presentation occult. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of congenital lacrimal fistula and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with a congenital lacrimal fistula.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with congenital lacrimal fistula.
- Identify the indications for surgical intervention for congenital lacrimal fistula.
- Summarize the management consideration for patients with congenital lacrimal fistula.
