Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is one class of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP). NSIP is chronic interstitial pneumonia with the homogeneous appearance of interstitial fibrosis and inflammation. It is nonspecific as it lacks the histopathological features of the other subtypes of the IIP. NSIP typically has bilateral lung involvement and may have a predisposition for the lower lobes.
