Once the patient has been positioned adequately, and lighting has been optimized, a digital rectal examination is first performed. Four quadrant anoscopy is then performed, and the largest hemorrhoidal column is identified. It is important to delineate the dentate line as if a rubber band is placed too close to the dentate line; severe pain may occur as it has somatic innervation. The apex of the hemorrhoid is then grasped approximately 1 cm to 2 cm proximal to the dentate line. The forceps should be placed at the proximal point of the hemorrhoid, and the patient should be asked if they feel any pain or sensation of the grasper. This can be repeated to approach a more proximal portion of the hemorrhoid. The trigger is then pulled, and the elastic band is released. The grasper is removed and using the anoscope, the position of the rubber band is confirmed. This process can be repeated in other quadrants if desired.
