Given the hepatic adverse effects associated with caspofungin, monitoring the liver function is essential.

Caspofungin is known to release histamine in peripheral blood cells, which predisposes patients to potentially developing histamine-mediated symptoms ranging from severe to fatal anaphylaxis. As a result, monitoring patients for anaphylaxis, rash, or histamine-related reactions (e.g., facial swelling, bronchospasm, a sensation of warmth) is of paramount importance to decrease the risk of morbidity and mortality.
