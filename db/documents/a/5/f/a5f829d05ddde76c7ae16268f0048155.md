The histologic basis of tendons is formed via a biological interplay of elastin and mucopolysaccharides that provide the ground substance, further composed of specialized fibroblasts called tenocytes, containing type I collagen as a matrix.

Endotenons are fascicular arrangements with bundles of tenocytes and collagen fibers held together by a fine layer of connective tissue. Epitenon describes septa of endotenon joined together externally to form fibrous outer layers. Paratenons are tendons covered by a loose layer of adventitial tissue proximal to the tendon sheath.

Tendon healing can be divided into intrinsic and extrinsic components. Intrinsic healing involves the tenocytes within the tendon, on the epitenon layer. The inflammatory cells and fibroblasts from the overlying sheath are implicated in extrinsic healing. The extrinsic healing component is the purported culprit of adhesion formation between the tendon and its sheath. Like other variations of wound healing, tendon repair progresses through 4 phases: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Although earlier stages see greater quantities of type III collagen, type I collagen dominates as healing progresses.

Each flexor tendon has a proximal region that is extrasynovial and a distal region that is intrasynovial. It is known that well-vascularized extrasynovial tendons (flexor tendons of the wrist and forearm - zones III, IV, and V) typically exhibit a robust wound-healing process following injury and subsequent repair, achieving 85-100% of normal digital motion with a low incidence of tendon rupture. This phenomenon is secondary to extrasynovial tendinous enrichment of inflammatory inhibitors and oxidative phosphorylation enzymes that prompt a rapid neovascularization response and increased expression of complement proteins. In contrast, intrasynovial tendons (digital flexor tendons) demonstrate minimal vascularity with muted inflammatory and metabolic responses.

Environmental factors, additionally, influence the healing capacity of connective tissues.
