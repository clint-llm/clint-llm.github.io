Loss of permanent teeth and hypodontia can shift an otherwise ideal occlusion. Hypodontia may be caused by trauma or lack of tooth development. For instance, the loss of a maxillary tooth can allow the eruption of the opposing mandibular tooth into the opposing edentulous space. The adjacent teeth may alsoÂ tip or shift to the empty space.

Impacted teeth characteristically remain under the gingival tissue and do not erupt into their ideal position. Impacted teeth can be a significant cause of malocclusion, leading to the shifting of adjacent teeth. When impacted teeth do not erupt into the dental arch, additional space exists for adjacent teeth to shift into, which will serve as an obstacle for if and when the impacted tooth may erupt later. Impacted third molars are often experienced during adolescence or early adulthood and may cause interferences in occlusion if not extracted or exposed.
