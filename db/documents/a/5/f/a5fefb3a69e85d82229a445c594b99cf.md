After initial stabilization and assessment, the practitioner should proceed with a thorough evaluation. Laboratory tests should include but are not be limited to, a CBC, electrolytes, liver and renal function, thyroid panel, coagulation studies, pregnancy test for age-appropriate females, serum and urine toxicology screens, and drug levels when available. EKG is necessary to evaluate any dysrhythmias or concern for QT prolongation. EKG should be compared to the previous EKG when available. Radiographic studies are helpful when appropriate to assess for complicating underlying conditions, such as aspiration pneumonia or trauma.
