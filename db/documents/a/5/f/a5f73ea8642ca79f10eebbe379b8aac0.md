In general, patients with pure EDHs have an excellent prognosis of a functional outcome after the surgical evacuation, when it is rapidly detected and evacuated. A delay in diagnosis and treatment increases morbidity and mortality.

EDHs caused by arterial bleeding develop rapidly and can be detected quickly. But those due to a dural sinus tear develop more slowly. Thus, clinical manifestations may be delayed, with a resultant delay in recognition and evacuation. Generally, an EDH volume greater than 50 cm prior to evacuation results in a worse neurological outcome and consequent mortality.

Factors that may influence the outcome are as follows:

- Patient age

- Time lapsed between injury and treatment

- Immediate coma or lucid interval

- Presence of pupillary abnormalities

- GCS/motor score, on arrival

CT findings (hematoma volume, the degree of midline shift, the presence of signs of active hematoma bleeding, or associated intra-dural lesions)

Postoperative intracranial pressure (ICP)

Several markers that correlate with a poor prognosis of EDH include the following:

- A low GCS before surgery, or on arrival

- Abnormal pupil examination, in particular, un-reactive pupils (unilateral or bilateral)

- Advanced age

- The time between neurological symptoms and surgery

- Elevated ICP in the post-operative period

Certain head CT findings can correlate with a poor prognosis:

- Hematoma volume of greater than 30 to 150 ml

- A midline shift greater than 10 to 12 mm

- “Swirl sign” indicating an active bleed

- Associated intracranial lesions (such as contusions, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and diffuse brain swelling)
