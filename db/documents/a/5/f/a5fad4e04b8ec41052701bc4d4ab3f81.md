Contraindications to ablative laser resurfacing include:

- Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI (there is an increased risk of dyspigmentation in patients with darker skin)

- History of keloidal scarring

- Recent oral isotretinoin therapy (traditional teaching recommends cessation for 6 to 12 months before resurfacing procedures)

- Ectropion (particularly when considering infraorbital resurfacing)

- Morphea

- Scleroderma

- Prior radiation therapy (which limits the skin's ability to heal in a timely fashion)

- Cutaneous disorders (vitiligo, lichen planus, and psoriasis are relative contraindications)

- Active herpes outbreaks or other ongoing infections in the targeted area (laser treatment should be postponed until the condition has resolved)

- Ongoing ultraviolet exposure

- Recent chemical peel (depending on the depth of the peel, may require six weeks to 6 months before considering ablative laser resurfacing)
