The required equipment is the same for any standard operation for external surgery. For internal surgery, including the vagina or introitus, spreading retractors such as a Gelpi or Weitlaner and Speculum will be necessary, as are deeply curved retractors like the Deaver. It is recommended to have variable sizes available. Positioning will likely require stirrups for lithotomy positioning.
