Brown recluse spider bites typically only cause cutaneous findings that are localized but sometimes can progress to systemic injury and, rarely, death. Most of these patients will present to the emergency department where they will encounter an ER nurse and emergency medicine physician or physician assistant. The ER nurse will assist with lab draws and local wound care. If admission to the hospital is deemed unnecessary, the patient will need to be seen by their primary care physician over the next few days to monitor the wound progression. If there is an ulcer formation, the patient will eventually need to be evaluated by a general surgeon. If the patient develops systemic findings or lab abnormalities, it would be prudent to involve the toxicologist in the patient's care to render their recommendations. In the event of end-organ damage like acute kidney injury, a nephrologist will need to be involved in the patient's care.
