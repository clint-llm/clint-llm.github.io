Diaphragm dysfunction is an underdiagnosed condition that causes unexplained dyspnea. The dysfunction can range from partial weakness to complete paralysis of either one hemidiaphragm or both hemidiaphragms.

Diaphragmatic paralysis usually results from a high spinal cord injury, whereas mid-cervical lesions lead to partial weakness. SCI leads to chronic impairment and disability. Half of these patients develop tetraplegia, with 4% of these patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation.

Traditional approaches to management have been mainly focused on waiting for recovery through innervation while supporting the patient on mechanical ventilation. However, this is fraught with complications. In the past few years, diaphragmatic pacing (DP) has been a proven therapy to wean SCI patients from mechanical ventilation (MV).
