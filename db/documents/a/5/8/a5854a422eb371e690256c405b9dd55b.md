All healthcare providers (i.e., nurses, physicians, and prehospital healthcare providers) need to be aware of and understand the various exceptions when a minor can be medically evaluated and treated without the presence or consent of a parent or legal guardian. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that health care providers support adolescents' growing autonomy and transition to adulthood by including their viewpoint and consent in a shared, family-based decision-making model. Providers have a duty to serve the pediatric patient's best interest and not necessarily the parents' desires. Parental consent should be considered a responsibility that supports the minor's best interests and preserves a family's interests, rather than a parent's right to express their own autonomous choices.  Reframing parental consent as parental responsibility may help clinicians minimize conflict during difficult medical decision-making in a child's health care.
