Arterial supply to the distal radioulnar joint derives primarily from palmar and dorsal branches of the anterior interosseous artery.  These arteries branch at the proximal border of the pronator quadratus and form an anastomotic complex. Other contributions are made by anastomoses as follows: dorsal interosseous artery to the dorsal branch of the anterior interosseous artery, ulnar artery to the palmar branch of the anterior interosseous artery, and collateral circulation from dorsal and palmar carpal arches.

The lymphatic pathways of the upper extremity have been poorly described, but a variety of courses have been noted, including perforators accessing the wrist compartment. These drain from distal to proximal and have little consistency in their flow from deep to superficial or superficial to deep. Primary lymph node collections in the upper extremity appear in the cubital and axillary regions.
