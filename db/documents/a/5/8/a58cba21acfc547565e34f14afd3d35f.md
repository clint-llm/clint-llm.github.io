Assessment of vascular risk factors is most important in anyone presenting with symptoms of amaurosis fugax. Patients should be assessed for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, cardiac disease and asked about tobacco use. A careful physical examination, including full ophthalmological examination with a dilated fundus examination, as well as auscultation of the carotid arteries and the heart, should be performed. Blood work, including a complete blood count, blood glucose level, lipid profile, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein should be ordered as well.

Carotid Doppler is a non-invasive test used to assess the extracranial and intracranial status of the vessels. Magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomography angiography can also be used to evaluate the patency of the internal carotid arteries.

An electrocardiogram, as well as Holter monitoring, and, in some cases, transesophageal echocardiography, should be obtained to rule out any possible source of rhythmic disturbance or cardiac emboli.

Neuroimaging studies are almost always done to rule out other causes of vision loss. In addition, the CT scan can help rule out a hemorrhagic lesion in the brain.
