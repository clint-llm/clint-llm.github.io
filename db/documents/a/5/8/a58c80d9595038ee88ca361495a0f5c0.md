The deep branch of the ulnar nerve is a purely motor branch once it passes through Guyon canal. It innervates the abductor digiti minimi, opponens digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi, the 2 medial lumbricals, interossei muscles, the medial head of the flexor pollicis brevis, and adductor pollicis. In some instances, the superficial branch can provide innervation to the hypothenar muscles.
