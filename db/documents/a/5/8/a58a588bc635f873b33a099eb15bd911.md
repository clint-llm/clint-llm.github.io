CTCL at initial stages has the same life expectancy as healthier adults. But when the disease progresses to more infiltrative and visceral involvement, it has bad prognostic effects. MF is life long disease and recurs after stopping the treatment. Many patients who have a chronic course die from an unrelated disease. SS has a poor prognosis, with median survival between 3-4 years.

PTCL has a poor prognosis compared to the B-cell counterpart. The international prognostic index, which has age, performance status, LDH, stage, and extranodal involvement, helps in determining the prognosis. Even if the IPI index is low, it is still considered to have a poorer prognosis. The presence of some markers like include p53, Ki-67, BCL-2, BCl-X, CD 26, EBV denotes poor prognosis, whereas AKL, NFkB, CCR3, TCR BF1 presence shows good prognosis.
