The aneurysmal wall examined at necropsy and in surgical specimens shows aneurysmal wall thickness between 0.3 to 5 mm. The wall is composed almost entirely of fibrous tissue, with a few strands only of elastic tissue and necrotic cardiomyocytes. Also, extensive calcification in the aneurysmal wall is the characteristic finding of a true ventricular aneurysm. The size of the aneurysm varies between 5 x 7 cm and 1O x 15 cm in diameter. The usual site of the aneurysm is anterior, with extension laterally towards the septum, owing to the occlusion of the left anterior descending artery in anterior myocardial infarction. An area of pericarditis is usually noted over the aneurysm. Further, a ventricular aneurysm consists of a laminated mural thrombus and consists of old and recent thrombotic elements.
