RF is a complex disorder that is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a urologist, general and vascular surgeon, internist, radiologist, and pathologist. Medical therapy with steroids and other immunosuppressive is widely used and it is important that the pharmacist educate the patient on the potential adverse effects. Once treatment starts, the outcomes depend on the chronicity of the condition. While some patients do have a reversal of the fibrosis, others continue to have residual renal and ureteral impairment. Some patients may benefit from surgical decompression but unfortunately, most patients are debilitated and frail for complex surgery.
