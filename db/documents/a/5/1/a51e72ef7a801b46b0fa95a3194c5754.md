In women, breast cancer is number one in incidence and mortality when compared to all cancers. It is the most common non-skin cancer and second deadliest cancer in women than for any other cancer. This activity describes different aspects of breast cancer screening, which is the most common cancer in women worldwide and is also the second commonest cause of cancer mortality in women in the United States. It also highlights the role of new diagnostic radiology practices and the interprofessional team in the detection of breast cancer.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the breast cancer screening guidelines as advocated by the American Cancer Society, United States Preventive Services Task Force, World Health Organization, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network.
- Review the most commonly used techniques to screen breast cancer.
- Outline the potential complications of breast cancer screening such as false-positive tests, possibilities of over-diagnosis, radiation hazards, and patient discomfort.
- As the number of breast cancer cases are increased with the widespread use and implementation of breast cancer screening methods, the complications and harms done due to overtly applying screening strategy may lead to harm more than benefit. Thus, a balance has to be achieved, and for this, it is crucial to maintain coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure the best patient outcomes.
