Pars defects are surprisingly common in the pediatric/adolescent population who participate in sports and present with low back pain (as high as 50%). With that in mind, approach these patients with an appropriate index of suspicion and work up with imaging. If initial radiographs are negative (AP/lateral/oblique), follow up with MRI or CT. Early identification correlates with a significantly improved outcome.
