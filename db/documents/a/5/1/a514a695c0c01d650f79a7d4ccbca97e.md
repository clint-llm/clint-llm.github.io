The etiology of the cramp depends on the situation in which it occurs. It is not possible to draw up the causes, and the possible physiological or pathological differences in which the cramp occurs must be highlighted, as different scenarios give rise to cramps.

Heat-associated muscle cramping is often seen during sports and rigorous exercise or physical activity. In this situation, large losses of sweat and electrolytes are believed to be the underlying pathologic mechanism.
