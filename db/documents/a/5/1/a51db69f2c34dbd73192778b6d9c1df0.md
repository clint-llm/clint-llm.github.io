The various side effects of chronic opioids merit discussion, and the educational materials provided.

If the patient is an IV drug user, communicable diseases should be ruled out, such as HIV or hepatitis B or C.

Methadone and buprenorphine save lives and should be considered for patients on chronic opioids to minimize the risk of death.

Naloxone is used in the acute treatment of an opiate overdose and can be given subcutaneous, IM, IV, intranasal, or inhalation. Naloxone rapidly displaces opioids from opioid receptors and prevents the activation of these receptors by opioids. It is reasonable to prescribe to any patient taking chronic opioids.

Naloxone kits are a recommendation for individuals that may witness or be the initial responder to an opioid overdose. It should be available in drug or substance abuse programs.

An addiction medicine or pain medicine specialist may be a valuable member of the patient's care team, depending on the patient's goals and needs.
