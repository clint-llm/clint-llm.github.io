A personality disorder is a disorder involving a rigid and unhealthy pattern of thinking. Personality disorders are prevalent in the general population and more so in clinical populations. In the pediatric population, all personality disorders can be diagnosed, except antisocial personality disorder, as long as the pathologic behavior has been present for a year or more. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) lists ten personality disorders divided into the 3 clusters (A, B, and C).

In contrast, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) appears to be the most prevalent personality disorder, with rates around 5% of the general population in some studies.
