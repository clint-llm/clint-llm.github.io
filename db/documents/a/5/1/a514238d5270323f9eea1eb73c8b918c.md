Cobalt toxicity is a rare diagnosis, and clinical signs and symptoms overlap significantly with more common diseases. Clinical suspicion is required for the diagnosis of cobalt toxicity. Ingestion of cobalt salts and elemental cobalt may cause gastrointestinal (GI) distress, likely due to irritation of the GI tract itself.

A complete history, including occupational, nutritional, and surgical histories, is important to help identify the potential source of cobalt exposure. In those with cobalt-induced cardiomyopathy, heart failure findings are prominent, including tachycardia, dyspnea, and signs of fluid overload.

Occupations in hard metal manufacturing and diamond polishing will be at a much higher risk of developing toxicity, particularly hard metal lung disease (HMLD). These patients will present with complaints of dyspnea, cough, and wheezing.

Arthroprosthetic-associated cobalt toxicity may present with neurologic dysfunction, including peripheral neuropathy, ocular toxicity, cognitive decline, as well as findings of hypothyroidism and cardiomyopathy.

Findings of dermatitis can also be found in patients, particularly in the occupational setting, as cobalt is a known sensitizer.

Based on case reports and current evidence, cobalt does not appear to cause renal toxicity, teratogenicity, or impaired fertility.
