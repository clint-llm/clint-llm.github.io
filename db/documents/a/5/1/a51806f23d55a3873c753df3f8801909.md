The benefits of temperature correction in practice are equivocal. However, it remains important that the practitioner considers the physiology of hyperthermic and hypothermic states to determine the appropriate approach to a patient. That is, practitioners should recognize that a patient displays hypocarbia, hypoxia, and has higher alkalemia when their body temperature is lower compared to uncorrected blood gas values. Conversely, a hyperthermic patient displays hypercarbia, hyperoxia, with higher acidemia compared to uncorrected blood gas lab values.

Temperature correction of blood gases is most often noted in cardiopulmonary bypass and post-cardiac arrest states. In these instances, tissue perfusion is diminished, resulting in an enduring anaerobic metabolism and resultant acidemia. The tissues will consume less oxygen and produce less CO2 during low perfusion states. Depending on the perfusion to the brain and concerns for increased intracranial pressure due to hypercarbia-related increased cerebral blood flow or the opposite effect of cerebral ischemia in states of hypocarbia, a practitioner may want to use one of two common methods for patient management.

The methods of alpha-stat and pH-stat differ because, in alpha-stat management, homeostasis (e.g., PCO2 of 40 mmHg, pH of 7.4, and PO2 of greater than 60 mmHg) is targetted at the 37°C laboratory values without being corrected for patient's temperature. It is thought that alpha-stat is more appropriate for patients who are prone to decreased cerebral perfusion as the practitioner is using an overestimate of CO2 partial pressure to guide management. Alpha-stat follows the hemoglobin disassociation curve, which is thought to preserve intracellular pH and cerebral autoregulation. Electrochemical neutrality and intracellular pH remain intact with this method.

During pH-stat management, homeostasis is targetted at the laboratory values corrected for the patient's temperature. Ph-stat, or temperature corrected management, aims to maintain normocarbia, normoxia, and an approximately normal pH at the patient's temperature. Ph-stat is thought by some to be more appropriate for patients who are prone to increased intracranial pressure because management is determined by the corrected blood gas values influenced by a hypothermic state with lower CO2 values. Regardless of the method used, there is no evidence of superior neurological outcomes with one particular approach. Some resources state that the general consensus of The Royal College of Anesthetists in the United Kingdom (UK) is to use the alpha-stat method.
