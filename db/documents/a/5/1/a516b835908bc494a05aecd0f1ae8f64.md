Most cerebral aneurysms are asymptomatic and small, and they are found incidentally during brain imaging or during an autopsy. A ruptured aneurysm is a serious and life-threatening emergency condition that needs to be treated promptly. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of saccular aneurysms (cerebral and aortic) and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of saccular aneurysms.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of saccular aneurysms.
- Review the management options available for saccular aneurysms.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in patients with saccular aneurysms to improve outcomes.
