Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the imaging modalities to assess intracerebral pathology. CT is often the initial imaging in emergencies as it is quick, with no contraindications, and can identify hemorrhage. The use of MRI in acute stroke is increasing.

A study of the somatosensory network after stroke, using resting-state fMRI, has shown the strong associations between the interhemispheric network connectivity indices and stereognosis.

Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) help in the correlation of sensory impairments such as astereognosis and hemianesthesia with parietal lesions seen in imaging.
