Wide-awake Local Anesthesia No Tourniquet (WALANT) is an alternative to general anesthesia and tourniquet for undergoing surgery. General anesthesia is where the anesthesiologist sedates the patient (induces sleep) before the surgery starts in the operating room to reduce pain sensation. A tourniquet is a device that squeezes the arm to control bleeding. Instead, WALANT uses only tiny doses of lidocaine to decrease pain and epinephrine to minimize bleeding. Typically the injections take place thirty minutes before surgery starts.

The patient remains awake throughout the procedure. The surgeon asks the patient for feedback and to perform specific movements that help improve the repair. This technique is especially beneficial for patients with tendon injuries. Often a hand therapist will be present to assist with range-of-motion exercises and discuss future rehabilitation plans. Since the patient is awake, there are more opportunities to ask the surgeon questions and learn about the procedure.

WALANT can easily be performed in a surgery center or even in the surgeon's office. On the day of surgery, patients can have breakfast and drive themselves to their procedure. For patients that have severe medical conditions like congestive heart failure, WALANT may be a better alternative. Other benefits include more flexible scheduling and affordability. WALANT effectively treats many conditions affecting the hand, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger finger, and wrist fractures.
