It is encouraged that all practitioners who wish to use cervical manipulation should undertake a formal education program to decrease risks.

Preparation should begin with a thorough history and complete head-to-toe assessment to minimize the likelihood of complications arising from cervical manipulation. Patients should be thoroughly screened for all potential contraindications and precautions, preferably through screening methods focused on identifying patients who have contraindications to HVLA therapy and may be at risk of adverse outcomes.

Since HVLA therapy (OMT) is considered a procedure, proper consent should be obtained before the initiation of treatment.

Preparation starts with localizing the correct region in which a cervical somatic dysfunction exists. In order to establish this diagnosis, it is necessary to identify the specific cervical spine level in which the segment is causing severe pain on palpation or a restriction of motion. Once identified, the practitioner will engage that cervical level in both flexion and extension. The provider will then test the patient's ability to rotate and side bend each segment to the right and left. Once identifying the restricted barrier, for example, a C4 vertebra that is flexed, rotated left side bent left, the physician would take the restricted barrier into the opposite orientation. For this example, you would engage C4 extended rotated right and side bent right.

Patient positioning is ideal for optimal procedural outcomes. The patient should be supine, and the operator (physician) should be at the head of the table. Patients need to be as relaxed as possible through physical assessment. This is an essential component of treatment for patients to have optimal results and prevent any adverse outcomes. The importance of establishing a satisfactory patient-physician relationship and establishing a foundation of trust is imperative to positive outcomes.
