The diagnosis of LCA is only possible by histopathological examination. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is an option for splenic masses; however, it is not very specific and is not recommended given the risk of bleeding and tumor cell dissemination if the tumor is malignant.

Radiological imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography scan (CT scan) have not proven adequate in diagnosing littoral cell angioma, given that it is difficult to differentiate from other splenic neoplasms like angiosarcomas, lymphomas, metastatic tumors on imaging.
