Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is a colorless, volatile, non-inflammable liquid that is produced by the mixture of chlorine with chloroform in the presence of light. It is structurally a chlorinated hydrocarbon called tetrachloromethane (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry nomenclature/IUPAC name).

In the past, carbon tetrachloride was emplyed as a cleaning agent and degreaser in homes, industrial manufacturing, dry-cleaning textile laundries, in fire extinguishers, and also used as a precursor of refrigerants and propellants. Because of its highly toxic and harmful effects, most of its uses are presently banned. However, its use continues in some industries. Human toxicity is usually caused accidentally by inhalation of its vapors, dermal absorption following direct skin contact, or ingestion; it may also be ingested deliberately as a suicidal agent. CCl4 causes cellular damage in multiple organs, mostly in the liver, kidneys, and lungs.
