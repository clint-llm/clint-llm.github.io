In the United States, there are approximately 160,000 thoracolumbar spine fractures annually. The thoracolumbar junction is the second most common location of spinal injuries, following the cervical spine. About 50% of all spinal injuries outside ofÂ the cervical spine occur at the thoracolumbar junction.

Chance fractures often occur in children and young adults, with a male predominance. In a review of Chance fractures by Bernstein et al., the mean patient age was 26 years, with ages ranging from 9 to 54 years and male to female ratio of approximately 3 to 1.
