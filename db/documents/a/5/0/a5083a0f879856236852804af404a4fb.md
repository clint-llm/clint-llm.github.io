Emergency surgical treatments such as revascularization and fracture stabilization should come before considering hyperbaric oxygen treatments. In some less urgent cases, hyperbaric oxygen treatments may help the surgeon better demarcate viable from dead tissue and thus minimize tissue loss and reduce the risk of amputations. The decision to use and frequency of hyperbaric oxygen should be made in close collaboration with the surgeon and depends on the injury type, the injury severity, and patient host factors. It is best to use an objective grading system such as the Gustillo open-fracture crush injury grading system while adding a host factor function score that includes, age, smoking, steroid use, ambulation status, cardiovascular and kidney function. This improves patient selection and the treatment algorithm, with the idea that even milder type injuries in a compromised host benefit from hyperbaric oxygen as adjuvant therapy.[1] Utilization review of hyperbaric treatments is an important part of the clinical care of those patients and is best done in close collaboration with the surgical and hyperbaric team after a certain number of predetermined hyperbaric treatments.
