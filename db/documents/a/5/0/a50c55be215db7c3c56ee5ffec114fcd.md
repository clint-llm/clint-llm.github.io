The autonomic nervous system is responsible for maintaining the homeostatic environment of the body with adjustments affecting major organ systems such as neuronal, circulatory, respiratory, integumentary, digestive, and urinary. The autonomic nervous system divides into sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric divisions.

Muscarinic receptors mediate many functions of the parasympathetic nervous system. The muscarinic receptors are on various organs throughout the body. Receptors diffusely express on organs of the neuronal, cardiac, musculoskeletal, pulmonary, digestive, and urinary systems. As mentioned, different receptor subtypes exist on different organs, producing various effects. The overall function of the receptors aims to achieve the “rest and digest” function of the parasympathetic nervous system. While the sympathetic nervous system readies the body for “fight or flight,” the parasympathetic nervous system functions as the unconscious restorative and energy-conserving system. Therefore, many functions of muscarinic receptors may be referred to as opposing the action of the sympathetic nervous system. Receptors present on cardiac muscle cells receive innervation from the vagus nerve and act to slow the heart rate and decrease the force of contraction. Receptors function at the SA node, AV node, atria, and within the ventricles, resulting in a slowed heart rate, decreased conduction velocity, and a prolonged cardiac muscle refractory period.

Within the digestive system, receptor activation stimulates intestinal motility and digestive enzyme secretion. Receptor activation in the lungs leads to smooth muscle contraction, narrowing the airways, and increasing secretion production. Furthermore, muscarinic receptors are present throughout the central nervous system and have demonstrated important functions in both learning and memory. Animal models lacking the M1 receptor develop deficiencies in both cognition and long-term potentiation.
