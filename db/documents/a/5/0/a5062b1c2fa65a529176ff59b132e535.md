The diagnosis and management of TRALI is not simple and is best done with an interprofessional team that includes a hematologist, cardiologist, pulmonologist, internist, and a specialty trained nurse experienced with the care of these patients. TRALI can develop within 6 hours to 72 hours of blood transfusions that are rich in plasma. Despite suspected various hypotheses, it could certainly be prevented with the careful approach in blood transfusions, especially in those who are more vulnerable to acquire TRALI. Due to no definitive treatment, prevention is the best key to keep TRALI from occurring by treating underlying diseases first.

Nurses who administer blood should be aware of this syndrome as it may present with shortness of breath. At the first sign of symptoms, the blood transfusion should be discontinued, and the patient monitored in the ICU.

The outcome of patients with TRALI depends on age, the number of other organs involved, the need for mechanical ventilation, and response to treatment.
