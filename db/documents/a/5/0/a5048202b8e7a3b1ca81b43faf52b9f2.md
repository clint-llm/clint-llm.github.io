Anti-histamines have been the mainstay for the treatment of allergic conditions. Epinastine is a mast cell stabilizer as well as an anti-histaminic, which the FDA has approved for topical use to relieve various allergic conditions. Since epinastine does not possess any CNS toxicity, it is superior to other anti-histamines with sedative properties. An accurate diagnosis is necessary before prescribing epinastine. Any clinician can prescribe epinastine, and the patient must be monitored regularly for adverse outcomes. Patients should be encouraged to follow the treatment plan; this requires an interprofessional team effort from the clinicians (including specialists, NPs, PAs, and optometrists), nursing staff, and pharmacists, coordinating efforts and communicating across interprofessional lines to improve and enhance patient care outcomes.
