Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord is a disease affecting the lateral and posterior columns of the spinal cord, primarily due to demyelination. It can present in patients who are deficient in vitamin B12, producing hematological and neurological manifestations.

Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord can be caused by inadequate oral intake of vitamin B12, poor absorption of vitamin B12, or by the use of medications such as metformin, proton pump inhibitors, and nitrous oxide.  Unexplained anemia, coupled with neurological symptoms, should raise suspicions of subacute combined degeneration, and an evaluation investigating vitamin B12 deficiency in susceptible populations should be done.
