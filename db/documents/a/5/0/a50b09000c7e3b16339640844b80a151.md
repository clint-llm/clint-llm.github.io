The management of ovarian cystadenomas depends on the following factors

- Symptoms

- Size of the cyst

- Age of the patient

- Medical history

- Menopausal state of the patient

Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or ovarian cystectomy is the adequate treatment of ovarian cystadenomas.

Clinical recurrence is uncommon and reflects either incomplete resection or a new primary tumor.
