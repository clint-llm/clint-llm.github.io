Radicular pain is theorized to result from mechanical nerve compression leading to the production of inflammatory molecules and neurochemical mediators. In intervertebral disc herniations, these mediators include phospholipase A2, substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and calcitonin gene-related peptide, which are released from the nucleus pulposus. These molecules have a role in sensitizing the free nerve endings, nerve root, and dorsal root ganglion, precipitating neuropathic pain. Their presence may additionally produce changes in the ion functioning of sensory neurons that increase pain.
