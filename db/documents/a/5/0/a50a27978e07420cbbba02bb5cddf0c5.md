The differential diagnoses of hemorrhagic stroke are:

- Acute hypertensive crisis

- Pituitary apoplexy

- Cerebral venous thrombosis

- Dural sinus thrombosis

- Cervical artery dissection

- Reversible cerebral vasoconstrictive syndrome (RCVS)

- Hemorrhagic neoplasms

- Arterio-venous malformations

- Meningitis

- Acute subdural hematoma

- Hemorrhagic infarct

Imaging studies such as CT and MRI can rule out these entities.
