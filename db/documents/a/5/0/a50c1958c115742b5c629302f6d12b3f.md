The prognosis ofÂ chronic interstitial nephritis in agricultural communities depends on the degree of renal dysfunction (GFR reduction) at the time of diagnosis and treatment options for the underlying condition. It also depends on the patient's past medical history, comorbidity, and general health. The progression of renal dysfunction is relatively rapid, with end-stage renal disease occurring over 4 to 10 years.
