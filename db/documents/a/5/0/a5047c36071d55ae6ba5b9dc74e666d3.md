Toxicity does not happen as frequently with the transdermal form of scopolamine due to its extended-release nature. Data on the toxic dose of scopolamine in the tablet form is scattered. Reports exist that 10 mg a day can be lethal for children. In adults, consumption of more than 100 mg a day did not result in death. The other feared toxidrome of scopolamine overdose is an anticholinergic syndrome resulting in tachycardia, hallucinations, hyperthermia, and dry membranes. Physostigmine 1 to 4 mg IV can serve as an antidote in such severe cases. However, with the transdermal application, only minor side effects are most commonly observed.
