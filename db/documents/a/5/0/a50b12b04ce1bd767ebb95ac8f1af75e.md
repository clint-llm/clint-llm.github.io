It is vital to educate the patient regarding the importance and technique of subjective refraction. The patient should receive education on the need for refractive error correction and the importance of preventing amblyopia in pediatric patients. The need for regular spectacle wear should be emphasized, and then if needed, patients should understand the need for laser refractive correction in the future.

The patient should also be educated regarding timely follow-up and subjective refraction evaluation to detect changes in refractive error. Moreover, they should also be told they need Schiempflug imaging in cases of high cylindrical power and retinal assessment in subjects with high myopia.
