Megalocornea, also known as anterior megalophthalmos, X-linked megalocornea, and macrocornea, is a rare bilateral nonprogressive congenital defect that is characterized by an increased corneal diameter greater than 12.5 to 13 mm at birth and a deep anterior chamber with normal intraocular pressures.

There are two patterns of clinical presentation. Primary megalocornea is an isolated megalocornea with no additional ocular or systemic manifestations. The second clinical presentation is megalocornea with other associated ocular and systemic abnormalities. This article will focus on primary congenital megalocornea (hereafter referred to as megalocornea) and will discuss possible comorbid conditions and syndromes in the ‘differential diagnosis’ section.

Primary megalocornea was first described in 1869, but the genetic basis of this disease has only been elucidated in the past decade.
