Audiometry is useful to assess the extent of sensorineural hearing loss. Specific investigations into the vestibular system (e.g., evoked myogenic potentials, electronystagmography, and rotary chair tests) are not indicated in the acute phase of the disease. However, they can be useful in assessing long-term compensation and residual deficits.

The laboratory tests should be tailored to the patient's symptoms and differential diagnoses. If the patient presents with severe vomiting, then a urea and electrolytes panel should be performed to assess whether electrolyte replacement needs to be initiated. If bacterial meningitis is suspected, then cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures should be sent. Subsequently, consider HIV and syphilis serology in high-risk individuals or atypical presentations. Finally, consider autoimmune screens in patients with systemic symptoms or atypical presentations with negative serology.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) imaging may be useful in ruling out alternative pathology. 13% of acoustic neuromas present with sudden hearing loss, which can be diagnosed using an MRI. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (GdMRI) is extremely accurate in predicting if a patient with bacterial meningitis will subsequently develop hearing loss, a complication in 14% of cases.
