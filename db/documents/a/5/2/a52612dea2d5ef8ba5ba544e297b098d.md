The gold standard for diagnosing peroneal neuropathies is electrodiagnostic testing, which includes both nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography. In peroneal neuropathy, both the deep and superficial nerves tend to be affected. In the case of a single branch being affected, deep peroneal neuropathy tends to be more common than superficial peroneal neuropathy. The peroneal nerve's most common compression site is found at the fibular head/neck, where the nerve is most superficial. This activity describes the electrodiagnostic findings of nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography studies, as well as highlighting how interprofessional teams are critical to evaluating and managing peroneal neuropathies over the longterm.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for electrodiagnostic testing of peroneal neuropathy.
- Describe the nerve conduction study findings in a patient with peroneal neuropathy.
- Review the electromyographic findings in a patient with peroneal neuropathy.
- Outline the importance of communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with peripheral neuropathy.
