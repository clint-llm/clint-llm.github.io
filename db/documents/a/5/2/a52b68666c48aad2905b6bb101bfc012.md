The key clinical elements to diagnosing SCI-induced osteoporosis include recognizing the time since the original SCI injury, establishing a baseline BMD value via a DXA scan, and following these patients closely to monitor the progression of bone loss. A relevant differential diagnosis pattern would entail initially categorizing a patient based on the bone loss spectrum via the established WHO criteria

- Normal BMD = t-score of -1.0 or greater (i.e., within 1 standard deviation below normal, healthy control group reference values)

- Osteopenia = t-score between -1.0 and -2.5

- Osteoporosis = t-score below -2.5

Also relevant in the differential diagnosis is considering underlying pre-existing medical conditions and medication use which may have already predisposed the patient to compromised BMD levels. Finally, always keep a heightened clinical suspicion for spontaneous fragility fractures, especially in the most compromised patients with SCI.
