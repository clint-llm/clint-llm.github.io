Medullary breast carcinoma is a rare subtype of triple-negative breast cancer that has distinctive clinical, morphological, and molecular features. Management of medullary breast carcinoma needs an interprofessional approach involving a team that consists of a surgical oncologist, an oncologist, a pathologist, and a radiologist. After the treatment of medullary breast carcinoma, long-term follow up is necessary to detect local and distant relapse. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner must refer patients with suspected breast masses to a radiologist for further workup.

Medullary breast carcinoma requires an interprofessional team approach, including primary care providers, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. Breast care nurses assist in evaluation, patient education, and documentation for the team. Oncology nurses administer treatments, monitor patients, and report changes to the team. Oncologic pharmacists collaborate with oncologists reviewing the dose and drug interactions and educate patients about compliance and side effects. [Level 5]
