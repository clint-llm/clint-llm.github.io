Controversy exists over the etiology of Poland syndrome. It mostly occurs sporadically. However, three other theories about the development of Poland syndrome include genetic, teratogenic, or vascular compromise during fetal development as possible etiologies. There has been documentation that distant family members developed Poland syndrome supporting the theory that it may be genetically linked. Another theory is that Poland syndrome results from environmental or medication-induced teratogenic effects on a developing fetus. Researchers found a higher incidence in pregnant smokers compared to pregnant non-smokers during embryogenesis.

Other studies indicate medication-induced abortions for unwanted pregnancies with failed interruption of pregnancy as an induction factor of Poland syndrome. Some suggest vascular compromise during fetal development. These usually present with hypoplasia of subclavian or axillary vessels in Poland syndrome, which support the theory of a poor developing limb bud. This could be caused by many factors such as amniotic bands, tumors, edema, or aberrant muscle during the sixth and seventh weeks of embryogenesis.
