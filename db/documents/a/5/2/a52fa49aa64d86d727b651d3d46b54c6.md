Symptomatic patients and pregnant women, even if asymptomatic, should be treated for acute Q fever. The treatment is most effective if initiated within the first three days of symptoms onset.

Treatment regimens for acute Q fever:

- Children: Doxycycline 100mg/day for 10 to 14 days, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 8 to 12 mg/kg/day

- Adults: Doxycyline 100mg/day for 14 days (preferred); alternatives- fluoroquinolones, minocycline, TMP-SMX

- Pregnant: TMP-SMX (320mg to 1600mg) until the end of the 7 month

Fluoroquinolones can enter the cerebrospinal fluid and are preferred for Q fever meningoencephalitis. For chronic Q fever, a combination of doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine is given for at least 18 months.
