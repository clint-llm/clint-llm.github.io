Congenital nipple inversion is mainly diagnosed during a wellness regular physical by a pediatrician or general practitioner as the patient approaches puberty. Many inverted nipples present in pre-pubescent patients will resolve spontaneously during puberty. They do not tend to cause any problems then and are usually observed until puberty/adolescence for resolution. If they do not resolve with puberty, they will often persist, and repair may be indicated for breastfeeding, psychosocial, or cosmetic reasons in adulthood. Many patients come for correction/ treatment when faced with lactational difficulties. To grade the inversion, digital manipulation is generally attempted.

Pathological/acquired nipple inversion after puberty or breast development is more worrisome for malignancy or other abnormalities. This is generally associated with nipple discharge (serous/bloody), nipple erosion, or a breast lump. It is important to obtain a detailed personal and family history in both male and female patients of any breast malignancy, as well as any confounding trauma history to the breast or chest, as scarring and fat necrosis can mimic malignancy. The latter is not likely to result in nipple discharge.
