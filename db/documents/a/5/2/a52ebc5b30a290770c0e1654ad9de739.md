Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy in United States.

Incidence of alcoholic cardiomyopathy ranges from 1-2% of all heavy alcohol users. It is estimated, approximately 21-36% of all non-ischemic cardiomyopathies are attributed to alcohol. The prevalance of alcoholic cardiomyopathy in addiction units is estimated around 21-32 %. Overall data with regards to alcohol induced cardiomyopathy is insuffienct and does not illustrate significant available data.

Most common age population for ACM is males from age 30-55 with significant history of alcohol use for more than 10 years.  Females constitute roughly 14 % of cases of alcohol induced cardiomyopathy however lifetime exposure required for women to develop alcohol induced cardiomyopathy is less compared to men.

Mortality rates are higher for males compared to females and more in blacks compared to white population

Interactions between genetic and non-genetic factors, exposure to other cardiotoxic substances, or mineral deficiencies such as thiamine play an important role in determining progression of alcoholic cardiomyopathy
