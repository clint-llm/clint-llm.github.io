The application of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has grown exponentially across dentistry, impacting different specialties and fields. Cone beam computed tomography imaging provides accurate measurements, improves the localization of impacted teeth, gives us visualization of airway abnormalities, can be helpful to identify and quantify asymmetry, assess periodontal structures, identify endodontic problems, and is beneficial to view condylar positions and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) bony structures.

Cone beam computed tomography is an excellent option when indicated and one of the greatest new technologies that have been introduced into dentistry in recent years. Dental healthcare workers need to be aware of its indications and applications. Therefore, the utilization of CBCT should be restricted to situations where its benefits outweigh the potential risks, and its usage should be limited to cases where it is justifiable. This will lead to better patient outcomes.
