Initially, the evaluation of a patient with an intestinal perforation is most commonly performed by the emergency department physician. A thorough history and physical examination can suggest the diagnosis of perforation and help initiate appropriate diagnostic studies and therapeutic modalities. Early surgical consultation is recommended, regardless of whether operative intervention is warranted. Conservative management is occasionally an option, with close clinical surveillance. If surgery is necessary, direct communication between the surgeon and the anesthesia team is imperative to avoid complications associated with the induction of anesthesia. Close nursing care and monitoring are vital to for early recognition of patient deterioration. Discharge coordination is also important to direct the plan for discharge and arrange for post-hospital needs and care.
