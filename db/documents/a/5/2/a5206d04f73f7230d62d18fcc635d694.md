In primary spontaneous pneumothorax, the patient is minimally symptomatic, as otherwise healthy individuals tolerate physiologic consequences well. The most common symptoms are chest pain and shortness of breath. The chest pain is pleuritic, sharp, severe, and radiates to the ipsilateral shoulder. In SSP, dyspnea is more potent because of decreased underlying lung reserve.

The history of pneumothorax in the past is essential as recurrence is seen in 15-40% of cases. Recurrence on the contralateral side can also occur.

On examination, the following findings are noted

- Respiratory discomfort

- Increased respiratory rate

- Asymmetrical lung expansion

- Decreased tactile fremitus

- Hyperresonant percussion note

- Decreased intensity of breath sounds or absent breath sounds

In tension pneumothorax following additional findings are seen

- Tachycardia of more than 134 beats per minute

- Hypotension

- Jugular venous distension

- Cyanosis

- Respiratory failure

- Cardiac arrest

Some traumatic pneumothoraces are associated with subcutaneous emphysema. Pneumothorax may be difficult to diagnose from a physical exam, especially in a noisy trauma bay. However, it is essential to make the diagnosis of tension pneumothorax on a physical exam.
