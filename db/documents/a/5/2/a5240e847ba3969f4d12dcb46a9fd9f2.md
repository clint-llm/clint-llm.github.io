Complications from partial meniscectomy can include iatrogenic cartilage damage, inadequate meniscal resection, and infection, among others. The overall complication rate varies from 0.5% to 1.7% with meniscectomy.

Hemarthrosis is another complication seen after meniscectomy.

Long-term complications following partial meniscectomy include re-operation due to the development of osteoarthritis. In patients undergoing partial meniscectomy with degenerative meniscal tears, studies have shown the average delay to re-operation for total knee arthroplasty to be roughly 9 months.
