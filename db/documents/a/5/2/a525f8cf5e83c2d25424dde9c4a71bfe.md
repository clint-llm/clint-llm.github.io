The diagnosis of spider veins is a clinical one based on history and examination. There are no lab tests that are useful in the diagnosis of spider veins. Imaging studies can be helpful in the mapping of the venous system if chronic venous insufficiency is suspected. These include duplex ultrasound, contrast venography, and magnetic resonance venography (MRV).

Spider veins feature on the Clinical, Etiological, Anatomical, and Pathological (CEAP) classification system of chronic venous disease, which describes seven categories (C0 –C7).

- C0 - Absence of venous disease

- C1 - Telangiectasias and larger reticular veins.

- C2 - Varicose veins (diameter of 3 mm or more)

- C3 - Edema

- C4 - Changes in the skin and subcutaneous tissue: pigmentation (C4a), eczema (C4a), lipodermatosclerosis (C4b) or atrophic blanche (C4b)

- C5 - Healed venous ulcer

- C6 - Active venous ulcer

Formally, the definition of telangiectasia is a confluence of dilated intradermal venules of less than 1mm in caliber.

- Simple linear

- Spider (radiating from a central locus)

- Arborizing (arranged like branches on a tree)

- Papular (discrete round spots)
