Treatment should be guided by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy guidelines. Initial treatment should begin with non-pharmacologic interventions such as switching the patient’s prenatal vitamins to folic acid supplementation only, using ginger supplementation (250 mg orally 4 times daily) as needed and applying acupressure wristbands.

Second-line medications include antihistamines and dopamine antagonists such as dimenhydrinate 25 to 50 mg every 4 to 6 hours orally, diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg every 4 to 6 hours orally, prochlorperazine 25 mg every 12 hours rectally, or promethazine 12.5 to 25 mg every 4 to 6 hours orally or rectally. If the patient continues to experience significant symptoms without exhibiting signs of dehydration, metoclopramide, ondansetron, or promethazine may be given orally. In the case of dehydration, intravenous fluid boluses or continuous infusions of normal saline should be given in addition to intravenous metoclopramide, ondansetron, or promethazine. Electrolytes should be replaced as needed. Severe refractory cases of hyperemesis gravidarum may respond to intravenous or intramuscular chlorpromazine 25 to 50 mg or methylprednisolone 16 mg every 8 hours, orally or intravenously.
