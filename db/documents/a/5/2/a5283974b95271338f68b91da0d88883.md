**Type I pneumocytes**have three main functions.

- Facilitate gas exchange

- Maintain ion and fluid balance within the alveoli

- Communicate with type II pneumocytes to secrete surfactant in response to stretch.

**Type II pneumocytes**have four main functions.

- Produce and secrete pulmonary surfactant - surfactant is a vital substance that reduces surface tension, preventing alveoli from collapsing.

- Expression of immunomodulatory proteins that are necessary for host defense

- Transepithelial movement of water

- Regeneration of alveolar epithelium after injury

**Alveolar macrophages**play an essential role in our immune system. They collect inhaled particles from the environment, such as coal, silica, and asbestos, and microbes, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Alveolar macrophages have a receptor named toll-like receptor, which binds to another receptor on the surface of microbial cells, the pathogen-associated molecular receptor. This interaction facilitates the phagocytosis of the pathogen and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines to enhance the local immune response. Within the alveolar macrophage, engulfed microbes become fused with their lysosome to destroy the pathogen.
