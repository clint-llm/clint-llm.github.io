History and physical exam can be useful in differentiating various pathologies associated with fetal echogenic bowel. Prenatal history should focus on additional pregnancy risk factors (advanced maternal age, gestational diabetes, fetal growth restriction, polyhydramnios), other major and minor fetal anomalies, results of prior imaging and screening tests, past medical history, and comorbidities.

The postnatal examination should focus on detecting any congenital anomalies. A thorough abdominal exam can give clues such as palpable loops indicating bowel obstruction. The patency of the gastrointestinal tract should be confirmed.
