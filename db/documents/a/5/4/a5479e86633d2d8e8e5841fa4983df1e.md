Patients with suspected or confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma will need general laboratory workup for further risk score stratification. Laboratory testing will help to evaluate the severity of liver disease including hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypoprothrombinemia with the clinical inclusion of ascites and encephalopathy to classify according to the Child-Pugh assessment scale. The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) has issued diagnostic algorithms for solid liver lesions by size. US surveillance frequently identifies high-risk patients and is further characterized by dynamic contrasted-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or four-phase computer tomography (CT).

Liver cancer has multiple proposed prognostic staging systems, but no single system is considered ideal. The most commonly used is the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer system (four stages A to D) that includes a more robust evaluation of the performance status evaluation (0, 1, 2 or greater than 2), constitutional symptoms by the Child-Pugh stage (A, B, or C), and the Okuda system evaluation. The Okuda criteria include tumor size less than or greater than 50%, ascites clinically detectable or absent, albumin less than or greater than 3 mg/dL, bilirubin less than or greater than 3 mg/dL, assigning positive points that correlates with stages I, II, and III in untreated patients with median overall survival of (mOS) 8.3, 2.0, and 0.7 months, respectively. Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer system is divided into the following:

- Early stage (A) asymptomatic patients with tumors appropriate for radical therapies

- Intermediate stage (B) asymptomatic patients with multi-nodular hepatocellular carcinoma may benefit from chemoembolization

- Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer system advanced stage (C) symptomatic patient with vascular invasion, and/or extra-hepatic spread with preserved liver function could be treated with chemotherapy

- Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer system terminal stage D disease should be offered systemic palliative therapy.

Very early stage (0) and early stage (A) may be considered for resection or even liver transplant with a curative rate of 30% and 5-year survival 40% to 70%. After a complete resection for hepatocellular carcinoma, based upon the 2010 TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system, five-year survival rates are Stage I (55%), Stage II (37%) and Stage III (16%). Patient with advanced disease may benefit from prognostic survival evaluation by calculating the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score which sums points of each of the sub-scores (Child-Pugh stage, Tumor morphology uni-nodular versus multi-nodular and extension less than or greater than 50%, AFP less than or greater than 400, and portal vein thrombosis present or absent) with a mOS of 36, 22, 9, 7, and 3 months for patients in categories 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 to 6, respectively.
