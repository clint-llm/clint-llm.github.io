In adults, the most common benign hepatic lesion in adults is the hemangioma. However, focal nodular hyperplasia is the second most common accounting for approximately eight percent of all non-hemangiomatous liver lesions. Focal nodular hyperplasia can present as early as childhood; however, it disproportionately affects women more than men at a ratio of approximately 8 to 1.

The incidence of focal nodular hyperplasia is increased in females age 20 to 50, further suggesting that the condition may be linked to increased estrogen. In recent literature, oral contraceptives as a cause of developing of focal nodular hyperplasia are not proven. However, women who are on a daily oral contraceptive regimen display larger nodules that women who are not taking oral estrogen-based contraception.

Focal nodular hyperplasia has rarely presented in children. Most pediatric cases have been reported in patients with a history of chemotherapy, malignancy, or hematopoietic stem cell therapy. However, Baylor University Medical Center reported a case of focal nodular hyperplasia in a healthy 3-year-old female with no pertinent past medical history. In this instance, the patient underwent surgical resection of a palpable abdominal mass for what oncologists believed to be a hepatic malignancy. After histological evaluation, it was determined that this patient had focal nodular hyperplasia.
