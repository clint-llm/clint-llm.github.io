The genus Nocardia is an aerobic actinomycete, catalase-positive, gram-positive bacillus, with a branching filamentous form that can cause pulmonary infection (most common), primary cutaneous infection and also dissemination to other sites. Typically, Nocardia is an opportunistic pathogen that primarily affects immunosuppressed patients. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of Nocardia infection and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify patients at high risk of developing nocardiosis.
- Summarize the clinical presentations of nocardiosis based upon the infection site.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for nocardiosis.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance nocardiosis treatment and improve outcomes.
