Acrochordons (fibroepithelial polyps, skin tags, papillomas) are common benign neoplasms of the skin, often associated with obesity. These small pedunculated lesions are frequently a nuisance for patients, typically developing around the neck, axilla, and groin areas. They may bother patients because of associated symptoms such as itching, pain, and rubbing against clothes or simply because of their appearance. There may be a familial predisposition for developing these lesions, as well as the established association with obesity and insulin resistance. This activity reviews the diagnosis and management of these polyps, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients affected by these lesions.

**Objectives:**
- Review the appearance and clinical features of an acrochordon.
- Histopathologic diagnosis is not routinely used to evaluate acrochordons. Identify cases where it should be considered.
- Identify the treatment options for patients presented with acrochordons.
-  a collaborative, interprofessional team approach to caring with patients bothered by acrochordons.
