The management of acute leukemia is by a multidisciplinary team that includes an oncologist, internist, infectious disease expert, and a hematologist. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner may be responsible for follow up after treatment and report back to the interdisciplinary team. Despite improvements in supportive care, death resulting from treatment toxicity remains a challenge. It is important to watch out for Tumor Lysis Syndrome which occurs when chemotherapy causes cancer cells to lyse releasing certain intracellular elements such as potassium, calcium, uric acid, and phosphorus. These elements, in large numbers, resulting in toxicity that can often lead to renal failure. Pretreatment with fluids and steroids typically prevents Tumor Lysis Syndrome. However, if it occurs, aggressive fluid therapy is the treatment.

Even after treatment, Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia can come back (relapse). Relapses can occur as far back as 21 years. IT is important to address other issues associated with cancer treatment in a young child including providing psychological support to child, parents, and family.
