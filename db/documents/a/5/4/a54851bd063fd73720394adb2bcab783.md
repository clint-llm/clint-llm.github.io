There is a rapid decline in renal function over weeks to months, with early clinical features usually non-specific. Sometimes hemoptysis and shortness of breath may be the first clinical feature.

- Anti-GMB disease may present with pulmonary involvement in the form of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and patients present with shortness of breath, cough, and hemoptysis, along with nephritis, hematuria, and edema.

- The extrarenal manifestations suggest the presence of the immune complex disorders or ANCA vasculitis include:

- General: fever, night sweat, weight loss, arthralgia

- Oral: mucosa ulceration.

- Eye: scleritis

- ENT: hearing impairment, otitis, epistaxis, nasal drainage, sinusitis, nasal cartilage necrosis.

- Respiratory: shortness of breath, cough, hoarseness of voice, tracheal or bronchial ulceration/stenosis, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage, infiltrate.

- GI: abdominal pain secondary toÂ ischemia, infarction, pancreatitis.

- CNS: mononeuritis multiplex, CNS vasculitis, so patient present with numbness, weakness, blurry vision, stroke.

- Skin: palpable purpura, ulcer, livedo reticularis

If not addressed promptly, there is a progressive and rapid loss of renal function and, eventually, renal failure. Once renal failure presents, the patient can have fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting, decreased urine output (oliguria).
