**Treatment of Red Lesions (Infantile Hemangiomas, Capillary Malformations, Arteriovenous Malformations, Pyogenic Granulomas)**-

The flash pulsed/ pump dye laser (FPDL) has become a mainstay in treating red lesions, including infantile hemangiomas, arteriovenous malformations, capillary malformations, and pyogenic granulomas. Its 595nm wavelength targets the red chromophore, oxyhemoglobin. The FPDL is most useful for superficial lesions, as its depth of penetration is only 1.2mm.

Multiple treatments may be necessary to fade the red pigment in a lesion sufficiently.

**Treatment of Blue Lesions (Venous Malformations, Arteriovenous Malformations)**

The most commonly used laser in the treatment of venous malformations is the Neodymium: yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd: YAG) laser. The Nd: YAG laser, having a wavelength of 1064, targets deoxyhemoglobin as its chromophore. Deoxyhemoglobin, which is blue, is prevalent in venous blood.

If the skin is being treated, then the Gentle YAG laser can be used. The Gentle YAG laser is an Nd: YAG laser which delivers a cryogen spray as a coolant for the epidermis, which is susceptible to heat-induced injury. Settings for the Gentle YAG laser can be varied, as the laser power can be delivered over various spot sizes and duration, but generally range from 130 – 200 joules per centimeter squared.

In mucosal treatments, a cryogen is not used. The laser is delivered on a fiber that is placed approximately 0.5 cm above the target tissue, and power is delivered for variable durations, generally from 0.5 to 1.5 seconds. The visible shrinking of the tissue involved in the malformation can be noted immediately upon treatment. The treated areas will develop small, white spots, which should not overlap. Separating the spots will help to prevent the sloughing of the mucosa. Different mucosal lesions can handle different laser power; oral lesions should be treated with 25 W to 30 W, while laryngotracheal lesions should be treated with lower settings between 18 W to 20 W. It should be kept in mind that venous malformations, as other pigmented lesions, generally require repeated treatments.

**Tattoo Removal**- The most common lasers used today in tattoo removal are the Q-switched (denoting fast-pulsed) 694-nm ruby laser, the Q-switched 755-nm alexandrite laser, the 1,064-nm Nd: YAG laser, and the 532-nm Nd: YAG laser. The different lasers used when removing tattoos can target different colors that have been deposited in the skin.

**Treatment of Pigmented Nevi**- Lasers commonly used in nevus removal can be either specific or nonspecific. Pigment nonspecific lasers target water as their chromophore and resurface the entire epidermis. They are outside the scope of this summary.
