A longitudinal study surveying anxiety symptoms in 242 participants with a mean age of 10 years found that 56% had an elevated SCARED score at 1-year follow-up and 32% had elevated scores at 3-year follow up. Eight percent of the participants in this study had a fluctuating course.

Most studies report that anxiety disorders tend to have a chronic and unremitting course if left untreated.

A 2013 meta-analysis states that a childhood diagnosis of SAD significantly increases the risk of panic disorder and other anxiety disorders in adulthood. The researchers found no association between SAD in childhood with major depression or substance use disorders in adulthood.
