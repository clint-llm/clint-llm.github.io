Due to its position and given the lack of surface markers on the floor of the fourth ventricle, the area postrema is challenging to localize during micro-neurosurgical procedures. However, as it may serve as an important landmark during procedures involving the brainstem, there has been some success with fluorescence-enhanced inspection of the fourth ventricle. This success is possible due to the absence of a blood-brain-barrier, and thus fluorescein may flow freely in the interstitial space, revealing the area postrema. The normal anatomical appearance of area postrema appears as two short and thick leaves that merge at the midline.
