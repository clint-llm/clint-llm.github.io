Fibric acids are FDA indicated to treat patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson types IIa and IIb). In adults, they reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Fibric acids should be used in conjunction with restricting cholesterol and fat intake and exercise if the response to diet and nonpharmacological interventions alone has been inadequate. The clinician should rule out secondary causes of hyperlipidemia before initiating therapy with a fibric acid. The patient should receive the drug for at least 2 to 3 months before assessing for efficacy. Fibric acid derivatives are also FDA indicated to treat adults with high serum triglycerides (Fredrickson types IV and V). Hypertriglyceridemia manifests itself in cardiovascular disease and pancreatitis.
