The management of hyperkalemia is multidisciplinary because of its potential to induce cardiac arrest. Once hyperkalemia is diagnosed, the primary condition must be treated. If the hyperkalemia is severe, the nephrologist should be consulted. If ECG changes are present, a cardiology consult should be made. Treatment to lower the high potassium should be ongoing. These patients need cardiac monitoring 24/7 until the hyperkalemia has resolved. The majority of patients have an excellent prognosis. However, patients with chronic disorders like end-stage renal failure may require continual blood work to monitor potassium.
