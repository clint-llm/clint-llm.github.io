The exact mechanism of mesalamine is unknown. However, the hypothesis is that it modulates the inflammatory response derived from the cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase pathways, thus decreasing the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Other potential mechanisms include interference with the production of inflammatory cytokines via reducing the activity of nuclear factor­ κB (NF-κB) and inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), cellular functions of mucosal lymphocytes, macrophages, and natural killer cells. Mesalamine has also been postulated as a free radical scavenger and an antioxidant.
