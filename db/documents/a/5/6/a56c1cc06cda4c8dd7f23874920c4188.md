The LCA typically arises just distal to the left cusp of the aortic valve to supply blood to the left portion of the heart. After its take-off from the aorta, the LCA splits into the left circumflex (LCx) artery and the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The LCx supplies the lateral portion of the left atrium and ventricle, while the LAD supplies the anterior portion of the left ventricle and the anterior 2/3 of the interventricular septum.
