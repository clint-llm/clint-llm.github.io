The immunohistochemical and histopathological findings in the herald patch and fully developed lesions of pityriasis rosea are very similar. Histological findings include focal or confluent parakeratosis, epidermal hyperplasia and spongiosis, exocytosis of lymphocytes, and extravasation of erythrocytes along with a moderately dense perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the superficial dermis. Immunohistochemical analysis usually reveals an increased CD4+ to a CD8+ ratio of T lymphocytes and increased numbers of Langerhans cells also have been observed in specimens.
