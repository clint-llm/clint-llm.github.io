The acromioclavicular joint is a diarthrodial joint defined by the lateral clavicle articulating with the acromion process as it projects anteriorly off the scapula. The AC joint is a plane type synovial joint, which under normal physiological conditions allows only gliding movement. As it attaches the scapula to the thorax, it allows an additional range of motion to the scapula and assists in arm movement such as shoulder abduction and flexion. It also enables the transmission of forces from the upper arm to the rest of the skeleton.

The AC joint is surrounded by a capsule and lined by a synovial membrane. In between the osseous portions lies an intra-articular cartilaginous disk. Lastly, the articulating surfaces are lined with fibrocartilage, as opposed to hyaline cartilage.

Three main ligaments stabilize the joint. The acromioclavicular ligament (AC) has both superior, inferior, anterior, and posterior components. The superior and posterior ligaments are the strongest, and it mainly serves to provide horizontal stability. The coracoclavicular ligamentsÂ (CC) complex consists of the conoid and trapezoid ligaments. They insert on the posteromedial and anterolateral region of the undersurface of the distal clavicle, respectively. It mainly serves to provide vertical stability. The coracoacromial ligament is a strong triangular band that connects the coracoid process to the acromion and also provides vertical stability.
