Current Guidelines

- For mild brain injury, imaging studies are not recommended. One should weigh the risks of radiation exposure and sedation in children compared to the benefits of imaging.

- Use age-appropriate scales to make the diagnosis and make appropriate referrals.

- Assess risks for the recovery

- Educate the caregiver/parent on appropriate activity after the injury

- Parents should encourage the child to return to non-sporting activity gradually after 2 to 3 days.

- No medication can speed up recovery
