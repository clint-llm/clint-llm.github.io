**Summary of Recommendations for Pharmacotherapy in HF by the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline Update**

Class I Recommendations

- Evidence-based specific beta-blockers (carvedilol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol succinate) with one of the following:

- Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) 
- Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) 
- Angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI)

- Chronic symptomatic HFrEF NYHA class II or III, replace an ACEI or ARB with an ARNI

Class IIa

- Ivabradine for patients with symptomatic HF while on goal-directed medical therapy for chronic HFrEF with LVEF less than or equal to 35% and in sinus rhythm with a heart rate of at least 70 bpm at rest.

Class III

- ARNI should not be given with or within 36 hours of the last dose of an ACEI or in patients with a history of angioedema

**The Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) Guidelines for Management of Acute Decompensated HF**

- Oral therapy should be continued in most patients with HFrEF and up titrated as needed.

- Continue angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and beta-blockers during treatment of acute exacerbations.

- Only consider withholding beta-blockers in patients hospitalized after a recent beta-blocker initiation.

- Loop diuretics remain the cornerstone of therapy. (Class I recommendation)

- Vasodilators (e.g., nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, or nesiritide) can be used as adjuvant therapies in patient with systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg.

- Inotropic agents can be used short-term in patients with hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) and the patient is symptomatic from hypotension.
