Etiology of chronic anemia based on mean corpuscular volume (MCV is the average size of RBC).

******Microcytic Anemia (MCV less than 80 femtoliters [fL])**

- Iron deficiency anemia: Most common cause of anemia

- Thalassemia

- Anemia of chronic disease

- Sideroblastic anemia

**Macrocytic Anemia (MCV greater than 100 fL)**

- Vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency

- Alcoholism and liver disease

- Myelodysplastic syndromes

- Drug-induced

- Hypothyroidism

**Normocytic Anemia (MCV 80 to 100 fL)**

- Bone marrow suppression (aplastic anemia and myelophthisic anemia)

- Anemia of chronic disease

Some conditions can present in more than 1 classification. For example, early iron deficiency can be normocytic. Anemia of chronic disease is mostly normocytic but can be microcytic too. Hemolytic anemia
