**Tips for Interventionalists**

An interventionalist could be related to interventional cardiology, interventional radiology, neurosurgery, and orthopedic surgery. Irrespective of the field of specialty primary operator is responsible for controlling radiation exposure while performing procedures.

- The risk-benefit ratio of X-ray use has to be considered for every patient and every procedure. Although ionizing radiation is most commonly used in interventional procedures yet, every effort should be made to minimize radiation exposure by using non-radiologic modalities (e.g., ultrasound imaging) and using the lowest possible radiation dose during the procedure. Recent advancement in imaging modalities ensures the provision of low dose modes. The use of half-dose mode ensures a reduction of the entrance radiation dosage to half without affecting imaging quality.

- Preferable use of pulse mood instead of continuous fluoroscopy should be sought whenever possible.

- Any intervention that reduces the radiation scattering subsequentially reduces the health care worker’s radiation exposure. Gantry position is a major determinant of radiation scattering. Scattering of radiation is maximum when the gantry position is > 30 degrees in left or right anterior oblique angulation or greater than 15 degrees in cranial angulation.
