**Syphilis**

Untreated syphilis can lead to cardiovascular and neurological syphilis. These complications are irreversible, as the treatment of syphilis can prevent further damage but not repair the one that is already done. Patients with a high titer of secondary syphilis, who are being treated with penicillin, can develop a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. The reaction occurs within 24 hours of treatment when the dying organisms release inflammatory cytokines and cause headaches, muscle pain, fatigue, fever, and tachycardia.

**Gonorrhea**

Undiagnosed or untreated urogenital gonorrheal infections can ascend, causing severe reproductive complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility.

**Tuberculosis**

Immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV, have weaker immune systems, making it harder for the body to control the tubercular bacteria. Drug-resistant bacteria can spread infections throughout the body and further complications, including spinal pain, meningitis, and miliary tuberculosis.

**Scarlet Fever **

Untreated scarlet fever can lead to rheumatic fever, which affects the heart, joints, skin, and brain. The risk of having these complications is higher in children, and they usually develop 2 to 3 weeks after the initial infection. Scarlet fever can also lead to renal complications, such as post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis; this is also more common in children than adults and can occur within a few weeks of throat infection or 3 to 6 weeks after GAS skin infection.
