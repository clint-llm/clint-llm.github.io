Bedside investigations such as basic observations and routine blood tests are likely to be unremarkable in the case of a benign, non-infected cystic hygroma. If the patient has developed an abscess, this may cause a raised white cell count with raised inflammatory markers. Aspiration of the lump in combination with imaging is the gold standard for diagnosing cystic hygromas.

Various imaging modalities like ultrasonography, computerized tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging are used to confirm the diagnosis. Ultrasonography is the least invasive of all and typically shows multicystic lesions with internal septations.

Occasionally karyotyping might be done in case of any doubt of chromosomal disorder.
