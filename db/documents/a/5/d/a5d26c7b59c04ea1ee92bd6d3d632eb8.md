Iatrogenic causes of injury to the vagus nerve and its branches can lead to a unilateral paresis or paralysis of the vocal fold. Recurrent laryngeal nerve damage can be a complication in operations such as thyroid surgery where unilateral damage leads to hoarseness or swallowing difficulties. Damage to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve can lead to an inability to increase pitch as the cricothyroid is unable to lengthen the vocal folds. Bilateral damage to the nerves, while extremely uncommon, can have severe sequelae of respiratory distress (secondary to failure of abduction and resultant midline position of the vocal folds) and occasionally can lead to a tracheostomy.

During endotracheal intubation, the endotracheal tube passes through the vocal folds, and the end ultimately rests in the subglottic larynx.  Ischemic damage from the pressure of the endotracheal tube through weaknesses in the cartilaginous framework can occur and ultimately cause sequela to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, resulting in apraxia that usually resolves with time.  Further insults of the passage of the endotracheal tube through the larynx involve damage or hemorrhage to the vocal folds and possible glottic and subglottic inflammation and subsequent scar formation.  This scar formation may obstruct the airway and lead to distress in the long-term.
