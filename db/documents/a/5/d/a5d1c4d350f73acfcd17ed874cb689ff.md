The nurses involved in patient care should monitor the following:

- Monitor hourly CSF drainage

- Ensure CSF oscillation inside the tubes

- Confer no soakage of the wound

- Ensure the correct height of EVD

- Zeroing of the EVD height at the level of the foramen of Monro or tragus of the ear

- Stringent neurological monitoring of the patient

- Monitor hourly ICP

There needs to be a strict provision of the recommended checklists.

Maintaining a sterile environment and stringent monitoring for foreseeing and timely troubleshooting complications are the cornerstones in the care bundle approach to managing these patients.
