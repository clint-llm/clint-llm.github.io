Glomus jugulare patients may exhibit non-specific signs and symptoms such as tinnitus and decreased hearing. At first, diagnosis may be challenging to recognize. While the otolaryngologist is almost always involved in the care of patients with glomus jugulare tumors, it is essential to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a neurosurgeon, neuro otologist, and neurologist. Interventional neuroradiologists are necessary to make proper diagnostic evaluations and sometimes contribute to the management of these lesions, including interval assessment and follow-up. Nurses will monitor the patient's vital signs and assist with the education of the patient and family.

The pharmacist will ensure that the patient is on the right analgesics, antiemetics, and appropriate antibiotics during the postoperative period. The neuroradiologist also plays a vital role in determining the cause. If the patient undergoes preoperative embolization, endovascular specialists such as endovascular neurosurgeons, interventional neurologists, or interventional neuroradiologists will also play a vital role in the care and treatment of the patient. For radiation treatment such as stereotactic radiosurgery, medical physicists, and radiation oncologists are also involved in the decision-making process.

The outcomes of glomus jugulare tumors depend on their extension and involved structures. However, to improve outcomes, prompt consultation with an interprofessional group of specialists is recommended. An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach to postoperative care can help achieve the best possible outcomes. Collaboration, shared decision making, and communication are crucial elements for a good result.
