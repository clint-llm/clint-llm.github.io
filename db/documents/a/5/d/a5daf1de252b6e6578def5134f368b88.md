The scaphoid is the largest of the eight carpal bones.

The majority of fractures (approximately 65%) occur at the waist, with a quarter at the proximal third and 10% at the distal third.

The incidence of avascular necrosis carries a strong association with the location of the fracture; the proximal segment has a 100% rate of AVN, reducing to 33% at the distal segment of the scaphoid.
