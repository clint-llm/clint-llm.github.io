The predisposition to thromboembolic disease is multifactorial. Individual patient factors, current disease state, recent or planned surgical procedures, and underlying hematologic disorders all add up to give a patient’s risk of VTE at that particular time. Patient-related factors include age over 40 years, obesity, the presence of varicose veins, and immobility. The use of oral-contraceptive medications and smoking increases the risk of VTE, as well.

Multiple risk assessment models have now been developed to identify those at the highest risk of hospital-acquired VTE and to provide appropriate thromboprophylaxis for these patients. The Caprini model was the first quantitative VTE risk assessment model to be validated and have worldwide use. The Brigham and Women's Hospital Model (Kucher model), the Padua model, Roger’s model, the Intermountain model, the IMPROVE model, and the Premier model have since undergone development and validation.
