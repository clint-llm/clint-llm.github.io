The use of fentanyl is contraindicated in patients in the following situations:

- After operative interventions in the biliary tract, these may slow hepatic elimination of the drug.

- With respiratory depression or obstructive airway diseases (i.e., asthma, COPD, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity hyperventilation, also know as, Pickwickian syndrome)

- With liver failure

- With known intolerance to fentanyl or other morphine-like drugs, including codeine, or any components in the formulation

- With known hypersensitivity (i.e., anaphylaxis) or any common drug delivery excipients (i.e., sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide).

The drug fentanyl should not be used concomitant with certain medications such as CYP3A4 inhibitors like macrolide antibiotics or azole-antifungal agents, and protease inhibitors may increase plasma concentrations of fentanyl, extending the opioid drug action and exacerbating the opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD). On the other hand, the cessation of a CYP3A4 inducer medication (i.e., carbamazepine, phenytoin) in patients treated with fentanyl citrate injections may potentially increase fentanyl plasma concentrations prolonging the opioid adverse reactions.Â If the patient has used a monoamine oxidase inhibitor in the previous 14 days, fentanyl is contraindicated.
