**Physical Exam**

- Skin turgor: This is assessed by pinching the skin between the forefinger and the thumb and then releasing it. The longer the time taken by the skin to return to its normal contour can indicate dehydration.

- Blood pressure: In dehydration, the total water volume is reduced, and therefore, it may lead to low blood pressure. Also, there may be reflex tachycardia.

- Mucous membranes examination: Dehydration can manifest as dry mucous membranes.

**Laboratory Tests**

- Arterial blood gas and basic metabolic panel: This is an important test to provide information about the patient's acid-base status and the concentrations of the major ions that mainly contribute to plasma osmolality.

- Complete blood count with differentials: To measure the blood concentration (hematocrit). It indicates changes to the fluid status inside the vasculature if it is increased or decreased.

- Urinalysis: This can help identify nephrotic syndromes by examining the number of electrolytes and proteins in the urine.

- Water deprivation test: The patient will be deprived of fluid for 8 hours, and his urine will be collected to be analyzed for osmolality and electrolytes, and then there will be an ADH challenge. The effects of subsequent urine collection will also undergo analysis, determining the cause of DI in the patient.
