Contraindications to entropion repair include patients who are unable to tolerate the procedure. In addition, medical management of any underlying etiology, such as autoimmune or connective tissue disease, must be optimized before a surgical repair is considered. Uncontrolled inflammation or infection worsens the prognosis, increases the risk of complications, and promotes the progression of the condition.

Patients with irreversible vision loss in the affected eye may not require repair as urgently as those with some degree of vision. However, entropion repair may still be indicated for pain relief or other symptom control.
