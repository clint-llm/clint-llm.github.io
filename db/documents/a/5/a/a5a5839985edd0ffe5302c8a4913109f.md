Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH), while a relatively rare disease process, poses a diagnostic dilemma as it is misdiagnosed or often missed entirely. Due to the rarity of the disease, there is a lack of ongoing prospective studies. Further studies, including case reviews, from multiple providers and facilities, would be beneficial to patients with ongoing IPH and those diagnosed in the future.

In patients with known IPH, early recognition of recurrence or exacerbations by health care professionals can improve outcomes and prevent further morbidity and mortality. It is crucial to approach patients with IPH with an interprofessional team of specialists, including primary care providers, hospitalists, and a pulmonologist, through the entire disease process from an acute event to outpatient follow-up. Interprofessional team collaboration is important in the optimal treatment of patients with this condition.
