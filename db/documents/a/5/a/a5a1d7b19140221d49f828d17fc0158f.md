The biceps femoris tendon rupture usually develops following sudden knee hyperextension with concomitant hip flexion which can be encountered in running athletes. The most common sport associated with biceps femoris tendon injury is football (soccer). Some case series reported that the injury developed while playing hockey, jogging, and water skiing.

**Risk Factors**

- Previous biceps femoris tendon injury increases the chance of a new injury by 6 folds. This is mainly due to the weak scar tissue increasing the chances of recurrence.

- Sharp training without enough warm-up.

- Weak hamstrings relative to quadriceps with a ratio < 0.6

- Unequal hamstring strength between both lower limbs with a difference greater than 15%

- Limited hip extension.

- Leg length discrepancy with the shorter leg has tighter hamstrings.
