Glucagon and insulin work together to maintain euglycemia and glucose transport to tissues. Insulin is a peptide hormone secreted by beta cells of the pancreas and maintains blood glucose by allowing the intracellular transfer of glucose. Insulin also exerts its effect by affecting carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism. Pre-proinsulin becomes proinsulin while it is being transferred through the endoplasmic reticulum. Proinsulin is converted to insulin and C-peptide by an enzyme complex on the outside membrane of the Golgi complex. The ratio of insulin to glucagon affects the degree of phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of the relevant enzymes like glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase.

The blood glucose levels determine whether glucagon or insulin is activated or inhibited. Low plasma glucose stimulates glucagon secretion, which in turn promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to normalize plasma glucose levels. Excessive glucagon might result from a tumor in the tail or the body of the pancreas, potentially leading to the glucagonoma syndrome, comprising weight loss, necrolytic migratory erythema (NME), diabetes, and mucosal abnormalities including stomatitis, cheilitis, and glossitis.
