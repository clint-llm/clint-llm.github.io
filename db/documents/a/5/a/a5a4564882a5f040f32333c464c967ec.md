When a pregnant patient in the third trimester of pregnancy or immediate postpartum <7 days of birth presents with the above symptoms of HELLP syndrome and new-onset hypertension or proteinuria is noted, the following laboratory tests are needed to establish the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome:

- Complete blood count

- Peripheral smear

- Liver function tests:aspartate aminotransferase (AST),alanine aminotransferase (ALT),bilirubin

- Creatinine

If liver function tests are elevated, obtain haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and coagulation studies to include fibrinogen, prothrombin (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Tennessee classification is used to diagnose HELLP syndrome and requires the presence of all three criteria.

1) Hemolysis confirmed with at least 2 of the findings:

- Peripheral smear with schistocytes and burr cells

- Serum bilirubin >1.2 mg/dl

- Low serum haptoglobin(<25mg/dl) or LDH> two times the upper level of the normal.

- Severe anemia with hemoglobin <8 to 10 g/dl depending on the pregnancy stage, unrelated to blood loss.

2) Elevated liver enzymes: AST or ALT > 2 times the upper level of normal.

3) Low platelets: <100,000 cells/microL.

Mississippi classification is sometimes used to subclassify patients with HELLP syndrome.

**Platelet Count**

**(cells/microL)**

**LDH**

**(IU/L)**

**AST or ALT**

**(IU/L)**

≤50,000



>50,000 to ≤100,000



>100,000 to ≤150,000



Patients meeting a few of the above criteria are considered to have partial HELLP syndrome and may progress to meet all criteria and hence should be monitored carefully.

HELLP syndrome mainly involves platelet activation without affecting clotting factors, and hence patients will have normal PT, PTT, and fibrinogen. Disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC) may co-exist if PT and PTT are prolonged or if fibrinogen is low.
