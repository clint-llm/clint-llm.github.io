Healthcare systems frequently need to create new clinical spaces to support changes in healthcare delivery. They often allocate significant resources to accomplish this. Opening these new spaces to the demands of medical practice has many challenges. Creating a simulation program to evaluate a new clinical space can help to ensure successful implementation. Forming an interprofessional team including front-line clinical staff, patient and family representatives, patient safety experts, quality officers, informatics specialists, architects, construction and facilities personnel, supply chain specialists, and environmental and safety services creates a realistic team that will be directly involved in the use of the new clinical space. Executive, administrative, and departmental leaders provide invaluable support and resource allocation while offering insight into various drivers, regulations, interdependencies, and overall vision. This interprofessional team will also help foster and maintain accountability throughout the simulation development and execution to provide meaningful output.
