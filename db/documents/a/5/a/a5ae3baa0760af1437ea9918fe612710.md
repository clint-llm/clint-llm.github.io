The physicians working in children's healthcare need alertness to detect errant growth rates and provide patient-centered interventions. These kids require long term monitoring, documentation in the growth charts, and physicians' judgment of employing growth hormone therapy. Regular counseling sessions help to educate the patient and family members and improve the outcomes. The psychologist and psychiatrist may need to intervene in children facing psychosocial stressors, eating disorders, and other mental illnesses.
