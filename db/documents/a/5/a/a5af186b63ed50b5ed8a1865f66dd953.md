Besides a detailed history and physical examination of patients whom PTLD is considered, the investigations include:

- Complete blood cell count (CBC) to evaluate unexplained anemia, thrombocytopenia or leukopenia

- Comprehensive chemistry panel

- Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to evaluate for tumor lysis syndrome.

- Urine analysis for Monoclonal protein, hyperuricemia

- EBV Status of recipient and donor

- Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) testes: EBV IgM, EBV IgG, EBV viral load (PCR). Also, serial EBV quantitative PCR measurement (that is rising) is more important and valuable than single positive EBV quantitative PCR. Negative EBV PCR does not exclude the possibility of PTLD.

- Radiological studies include computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positive positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to evaluate spread.

- Lumbar puncture with cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis (EBV PCR in CSF fluid) in patients with PTLD with CNS involvement

Histopathologic examination of the tumor can only determine the definitive diagnosis.
