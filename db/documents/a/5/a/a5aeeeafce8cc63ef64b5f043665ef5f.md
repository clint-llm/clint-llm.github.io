Bag-mask ventilation is a very useful technique when encountering patients in respiratory distress. the technique is commonly used by EMS, anesthesiologist, ICU nurses, respiratory therapists, and intensivists. The technique can be life-saving and is relatively much easier than intubation. When done well, the patient can be oxygenated until an anesthesiologist can intubate the patient. an interprofessional approach will provide the best care for the patient. [Level V]
