Tarlov cysts are often overlooked due to several factors. This can lie with the physician or radiologist responsible for interpreting the imaging, as Tarlov cysts are considered clinically irrelevant, and other degenerative spine conditions are usually blamed as the reason for the patient's symptoms. It is also difficult to use an objective measure to ascertain that Tarlov cysts are the reason for symptoms. And when imaging or electromyography is used to try to confirm, they are often limited to L1 - S1 nerve roots.

Treatment is therefore also controversial, but methods to treat exist. Careful selection of levels and reasons for symptoms is crucial to maximizing treatment effectiveness. Recurrence of cysts and symptoms may occur despite initial effective treatment and must be highlighted to manage patient expectations. This, therefore, would require an interprofessional team approach - usually comprising of a pain specialist, spinal surgeon, specialist nurses, family medicine doctor (including PAs and NPs), and the patient.
