Colesevelam has relatively few monitoring needs. While the drug's desired effect is easily attainable without monitoring, the real monitoring that is necessary is with concomitantly administered drugs. Colesevelam primarily has been shown to decrease levels of fat-soluble vitamins as the drug tends to cause steatorrhea and the malabsorption of these vitamins. Patients with known deficiencies of these vitamins should understand to take their supplements either an hour before or about four hours after the administration of colesevelam.

In addition to fat-soluble vitamins, studies have shown that patients with hypothyroidism that get started on colesevelam show an increase in TSH levels. This increase indicates that colesevelam causes a decreased absorption of levothyroxine. To counter this, healthcare providers should monitor the patient's TSH levels while on this drug and advise patients to take their levothyroxine four hours afterÂ taking colesevelam.
