Acute bacterial cellulitis is eliminated in front of the absence of infectious context (fever, leukocytosis) and recurrent evolution. The histopathologic findings of bacteria cellulitis can also include significant edema, but neutrophils are the predominant inflammatory cell in these infections. In rare cases, clinical and histological similarities have been described with chronic erythema migratory. Eosinophilic annular erythema is also a differential diagnosis, but this entity is considered by many to be a subset of Wells syndrome.
