Chlordiazepoxide is a long-acting benzodiazepine and is an FDA approved medication for adults with mild-moderate to severe anxiety disorder, preoperative apprehension and anxiety, and withdrawal symptoms of acute alcohol use disorder. It is also FDA approved for pediatric patients greater than six years old for anxiety. Off-label, it can be used in the treatment of catatonia. It was synthesized and developed in 1956 and approved for use in 1960. It is among the least harmful of the effective psychopharmacological benzodiazepine composites. Like other medications in the benzodiazepine class, it serves as an augmenting agent for antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, SSRI, and SNRI to treat psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders. Clinicians should not combine chlordiazepoxide with other benzodiazepines.
