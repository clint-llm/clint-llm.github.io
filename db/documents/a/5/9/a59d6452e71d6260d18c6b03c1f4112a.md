The definitive treatment for Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome is surgical reattachment of the retina by retinopexy, scleral buckle, or pars plana vitrectomy and washout of anterior compartment cellular debris.

Due to the rarity of the disease, outcomes associated with Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome have not been investigated. Although medical management with prostaglandin agonists, beta-blockers, selective alpha-2 receptor agonists, or topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can be used to lower intraocular pressure while awaiting surgical intervention, its efficacy remains in question.

However, surgical reattachment has been shown to normalize IOP and preserve further vision loss in patients with Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome.
