Prevention of inhalation of the fungus in areas where it is widespread in the environment is not possible. Fortunately, only a small percentage of those infected get sick. The disease usually affects predominantly males exposed to outdoor environments in rural areas of Central and South America. PCM is considered an occupational disease in some of these areas. Education of the population is fundamental for early diagnosis of the disease and subsequent treatment. The chronic form of the infection has a strong association with smoking and alcohol intake, so people in endemic areas should be encouraged to avoid these. Tobacco cessation counseling and medications may be of use.

In immunocompromised patients, most paracoccidioidomycosis infections have been reported in patients with HIV. Lymphomas are the most common hematologic malignancy associated with PCM, and some cases have been reported with kidney transplantation. Clinicians should counsel immunocompromised patients before traveling to endemic areas to avoid high-risk exposures.
