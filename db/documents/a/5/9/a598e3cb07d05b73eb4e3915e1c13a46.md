Felodipine is a medication used in the management and treatment of essential hypertension. It is a member of the dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers. Reduction in blood pressure lowers the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The most significant benefit of the antihypertensive effect of felodipine is a decrease in the incidence of stroke. This activity describes felodipine's indications, action, and contraindications as a valuable agent in treating essential hypertension. In addition, this activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for interprofessional team members in the treatment of patients with essential hypertension.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of felodipine.
- Describe the adverse effects of felodipine.
- Summarize the monitoring for toxicity of felodipine.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and educating the patients regarding compliance with felodipine.
