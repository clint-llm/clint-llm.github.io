- Marijuana or cannabis is the most commonly used illicit substance among all age groups, including pregnant women and women of reproductive age. A large number of women using marijuana continue its use during pregnancy.

- Pregnant women should be universally screened for illicit drug use, including marijuana. In addition, they should be counseled regarding potential risks of THC on maternal, fetal, and neonatal health and referred for substance use disorder treatment.

- Marijuana use is linked to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Therefore, ACOG and AAP strongly recommend against the use of marijuana during pregnancy and lactation.

- Since marijuana is more easily available and used, there is a dire need for good quality observational and ethical studies to evaluate its effects on maternal and child health.
