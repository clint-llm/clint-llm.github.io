Azathioprine is an immunomodulator associated with several serious adverse effects. Susceptibility to its toxicity varies with age, genetic differences, and medication dosage. Its adverse effects are a limiting factor in the patient's compliance. Therefore regular follow-up and frequent laboratory workups are crucial to avoiding its complications. Clinicians and pharmacists should be aware of potential adverse effects of AZA, even in asymptomatic patients. Pharmacists should verify dosing is appropriate to the condition treated and report any discrepancies to the rest of the healthcare team. Nursing will often function at the "front lines" in seeing the patients and are often the first to know about adverse events, which they can report to the team. Nursing will also be in charge of administration, so they should verify dosing to ensure optimal therapeutic results with minimal adverse effects.

In summary, azathioprine therapy requires an interprofessional team approach, including clinicians, specialists, mid-level practitioners, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level 5]
