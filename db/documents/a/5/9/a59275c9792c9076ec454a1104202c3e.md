Mechanical thrombectomy is an emergent procedure. Therefore, neuro-angiography suite/operating room (OR) should be prepared well in advance for endovascular treatment of stroke to avoid any delay in anesthesia. An anesthesia machine should be checked and be ready to go. Airway equipment, monitoring devices, venous access kits, and drugs should be ready for starting and maintaining anesthesia.
