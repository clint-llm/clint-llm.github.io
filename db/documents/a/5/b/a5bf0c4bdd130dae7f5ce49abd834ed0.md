Presently, there is no definitive consensus or guidelines regarding the function and value of Chapman's points. If utilized, most osteopathic physicians consider the finding of a Chapman's point a diagnostic tool.Â When considered concurrently with information gathered via a thorough history and physical, the presence of Chapman's points increases the clinical suspicion for underlying visceral disease.

Another hypothesis to consider for the identity of these ganglionic formations may be due to the presence of vessels of the system known as the "primo vascular system" (PVS). PVS have vessels and nodes from the surface to the periphery, connected to all the viscera and ubiquitously present in the human body. The liquid that these vessels carry is rich in protein, hormones, and more. The movement is influenced by the structures adjacent to the PVS, by the heartbeat and by the breath; moreover, the same vessels can contract, having their own electrical activity, through endothelial cells similar to the actin of smooth muscle. The liquid transport speed can be slower than the lymphatic transport speed or faster; this will depend on the location where PVS is present.
