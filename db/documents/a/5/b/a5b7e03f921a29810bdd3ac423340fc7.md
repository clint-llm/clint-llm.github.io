Vitiligo is commonly known as multifactorial polygenic disorder and has complex pathogenesis. It is commonly associated with both non-genetic and genetic factors. However various theories have been proposed about its pathogenesis but the exact etiology is still unknown. The generally agreed principles are the absence of melanocytes in vitiligo skin with melanocytes loss, owing to their destruction. The destruction is most results in progressive melanocytes decreases. Theories about the melanocyte destruction include cytotoxic mechanisms, autoimmune mechanisms, intrinsic melanocyte defects, neural mechanisms, and oxidant-antioxidant mechanisms.

In the neural hypothesis, a neurochemical mediator usually destroys the melanocytes and decreases the production of melanin. In oxidant and anti-oxidant mechanism intermediate or metabolic product of melanin synthesis causes the destruction of the melanocyte.
