Adverse effects associated with aflibercept use include eye irritation, vitreous detachment, temporary blurred vision, eyelid swelling, and conjunctival hemorrhage. Serious adverse reactions related to the administration of aflibercept and the injection procedure include retinal detachment, traumatic cataracts, thromboembolic events, and increased intraocular pressure (IOP). These complications are observed in less than 0.1% of intravitreal injections with aflibercept.

A temporary rise in intraocular pressure within 60 minutes of administrationÂ can be expected and should return to baseline in minutes following injection. Intraocular pressure may take longer to normalize in patients with glaucoma and other ocular comorbidities. Patients should be educated about common and severe adverse effects and know when to notify their doctor.
