Infants with Patau syndrome typically have intrauterine growth restriction and microcephaly. Facial defects are primarily midline and include cyclopia, cleft lip, and cleft palate. Facial features include a sloping forehead, small malformed ears, anophthalmia or microphthalmia, micrognathia, and pre-auricular tags. Central nervous system abnormalities are also usually midline, with alobar holoprosencephaly being the most common defect. Common extremity defects include postaxial polydactyly, congenital talipes equinovarus, or rocker-bottom feet.

The spectrum of cardiac disease in Patau syndrome includes a ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, atrioventricular septal defect, and double outlet right ventricle. Interestingly, the cardiac defects alone typically are non-lethal in infancy or childhood, even if left untreated.

Additional organ systems affected by abnormalities include the lungs, liver, kidneys, genitourinary tract, digestive tract, and pancreas.

Patients surviving past infancy have a severe psychomotor disorder, failure to thrive, intellectual disability, and seizures.
