The physical examination can be useful in ruling out other causes of chronic low back pain; however, studies have shown that physical exam is relatively nonspecific. Degenerative changes in the facet joints can be visualized in radiologic studies. Initial radiographic assessment of a patient presenting with lumbar facet-medicated pain includes AP, lateral, and oblique views.

While CT and MRI are equally useful in demonstrating morphological changes in facet joint degeneration, MRI presents the advantages of better assessing the consequences of facet joint degeneration, such as surrounding neural structural impingement.

Radiographic changes due to osteoarthritis can be seen equally among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, and thus radiological investigations report a poor correlation between clinical symptoms and spinal degeneration.
