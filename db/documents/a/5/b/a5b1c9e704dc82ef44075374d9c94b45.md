The classic presentation of leukocyte adhesion deficiency is recurrent bacterial infections, neutrophil adhesion defects, and umbilical cord sloughing delays. The adhesion defects result in poor leukocyte chemotaxis, particularly the neutrophil, with an inability to form pus and neutrophilia.

Individuals with leukocyte adhesion deficiency commonly suffer from bacterial infections beginning in the neonatal period. Infections such as omphalitis, pneumonia, gingivitis, and peritonitis are common and usually life-threatening due to the inability to destroy the invading pathogens. Individuals with LAD do not form abscesses because granulocytes cannot migrate to the sites of infection.

Characteristics of patients with LAD include the following

LAD I:

- Delayed separation of the umbilical cord

- Recurrent pyogenic infections, with onset in the first weeks of life

- Infections caused meanly by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa

- Absent pus formation

- Periodontitis

LAD II:

- Recurrent skin infections

- Pneumonia

- Bronchiectasis

- Tuberculosis

- Denture abnormalities

- Infections are less severe and fewer as compared to LAD I

LAD III:

- Omphalitis

- Osteoporosis like bone features

- Bleeding complications

- Hematological abnormalities, e.g., bone marrow failure

Other miscellaneous manifestations may include:

- Vaginitis

- Peritonitis

- Osteomyelitis

- Perianal abscesses

- Sinusitis

- Tracheobronchitis

- Necrotic soft tissue infections

- Otitis media

- Meningitis

- Graft versus host reaction

- Recurrent tonsillitis

- Conjunctivitis

- Granuloma

- Oral candidiasis

- Aphthous stomatitis

- Urinary tract infections

- Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis

- Glomerulonephritis

- Hemolytic-uremic syndrome

- Nail dystrophy

- Persistent Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy

- Pyoderma gangrenosum

- Megakaryocytic acute myeloid leukemia
