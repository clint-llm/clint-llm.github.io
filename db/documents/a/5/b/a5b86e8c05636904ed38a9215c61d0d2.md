Absolute contraindications to hysteroscopy are few. They include active pelvic infection, prodromal or active genital herpes, and confirmed cervical or endometrial cancer. Moderate vaginal bleeding is a relative contraindication to hysteroscopy. However, adequate visualization for the procedure may be achieved with copious irrigation. Pregnancy is also a contraindication to hysteroscopy unless used in the setting of retained IUD or products of conception removal.

Medical comorbidities could be potential contraindicationsÂ to hysteroscopic surgery(e.g., coronary heart disease, bleeding diathesis).
