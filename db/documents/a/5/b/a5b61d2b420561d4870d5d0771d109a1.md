As described above, in patients who present with findings suspicious for a lipodystrophy syndrome, a metabolic work up must be pursued. Patients should have a complete metabolic panel checked for hyperglycemia and any alterations of hepatic enzymes. A cholesterol panel should also be checked to rule out hypertriglyceridemia. Leptin levels can be obtained and, if low, may predict responsiveness to replacement treatment. Genetic testing is not routine at this time but for certain subtypes of lipodystrophy may be performed in clinical laboratories. There are ongoing clinical trials which can be reviewed at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
