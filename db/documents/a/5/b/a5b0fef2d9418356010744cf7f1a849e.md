Female menstrual cycle normally comprises a 28 to 30-day cycle, which contains 2 phases, the proliferative phase and the secretory phase. At the end of the cycle, the uterine lining starts shedding off, which is a normal phenomenon of female menstruation.

The absence of menstruation during the female during the reproductive ages of approximately 12 to 49 years is known as amenorrhea.

There are primary and secondary causes of amenorrhea.

The most common cause of amenorrhea is pregnancy, and it is the first thing that needs to be ruled out when investigating such a patient. In general, if a female does not have menses for 6 months, she has amenorrhea.
