Fentanyl is similar to other opioid drugs. Fentanyl molecules target a subclass of opioid receptor systems in the body, many of which are localized in the brain within specialized neuroanatomical structures, particularlyÂ involving the control of emotions, pain, and speaking to the point of its infamous addictive properties, reward. Biochemically, it is a Mu-selective opioid agonist. However, it has the capability to activate other opioid system receptors such as the delta and potentially the kappa-receptors. Consequently, the activation of these receptors, particularly the Mu-receptors, produces analgesia. Also, the neurotransmitter dopamine (Da) is increased in the reward areas of the brain, which elicits the stereotypical exhilaration and relaxation effects, and is typically associated with the addiction to the drug.

Fentanyl is hepatically metabolized via the CYP450 enzyme system, specifically CYP3A4. The drug has a half-life of 3 to 7 hours. Excretion is 75% in the urine and 9% in feces.
