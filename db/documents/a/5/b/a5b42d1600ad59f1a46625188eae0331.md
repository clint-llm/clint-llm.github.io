Muehrcke’s nails are cutaneous manifestations of underlying systemic disease with unclear prevalence. When a provider notices it, it is best managed by an interprofessional team of a primary care clinician, a dermatologist, and a specialist whose specialty is most pertinent to the patient’s underlying systemic condition.

A dermatologist’s involvement helps make the diagnosis, monitor progression, and insight into other hair, nail, or skin disorders, which may additionally manifest from an underlying condition. A primary care provider is important to assess the patient’s baseline health, launch medical workup, and carefully coordinate care with appropriate specialists. Specialists can help treat underlying conditions or modify treatment if the Muehrcke’s nails are a result of therapy (e.g., chemotherapy). Often, the outcomes of this condition depend on how amenable the underlying condition to treat.
