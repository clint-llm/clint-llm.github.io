Glycol ether (GE) toxicity can occur through various routes; the two primary ways are via inhalation of volatile flumes or ingestion. There have been multiple reports of occupational exposures when the compound was first produced in the 1960s.

Upon entering the body, the glycol ethers quickly distribute throughout the body. Upon metabolism of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), an organic acid is formed. The accumulation of organic acids is generally responsible for causing renal, neurologic, and reproductive side effects.

Studies of occupational exposure to ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGME) and ethylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (EGMEA) were conducted in Europe and the United States and expressed as time-weighted averages. The concentration that considers both the quantity and duration of exposure to a hazardous substance in the air during a designated work period is the time-weighted average concentration.

US air sample analysis showed 0.4 to 7.4 ppm for EGME and 0.2 to 0.4 ppm for EGMEA. A Belgian study found high concentrations of both substances in air samples, primarily during printing and painting. The presence of MAA in urine samples indicated exposure in paint fabrication and furniture painting. A French study found the highest EGME exposure in the electronic industry.
