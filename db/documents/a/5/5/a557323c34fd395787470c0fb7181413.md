The precise prevalence and incidence of Tietze syndrome are unknown. Biological sex, ethnicity, geography, or occupation do not provide any insights into occurrence rates. Older youth and younger adults do seem to be affected more frequently than their older counterparts over the age of 40. Rarely are those at the far ends of the age spectrum affected, but cases have been reported.
