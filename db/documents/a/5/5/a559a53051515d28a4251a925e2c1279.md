The cardinal symptom of alveolar osteitis is radiating pain that increases in intensity after tooth extraction. The pain is at, or near, the extraction socket in the trigeminal nerve distribution. It typically occurs between one and five days post-operatively and is unrelieved by analgesics.

Physical examination is unremarkable mainly. Expected postoperative changes, such as erythema and edema, can be anticipated, but there should be no frank signs of infection. Rarely a low-grade fever or regional lymphadenopathy can be noted.

Vital signs are stable, and the patient is most commonly afebrile. The pain is accompanied by a totally or partially broken down blood clot in the alveolar socket. Exposed bone secondary to this fibrinolysis is the typical clinical presentation but may be difficult to visualize on examination.
