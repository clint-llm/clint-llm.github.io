Definitive diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism is not a realistic goal in an emergency setting. However, because lab abnormalities in these patients may be transient, it is important to draw extra blood for future testing at the time of initial presentation. Although a definitive specific diagnosis is unlikely in an emergency department, some labs are helpful in screening for these diseases. Most children with inborn errors of metabolism will have an elevated lactate level, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, or acidosis on blood testing, or ketonuria/elevated urinary reducing substances on urine testing.  These tests can, therefore, be used as a screen for possible inborn errors, with extra tubes saved for further serum amino-acid and organic-acid testing should these tests be positive. If the child is undergoing lumbar puncture for any reason, an extra tube of cerebrospinal fluid should also be saved.
