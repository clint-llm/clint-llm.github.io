AIP is a rare autosomal dominant condition that runs a chronic course with recurrent acute episodes of neurovisceral symptoms. Trials are giving hope to find a definitive cure to this life -long disease. Once the diagnosis of AIP or some other acute hepatic porphyria is confirmed, patients should be thoroughly counseled and provided with the list of trigger factors (that can precipitate an attack) for avoidance, especially drugs that are safe and unsafe. They should know that treatment is only available for acute attacks and that the best way to remain asymptomatic is by preventing precipitants. If they have abdominal pain should go immediately to the emergency department. They should receive education on prognosis and complications and are strongly encouraged to obtain genetic testing done for their offspring.
