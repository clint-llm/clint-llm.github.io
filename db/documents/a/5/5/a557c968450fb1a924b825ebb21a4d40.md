Stress generally affects all systems of the body including cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, gastrointestinal, nervous, muscular, and reproductive systems. With regards to the cardiovascular system, acute stress causes an increase in heart rate, stronger heart muscle contractions, dilation of the heart, and redirection of blood to large muscles. The respiratory system works with the cardiovascular system to supply cells of the body with oxygen while removing carbon dioxide waste. Acute stress constricts the airway which leads to shortness of breath and rapid breathing. The endocrine system increases its production of steroid hormones, which include cortisol, to activate the stress response of the body. Stress can affect the gastrointestinal tract by affecting how quickly food moves through the bowels. It can also affect digestion and what nutrients the intestines absorb. With regards to the nervous system, stress will activate the sympathetic nervous system which in turn activates the adrenal glands. The parasympathetic nervous system facilitates the recovery of the body after the acute stress-induced crisis is over. Stress affects the musculoskeletal system by tensing up the muscles as a way of guarding against pain and injury. In the reproductive system, chronic stress can negatively impact sexual desire, sperm production/ maturation, pregnancy, and menstruation.
