In patients with hypertension, there is increased sympathetic activity to the kidneys. This increase leads to increased sodium and water reabsorption, reduction of renal blood flow, and renin release. Longterm overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system can lead to decreased kidney function as well as cardiac hypertrophy.

Renal denervation through sympatho-modulatory approaches is becoming an option for pharmacologically-resistant hypertension. Different from sympathectomies performed in the past, these approaches look to treat hypertension without the adverse effects of postural hypotension. Kidney denervation performed through ultrasound, radiofrequency, or chemical agents has been successful in several clinical trials. Such procedures will likely become more mainstream in the years to come.
