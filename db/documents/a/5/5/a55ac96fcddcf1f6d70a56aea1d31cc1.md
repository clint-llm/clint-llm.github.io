Within a "Plastics" surgical instrument set, the following instruments are specifically necessary for the reasons stated:

- A small Desmarres retractor and a four-pronged blunt-tipped rake for lower eyelid retraction: wide retractors limit the surgical view - the rake tips are blunt to avoid unnecessary trauma when retracting

- An electrocautery unit with a sharp tip cutting needle is reasonable to use. Alternative devices include a radio-frequency device with a cutting needle, although this gives less hemostasis than an electrocautery unit (which, in turn, leads to more collateral heat)

- Many practitioners prefer to make incisions with Westcott scissors, dissect the fat with Stevens or Westcott scissors, and use bipolar cautery during the procedure, rather than the monopolar unit.

- A 4-0 silk suture to provide traction to the conjunctiva to aid exposure

- Q-tips for delicate dabbing to control small bleeders

- Bipolar cautery

- Frozen gauze or sterile ice packs for use during surgery

- A plastic corneal shield should be used to protect the cornea during eyelid surgery.
