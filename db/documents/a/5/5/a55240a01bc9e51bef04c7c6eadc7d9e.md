The left subclavian artery is more likely to be affected than the right or innominate arteries. If there is isolated stenosis, the likelihood of symptoms is less than in other vascular beds; however, if the obstructive disease affects other aortic arch vessels, such as the carotid or vertebral arteries, the likelihood of steal or ischemic symptoms increases.

Upper extremity symptoms include arm claudication, muscle fatigue, rest pain, and finger necrosis. Neurologic issues include vertebrobasilar hypoperfusion, including visual disturbances, syncope, ataxia, vertigo, dysphasia, dysarthria, and facial sensory deficits.

In patients with internal mammary artery grafts as a result of coronary artery bypass graft surgery, the symptoms of ischemic heart disease, including angina pectoris, due to coronary-subclavian steal, predominate.

While the diagnosis typically rests on imaging, a thorough physical exam is important.

- Unequal arm blood pressures

- Refractory hypotension in rare cases of bilateral subclavian artery stenosis

- The presence of a faint pulse in the upper extremities and systolic blood pressure (BP) difference of greater than 15 mmHg between the right and left upper extremities

- Absent or significantly diminished pulses

- Neurologic and cardiac sequelae.

- Bruits

- Ulcers

- Gangrenous skin changes

- Nail bed splinter hemorrhages

- ABI value greater than 1.3 in patients with bilateral subclavian artery stenosis

- vertebrobasilar hypoperfusion evidence with syncope, ataxia, and dysphagia
