The incidence of stress ulcers is unknown but is thought to almost always occur in severe acute illness. The most common presentation of stress ulceration is in the form of upper GI bleeding, and GI bleed secondary to stress ulcerations may range from 1.5% to 15%, depending on whether or not patients received stress ulcer prophylaxis. The incidence of stress ulceration and its complications are declining with the advent of active prophylaxis methods for preventing stress-related gastritis. Patients with GI bleeding secondary to stress ulceration have increased morbidity and mortality than those who do not have GI bleed. Hence stress ulcer prophylaxis has been the center of many randomized clinical trials. Very rarely (less than 1% of the time), stress ulcers can cause perforation and perforation-related complications.****
