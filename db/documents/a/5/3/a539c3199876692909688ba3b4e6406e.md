Transthoracic Echocardiography views and anatomy:

**Parasternal Long-axis View (Figure 1)**

**Structures**

- Chambers identified in this view: left atrium, left ventricle, left ventricle outflow tract, aorta.

- Valves identified in this view: mitral valve and aortic valve 

- This view helps in identifying regurgitant and stenotic jets of mitral and aortic valves.

**Parasternal Short-axis View**

**Structures**

- Chambers identified in this view: left atrium, right atrium, right ventricle outflow tract, main pulmonary artery

- Valves identified in this view: aortic valve, pulmonary valve, tricuspid valve

- This view helps in identifying the tricuspid and pulmonary valve disease as well as patent ductus arteriosus.

**Apical 4 Chamber View (Figure 2)**

**Structures**

- Chambers identified in this view: left atrium, right atrium, left ventricle, and right ventricle

- Valves identified in this view: mitral and tricuspid valve 

- This view helps identify the wall motion abnormalities of the inferior septal wall and anterolateral wall of the left ventricle, mitral, and tricuspid valve disease.

**Apical  5 Chamber View**

**Structures**

- Chambers identified in this view: left atrium, right atrium, left ventricle, left ventricle outflow tract, right ventricle, and aorta

- Valves identified in this view: mitral valve, tricuspid valve, and aortic valve

- This view provides additional information on the Left ventricle outflow tract, aortic valve, and aortic root compared to the four-chamber view.

**Apical 2 Chamber View (Figure 3)**

**Structures**

- Chambers identified in this view: left atrium and left ventricle

- Valves identified in this view: mitral valve 

- This view helps identify the wall motion abnormalities of the inferior wall and anterior wall of the left ventricle and mitral valve disease.

**Apical Parasternal long-axis View (Figure 4)**

**Structures**

- Chambers identified in this view: left atrium, left ventricle, left ventricle outflow tract, aorta.

- Valves identified in this view: mitral valve and aortic valve 

- This view helps identify the wall motion abnormalities of the anterior septal wall and the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle. In this view, mitral valve and aortic valve disease are identifiable.

**Subcostal Coronal View**

**Structures**

- Chambers identified in this view: left atrium, right atrium, left ventricle, and right ventricle

- Valves identified in this view: mitral and tricuspid valve 

- This view helps in diagnosing interatrial septal defect, pericardial effusion, and cardiac tamponade.

**Subcostal Saggital view**

**Structures**

- Chambers identified in this view: right atrium, inferior vena cava, hepatic vein, and descending aorta

- This view helps in assessing the fluid status of the patient.

**Suprasternal Noch View**

**Structures**

- Chambers identified in this view: left atrium, aortic arch, brachiocephalic artery, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery, right pulmonary artery.

- This view helps in diagnosing aorta diseases such as aortic dissection and coarctation of the aorta. In this view, congenital heart defect, patent ductus arteriosus can be identified.
