Traditionally, blood pressure (BP) is measured using the auscultatory method with a sphygmomanometer and stethoscope. According to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), normal systolic and diastolic blood pressure for adults is <120 mm Hg and <80 mm Hg, respectively.

It is well known that an increase in blood pressure accompanies advanced age. This increase in BP is due to complex and varied components, which are not only due to aging factors but also to unique environment and lifestyle factors. With advanced age, microscopic and macroscopic changes to the heart, vascular system, and autonomic nervous system may occur, which can dramatically affect blood pressure. This activity aims to begin to understand how aging can affect blood pressure.
