Patients often complain of a soft, mobile mass of tissue they can feel under the skin. These are typically painless unless they encroach joints, nerves, or blood vessels. Patients often see these in the upper part of the body. Rarely, these lipomas can form in muscles or organs.

Lipomas are mostly harmless and are only treated or excised if they cause pain due to their location and/or impact an organâ€™s function. However, some patients choose to have these masses removed for cosmetic reasons, as they can often be seen through the skin as they lie subcutaneously. Small lipomas (less than 4 cm) can be removed through small incisions, and scarring is not usually a significant concern. Research conducted also concluded that open surgery is still a better option for removing giant lipomas (greater than 10 cm) compared with lipoma removal by suction-assisted lipectomy through small incisions as it allows better judgment, prevents recurrences, and avoids damage to the surrounding tissues.

Pericallosal lipomas are fat-containing lesions that occur most commonly in the interhemispheric fissure closely related to the corpus callosum, which is often abnormal. This is the most common location for intracranial lipoma.
