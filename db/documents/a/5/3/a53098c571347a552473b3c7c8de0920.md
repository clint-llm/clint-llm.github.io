Astereognosis is the inability to identify objects by feel only, in the absence of input from the visual system. It may also be defined as the impairment of recognition of the objects by somatosensory discrimination of the size, texture, weight, and shape of the objects, in the absence of any major somatosensory deficit. This activity reviews the etiopathology, evaluation, and treatment of astereognosis and emphasizes the role of the interprofessional team in improving the disability due to astereognosis.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of astereognosis.
- Explain the evaluation of patients with astereognosis.
- Review the management options available for patients with astereognosis.
- Summarize the importance of communication and coordination amongst the interprofessional team members to enhance the care of patients with astereognosis.
