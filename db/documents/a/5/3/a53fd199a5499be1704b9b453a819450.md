The body's physiologic responses to stress have significance in the clinical setting in many applications, including the management of healthy and hypo adrenal surgical patients and understanding how patients' lifestyle modifications may be related to the body's stress response.

The physiologic stress of surgery causes cortisol levels to rise in a positive correlation to the severity of the surgery. In patients undergoing major surgeries as defined by the POSSUM scale, cortisol levels return to baseline on postoperative days 1-5.

Hydrocortisone injections for hypo adrenal patients undergoing surgery are given to replicate levels in patients undergoing surgery with normal adrenal function; this is thought to help hypo adrenal patients withstand the physiologic stress of surgery. Dose recommendations vary as well as a method of supplementation.

ICU patients are subject to physical and environmental stress, and efforts have been made to investigate the link between cortisol levels and illness recovery, as well as to ameliorate stressors during the ICU stay that make it a problematic healing environment. Subjective patient perception of relaxation is heightened with the use of sleep adjuncts such as earplugs, eye masks, and relaxing music. However, these interventions did not influence nocturnal melatonin or cortisol level.

Long-term exercise aids in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and adaption of baseline cardiac performance is thought to be one of the factors. Long-term moderate exercise is useful for relieving stress-induced cardiovascular response through changing baroreflex set points in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius for blood pressure control and blood volume homeostasis regulated by the paraventricular nucleus.
