Treatment of pertussis is largely supportive, including oxygen, suctioning, hydration, and avoidance of respiratory irritants. Parenteral nutrition may be necessary as the disease tends to have a prolonged course.

Hospitalization is indicated for patients with superimposed pneumonia, hypoxia, central nervous system (CNS) complications, or who are unable to tolerate nutrition and hydration by mouth. Patients less than 1-year-old are not fully vaccinated and carry the greatest risk of morbidity and mortality; they should be hospitalized regardless of symptoms. Neonates should be admitted to an intensive care setting as life-threatening cardiopulmonary complications and arrest can occur unexpectedly.

Antibiotic effect on the duration or severity of the disease is minimal when started in the catarrhal phase and not proven effective when started in the paroxysmal phase. Rather, the primary goal of antibiotic treatment is to decrease the carriage and spread of disease. Erythromycin (40 to 50 mg/kg per day, maximum 2 g per day, in 2 to 3 divided doses) is the first-line treatment for pertussis. Azithromycin (10 mg/kg per day on day 1 followed by 5 mg/kg on days 2 to 5) and clarithromycin (15 mg/kg per day in two divided doses) are alternative treatments. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (8 mg/kg per day of trimethoprim) has been used as an alternative in macrolide-allergic patients, but its efficacy has not been proven.

The macrolides are not recommended for infants less than 4 weeks old for fear that this may lead to infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

Strict isolation is important while the patient remains infectious. Pertussis is contagious throughout the catarrhal phase and for 3 weeks after the onset of the paroxysmal phase. In patients treated with antibiotics, isolation should be continued for at least 5 days after treatment is initiated. Postexposure prophylaxis with erythromycin is recommended for all household contacts.

Corticosteroids have not shown definite benefit in reducing the severity and course of illness but are sometimes given to critically ill infants. Beta2-agonists, pertussis immune globulin, cough suppressants, and antihistamines are not effective. Exchange blood transfusion therapy for leukocytosis with lymphocytosis may be considered.

Close contacts should be treated with azithromycin or erythromycin.

Vaccination is recommended with the acellular vaccine at ages 2,4,6, 15-18 months, and at ages 4 to 6 years. In addition, the CDC recommends a single dose of Tdap for all adults to reduce transmission to children. Adverse effects of the vaccine include crying and febrile seizures, but severe neurological effects are rare. The vaccine can also be administered during the third trimester to pregnant women without causing harm to the fetus.

DTaP is approvedÂ during the last 3 months of pregnancy to prevent pertussis in infants under 2 months old.
