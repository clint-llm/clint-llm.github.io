Radioactive iodine ablation (RAI), which entails the administration of radioactive iodine-131, is used to treat hyperthyroidism and in the adjuvant setting for differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC).

Ninety-five percent of thyroid carcinomas derive from the thyroid hormone-producing follicular cells of the thyroid gland; DTCs, the most common subtype, include both papillary and follicular histologies.

**Low Risk**

- Papillary carcinoma with all the following features:

- No distant metastases
- No lymph node involvement
- Gross total tumor resection
- No tumor invasion of local/locoregional structures
- Non-aggressive histology
- No radioiodine uptake outside the thyroid bed on post-thyroidectomy iodine whole-body scan
- Clinical N0 or ≤ 5 pathologic N1 micrometastases (< 0.2 cm in largest dimension)
- No vascular invasion

- Intrathyroidal encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma.

- Intrathyroidal, well-differentiated follicular carcinoma with capsular invasion and no to minimal (< 4 foci) vascular invasion

- Intrathyroidal, papillary microcarcinoma

**Intermediate Risk**

- Microscopic invasion into perithyroidal tissues

- Radioiodine uptake within the neck on a post-RAI whole body scan

- Aggressive histology (i.e., tall cell, insular, columnar cell carcinoma, Hürthle cell carcinoma, follicular thyroid cancer, hobnail variant)

- Papillary carcinoma with vascular invasion

- Clinical suspicion of regional lymph node involvement (cN1), all involved lymph nodes < 3 cm in largest dimension; or > 5 regional lymph nodes containing cancer on pathologic analysis (pN1), all lymph nodes < 3 cm in the largest dimension.

- Multifocal papillary microcarcinoma with extrathyroidal extension

**High Risk**

- Gross extrathyroidal extension

- Incomplete tumor resection

- Distant Metastasis (either on imaging, pathology, or significantly elevated postoperative serum thyroglobulin level)

- Pathologic regional lymph node involvement (pN1) with at least one lymph node ≥3 cm in the largest dimension

- Follicular carcinoma with extensive (> 4 foci of) vascular invasion

In the case of patients with hyperthyroidism (which includes Grave’s disease, toxic multinodular goutier, and toxic adenoma) who are not candidates for or who fail radical or partial thyroidectomy or antithyroid drug therapy, the ATA recommends radioiodine as a first-line or alternative treatment.

Radioactive iodine isotope administration also serves a role in the diagnosis and long-term follow-up of patients with DTC and the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.
