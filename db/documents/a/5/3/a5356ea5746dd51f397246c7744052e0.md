Breast cancer care is complex and involves a comprehensive interprofessional care team. A general surgeon or breast/oncologic surgeon typically performs the mastectomy. Additional personnel involved during mastectomy procedures include perioperative nursing staff, anesthesia providers, and surgical technologists or assistants in surgery. For patients who require axillary node biopsy at the time of mastectomy, a radiologist or nuclear medicine technologist is often involved for perioperative technetium sulfur colloid injection as part of sentinel lymph node mapping. In patients undergoing reconstructive procedures, a plastic surgeon typically works alongside the general or breast surgeon to perform the appropriate reconstructive surgery, which has its basis in various patient factors. Additionally, most patients who undergo a mastectomy do so because of malignancy, and their postop care team includes medical oncology and possibly radiation oncology. Following mastectomy, patients may require home healthcare nursing support and even physical or occupational therapy to maximize the return of capacity for activities of daily living.
