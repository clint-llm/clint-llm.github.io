While the emergency clinician and trauma surgeon are almost always involved in the initial care of patients with cerebral contusions associated with TBI, it is essential to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a neurosurgeon and intensivist. Prompt consultation with an interprofessional group of specialists is recommended to improve outcomes. The nurses are also vital members of the interprofessional group, as they will monitor the patient's vital signs. The blood bank and the clinical laboratory will provide key elements in the treatment and management decisions. If the patient is intubated, respiratory therapy is essential for managing ventilators with the coordination by the neurointensivist. The radiologist also plays a vital role in the radiological monitoring of imaging changes.

A significant complication in these patients that is associated with high morbidity is deep vein thrombosis. Many patients can be placed in medical prophylaxis if there is no evidence of the contusion's progression. Physical therapists must be consulted for early ambulation. An integrated care pathway using an evidence-based approach and following management guidelines are crucial elements for improving outcomes.
