Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can track the effects of neural activity and the energy that the brainÂ consumes by measuring components of the metabolic chain. Other techniques, such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), study cerebral blood flow and neuroreceptors. Positron emission tomography (PET) assesses the glucose metabolism of the brain.
