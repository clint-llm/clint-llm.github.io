Hypertelorism is not a syndrome in and of itself, but rather it is a physical finding in many craniofacial syndromes. When thinking about the epidemiology of hypertelorism, it is helpful to consider the proposed embryological mechanisms. In the failure of the embryonic frontonasal prominence to develop normally, the patient will present with median facial clefting (also often referred to as frontonasal dysplasia). Alternatively, when dysplasia of bone development is the underlying contributive factor to hypertelorism, patients will present with craniosynostosis or cranial bone abnormalities.

Frontonasal dysplasia and or median facial clefting is rare, presenting in about 0.17% of all clefting presentations.

There are additional genetic syndromes that may include hypertelorism as a feature, including but not limited to Bohring-Optiz Syndrome, Greig Cephalopolysyndactyly, Noonan Syndrome, Joubert Syndrome, Trisomy 18, 22q11 syndrome, Neurofibromatosis type 1, Aarskog syndrome, Cat-Eye Syndrome, CHARGE association, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Wolf-Hirshorn Syndrome, Morquio Syndrome, and Hurler Syndrome. The specific epidemiology of each of these genetic syndromes is discussed separately in dedicated articles to each syndrome.
