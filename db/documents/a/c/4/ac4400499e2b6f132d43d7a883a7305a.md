Ocular hypotony can be transient with limited risk to the eye. But in some instances, it can evolve into a more chronic situation with significant and devastating effects on the eye and vision, such as evolution to phthisis bulbi.

Often, the complications of hypotony may co-exist with the primary pathology responsible for the hypotony. For instance, in the setting of trauma, complications of ocular hypotony may be associated with other features of trauma, which may result in disorganization of the globe. In uveitis, anterior and posterior synechia, macular edema, and cataract may also co-exist with hypotony and its effects.

Complications specific to ocular hypotony include hypotony maculopathy with characteristics described in the earlier sections on pathophysiology. Other complications include choroidal detachment, hypotony keratopathy, refractive change, papilledema, and cataract formation.

Treatment of these complications of ocular hypotony can result in a favorable response with improvement in vision.
