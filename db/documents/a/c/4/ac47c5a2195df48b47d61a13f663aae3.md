Stiff elbow is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a therapist and an orthopedic nurse. In most cases, conservative treatment with exercise is the first step. Surgery is often undertaken for recalcitrant conditions that do not respond to conservative measures. However, surgery does not guarantee a positive result and is also associated with serious complications.

The outcomes for patients with stiff elbow depend on the cause. Those who comply with rest, stretching and regular exercise tend to have good outcomes.
