Vaccinia and variola truly were dark chapters of human history; however, the threat posed by Poxviridae as a “species” is still very extant. Because variola ran so rampant, and for so long through human populations, it likely ceded other Poxviridae from really gaining any real foothold on humans as a species (even if only antigenically).

Especially in the wake of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, funding, and development towards understanding zoonotic viral host-switches, their virulence, patterns, and transmissibility must increase -with special scrutiny given to Poxviridae. Current knowledge is grossly insufficient, and in this past year, this fact has been proven dramatically.

Finally, when the possibility of manufactured bioterrorism was realized in the dusk of the 20th century, smallpox was the obvious consideration. Although the inventory of the U.S. strategic defense stockpile is classified, it is generally assumed that enough vaccinia vaccines were produced en-masse to treat the entirety of the territorial U.S. population.
