The cornerstone of treatment of hypercholesterolemia is a healthy lifestyle, an optimum weight, no smoking, exercising for 150 minutes per week, and a diet low in saturated and trans-fatty acids and enriched in fiber, fruit, and vegetables and fatty fish. Plant stanols at a dose of 2 g/d can help reduce LDL-C levels. The drug class of choice is the statin which can lower LDL-C from 22% to 50%. Also, they have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in both primary and secondary prevention trials. The major side effects are elevated transaminases, myalgia, and myopathy and new-onset diabetes. If transaminases exceed three times the upper limit of normal, the statin dose should be reduced, or a lower dose of another statin should be used. Myopathy is a serious problem since it can result in rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. Certain drugs in combination with statins increase this risk. These include gemfibrozil, macrolide antibiotics azole antifungals, protease inhibitors, cyclosporine, nefazodone, and other CYP3A4 inhibitors, and multisystem diseases. However, some patients cannot achieve adequate control of their LDL-C levels even with high-dose statin therapy and require additional drugs.

Cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ezetimibe) and/or bile acid sequestrants are the next-line of drugs given their safety in combination with statins. Niacin in combination with the above can be used to further lower LDL-C in primary prevention but not in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Currently, heterozygous FH patients whose LDL-C levels remain markedly elevated (more than 200 mg/dL with cardiovascular disease or more than 300 mg/dL without CVD) on maximally tolerated drug therapy are candidates for LDL apheresis. This is a physical method of purging the blood of LDL in which the LDL particles are removed selectively from the circulation. Usually, LDL apheresis is performed every 2 weeks. A new class of drugs, PCSK9 inhibitors (monoclonal antibodies), can lower LDL-C up to 60% on statin therapy and are approved for use in FH and patients on statin therapy not at their goal.

Treatment of heterozygotes with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may normalize LDL levels. However, achieving optimal levels may require one of the combinations involving reductase inhibitors, niacin, bile acid sequestrants, and ezetimibe. Levels of LDL cholesterol less than 100 mg/dL can be obtained with combinations of these drugs in some patients. Treatment of individuals with homozygosity or combined heterozygosity is challenging. Partial control may be achieved with medications including antisense oligonucleotide directed at Apo B-100 synthesis, inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, and ezetimibe. Statins and monoclonal antibodies directed at proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) protein are useful if some residual receptor activity is present and there is no null mutation. LDL apheresis in conjunction with medications can be very effective. Striking reduction of LDL levels is observed after liver transplantation, illustrating the important role of hepatic receptors in LDL metabolism.

In conclusion, hypercholesterolemia is a mammoth problem facing us, and it behooves us as health care professionals to get more patients on efficacious therapies like statins which are cost-effective since they are now largely generic. The optimum LDL-C for the population is less than 100mg/dL. In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the goal should be less than 70 mg/dl or a 50% reduction in LDL-C. For others, the goal should be an LDL-C less than 100 mg/dl or a 30% to 50% reduction in LDL-C.
