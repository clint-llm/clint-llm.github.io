The mainstay of treatment is to descend 1000 meters or until there is a resolution of symptoms with the descent. During the descent, it is important to minimize exertion as exertion may increase hypoxemia from metabolic demands of the body and worsen an individual’s condition. If available, a trial of oxygen therapy may ameliorate symptoms and help temporize the patient if the descent is technically difficult or delayed. That said, the mainstay of treatment remains descent, regardless of oxygen availability. Supplemental oxygen via a high-flow nasal cannula and facemask titrated to Sp02 greater than 90% is a reasonable alternative when available. Portable hyperbaric chambers also may be used when descent is not possible, but these typically require constant care and may be difficult for individuals experiencing nausea or vomiting, claustrophobia, or altered mental status from concomitant AMS/HACE. There also exists the risk of recurrence of symptoms after exiting from the chamber. Nifedipine improves symptoms as an adjunct by decreasing pulmonary vasoconstriction but should not be used as the sole therapy if oxygen or descent are options. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors may be used to help to decrease pulmonary artery and capillary pressure through vasodilation if nifedipine is unavailable. There is no clinically proven role for acetazolamide, B-agonist, or diuretics.
