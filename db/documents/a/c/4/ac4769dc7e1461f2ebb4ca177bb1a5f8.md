There are numerous medical complications associated with Campylobacter infection, many of which have a worse prognosis than the acute infection itself. Campylobacter infections can cause extraintestinal diseases involving the neurologic, pulmonary, immunologic and cardiac systems.

In 1859, the French scientist, Jean-Baptiste Octave Landry, first reported the disease known today as Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). GBS is an autoimmune disease that presents with symmetrical ascending flaccid paralysis due to demyelination of peripheral nerves. It was not until the 20th century that a strong association between GBS and Campylobacter was made. Today, it is estimated that Campylobacter, particularly C. jejuni provoke approximately 30% of all GBS. Approximately 1 in every 1000 people infected with Campylobacter will develop GBS. It occurs 1 to 3 weeks after infection with Campylobacter. The mechanism of the autoimmune disease is thought to be through molecular mimicry creating autoantibodies that react with peripheral nerves. The clinical course for those who suffer from GBS varies. Approximately 20% of patients with GBS have a complicated clinical course requiring prolonged intensive care. Despite the advances in the critical care management of GBS, it has mortality between 3% to 7%.

Case reports have emerged of Campylobacter-associated myocarditis and pericarditis. This is most commonly described in young, healthy males with a history of traveling associated diarrheal illness. Patients may experience symptoms ranging from mild chest discomfort to severe pain that mimics myocardial infarction. Laboratory testing often shows elevated Troponin, CK, BNP, and CRP. Increased levels of Troponin T have been associated with a worse prognosis. However, a normal value does not exclude the diagnosis of myocarditis. Echocardiography is used to identify associated pericardial effusions and wall motion abnormalities associated with the condition. In most patients, clinical evolution of symptoms and outcomes are benign. Approximately 30% of those affected develop dilated cardiomyopathy. In severe cases, life-threatening arrhythmias and cardiovascular collapse requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have been described.

Approximately 1% to 5% of patients will experience acute reactive arthritis with an annual incidence of 4.3 per 100,000. Young adults are the most commonly affected group. Both C. jejuni and C. coli are associated with the condition. Symptoms begin within the 4 weeks following acute infection, and predominant symptoms are a sterile joint inflammation. Symptoms vary from mild oligo-arthralgia to disabling polyarthritis. Musculoskeletal symptoms are the most common presentation though patients can also have ocular, dermatological and urinary symptoms. While symptoms most commonly affect the knees and ankles, small joints and tendons involvement is also seen. The duration of symptoms in acute reactive arthritis is variable. Patients may experience symptoms lasting several months to a year. There is no association with HLA B27 on a population level.

In the gastrointestinal (GI) system, there has been an increased association of esophageal and colorectal diseases with Campylobacter infections. In the acute phase of the disease, severe infections can manifest as colitis which can lead to significant morbidity occasionally requiring surgical intervention. Toxic megacolon is a rare complication of Campylobacter colitis and should be considered in critically ill patients. Patients that develop toxic megacolon have high morbidity and mortality despite interventions.

Multiple other gastroenterological manifestations are associated with Campylobacter including, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's esophagus (BE), and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Research has also shown there an increased risk for colorectal carcinoma and irritable bowel disease following Campylobacter infections.

A form of lymphoma, immunoproliferative small intestinal disease, has shown an association with Campylobacter infections. Biopsy specimens several patients noted the presence of C. jejuni and antimicrobial therapy targeting this organism lead to the rapid remission of the immunoproliferative small intestinal disease.
