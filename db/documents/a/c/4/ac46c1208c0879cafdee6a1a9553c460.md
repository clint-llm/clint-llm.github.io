Papillary fibroelastomas are one of the most common types of primary cardiac tumors. They are increasingly recognized as the spatial resolution of imaging modalities improves. Also, they are a potential cause of transient ischemic attacks, strokes, myocardial infarction, and sudden death. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of papillary fibroelastomas and highlights the role of the cardiac team in managing the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathology of papillary fibroelastomas. 
- Review the evaluation of papillary fibroelastomas.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for papillary fibroelastomas. 
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance papillary fibroelastoma treatment and improve outcomes.
