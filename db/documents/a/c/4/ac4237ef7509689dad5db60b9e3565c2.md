Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) can be diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), serology or viral cultures, with PCR being the predominant method used.

Laboratory studies in HHV-6 may show leukocytosis, leukopenia, and anemia.

Indication for radiological imagining is dependent on the clinical presentation, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Chest radiography can be obtained to rule out other etiologies in adults including pneumonia and pneumonitis. The need for imaging is less frequently the case in children. Computed tomography (CT) of the head with and or without contrast can be obtained to search for other treatable diseases. In cases where the central nervous system is afflicted, a lumbar puncture can be performed. HHV-6 infection of the CNS often has a mild pleocytosis with elevated protein. CSF can be sent for HHV-6 PCR studies to confirm the diagnosis.
