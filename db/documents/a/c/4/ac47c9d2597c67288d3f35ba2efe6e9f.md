Any lesion can cause central or linguistic agraphia to the cortical language centers of the brain or to any of their associated subcortical structures. This is classically studied in stroke, which remains the most common cause of language impairment in general.

Neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer disease or frontotemporal dementia can also lead to central agraphia, in which case the onset is gradual with progressive worsening. Primary progressive aphasia and its subtypes represent clinical neurodegenerative syndromes, which are characterized predominantly by slowly worsening language impairment; notably, Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal degeneration are implicated in the majority of these cases.

As with central agraphia, peripheral agraphia can be caused by a myriad of lesions anywhere from the cortex to the peripheral nerve and muscle. However, in peripheral agraphia, these lesions disrupt the motor planning or motor output of writing.
