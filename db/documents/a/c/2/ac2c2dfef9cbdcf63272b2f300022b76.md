Mural thrombus development within the aneurysm sac is multifactorial.  The loss of endothelial homeostasis allows for activation of pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant mediators.  Additionally, as the aneurysm sac enlarges, the resultant turbulent flow causes decreased flow velocities along the luminal flow channel.  The result of these altered flow mechanics can lead to clot formation, and ultimately to thrombosis and/or embolism.

Chronic ischemia can develop as a result of repeated thromboembolic events originating from a popliteal artery aneurysm, which occurs in 85% of asymptomatic popliteal artery aneurysms.  As repeated insults occur, distal tibial vessels are occluded, leading to progressive limb ischemia and reliance on collateral vessels.
