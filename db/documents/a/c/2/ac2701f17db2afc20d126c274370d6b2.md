Specimen collection depends on the type of test chosen for diagnosis. To identify the exact type of α-thalassemia affecting a patient, a battery of various laboratory tests is required, including CBC and Hb analysis for identifying and quantifying various types of Hb like HbF, HbA2, HbH, HbBarts, HbCS (constant spring), etc. EDTA vials are used for whole blood collection for CBC, Hb analysis, and molecular testing.

Cytogenetic analysis on chorionic villi samples or cells isolated from the amniotic fluid sample is the procedure of choice for prenatal diagnosis of α-thalassemia in a suspected carrier or thalassemia minor parents. The intact chorionic villi can be preserved in a culture medium for up to 7 days.
