The sudden appearance of severe blistering and cellulitis may be seen in pemphigus, pemphigoid, Steven-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrosis, erythema multiforme; group A streptococcus, pseudomonas, clostridial or Aeromonas infection; radiation exposure, scalding, or UV exposure.

Any appearance of such skin findings, particularly on both lower extremities, following shellfish ingestion, should immediately suggest V. vulnificus infection.

Patients coming in with similar lesions (cellulitis, blistering, bullae, ecchymosis) on an extremity recently wounded in an aquatic environment is V. vulnificus until proven otherwise. Other causes could be skin reaction to applied medicaments (iodine, silver sulfadiazine, chlorhexidine), local hypersensitivity to tape, or concomitant sunburn or applied heat

Acute infectious gastroenteritis may be caused by a multitude of viral, bacterial, parasitic, and protozoan pathogens. Viruses predominate (60%), with noroviruses, rotaviruses, and adenoviruses accounting for many cases. Bacterial etiologies are second, with salmonella, staphylococcus, campylobacteria, E. coli (enteropathogenic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enteroinvasive E. coli ), Bacillus cereus, Shigella, Yersinia, Vibrionaceae, and Clostridia (C. perfringens and C. difficile). C. difficile is highly suspect in nursing home acquired gastroenteritis. Protozoa Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium are responsible for a smaller percentage of cases. Finally, intestinal parasites, such as Enterobius vermicularis, Ancylostoma duodenale, and Necator americanus, are all causative agents.

Non- infectious gastroenteritis is seen much less frequently than infectious and may be related to conditions such as Crohn disease, irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, lactose intolerance, or medications such as NSAIDs or colchicine are implicated in acute gastroenteritis presentations.
