Meningitis during the neonatal period is a potentially devastating condition with dire long-term consequences. Despite advances in preventive and critical care medicine, bacterial meningitis continues to have an adverse outcome rate of 20 to 60%. Although the incidence and mortality have declined over the past few decades, it remains difficult to diagnose due to pathogens varying with gestational age at birth, age at presentation, and geographic location, the often subtleness of clinical presentation, and inconsistent findings among infected individuals. Clinical evaluation and empiric treatment guidelines continue to evolve to support clinicians' efforts to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with neonatal meningitis. This activity primarily reviews the etiology, evaluation, and management of patients with neonatal meningitis and includes a discussion on the roles of interprofessional team members in coordinating patient care.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the common etiologies of neonatal meningitis.
- Implement current recommendations, including lumbar puncture, for evaluating patients with neonatal meningitis.
- Select the recommended antimicrobial therapy in patients with neonatal meningitis. 
- Explain the interprofessional team's role in caring for patients with neonatal meningitis.
