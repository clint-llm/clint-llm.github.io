Mebendazole is administered orally without regard to meals. The patient must chew the tablet completely before swallowing. For patients who have difficulty taking the tablet, it can be placed in a spoon and mixed with 2 to 3 ml of drinking water using a dosing syringe. The pill absorbs the water and turns into a soft mass with semi-solid consistency, which is easily swallowable.

Dosing of mebendazole for common FDA indications are listed below:

- Roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides): 100 mg twice daily (morning and night) for three consecutive days.

- Hookworm (Ancylostoma duodenale): 100 mg twice daily (morning and night) for three consecutive days

- Whipworm (Trichuris trichiura): 100 mg twice daily (morning and night) for three consecutive days

- Pinworm (Enterobius vermicularis): 100-mg single oral dose

If the patient does not achieve satisfactory results after three weeks of medication, then a second course of therapy is recommended. Dosing of mebendazole for common non-FDA approved indications are listed below:

- Capillariasis Infection: 200 mg to be administered orally twice daily for 20 days

- Cestodes Infection: 300 mg to be administered orally twice daily for 3 to 6 days

- Filariasis: 300 mg to be taken orally daily for 28 to 45 days

Less than ten (10%) of the drug undergoes systemic absorption after oral ingestion, and this portion undergoes metabolism rapidly by hepatic enzymes. Plasma levels may also decrease by carbamazepine or phenytoin or any CYP450 inducer. Cimetidine does not appreciably raise serum mebendazole, which is consistent with its poor systemic absorption.
