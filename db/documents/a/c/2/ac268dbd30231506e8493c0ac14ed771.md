Intraoperative neuromonitoring acts asÂ an alternative to wake-up testing to monitor for impending neurologic injury that is avoidable by altering the surgical technique, position, physiologic parameters, and/or medications. The use of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) intraoperatively began in the 1970s; they were one of the first intraoperative neuromonitoring techniques to be used.
