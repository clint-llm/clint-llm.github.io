Given the amount of data collected during the test, CPET is considered a specialized test and, as such, is often performed in cardiac or pulmonary testing centers. Technicians who perform cardiac stress tests and pulmonary function tests possess the necessary skills to perform CPET. Centers located in resource-rich communities may offer a package, which includes a history and physical examination with a specialist, a baseline EKG, an echocardiogram, CPET, and consultations focusing on fitness, healthy eating habits, and optimized disease management.
