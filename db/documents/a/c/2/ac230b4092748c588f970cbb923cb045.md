The pathophysiology of the disease shows increased osteoclastic activity due to signal abnormalities or decreased osteogenic potential of the bone due to defects in local vascularization of the bone. The disease can be genetic, as in the case of association with NF-1, or can be due to fibrous hamartoma and pathological periosteum.

Normally, NF-1 codes for Neurofibromin, a protein that negatively regulates Ras protein by inactivating Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP. Ras protein controls cell differentiation and cell proliferation. In cases of CPT associated with neurofibromatosis, NF-1 gene mutation occurs, leading to loss of neurofibromin activity, which causes maintenance of Ras-GTP, which is the active form of Ras and Ras-MAPK pathway defect leading to defective differentiation of osteoblasts. Also, osteoclastic activity increases due to overexpression of the Ras pathway, resulting in bone resorption.

In some cases of CPT, the pseudarthrosis tissue shows double activation of the NF-1 gene. In other cases of CPT, the diseased tibia bone shows insufficiency in osteogenesis and mechanical strength.

Simultaneously, reactive changes lead to medullary sclerosis with excess trabecular bone deposition in the medullary aspect.
