Pseudobulbar palsy is not a disease but a clinical constellation. Clinical conditions that involve corticobulbar tracts bilaterally can cause pseudobulbar palsy.

Neurological disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy are common causes of pseudobulbar palsy.

Rare causes of pseudobulbar palsy are:

- Central pontine myelinolysis: Common symptoms include pseudobulbar palsy.

- Bilateral thalamic infarction: Very rarely infarction of specific nuclei manifests as pseudobulbar palsy.

- Methotrexate-induced neurotoxicity: It is uncommon, but acute or subacute neurological clinical signs and symptoms, including pseudobulbar palsy, have been reported in the literature.

- Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: It rarely causes pseudobulbar symptoms.

- Cerebral malaria: Pseudobulbar palsy in cerebral malaria may occur probably due to demyelination.

- Bacterial endocarditis: Cerebral disturbance may occur in bacterial endocarditis and can manifest as pseudobulbar palsy.

- Syphilis: Requires CSF examination.

- Large petroclival meningioma: It presents as bulbar motor dysfunction and emotional lability that characterizes pseudobulbar palsy.

- Neurocysticercosis: It is uncommon.

Autoimmune encephalitis and Hashimoto encephalopathy causing pseudobulbar palsy have been reported; this highlights the importance of early detection of anti-thyroperoxidaseÂ antibodies in a patient with pseudobulbar palsy.
