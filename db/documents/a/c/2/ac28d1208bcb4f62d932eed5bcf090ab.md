Laser hair removal, depilatory creams, and electrolysis are used to remove unwanted hair. The Nd:Yag laser, Alexandrite laser, and diode laser are the most efficacious hair removal lasers. Depilatory creams typically contain calcium thioglycolate and barium sulfate and are effective though they may irritate the skin.
