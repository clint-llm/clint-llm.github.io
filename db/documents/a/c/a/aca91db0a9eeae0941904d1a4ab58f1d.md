Since EMB is an invasive procedure, it has both absolute and relative contraindications. Absolute contraindications to EMB include valvular diseases such as vegetations or stenosis and vascular pathologies such as aneurysm and thrombosis. Atrial myxomas have high embolic potential and should not be routinely biopsied.Â Relative contraindications include coagulopathy, the use of dual antiplatelet therapy, or therapeutic anticoagulants. In situations of contraindication, alternatives to endomyocardial biopsy are needed, which include tissue doppler echocardiography, scintigraphy, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI).
