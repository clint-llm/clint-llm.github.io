There are no oral formulations available for octreotide. Octreotide administration may be through a subcutaneous or intravenous route. Drug administration is usually as octreotide acetate injection, either as a subcutaneous or a long-acting release form. Compared to subcutaneous octreotide, the bioavailability of the long-acting release form is relatively low at about 60%. The subcutaneous form is available either as sterile 1-mL ampules in three strengths; 50 mg, 100 mg a, d  500 mg, or a  sterile 5-mL multidose vials in two strengths; 200 mg/mL and 1000 mg/mL. They are usually dosed three-times-daily, whereas the long-acting release form is a depot formulation containing a 10 to 30 mg dose of octreotide and is available in three strengths; 10 mg per 6 mL, 20 mg per 6 mL, and 30 mg per 6 mL, usually administered intramuscularly every 28 days.
