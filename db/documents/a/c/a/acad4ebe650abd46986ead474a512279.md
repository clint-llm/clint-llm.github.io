The incidence of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations is around 1:50,000 cases. They occur twice as often in women as occur in men.

Although these pulmonary AVMs are expected to be inherited and present at birth, they rarely manifest clinically before adult life. Acquired pulmonary AVMs are not as common, and the most common associations are liver cirrhosis and congenital heart disease surgery. Other rare associations include chest trauma, schistosomiasis of the lung, and metastatic lung disease.
