Primary care clinicians are commonly the first medical care providers to be informed about staring episodes or poor school performance, suggesting absence seizures, prompting a referral to neurology. After diagnosing absence epilepsy and initiating ethosuximide, both primary care physicians and neurologists should monitor for clinical benefit from ethosuximide therapy. If a patient remains seizure-free for over two years while on ethosuximide, and if the patient's EEG has normalized, one could consider slowly tapering the medication off over weeks to see if the patient developed terminal remission.

Ethosuximide therapy requires the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team, including clinicians as outlined above, but also nursing staff, pharmacists, and mental health professionals. Nursing can counsel on medications and the disease state and serve as a liaison between other disciplines. Pharmacists will verify appropriate dosing, check for potential drug-drug interactions, and offer the patient further counsel on proper medication administration. SPecialists will also weigh in with their opinion and work with the prescriber(s) to ensure the patient is receiving the appropriate therapeutic interventions. This interprofessional approach will optimize the therapeutic success of ethosuximide while minimizing adverse events. [Level 5]
