Because pruritus has many etiologies, a thorough history is essential to avoid unnecessary testing and delay in treatment. Brachioradial pruritus has a wide area of presentation but is most commonly reported on the dorsolateral arms. Adjacent areas that may be affected are in the C5 to C6 dermatome and include the upper arms, shoulders, and neck. In addition to pruritus, patients may report pain, stinging, or tingling in the affected area. Brachioradial pruritus is bilateral approximately 75% of the time.

The physical exam of the affected areas is not impressive and lacks primary cutaneous lesions. Secondary cutaneous lesions such as excoriations, prurigo nodules, or lichenification may be present due to excessive scratching.

Confounding factors include coexistent chronic pruritic conditions, skin diseases, topical or systemic medications, and unusual presentations.
