An assessment utilizing the ABCDE (airway, breathing, circulation, disability, exposure) approach should be performed upon initial presentation to assess the severity of intoxication/overdose quickly. Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation, should be obtained to aid in this initial assessment. An EKG should be obtained and assessed for any changes that may indicate the presence of any arrhythmias (e.g., torsades de pointes). An acetaminophen level should also be obtained to either confirm or rule out acetaminophen as a coingestant.

Diphenhydramine plasma levels do not provide any relevant clinical information and are also not readily available. Furthermore, despite undergoing extensive hepatic metabolism, diphenhydramine is not expected to cause any abnormal elevations in liver function tests or be linked to liver injury.
