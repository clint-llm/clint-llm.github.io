Imaging in stroke patients is an early and essential evaluation which should be done as soon as possible to confirm the diagnosis and start the appropriate therapy.

Stroke imaging performs in patients for the three main reasons:

- To differentiate the ischemic from hemorrhagic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhages; non-contrast CT is the primary modality for this process.

- To exclude other causes of stroke (i.e., stroke mimics such as tumors, seizure, etc.).

- To estimate the volume and location of the infarcted tissue and tissue at risk for infarction.

- To find the occluded artery in ischemic stroke and to help the treatment planning.

NCCT is the first-line imaging modality in most centers as the patient admitted and stabilized in the emergency room. It is performing to exclude hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage. The next imaging is CTP and CTA. In modern CT scanners, it is possible to perform the CTP and CTA at the same time with a single dose of contrast, but still, in many stroke centers, CTP and CTA are done by two contrast infusion. The non-contrast CT, CTA, and CTP are the backbone of ischemic “code-stroke” imaging in many stroke centers.
