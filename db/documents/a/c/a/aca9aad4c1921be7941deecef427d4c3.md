**Densely Granulated GH Cell Adenomas**

These constitute about 30% of GH-secreting pituitary adenomas, are characterized by cells similar to somatotrophs, and contain numerous large secretory granules. These are slow-growing tumors that present in middle age.

**Sparsely Granulated GH Cell Adenomas**

These constitute about 30% of GH-secreting pituitary adenomas and are characterized by pleomorphic cells with few secretory granules. These are rapidly growing tumors that present with severe disease at a young age.

**Mixed GH Cell and Prolactin Cell Adenoma**

These are about 20% of GH-secreting pituitary adenomas, characterized by densely granulated somatotrophs and sparsely granulated lactotrophs. They secrete GH and prolactin.

**Acidophilic Stem Cell Adenomas**

These are rare tumors and are characterized by giant mitochondria. Clinically these are aggressive tumors that invade the surrounding structures. They also secrete GH and prolactin.

**Mammosomatotroph Cell Adenoma**

These comprise about 10% of GH-secreting pituitary adenomas and are characterized by cells that secrete both GH and prolactin. They commonly occur in children and present with gigantism and hyperprolactinemia.

**Plurihormonal Cell Adenomas**

As the name suggests, these tumors may secrete multiple hormones GH, prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), Thyrotropin stimulating hormone (TSH), or Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH); the secondary hormonal products may be silent.
