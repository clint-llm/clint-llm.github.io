Simvastatin is an oral HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor indicated as an adjunct to diet. It is a semi-synthetic derivative of lovastatin, the first FDA-approved statin. Simvastatin helps lower cholesterol production and reduce dyslipidemia-associated complications. High concentrations of LDL cholesterol can lead to artery damage, potentially leading to cardiac complications and stroke. However, there are several more effective statins with more favorable adverse effect profiles. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of simvastatin, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating hyperlipidemia as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of simvastatin.
- Review the indications for using simvastatin in lipid control.
- Explain the adverse event profile of simvastatin and how it compares with other statin medications.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to examine simvastatin use and improve patient outcomes.
