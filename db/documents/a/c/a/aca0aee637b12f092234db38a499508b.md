The goals of micropenis management include:

- Minimize social embarrassment associated with micropenis

- The ability to achieve normal sexual function,

- Normal urinary function in the standing position

Medical or surgical interventions have had trials performed with variable responses. The primary etiology, age of presentation, degree of atrophy, and desired outcome usually dictate the treatment approach. A reasonable treatment plan for micropenis is a trial of medical therapy first, then surgical intervention if the medical treatment does not result in the desired outcomes.

**Medical Treatment**

- Testosterone is available as an intramuscular injection or topical gel. Intramuscular (IM) testosterone (25 mg) given every three weeks for three months is a traditional dosing regimen followed by a pediatric endocrinologist.

- Dihydrotestorne (DHT) (testosterone metabolite) reportedly has some efficacy (case reports and small case series), especially in infants with 5-Î± reeducate deficiency.

- Human recombinant FSH and LH administration can be a consideration in children with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

**Surgical Treatment**

A penile reconstruction is an option if the response to medical treatment is inadequate. Surgical treatment usually achieves acceptable results. However, dissatisfaction with penile appearance is common among treated patients.
