Information regarding IOP is of clinical importance during the ophthalmologic examination. There are situations, however, in which tonometry is challenging to obtain with certain instruments or can worsen the clinical conditions of the patient in specific conditions, which include:

**Ruptured globe:**Contact tonometry should be avoided or limited in the setting of a ruptured globe or suspicion of one.

**Infection:**When an infection such asÂ keratoconjunctivitis is suspected in one eye, the clinician should thoroughly disinfect or use a new cover before measuring the contralateral eye. This is also important when using the same tonometer between patients to prevent disease transmission.

**Unhealed corneal abrasions or ulcers, corneal scars, and elevated eyes with astigmatism:**Manipulation with tonometry can further aggravate active corneal lesions.

**Inability to administer or intolerance/allergies to topical anesthesia and/or fluorescein:**This contraindication is applicable to methods of tonometry requiring topical anesthesia before measurement of IOP.

**Difficulties or i****nability to use the tonometer:**Certain tonometry, like the gold standard Goldmann applanation, can only be used with a collaborative individual in an upright position. Other portable manual instruments, like iCare rebound tonometers, can be used in a supine position and require little patient collaboration, thus can be considered in bedridden and non-collaborative individuals and children.
