The prognosis of undifferentiated connective tissue disease usually relies on the degree of organ involvement. However, up to 60% of cases will remain undifferentiated, and others may progress into a defined connective tissue disease. A couple of factors may help in the prediction of this progression, for instance, the presence of cytopenias at the time of diagnosis, the degree of changes of the nail fold-capillaroscopy test during the follow-up sessions, and the antinuclear antibody titers, all of which may prove predictive about the disease in the future.

Up to 10 to 20% of patients diagnosed with undifferentiated connective tissue disease will never progress into a defined disease, and their symptoms will remit or subside. The progression rate into a defined connective tissue disease is the highest within the first five years of the disease onset; this rate tends to decrease over time, and patients who have progressed late to a defined disease appear to have a milder disease course with a lower chance to develop complications and adverse events. Additionally, the survival rates in these patients appear to be similar to those with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.

It is mentioned in a recent study which was published in 2019 that clinical practice guidelines or recommendations were not defined yet, and potential areas of intervention and a precise definition of undifferentiated connective tissue disease are still absent. This uncertainty regarding the name of the disease makes patients feel uncertain about the education and understanding of this disease.
