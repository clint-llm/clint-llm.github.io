The gestational sac and yolk sac are the first abnormal structures identifiable during a spontaneous abortion, a term synonymous with miscarriage or pregnancy loss. More specifically, an abnormal yolk sac is identifiable on ultrasound at least seven days before a spontaneous abortion, most of which occur during the first trimester. This finding is crucial for effectively managing and counseling patients during a spontaneous abortion.

During the first trimester, sonographic findings of the yolk sac give clinicians important information in terms of pregnancy outcomes.Â Absent, small, and large yolk sacs are associated with pregnancy loss compared to yolk sacs of pregnancies that continue past the first trimester.
