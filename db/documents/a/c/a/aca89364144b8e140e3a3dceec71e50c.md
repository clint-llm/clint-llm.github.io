Generally, the prognosis of erysipelas is good and can be managed in the outpatient setting. It responds well to oral antibiotics. However, extra caution should be taken in the immunocompromised and those with poor adherence to medication. Hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics is recommended in severe cases affecting those who are immunocompromised, infants, and the elderly. Close monitoring and observation are also recommended for those who will most likely not comply with instructions or complete their antibiotic course secondary to psychological or social reasons.
