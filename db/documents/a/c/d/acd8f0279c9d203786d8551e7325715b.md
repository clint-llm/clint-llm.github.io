Some patients tend to develop pruritus and eczema at the site of the lesion. This can usually be managed with symptomatic treatments (i.e., topical steroids).

Psychological problems, including depression, anxiety, and self-isolation, can result from body disfigurement secondary to congenital melanocytic nevi. Therapeutic strategies focused on cosmetic improvement should be discussed with the patients and their families, and psychological advice should be sought if necessary.

Melanomas arising from CMN are highly aggressive. They usually arise in the deep dermis or subcutis, presenting as papules or nodules, sometimes with ulceration. It is, therefore, difficult to detect them early on in their development. They can also develop in the CNS or other organs. Lymphadenopathy due to lymph node metastasis is frequently present at the time of diagnosis.

The presence of neurological involvement can be asymptomatic (noted on MRI), manifest as developmental delay, seizures, psychiatric symptoms, or result in increased intracranial pressure. The latter can present as irritability, lethargy, increased head circumference, cranial nerve palsies, etc. The prognosis in these patients is ominous, and they tend to die at a very early age.
