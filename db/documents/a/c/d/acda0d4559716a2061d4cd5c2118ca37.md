ThereÂ are several significant adverse effects been reported for bupropion. Many of these side effects occur in more than 10% of patients.

- Cardiovascular (tachycardia)

- Respiratory (rhinitis, pharyngitis)

- Central nervous system (insomnia, headache, agitation, dizziness)

- Dermatologic (diaphoresis)

- Endocrine (weight loss)

- Gastrointestinal (constipation, dry mouth, nausea)

- Musculoskeletal (tremor)

- Ophthalmologic (blurred vision)

The most severe adverse effects are lowered seizure threshold and the potential of worsening suicidal ideation.

Clinicians and researchers first noted the epileptic seizure occurrence in the 1980s, and bupropion was removed from the market from 1986 through 1989. The immediate-release preparation, especially in higher doses, appears to have the highest likelihood of causing seizures.
