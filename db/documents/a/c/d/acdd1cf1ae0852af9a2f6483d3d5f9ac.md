An epidural hematoma (EDH) is an extra-axial collection of blood within the potential space between the outer layer of the dura mater and the inner table of the skull. It is confined by the lateral sutures (especially the coronal sutures) where the dura inserts. It is a life-threatening condition, which may require immediate intervention and can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated. Rapid diagnosis and evacuation are important for a good outcome. This activity examines when this condition should be considered on differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate it. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of epidural hematomas.
- Explain when an epidural hematoma should be considered on differential diagnosis.
- Explain how to manage an epidural hematoma. 
- Explain the need for a well-integrated, interprofessional team approach to improve care for patients with epidural hematomas.
