Like other macrolide antimicrobials, azithromycin binds to the 23S portion of the 50S bacterial ribosomal subunit. It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by preventing the transit of aminoacyl-tRNA and the growing protein through the ribosome. Compared to erythromycin, azithromycin is less prone to disassociation from the gram-negative ribosome, conferring its greater efficacy against gram-negative pathogens.H. influenzae.

Pharmacokinetically, azithromycin rapidly moves from the bloodstream into tissues and, once there, readily crosses cellular membranes, allowing efficacy against intracellular pathogens.Babesia sp., Plasmodium sp., and Toxoplasma sp.), azithromycin inhibits the 50S ribosome found in the parasite apicoplast, an endosymbiosis-derived organelle with bacteria-like protein-synthesis machinery that performs critical metabolic functions.

In addition to azithromycinâ€™s antimicrobial activity, it is also a potent immunomodulator that has been shown to markedly reduce airway neutrophilia, IL-8 gene expression, and C-reactive protein levels in lung transplant recipients.
