Dens evaginatus/talon cusps may have additional pulpal tissue present, depending on the severity and when the developmental disturbance occurred during odontogenesis. With this complication, the restorative prognosis may be guarded without appropriate endodontic intervention. Additionally, these cusps are prone to traumatic fractures due to their unfavorable location in the plane of occlusion. If the traumatic fracture occurs, endodontic therapy may be warranted due to pulpal exposure.

Dens invaginatus has a higher predilection for caries formation due to their “funnel shape” that allows food debris or bacteria to progress faster and deeper into the tooth.

Amelogenesis imperfecta, with the different clinical presentations, often requires an interdisciplinary treatment approach. The generalized form of the condition is commonly associated with an underlying systemic syndrome, such as regional odontodysplasia, in which genetic counseling or genetic workup is indicated to manage any underlying syndrome appropriately.

Dentinogenesis imperfecta, especially DI type II, presents with greater pulpal tissue, which may complicate restorative interventions due to the higher frequency of pulpal exposure during restorative treatment or as a result of parafunctional habits.
