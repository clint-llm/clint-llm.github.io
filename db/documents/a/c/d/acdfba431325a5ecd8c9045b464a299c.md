The causes of QT interval prolongation can be divided into congenital or acquired. Congenital causes are usually a result of mutations in ion channels (potassium, calcium, or sodium) with more than 15 identified mutations. In contrast, acquired QT interval prolongation may be a result of electrolyte abnormalities, and/or drugs that affect those ion channels.
