The main advantages of PMBC are the lower cost and avoidance of a thoracotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass. One study revealed that the pathophysiology of mitral stenosis results in a decrease in coronary flow reserve (CFR). Therapy with PMBC significantly improves CFR and subsequently leads to improved cardiac output from the right and left chambers.

Proper patient selection and appropriate balloon sizing during the procedure can help improve outcomes and prevent PMBC complications.
