Myofibroblastoma of the breast is a benign tumor of mesenchymal origin associated with the deletion of chromosome 13q14, similar to spindle cell lipoma and cellular angiofibroma.

Myofibroblasts respond to tissue injury. The injured cells or cells with malignant potential produce cytokines, including transforming growth factor β1. This helps the fibroblasts to migrate into the injured tissue. This process is followed by the development of smooth muscle actin fibers, which eventually transform into myofibroblasts with contractility. The contraction in the injured tissue increases the speed of healing and repair.

The size of myofibroblastomas usually ranges between 1 and 3 cm. However, larger masses measuring up to 13 cm have also been reported.

Although extra-mammary location is uncommon, it can still occur mostly along the embryonic milk line, which extends from the axilla to the inguinal region.
