The basic structure of the femoral triangle is highly conserved and could theoretically undergo alteration by the congenital absence of a muscle that composes one of its borders or rare anatomical malformation of its contents. The overall size of the femoral triangle can vary based on the size of the individual. Many of the structures that pass through the femoral triangle are critical to the viability of the limb and are also highly conserved.

The branches of the femoral artery, such as the deep femoral artery and lateral circumflex arteries, display more anatomic variance in their origin, with most diverging from the artery posterior-laterally and some diverging posteriorly or posterior-medially.
