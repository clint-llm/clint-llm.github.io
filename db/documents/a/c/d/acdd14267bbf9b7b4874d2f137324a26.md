Prenatal diagnosis is made through routine ultrasound techniques for gestation and fetal echocardiography. Visualization of structural abnormalities or deviations from standard flow patterns may distinguish a single ventricle in utero.

Post-natal diagnosis is made through a variety of techniques. Echocardiography is the best modality for the diagnosis of a single ventricle. Other techniques may aid in the diagnosis of a single ventricle, including electrocardiography, plain chest films, and pulse oximetry.
