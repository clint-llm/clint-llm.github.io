Management favors nonoperative and conservative treatment in hemodynamically stable patients. Conservative measures include fluid/blood replacement as necessary with monitoring. Patients should be considered for surgical intervention if they are hemodynamically unstable, have a significant injury to other systems, or are currently on anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy. Candidates for surgical intervention will undergo exploratory laparotomy for assessment, repair, or removal. Angiographic embolization also may be considered as an alternative to surgery in patients who fail nonoperative management.
