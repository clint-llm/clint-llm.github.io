Once a patient has developed bladder stones, the chances of getting recurrent stones are increased. Therefore it is important to identify and treat the underlying cause. Patients must be counseled that drinking plenty of water would protect them from stone formation because increase water intake would dilute all the minerals that precipitate to form stones in the urinary tract. If the prostate is enlarged it should be removed by surgery to prevent stasis of urine in the bladder.
