In a neglected symptomatic talocalcaneal coalition, the natural progression would be a stiff subtalar joint with a hindfoot valgus affecting the gait mechanism and leading to pain and recurrent ankle sprains and leading to degeneration in the ankle, Choparts, and the forefoot joints.

Complications ofÂ resection of a talocalcaneal coalition include recurrence of the coalition, damage to posteromedial structures like the flexor digitorum longus, tibialis posterior, flexor hallucis longus, and the posterior tibial neurovascular structure, persistent discomfort, superficial infections, minor wound problems, scar sensitivity, hypertrophy, mild paraesthesia.

PROMs after surgical excision of a tarsal coalition reveal that over 70% of patients' activities are not subject to restriction from pain, and their functional outcome is good.
