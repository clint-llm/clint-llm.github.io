Particular attention is paid to home glucose monitoring to learn the patterns of glucose variability and their relation to life circumstances such as school, exercise, and physical stresses such as illness and menses. Insulin dose adjustment is performed with child and family input, as appropriate.

Hemoglobin A1c is typically measured at clinic visits as a measure of average glucose over the prior two to three months. The American Diabetes Association recommends Hemoglobin A1c be less than 7.5%, although large population studies suggest only 20% to 25% of children and adolescents achieve this.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has become more common in children and adolescents, and measures of "time in range" and glucose variability are likely to be even more valuable than Hemoglobin A1c, although insurance does not universally cover CGM and is not always desired by patients.

Screening for thyroid disorders is performed at regular intervals and screening for celiac disease is typically done as well, although the frequency is not established. Regular screening for lipid disorders, microalbuminuria, and retinopathy are recommended based on the duration of diabetes. Assessment of mental health and psychosocial factors are also important.

Islet cell antibodies are not usually measured to make the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. These antibodies are only found in about 5% of children and are not specific markers. One should obtain a baseline lipid profile. In addition, urinary albumin should start at age 12 as these children are susceptible to end-stage renal disease.
