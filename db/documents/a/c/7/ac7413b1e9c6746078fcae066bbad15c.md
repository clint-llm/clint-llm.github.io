- Spinal cord stimulators are composed of three main parts: the electrodes or leads, which can be cylindrical or paddle, the implantable pulse generator (IPG) or batteries, and the charging and reprogramming equipment, which includes a remote control.

- Many different companies currently make these devices. However, the bulk of the neuromodulation market is primarily three companies.

- All these companies offer the option of rechargeable IPG devices that last for up to 10 years years. This setup allows patients to use higher voltages without depleting the battery, increases the reprogramming options, and requiring less frequent replacement.

- Additionally, each IPG has a different level of MRI conditionality. If MRI imaging is pertinent in the patient's future healthcare management, a review of the conditionalities of each IPG should take place before making a selection.
