Patients with acute mesenteric ischemia usually need immediate surgical intervention. Treatment should begin promptly in the emergency department with aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics (with coverage for bowel flora). If the patient remains hypotensive despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, a norepinephrine drip should be started. However, vasopressors can technically worsen ischemia and should be used with caution.

Mesenteric arterial occlusion from an embolism is treated with early surgical laparotomy with embolectomy. Although still being researched, some patients with a very early diagnosis of mesenteric arterial embolism (without signs of peritonitis) can be treated with local infusion of a thrombolytic agent. Mesenteric arterial thrombosis usually needs surgical revascularization or stenting. Mesenteric venous thrombosis can sometimes be managed medically with systemic anticoagulation, but it is dependent upon disease severity. Treatment of NOMI aims to eliminate the underlying cause that is causing the ischemia, for example, removing the vasoconstrictive medications that are causing the mesenteric artery to spasm.

As long as there are no contraindications, patients are usually treated with systemic anticoagulation after surgical intervention.
