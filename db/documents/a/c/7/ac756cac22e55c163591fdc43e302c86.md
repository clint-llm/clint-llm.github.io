LDL-cholesterol is a leading cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); this involves many processes that ultimately result in ASCVD. LDL accumulates in circulating macrophages, following modifications such as oxidation of LDL. The oxidized LDL acts as a chemoattractant for monocytes, which become macrophages. These macrophages become trapped in the vessel wall, likely due to abnormal endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1.

Triglyceride-rich-HDL also carries implications in ASCVD, and it reduces macrophage efflux capacity, promotes monocyte infiltration in the arterial wall, and increases pro-inflammatory genes. Apolipoprotein C-III, which inhibits LPL, may also promote atherosclerosis by resulting in elevated triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Studies have found that lower C-III is associated with lower triglyceride levels and reduced risk for ASCVD.

Apo B-100 is directly related to the LDL particle number. When ApoB-100 lipoproteins become elevated, the risk of atherosclerosis is increased even in the absence of additional risk factors. Some propose that atherogenesis is due to the subendothelial retention of apo B-100 by proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix.
