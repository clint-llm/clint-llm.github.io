A fistula-in-ano is an epithelial-lined tract connecting the anal canal to the perianal skin. Anal fistulas can have many causes but are most commonly the result of an anorectal abscess. Classification of the fistula is determined in relation to the anal sphincters. Although benign, the condition can cause significant distress and embarrassment to the patient. Treatment focuses on control of the infection and maintaining fecal continence. Many treatment options are available, and novel treatments are steadily proposed and tested. This article will review the fundamental principles of fistula-in-ano diagnosis and treatment.
