Drug elimination is the sum of the processes of removing an administered drug from the body.  In the pharmacokinetic ADME scheme (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion), it is frequently considered to encompass both metabolism and excretion.   Hydrophobic drugs, to be excreted, must undergo metabolic modification making them more polar. Hydrophilic drugs, on the other hand, can undergo excretion directly, without the need for metabolic changes to their molecular structures.

Although many sites of metabolism and excretion exist, the chief organ of metabolism is the liver, while the organ primarily tasked with excretion is the kidney.  Any significant dysfunction in either organ can result in the accumulation of the drug or its metabolites in toxic concentrations.

A variety of other factors impact elimination — intrinsic drug properties, such as polarity, size, or pKa.  Also other factors include genetic variation among individuals, disease states affecting other organs, and pathways involved in the way the drug distributes through the body, such as first-pass metabolism.
