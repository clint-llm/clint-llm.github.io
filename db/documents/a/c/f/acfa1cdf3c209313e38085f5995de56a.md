Laboratory diagnosis of trichuriasis is based on the microscopic examination of stool samples to determine the presence and, if possible, the number of eggs.

Stool samples may also demonstrate red blood cells (RBCs), and white blood cells (WBCs), specifically eosinophils. A complete blood count may show anemia.

There have been case reports of patients reporting symptoms in areas that have adequate resources where the diagnosis has been made with sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. The classic finding is the “coconut cake rectum” from white bodies of adult worms dangling from inflamed mucosa.

There have recently been studies that show a "whipworm dance" on ultrasound which is when the lumen of the appendix wriggles continuously. This is a modality that can easily be used in resource-poor settings.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are currently being developed and used in research settings. This has improved the specificity and sensitivity of detecting the whipworm.
