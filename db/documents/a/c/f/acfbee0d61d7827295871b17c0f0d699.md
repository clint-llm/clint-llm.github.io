As previously detailed, complications can include female infertility and spontaneous abortion, increased incidence of STIs to include HIV, urinary tract obstruction potentially leading to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease, and bladder cancer.

Bladder cancer related to chronic UGS is the most common squamous cell carcinoma, in comparison to transitional cell carcinoma that is the most common type of bladder cancer overall. The etiology is multifactorial and includes chronic irritation and inflammation, restorative hyperplasia, and subsequent DNA and tissue damage.

Individuals with schistosomiasis, including from S. haematobium, are also more susceptible to Salmonella typhi and other Salmonella species causing prolonged bacteremia. Chronic inflammation can also lead to many subsequent issues to include anemia of chronic disease, malnutrition, and stunting of growth in children.
