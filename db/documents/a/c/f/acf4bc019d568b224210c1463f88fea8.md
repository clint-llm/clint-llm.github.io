The diagnosis of herpangina is usually made clinically. In mild cases, no imaging or laboratory testing is required. Laboratory studies are usually obtained to gain additional information about complications such as dehydration or to rule out alternative diagnoses. The white blood cell count is usually within normal limits, though lymphocytosis may be seen in some situations. Confirmatory testing is usually required only in complicated disease, for the collection of epidemiological data during epidemics, or to differentiate herpangina from more serious diseases such as eczema herpeticum. Isolation of the enterovirus in cell culture is the “gold standard” for confirmatory testing, which can often take longer than a week to obtain results. This makes it an impractical test for clinical practice. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is fast and highly sensitive for enteroviruses. Samples may be obtained from the stool, mucocutaneous ulcers, vesicular fluid, or cerebrospinal fluid. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) testing is also available. ELISA testing for enteroviruses is generally less sensitive than PCR and should be utilized only in cases where PCR is not available. Serum antibodies to coxsackievirus may also be measured after clinical symptoms have developed. The antibody titer may show a four-fold rise in serial samples conducted two to three weeks apart.
