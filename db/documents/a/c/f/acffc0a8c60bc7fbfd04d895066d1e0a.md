Only a few reports have investigated the histopathological features of Best vitelliform macular dystrophy.

Histopathology of a 69-year-old male with BVMD showed

- Accumulation of lipofuscin within the RPE, particularly at the fovea. Lipofuscin was confirmed by staining, ultrastructural appearance, and autofluorescence properties.

- Other features included:

- Accumulation of heterogeneous material between RPE and Bruch's membrane, which likely derived from degenerating RPE cells containing lipofuscin
- Loss of foveal photoreceptors above the lesion
- Photoreceptor outer segment debris and phagocytic cells in the subretinal space

Histology of another eye showed 'well-circumscribed area of RPE hyperplasia, accumulation of lipofuscin in the RPE, deposition of granular material in the photoreceptors, macrophages, and drusen.'

Mullin and colleagues reported a male who was noted to have small macular vitelliform lesions and extramacular subretinal flecks in both eyes for the first time at 75 years of age.

Histopathological evaluation of a 28-year-old male with vitelliruptive stage 'with some features of a pseudohypopyon' revealed diffuse RPE abnormality with an accumulation of lipofuscin. Lipopigment was noted 'within the RPE, within macrophages in the subretinal space, and within the choroid.'

Frangieh and colleagues suggested that the changes in the neurosensory retina were primary, and RPE changes were secondary.

Also, the brilliant autofluorescence of the vitelliform lesion might suggest the deposited material to be A2E or lipofuscin. However, angiographic evidence of generalized deposition of lipofuscin in RPE causing block fluorescence (dark choroid in fluorescein angiogram as seen in Stargardt disease) is not a feature in BVMD.
