It occurs most commonly unilaterally. There is an increased risk of uveal melanoma and glaucoma in these cases. This activity reviews the evaluation and clinical diagnosis of nevus of Ota and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review histopathology of nevus of Ota.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation steps for a possible nevus of Ota.
- Outline treatment options for nevus of Ota.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with nevus of Ota.
