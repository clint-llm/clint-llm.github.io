An interprofessional approach is vital for better clinical outcomes. Early diagnosis and referral to a neurosurgeon, vascular surgeon, or interventional radiologist have better outcomes in patients with ruptured saccular aneurysms. An interprofessional team including but not limited to an emergency medicine clinician, a neurosurgeon, an endovascular interventional neuroradiologist,Â intensivist, vascular surgeon, cardiothoracic surgeon, neurologist, cardiologist, physical therapist, speech therapist, occupational therapist, nurse, pharmacist, and a nephrologist is recommended for proper care and management for better clinical outcomes and early hospital discharge.
