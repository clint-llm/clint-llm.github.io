Since prediabetes is the precursor for diabetes mellitus, the pathophysiology is relatable. Hyperglycemia will cause production and release of insulin by the pancreatic beta cells. Excess insulin exposure for long periods of time diminishes the reponse of the insulin receptors the function of which is to open glucose channels leading to entry of glucose into the cells. Decreased function of the insulin receptors leads to further hyperglycemia further perpetuating the metabolic disturbance and leading to the development of not only diabetes type 2 but also metabolic syndrome. In prediabetes, this process is not to the extent of diabetes mellitus but is a first step in a metabolic cascade which has potentially dangerous consequences if not adequately addressed. Hence its imperative to start treatment at the earliest.
