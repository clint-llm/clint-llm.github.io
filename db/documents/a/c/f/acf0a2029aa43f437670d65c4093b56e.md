Classically, acute hemolytic transfusion reaction is described as a triad of symptoms; fever, flank pain, and red or brown urine. However, this classic presentation is not seen often. Other symptoms are chills, hypotension, renal failure, back pain, or signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation. On a peripheral blood smear, signs are consistent with immune hemolysis such as keratocytes, helmet cells, bite cells, blister cells, spherocytes, or microsporocytes. There is urinary hemosiderin on urine analysis. Serum haptoglobin is low, lactate dehydrogenase and unconjugated bilirubin are high.

Delayed transfusion reactions are usually insidious. Patients present late after transfusion, 24 hours to 30 days. The presenting symptom is usually jaundice or low-grade fever. Clinical labs look similar to those described above and are consistent with hemolysis.

Non-immune hemolysis patients present like acute hemolytic transfusion reaction patients.
