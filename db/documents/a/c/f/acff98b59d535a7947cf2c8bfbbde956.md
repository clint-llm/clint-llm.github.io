The management of cardiac allograft vasculopathy in post-cardiac transplant patients requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that includes a nurse, physician assistant, laboratory technologists, pharmacists, pathologists, social workers, and a number of physicians in different specialties. Before the transplant, a social worker must assess the patient's socioeconomic factors to see if compliance with medication and support through the process of transplant is adequate. Nurses, especially advanced practice nurses, and PAs play an essential link between patients and cardiologists. Given the high number of medications prescribed post-transplant, with various interactions and side effects, pharmacists become an integral part of the management team, and emphasis should be placed on patient education. CAV may be confused for graft rejection, in which case endomyocardial biopsies aid in the diagnosis, and for this, a pathologist trained in immunology is vital. Lastly, not only cardiologists and cardiac surgeons but primary care physicians, nephrologists, hemato-oncologists, and pulmonologists may have a role to play in the management of these patients, and interprofessional rounds during inpatient hospitalizations are imperative to improving the quality of care delivered.
