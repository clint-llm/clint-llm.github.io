The management of setmelanotide requires both extensive supervision and team collaboration to ensure patient safety and the best possible outcomes. Interprofessional communication among physicians, psychiatrists, pharmacists, and geneticists is crucial. The clinician's role is to determine the screening eligibility of the patient. Since obesity is the number one cause of many ailments, psychiatrists must manage patient concerns to monitor depressive episodes and any new mental health diagnoses.

Setmelanotide is administered subcutaneously; therefore, the pharmacist's role is to double-check any contradictions and drug-drug interactions and monitor the long-term effects of the dose. Lastly, the most important role goes to the geneticist, who determines whether the patient is eligible to receive the medication depending on their genetic testing to look for specific deficiencies as described above. All these clinical professionals must constantly communicate with each other regarding the patient's conditions and the therapeutic effects to avoid severe adverse drug reactions (ADR).

The management of this medication requires safety in ordering the medication, handling and preparing the subcutaneous administration, proper and detailed documentation, and detailed ongoing evaluations. The administration of drugs should follow strict protocols to ensure patient safety. In efforts to coordinate care for patients on Setmelanotide, the following steps must be taken to ensure positive outcomes:

- The physician recommends setmelanotide based on eligibility according to the patient's Body Mass Index (BMI) and other risk factors like cardiovascular health, diabetes, hyperphagia, etc.

- The physician then orders genetic testing for the patient to evaluate them for the setmelanotide therapy.

- The geneticists must then determine whether the patient is eligible to receive setmelanotide after a precise genetic testing report.

- The physician/nurse administers setmelanotide via subcutaneous therapy while following all strict precautions to keep the patient safe from infection and other adverse events.

- The physician and psychiatrist continue to monitor all side effects and long-term management of the drug.

Setmelanotide has been known to cause depression and suicidal ideation, as described above.

Overall, the goal of the interprofessional team is to improve patient outcomes and put patient safety at the forefront. However, the impact goes beyond the clinical outcomes. Among clinicians, geneticists will increase genetic testing with the increased use of this medication.

In long-term usage of Setmelanotide, if the medication effects are sub-minimal and the expected weight loss is not achieved, or if the side effects outweigh the therapeutic effects of the drug, then it is the physician's responsibility to reevaluate the drug dosage and concentration while keeping the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug in mind.
