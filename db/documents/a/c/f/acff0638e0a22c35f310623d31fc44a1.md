Treatment for sudden cardiac arrest should be initiated immediately by lay people and EMS. Treatment includes the use of an automated external defibrillator and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). CPR provides enough oxygen to the brain until a stable electrical rhythm can be established.

After transfer to a hospital, therapeutic hypothermia can be induced to limit neurologic injury and reperfusion injuries. Therapeutic hypothermia is more effective for the management of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation but can also be used in PEA and asystole. Limitations to therapeutic hypothermia include a tympanic membrane temperature below 30 degrees at presentation, being comatose before the sudden cardiac arrest, pregnancy, inherited coagulation disorder, and the terminally ill patient.

If a patient survives the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, long-term treatment is aimed at the underlying cause.

An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is used for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in any person who has experienced arrhythmia-related syncope or survived sudden cardiac arrest.

Medication is targeted at the underlying cause of sudden cardiac arrest.
