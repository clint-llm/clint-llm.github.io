An interprofessional team approach should be utilized to tailor an individualized pain management plan for the postoperative patient. The team should include the patient’s primary care provider, a pharmacist, the operating surgeon, anesthesiologist, operating room, and nursing staff involved in the case. Depending on the patient’s history or nature of the procedure, a pain management specialist, physical therapist, or psychiatrist may be included in the patient’s pain management plan as well.

In recent years, the development of Acute Pain Service (APS) groups and Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs has been implemented by many facilities to help establish pain score monitoring protocols and improve intervention strategies to help manage postoperative pain within surgical wards. Theoretically, the parameters set by these programs would allow ward nurses to play a more active role in the monitoring and managing of postoperative pain, which would allow for increasingly adequate pain control.
