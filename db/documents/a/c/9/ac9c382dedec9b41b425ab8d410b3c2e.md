Side effects of radiation therapy include radiation dermatitis, neurocognitive toxicity, and endocrinopathies in the future.

Patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy with radiotherapy are at increased risk for leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatotoxicity. Weekly CBC with differential and liver function tests are recommended. Severe thrombocytopenia can result in withholding of radiotherapy until blood counts are stabilized. Due to lymphopenia especially affecting CD4 count, pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis should be administered to all patients receiving daily chemotherapy while on radiotherapy.
