The elastic deformability of red blood cells is formed by the cytoskeleton protein located underneath the cell membrane. The five interconnected proteins involved are spectrin, ankyrin, protein 4.2, band 3 protein, and glycophorin C. Any genetic abnormalities affecting this protein can change the structure and function of these proteins leading to abnormal red blood cells and abnormal deformability.

Most cases of hereditary elliptocytosis are due to genetic defects affecting alpha spectrin, beta spectrin, protein 4.1, band 3, and rarely glycophorin C. These changes include single base substitution, insertion, deletions, or mRNA processing changes. The mutation in the gene encoding alpha spectrin is SPTA1, beta spectrin is SPTB, and protein 4.1 is EPB41. In most HE cases, SPTA1 mutation is the most common, occurring in 65%, followed by mutations in SPTB (30%) and EPB41 (5%). Hereditary elliptocytosis is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion except for hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP), which is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.
