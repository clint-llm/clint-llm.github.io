It is important to exclude all causes of scrotal enlargement or scrotal mass. A detailed focused history, physical examination, and ultrasonography are helpful diagnostic tools. The differential diagnosis of filarial hydrocele includes all of the following:

- Common hydrocele (non-infectious origin)

- Inguinal hernia

- Spermatocele

- Varicocele

- Epididymal cyst

- Testicular tumors

- Appendix testis

Other conditions that need to be excluded are idiopathic scrotal edema. In the case of painful scrotal enlargements, testicular torsion, infectious epididymo-orchitis, or orchitis should be considered as well.
