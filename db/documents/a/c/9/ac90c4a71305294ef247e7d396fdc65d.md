After confirmation of a potentially suitable donor, a shaved, washed (4% chlorhexidine) and the fasting patient is taken to the operation room in coordination with the donor heart's availability. This is done in coordination with the transplant registry that selects the appropriate donor heart after matching. General anesthesia is not induced to the recipient until the donor heart acceptability is confirmed. After confirming availability, the recipient's heart should be removed before the donor's heart is available to reduce ischemia time. Once the recipient's chest is opened, the heart and surrounding anatomy are dissected and prepared to go on cardiopulmonary bypass. The donor heart retrieval is timed to prevent ischemia time.Â The whole surgery is carried under general anesthesia using cardiopulmonary bypass, transesophageal echocardiography, and multiple monitoring techniques including but not limited to the Swan-Ganz catheter.
