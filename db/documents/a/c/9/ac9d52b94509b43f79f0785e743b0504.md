History should include the medical condition(s) that prompted CQ or HCQ therapy, the time since the start of therapy and the daily dose in mg per kilogram of the patient's actual weight.  Ideal weight was the preferable measure in the past but can cause overdosing of thin patients, and the patient's actual weight is now the preferred measure.

Vortex keratopathy (corneal verticillata) rarely causes vision complaints. In some advanced cases, patients may notice haloes and glare. The deposits occur within the sub-epithelium, do not stain, and are non-irritating.  Verticillata appears as bilateral fine, golden-brown or gray opacities in the inferior cornea that branch out from a central whorl.
