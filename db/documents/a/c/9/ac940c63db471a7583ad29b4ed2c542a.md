Glaucoma is a chronic and serious disease that can result in permanent vision loss if not taken care of properly. Regular eye appointments and compliance with medication are vital to helping slow down disease progression. Since glaucoma has a hereditary component, it is important to educate family members thatÂ they may be at an increased risk to develop glaucoma and may need to have screening done regularly by an eye doctor for early detection.
