An incomplete abortion is the partial loss of the products of conception within the first 20 weeks. Incomplete abortion usually presents with moderate to severe vaginal bleeding, which may be associated with lower abdominal and/or pelvic pain. It is important to diagnose this early to make sure the patient expels all products of conception. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of incomplete abortion and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of incomplete abortions.
- Describe the evaluation of incomplete abortions.
- Outline the management options available for incomplete abortions.
- Summarize the importance of coordination and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients with an incomplete abortion.
