**Dosage Formulations**

Lovastatin is available in two forms, immediate and extended-release tablets. Immediate-release tablets are recommended for administration in the evening with food, and extended-release taken at bedtime. Both dosage forms are not to be crushed or chewed. Lovastatin immediate release is available in 20 mg and 40 mg tablets. The extended-release tablets are available in 20, 40, or 60 mg. Extended-release tablets are not recommended for patients that only need small amounts of reduction in cholesterol levels.

**Adult Dosing**

- Lovastatin at a dose of 20 mg per day is considered a low-intensity statin as it normally reduces LDL-C by less than 30%.

- Lovastatin at a dose of 40 - 80 mg per day is considered a moderate-intensity statin as it normally reduces LDL-C by 30% to 50%.

Before initiating treatment with lovastatin, other causes for hypercholesterolemia should be ruled out. These include alcoholism, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, dysproteinemias, hypothyroidism, obstructive liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, and/or other drug therapy. A complete lipid profile should be investigated to measure total-C, HDL-C, and TG. Lovastatin is indicated for heterozygous familial hyperlipidemia and prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (primary prevention in patients with or without diabetes and secondary prevention in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease like coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, ischemic stroke, and/or transient ischemic attack).

- Before starting lovastatin, the patient should be started on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet as per NCEP Treatment Guidelines for six weeks and continue this diet throughout treatment. Patients should avoid taking grapefruit juice since it may increase drug toxicity and adverse effects.

- When initiating the treatment, consider the patient’s 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk scores, LDL-C at baseline, and patient and medicine-specific factors. Lovastatin needs to be used in conjugation with lifestyle changes like exercise and dietary modifications.

- Recommended starting dose is 20 mg once a day with an evening meal. The maximum recommended dose is 80 mg once daily. Dosages should be individualized to treatment goals and adjusted at 4-week intervals. According to AHA guidelines, reassess patient clinical response after one to three months of treatment initiation with lovastatin and once stabilized reassess annually.

- A lower starting dose of 10 mg of lovastatin may be considered for some when patients require smaller reductions in cholesterol levels. Consider reducing the dose of lovastatin if cholesterol levels fall drastically below the targeted range for individuals.

**Specific Patient Population**

**Adolescent Patients(10 - 17 years ):**In patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, recommended lovastatin dose ranges between 10 to 40 mg per day, and the maximum recommended dose should not exceed 40 mg per day. Lovastatin dose should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy as per NCEP pediatric panel guidelines. Consider starting dose at 10 mg for patients requiring smaller reductions in LDL-C. When reduction in LDL-C of 20% or more desired, then start lovastatin dose at 20 mg per day.

**Patients with Renal Impairment:**In patients with severe renal impairment with CrCL less than 30 mL/min, use caution when the lovastatin dose is more than 20 mg per day.

**Patients with Hepatic Impairment:**No dose adjustment is studied/provided in the manufacturer’s prescribing label.

**Pregnancy Considerations:**After a comprehensive review of all available data, the U.S. FDA has removed the strongest warnings against using HMG-co-A Reductase Inhibitors in pregnant women. However, most women should not take lovastatin once they become pregnant. Assess the risk versus benefits to the pregnant patient.

**Breastfeeding Considerations:**It is not known whether lovastatin gets excreted in human milk. Because a small amount of another drug in this class is excreted in human breast milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women taking lovastatin should not nurse their infants.
