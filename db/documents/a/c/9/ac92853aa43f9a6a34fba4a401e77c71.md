Anemia of chronic renal disease is of multifactorial origin, the widely accepted etiology being decreased renal production of erythropoietin (EPO), the hormone responsible for stimulating red blood cell production. Decreased erythropoietin has recently been linked with the downregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a transcription factor that regulates gene expression of erythropoietin.

RBC fragmentation by injured renovascular endothelium in selected conditions such as glomerulopathy and malignant hypertension exacerbates the anemia, which explains why anemia can be particularly severe in renal glomerulopathies, including glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, for the degree of excretory failure.
