Lobectomy patient interprofessional care focuses on postoperative care. The interprofessional team includes the thoracic surgeon, anesthesia team, nurse staff (operation room, postoperative care unit, thoracic surgery unit), chest physical therapy, and social services. The surgical team directs decisions. Postoperative management will be by nursing staff (pain medication, thoracic drainage, monitorization vigilance, and chest physical therapy instructions), pharmacy (pain control), and adequate pulmonary hygiene are essential for fast-tracking results. Patient education consists of teaching respiratory therapy exercises and early mobilization to enhance pulmonary recovery. This patient health care pathway has demonstrated a reduction in the length of hospital stay and costs.

Nursing staff, including operating room specialty nursing, can prepare the patient for the procedure, assist and monitor during the surgery, and provide post-operative care (including antimicrobial measures as needed) and monitoring, alerting the surgeon of any concerns they encounter. With appropriate interprofessional measures as outlined above, patient outcomes can reach their optimal potential. [Level 5]
