The sensitization of the mother depends on multiple factors, including the volume of transplacental hemorrhage, the extent of the maternal immune response, and the concurrent presence of ABO incompatibility. It affects 17% of pregnant women with 1mL of Rh-positive cells and 70% after 250mL of rhesus-positive cell exposure.

Generally, no effects are seen in first pregnancies for Rh-D mediated disease as IgM is a large pentamer that can not cross the placental barrier. However, during the following pregnancies, subsequent exposure of as little as 0.03mL of Rh-positive cells can lead to the formation of anti-D IgG immunoglobulins, which cross the placenta freely and bind to fetal red blood cells containing D-surface antigen. These antibody-coated cells are recognized by the fetal reticuloendothelial system, and the destruction of these cells causes the release of large amounts of bilirubin in fetal circulation. During the antenatal period, maternal conjugation enzymes remove the excess of bilirubin, but after birth due to early insufficiency of glucuronyltransferase enzymatic activity, neonates present with jaundice or kernicterus and severe hemolytic anemia.
