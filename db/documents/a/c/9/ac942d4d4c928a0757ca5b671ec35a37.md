Almost 25 percent of the people with lung carcinoid tumors may not present with any symptoms of the disease. They may be diagnosed incidentally while being tested for another condition.

The most common presenting symptoms of bronchopulmonary carcinoid tumors are:

- Coughing or wheezing

- Hemoptysis

- Symptoms referable to the consequences of collapse or pneumonia distal to airway obstruction.

Since this tumor is primarily a carcinoid tumor, the patient's may present with symptoms of carcinoid syndrome:

- Facial flushing

- Shortness of breath

- High blood pressure

- Weight gain

- Hirsutism

- Asthma-like symptoms

Small carcinoids may be asymptomatic and only discovered, incidentally.

Most cases are endocrinologically silent at the clinical level. Clinical syndromes secondary to peptide production are uncommon, they include carcinoid syndrome, Cushing syndrome, and acromegaly.
