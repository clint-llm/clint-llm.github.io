Benign occipital seizures are classified as an occipital onset epilepsy syndrome, which occurs in children with normal developmental milestones, normal general and neurological examination, and without any structural abnormalities in the brain. These epilepsies are broadly classified into 2 categories, Panayiotopoulos syndrome and idiopathic childhood occipital epilepsy of Gastaut (ICOE-G), based on their clinical presentation. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of benign occipital seizures and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of benign occipital seizures.
- Outline the clinical presentation of benign occipital seizures.
- Review the management options available for benign occipital seizures.
- Describe the prognosis of benign occipital seizures.
