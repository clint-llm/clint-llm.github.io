The epidemiology of NTM lung infections has been challenging to determine, due to the following:

- In many countries, it is not mandatory to report the condition to the public health departments

- The differentiation between infection and disease is often difficult.

- The diagnosis tests are not always available in all institutions

- Follow up is not precise

In the 1980s, U.S. laboratories reported an estimated prevalence of NTM infection of 1 to 2 cases per 100000 population

Studies since the 1950s from Czechoslovakia, Wales, Ireland, Australia, and the United States have reported increases in the incidence and prevalence of NTM lung infections. In Queensland, Australia, where NTM is reportable, the incidence of clinically significant pulmonary disease rose from 2.2 per 100000 in 1999 to 3.2 per 100000 in 2005.

Finally, while the prevalence and incidence of NTM pulmonary disease have been increasing through the years, not only in the U.S. but also around the world, this epidemiological variation has not been explained. New radiological advances, especially resolution chest computed tomography (CT) scanning, improved diagnosis, and an increase in chest screening may be important factors responsible for these epidemiological observations.
