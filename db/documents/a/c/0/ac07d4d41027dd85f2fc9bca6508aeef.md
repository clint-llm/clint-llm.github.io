HHV-8 is a double-stranded enveloped DNA virus with 6 major subtypes (A-F).

Due to HHV-8 co-evolving with the human population for centuries, cofactors of immune defects and inflammation are required for the development of malignancy.

After infecting endothelial cells, HHV-8 activates the mTOR pathway, alters the cells to have mesenchymal differentiation, and promotes aberrant angiogenesis

Interestingly, Kaposi sarcoma is not monoclonal and different nodules within a patient have different clonal origins.

Clinically, Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular lesion, and as such,Â often presents as a violaceous pink to purple plaque on the skin or mucocutaneous surfaces. Lesions may be painful with associated lymphedema and secondary infection.
