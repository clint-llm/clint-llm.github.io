The incidence of PNI following extremity trauma has been reported between 1.64% and 3.4%.

One analysis from a large database indicated an average annual incidence of upper extremity PNIs to be 43.8 per 1 million individuals. This number decreased throughout the study, while the compound annual growth rate in cost was 9.6% between 2001-2013. Most patients were male, Caucasian, and admitted through the trauma/emergency department. The average age was 38.1 and the most common injury was digital laceration. Most patients were discharged following their encounter.

Another database study concluded that lower extremity PNIs occurred with an annual average incidence of 13.3 cases per 1 million individuals. The mean age was 41.6, most were male, and most were admitted through the emergency room. The sciatic nerve was most commonly injured, and the most frequent injury was a lower extremity fracture. The compounded annual growth rate of the cost was 8.8% from 2001 to 2013.

Positioning nerve injuries are most likely to occur in those with extremes of body weight, males, and with a history of nerve disease or morbidities that would predispose an individual to nerve injury.
