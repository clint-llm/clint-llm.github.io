Prevalence increases with age, with most studies finding a prevalence of 1.0% to 1.5% until age 60, at which point the prevalence rises to approximately 6.0%. It is more common in males, with an approximate 2Â to 1 ratio of males to females. Prevalence rates above 10% have been observed in populations of young athletes, suggesting that increased parasympathetic autonomic tone plays a role in the development of first-degree AV block in younger patients.
