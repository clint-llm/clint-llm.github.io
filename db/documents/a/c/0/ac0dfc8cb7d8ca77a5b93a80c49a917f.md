The spectrum of infectious diseases is rapidly evolving. Emerging infectious agents present with a constellation of challenges. The highly virulent pathogens with increased resistance result in increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. It has been estimated that ten million people will die every year due to AMR by 2050.

CDC has published antibiotic-resistant threat reports in 2013 and 2019. According to the 2019 report, in the US, more than 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections occur each year, and more than 35000 people die. In addition to this, it also mentioned that 223,900 cases of Clostridoides difficile occurred in 2017, of which 12800 people died.  The report did not include viruses or parasites.

The report categorized the threats into four tiers based on level of concern to human health

- Urgent Threats

- Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii
- Candida auris
- Clostridiodes difficile
- Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae
- Drug-Resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae

- Serious Threats

- Drug-Resistant Campylobacter
- Drug-Resistant Candida
- Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamases producing(ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae
- Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE)
- Multidrug-Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa
- Drug-Resistant nontyphoidal Salmonella
- Drug-Resistant Salmonella typhi
- Drug-Resistant Shigella
- MRSA
- Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae
- Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis

- Concerning Threats

- Erythromycin-Resistant Group A Streptococcus
- Clindamycin-Resistant Group B Streptococcus

- Watch List

- Azole-Resistant Aspergillus fumigatus
- Drug-Resistant Mycoplasma genitalium
- Drug-Resistant Bordetella pertussis

World Health Organisation created a priority list of pathogens in 2017 and 2020 based on their substantial threat to morbidity and mortality. The priority list is categorized into three tiers:

- Tuberculosis: A Global Priority for research and development especially Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis

- Critical Priority:

- Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii
- Carbapenem-Resistant Pseudomonas Aeruginosa
- Carbapenem-Resistant, Third generation Cephalosporins-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae

- High Priority

- Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus faecium
- Vancomycin-Resistant, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus
- Clarithromycin-Resistant H.Pylori
- Fluoroquinolones-Resistant Campylobacter species
- Fluoroquinolones-Resistant Salmonella species
- Third generation Cephalosporins-Resistant, Fluoroquinolones-Resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae

- Medium Priority

- Penicillin-non-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae
- Ampicillin-Resistant Hemophilus influenzae
- Fluoroquinolones-Resistant Shigella species
