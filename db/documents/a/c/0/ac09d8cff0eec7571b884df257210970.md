Currently, there is no evidence-based protocol for the management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome. Patients with GTPS are most effectively managed with an interprofessional team approach. This team may include primary clinicians, physical therapists, sports medicine clinicians, and orthopedic surgeons. The diagnosis for GTPS is clinical. It is essential to perform a thorough physical examination. Treatment interventions have been developed to target the proposed GTPS pathologies at the cellular level. Thus, to determine the best treatment protocol, further research and studies should be developed to determine the exact pathology of GTPS.
