The concept of nerve stimulation/peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) is not new and has been in practice since the early 19 century. However, clinical studies were done much later in this field. In 1976, Campbell et al. published the reports of the first set of clinical studies done in the field of pain management using PNS.
