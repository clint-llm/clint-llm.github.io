While there are many theories as to the cause of bone marrow edema syndrome, the fact remains that this is a rare condition with a highly variable presentation. Therefore, clinicians may not arrive at the correct diagnosis quickly without excluding all other reasonable possibilities. However, if a patient is diagnosed with bone marrow edema syndrome, the mainstay of treatment remains symptom management. Physical therapy and offloading techniques will be most effective in reducing pain. NSAIDs also play an important role in decreasing the inflammatory response of bone marrow edema syndrome. Over time, symptoms will likely resolve, and patients should be counseled to avail themselves of coping mechanisms or assistance which may be needed to overcome both the physical and mental stress that may occur during their recovery.
