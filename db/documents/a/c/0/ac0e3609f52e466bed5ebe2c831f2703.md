Facial lacerations are a common patient presentation, and the ear presents a unique challenge due to its structure. The ear is particularly susceptible to lacerations, avulsions, and blunt trauma due to the prominent position of the ears overlying a bony surface. Health professionals should be aware of the complexities of treating ear lacerations and potential complications that can arise. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with ear lacerations and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures that can be damaged in an ear laceration.
- Describe the contraindications to primary closure of an ear laceration.
- Identify the complications that can occur following repair of an ear laceration.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of complex ear lacerations and improve outcomes.
