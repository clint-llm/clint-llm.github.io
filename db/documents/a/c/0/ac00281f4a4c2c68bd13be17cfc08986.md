Radioactive iodine ablation is indicated when there is a contraindication to surgery or in the nonfit patient. It can cause a reduction in goiter size by 40% to 60% within 2 years. Radiation thyroiditis, hypothyroidism, and transient increase in thyroid gland size are the most common complications for which the use of radioactive iodine ablation is limited.
