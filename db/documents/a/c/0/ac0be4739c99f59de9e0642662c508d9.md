An integral step in new bone formation is the avid binding of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) to hydroxyapatite crystals found in bone. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates such as zoledronate are PPi analogs with a higher binding affinity. These bisphosphonates, therefore, preferentially bind to bone, especially at sites that are being actively remodeled. The bone-bound bisphosphonates are released during the process of bone breakdown by osteoclasts.

Once released, the bisphosphonate is then absorbed by osteoclasts. Within the osteoclasts, the bisphosphonate binds to and blocks the activity of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS). FPPS is an essential intracellular enzyme in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase pathway responsible for producing isoprenoid lipids, cholesterol, and other sterols. Inhibition of this pathway prevents the posttranslational modification of small proteins, including guanosine triphosphate binding proteins, which are needed for the activity and survival of osteoclasts.

Therefore, the administration of zoledronate increases osteoclast apoptosis, thus reducing bone resorption and loss. Osteoblastic activity and bone formation are not impacted by the use of zoledronate. Hence the use of this agent shifts bone metabolic activity in favor of bone formation, reducing bone loss. This ultimately leads to an increase in bone mass and bone density as bone formation exceeds resorption.
