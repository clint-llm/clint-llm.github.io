As the opioid epidemic continues, interprofessional communication and care coordination among healthcare team members are imperative in the appropriate and safe use of opioids for patient care. With proper interprofessional communication, excess quantities, as well as duplicate prescriptions, will be reduced. Unfortunately, such communication can be challenging with multiple institutes, pharmacies, and clinicians involved in the ongoing care of the same patient. Many clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists have found direct communication ineffective.

It remains unclear how to proceed with anesthesia for patients that addresses all patient anesthesia needs, particularly intraprocedural and immediately post-operative, while not relying excessively on opioids drugs, which can lead to long-term misuse and addiction. Opioids have become a leading cause of unintentional death in the United States. Many patients are opioid naive, and their initial exposure to opioid drugs may be in the perioperative setting when anesthesiologists play a significant role in pain management. This is where multimodal analgesia, enhanced recovery pathways, and regional anesthesia can be important tools helping anesthesiologists achieve optimal opioid stewardship while also providing effective analgesia without undesirable sequelae.

The interprofessional healthcare team, especially anesthesiologists, nurses, and pharmacists, must also pay special attention to opioid conversions. Due to the recurring shortages that plague medicine, many clinicians are forced to be flexible with preferred pharmaceuticals. If unfamiliar with the conversion ratios, it is imperative to review proper dose adjustments to prevent accidental opioid toxicity, and many sources are available for this conversion based on preference and other available agents.

Nursing staff can be a valuable resource in this area by establishing working relationships with multiple pharmacies and liaising between the prescriber, the patient, and the pharmacist. The interprofessional team approach is critical to provide effective opioid therapy and prevent misuse of these agents. [Level 5]
