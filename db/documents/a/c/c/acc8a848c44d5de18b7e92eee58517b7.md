An annular fissure or tear is a deficiency of one or more layers of the annulus fibrosus.

Most annular fissures are asymptomatic, but some may be painful. Typically, simple symptomatic annular fissures without disc herniation are treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and low-impact physical therapy. Chronic pain due to annular fissures can be due to granulation tissue or in-growth of nerve endings which is usually seen near the dorsal root ganglion. Additionally, an annular fissure can allow extrusion, for example, disc herniation, of the nucleus pulposus and compress the adjacent nerves.
