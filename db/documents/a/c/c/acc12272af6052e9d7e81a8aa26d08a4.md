**Malunion**

- Controversial how to define or measure displacement and malunion

- Patient with anatomic reductions have better outcomes, but displacement less than 1 cm are often tolerable

- Sometimes difficult to discern stable patterns from unstable patterns

- May consider manipulation under anesthesia to determine stability in select cases or to guide treatment during surgery

- Complete sacral fractures with ipsilateral rami fractures treated nonoperatively will displace over time 39% of the time

- Complete sacral fractures with bilateral rami fractures treated nonoperatively will displace over time 68% of the time

**Hardware Failure**

- Micromotion is present even in a well-aligned and healed pelvic ring. Therefore, there is a high rate of hardware failure over time. If the pelvic ring has healed, there should be no displacement if and when the hardware fails; this is not an indication for hardware removal

- Plating across the symphysis has a hardware failure rate of 43% at one year

- 97% of hardware failures were asymptomatic

**Neurologic Dysfunction**

- Denis 3 fractures of the sacrum have approximately a 50% rate of neurologic dysfunction of lumbosacral nerve roots.

**Sexual Dysfunction**

- Erectile dysfunction occurs in 46% of males after pelvic ring injury

- Dyspareunia occurs in 56% of females after pelvic ring injury, 91% with APC injuries, and 79% of patients treated with symphysial plating

**Chronic Pain and Disability**

- See prognosis section

**Infection**

- As high as 16% with a posterior approach to the sacrum

- Obesity increases the risk of complications and reoperation

**DVT/PE**

- Pelvic ring injury may require IVC filter
