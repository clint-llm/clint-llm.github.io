The anatomy of the Eustachian tube in infants and young children differs from that of adults in that the ET runs horizontally rather than sloping downward from the middle ear. Because of this anatomical difference, bottle-feeding of infants should be performed with the head elevated to decrease the risk of reflux into the middle ear space. The horizontal course of an infant's ET makes it more difficult for fluid to drain out of the ear and creates a more accessible avenue for bacteria to travel from the mouth to the middle ear space, both of which can culminate in an ear infection. After the age of six, the frequency of ear infections substantially decreases.

As previously discussed, Eustachian tube dysfunction often manifests in the setting of an inflammatory process such as otitis media or rhinosinusitis. Symptoms include tinnitus, distorted or diminished hearing, and pressure in the ear. These symptoms are typically mild and respond to actions that facilitate the normal opening of the tube, such as swallowing or yawning. Theoretically, medications aimed at reducing inflammation, which include corticosteroids, antihistamines, and antibiotics in the setting of an infectious process, may temporarily improve Eustachian tube function; however, the research and evidence for this are underwhelming.

Severe or refractory Eustachian tube dysfunction may require more aggressive treatment that involves healthcare team-based approaches and surgical intervention.

**Eustachian Tuboplasty**

- The most evidence related to Eustachian tube dysfunction interventional techniques involves Eustachian tuboplasty. One reported approach involves inserting a deflated balloon catheter into the ET using a transnasal endoscopic visualization. The balloon is then filled with saline and remains in situ for two minutes before removal. Results of the procedure were measured regarding the improvement of symptoms, including ear pressure, pain, fullness, and tolerance to pressure changes such as air travel. High levels of symptomatic improvement were noted in patients who had not undergone previous surgery; the intervention demonstrated mixed efficacy for patients with chronic otitis media symptoms. In some studies, Tympanometry was used as an additional objective measure of functional improvement, resulting in a high conversion rate of abnormal tympanogram tracings back to type A (normal function) tympanogram tracings.

**Myringotomy**

- Myringotomy involves producing an opening in the tympanic membrane designed to relieve pressure buildup in the middle ear. This typically is done with a laser for increased accuracy and control and may involve ventilation tube placement. Studies regarding the efficacy of this technique in relieving middle ear symptoms appear promising; many are too short-term and poorly reported to appropriately conclude the value of the technique.

**Tympanostomy**

- Tympanostomy is a variation of myringotomy that involves the placement of a tube that traverses the tympanic membrane to ventilate the middle ear space. Tympanostomy tube placement is the most common ambulatory pediatric surgery in the United States. Indications for the procedure include recurrent otitis media refractory to antibiotic use. Otitis media is more common in children because the overall function of the Eustachian tube is decreased due to the natural horizontal angle of childhood. Tympanostomy tube placement is considered a safe and efficacious procedure, providing relief of recurrent otitis media in most patients; otitis media still can occur following placement. Risks related to the procedure involve typical risks associated with anesthesia induction.
