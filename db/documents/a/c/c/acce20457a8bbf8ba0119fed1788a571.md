When adding a simulation technician to a simulation-based healthcare education team, a primary concern is the financial impact. Many organizations find it challenging to get buy-in and financial support for this additional human resources expense. Smaller institutions often have nursing and other allied health faculty pulling double-duty, handling the additional responsibilities of a simulation technician. While this may not be the best practice, circumstances are such that this is not uncommon. Some analysis has already shown the benefits of adding simulation technicians to a workforce. However, additional research and analysis are needed to fully understand the impact of simulation technicians on not only the education team but also both learner and patient outcomes.
