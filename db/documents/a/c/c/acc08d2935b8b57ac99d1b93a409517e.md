There are five phases or periods of lung development: embryonic, pseudoglandular, canalicular, saccular, and alveolar. The development of the lungs begins at week 4 of pregnancy which is the embryonic period. This stage spans from weeks 4 through 9 and coincides with the pseudoglandular period which spans from weeks 5 through 18. At this time there is the formation of the major airways. The canalicular period spans from weeks 16 through 27 and includes epithelial differentiation and air-blood barrier formation. From weeks 26 through 38, is the saccular period, where surfactant production begins, depicting viability. This period also allows the expansion of spaces within the lungs. Lastly, the alveolar period concludes lung maturity by forming secondary septations and continuing to produce surfactant. The presence of sufficient surfactant is the indicator for lung maturity.
