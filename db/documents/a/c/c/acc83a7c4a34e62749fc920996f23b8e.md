Given the exhaustive conditions that can cause acute hepatitis, the management of this clinical condition requires an interprofessional, collaborative team approach that would aid in making a timely diagnosis resulting in appropriate management. Clinical presentation of acute hepatitis in patients can range from being asymptomatic with incidental abnormal liver biochemical test results to being critically ill with signs concerning for acute liver failure. In clinical practice, acute hepatitis is primarily encountered by primary care physicians, emergency medicine physicians, and internists. Depending on the etiology and the severity, other specialists may need to be involved in the care team, including gastroenterologists, hepatologists, pharmacists, nursing staff, toxicologists, infectious disease specialists, transplant surgeons, intensive care teams, or liver transplant centers
