The underlying cause of the symptom will determine the evaluations needed.

- Vascular: Risk factor stratification (HgbA1C, lipid panel), plain head computed tomographic (CT) scan, or vessel imaging (CT angiography/magnetic resonance angiography) and appropriate use of magnetic resonance imaging, digital subtraction angiography, positron emission tomography

- Trauma: Head CT scan to screen for increased intracranial pressure and correlate clinical symptoms with concerning findings such as midline shift or herniation syndromes

- Metabolic: A complete metabolic panel, blood panel, and screen for thyroid disease

- Malnutrition: Vitamin deficiency panel (B-subtypes, E, and thiamine) should be considerations.

- Toxic: Urine and serum toxicology screen  (home medications, bacterial toxins or recreational drugs)

- Hereditary: Inherited ataxias undergo screening through the clinical and family history, before being sent to the geneticist for formal counseling and testing

- DNA southern blot, RNA Northern blot, methylation assays, karyotyping, whole-genome sequencing

- Neuroinflammatory or autoimmune: Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid glucose, protein, cell count oligoclonal bands, IgG index, aquaporin-4 antibody, MOG antibody

- Neuroinfectious: Lumbar puncture with basic cerebrospinal fluid laboratories, meningoencephalitis panel, VDRL, HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, cryptococcus antigen, toxoplasmosis antigen

- Psychogenic: Psychiatric evaluation to uncover conversion disorders or psychogenic dysdiadochokinesia

- Neurodegenerative: a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation, well-documented history of clinical progression, behavioral changes, motor changes, and genetic testing, if indicated
