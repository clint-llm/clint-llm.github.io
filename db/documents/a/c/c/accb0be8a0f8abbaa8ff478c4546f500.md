Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of hereditary connective tissue disorders that manifests clinically with skin hyperelasticity, hypermobility of joints, atrophic scarring, and fragility of blood vessels.****It is largely diagnosed clinically, although identifying the gene encoding the collagen or proteins interacting with it is necessary to identify the type of EDS. Identifying the type of EDS to guide management and counseling is important.

Asymptomatic, nonsyndromic joint hypermobility, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and hypermobility spectrum disorders (particularly the hypermobile type) are the commonest phenotypes associated with joint hypermobility. Compilations of these syndromes can be chronic pain, dysautonomia, gastrointestinal dysmotility, mast cell activation, and anxiety and phobic states.
