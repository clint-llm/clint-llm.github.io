Train-of-four (TOF) is the standard for monitoring a patient’s blockade status during perioperative and postoperative periods. TOF involves four 2-Hz stimulations to specific muscle groups to assess the extent of the blockade and, in a prognostic sense, how the patient will react when withdrawing the maintenance of the blockade. Normally performed on the adductor pollicis muscle via stimulation of the ulnar nerve, the response desired is a twitch that indicates a specific muscle contraction. The four twitches are quantified so that a normal TOF should be TOF greater than or equal to 1, meaning the muscle has improved contraction on each stimulation so that the fourth is much stronger than the first.

This reaction would indicate that no more nNMB is required and that reversal should receive a standard dose. However, if TOF is less than 0.9, this would indicate that post-residual blockade and postoperative complications have a higher risk of occurring. The main complication of concern is respiratory distress due to residual blockade of the diaphragm and laryngeal muscles. If TOF is less than 0.7, this would indicate persistent blockade.
