Patients with a dental abscess usually present with oral cavity pain, fever and difficulty chewing. Healthcare workers outside the dental profession including nurse practitioners should promptly refer these patients to an oral surgeon. Besides antibiotics, most patients also require an initial drainage procedure, to be followed for a formal dental procedure at a later date. For those patients who seek care promptly, the prognosis is good. But any delay in treatment can lead to worsening of the problem and even loss of the tooth.
