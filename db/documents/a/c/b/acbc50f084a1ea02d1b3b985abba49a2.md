The primary imaging modality with any suspected peroneal tendon disorder is X-rays of the ankle. X-rays should be weight-bearing and include standard AP, mortise, and lateral ankle views. Additional X-ray views are the axillary/Harris heel view and AP, lateral and oblique views of the foot to look for other fractures and foot alignment. Findings on the x-ray that indicate peroneal pathology are avulsion from the base of the fifth metatarsal, avulsion fracture of the distal fibular groove, os peroneum, and retromalleolar groove flattening.

Ultrasound is a no radiation, inexpensive imaging modality that can provide an evaluation of the tendon in motion, as well as assist with injections. It has been shown to be effective in identifying tears as well with a sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 85%.

MRI is the next step in evaluation with a high-quality view of the tendons with no exposure to radiation. The sensitivity is 83%, and specificity is 75% for peroneus brevis tears. Findings include fluid surrounding the tendons, discontinuity, edema of the bone, and any bony deformity.

CT scanning does expose the patient to radiation but provides better bony detail to evaluate possible bony deformity causing possible tendon dysfunction.Â  If x-rays indicate the possibility of fracture, peroneal tubercle, or retro trochlear eminence CT scan would be useful and determine possible management.
