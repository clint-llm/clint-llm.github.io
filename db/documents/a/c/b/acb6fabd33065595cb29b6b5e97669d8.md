History of a fall onto an outstretched hand is very common. Elbow swelling and ecchymosis may be present. Ecchymosis on the lateral aspect may represent an unstable fractureÂ causing a tear in brachioradialis aponeurosis. Tenderness to the lateral aspect of the elbow is usually present. Also, the elbow range of motion will be painful and restricted. However, all these signs can also be present in the more frequent supracondylar fractures. The latter is commonly associated with a higher degree of elbow deformity. Thorough palpation and evaluation of the whole of the upper limb are warranted. Also, a detailed examination of the peripheral pulses, digital sensation, and finger movements should be done.
