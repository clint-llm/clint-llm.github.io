Osgood Schlatter disease is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a sports physician, physical therapist, primary care provider, orthopedic nurse and an orthopedic surgeon.

As these injuries often present in extremely active adolescent patients, it may be effective to decrease the amount of athletic participation rather than cease activity altogether. For example, in a patient that participates in multiple sports or on multiple teams during the same season, it may be effective to recommend that the patient eliminates one of these teams or sports to decrease the amount of activity and strain that occurs with frequent and recurrent participation as opposed to complete rest. The decision to limit activity should be a shared decision including short term and long term goals of the both patient athlete and parent. Ultimately the decision should be driven by the level of pain experienced. Preventative measures for Osgood Schlatter include recommending a gradual increase in workload (less than 10% per week), using appropriate equipment and techniques, include stretching regimen to ensure flexibility in hamstrings and quadriceps, and consider avoiding early sports specialization.

**Outcomes**

The condition is self-limiting but may persist for up to 2 years until the apophysis fuses. Treatment includes relative rest and activity modification from the offending activity as guided by the level of pain.

If pain does not respond to conservative measures, formal physical therapy may be warranted. In severe, prolonged cases a short period of knee immobilization may be considered. There is no evidence to recommend injection therapy or surgical intervention for Osgood-Schlatter disease.

While recovery is slow, most patients are eventually free of pain.
