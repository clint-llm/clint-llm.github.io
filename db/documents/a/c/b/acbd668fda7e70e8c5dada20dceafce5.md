Pressure injuries are formed when pressure causes localized damage to underlying skin and soft tissue. These skin and soft tissue injuries remain a significant problem within hospitals and long-term care facilities and result in decreased quality of life and high costs for both the patient and our health care system. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with these pressure injuries, they must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of pressure injuries and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with pressure injuries.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pressure injuries.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of pressure injuries.
- Review the management options available for pressure injuries.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of pressure injuries and improve outcomes.
