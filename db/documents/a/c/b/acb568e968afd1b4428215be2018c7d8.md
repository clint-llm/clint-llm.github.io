**Course:**

The renal arteries come off the aorta and supply the kidneys. The right renal artery runs an inferior course that courses posterior to the inferior vena cava and right renal vein to reach the hilum of the right kidney. The left renal artery has a much shorter course and runs slightly more inferiorly compared to the right renal artery. The left renal artery has a more horizontal course and can be found just posterior to the left renal vein before it enters the hilum of the left kidney.

**Anatomic Relations:**Knowledge of the anatomic relations is essential for the surgeons as important structures can suffer an injury during different surgical procedures that require an approach to the renal arteries.

**Right Renal Artery:**Anteriorly, the proximal portion of the right renal artery is related to inferior vena cava, while the distal portion is related to the shorter right renal vein. These structures separate it from the second part of the duodenum and head of the pancreas. Posteriorly, it is associated with the right renal pelvis and the ureter in its distal section whereas, the right crus of the diaphragm, right psoas major muscle, right sympathetic trunk, cisterna chyli, and body of the 2nd lumbar vertebra in its proximal part.

**Left Renal Artery:**The left renal vein separates the left renal artery from the body and tail of the pancreas and the splenic vessels. Posteriorly,****its proximal part is related to the left crus of the diaphragm, left psoas major muscle, left sympathetic trunk, and the body of the second lumbar vertebra. The distal portion is related to the left renal pelvis and the ureter, posteriorly.
