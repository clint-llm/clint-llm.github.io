The management of ampullary cancer requires interprofessional attention involving interventional gastrointestinal medicine at the diagnostic level and medical oncology, surgical oncology, and radiation oncology at the management level. This needs thorough care coordination among all the disciplines for outlining and conducting a patient-centered personalized treatment strategy. Adjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiation plays a crucial role in resected ampullary carcinoma that improves overall clinical outcomes. For advanced tumors, due to the rarity of these tumors, currently, the data is limited to the treatment regimens used for pancreatic cancer. At this time, there is no consensus regarding optimal management and therefore mandates an interprofessional evaluation.
