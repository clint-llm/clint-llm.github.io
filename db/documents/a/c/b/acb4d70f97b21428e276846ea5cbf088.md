Sacroiliitis is an inflammation of the sacroiliac joint (SI), usually resulting in pain. Often it is a diagnosis of exclusion. The sacroiliac joint (SI) is one of the largest joints in the body and is a common source of the buttock and lower back pain. It connects the bones of the ilium to the sacrum. Sacroiliitis can be particularlyÂ difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to many other common sources of back pain. It often is overlooked as a source of back or buttock pain. Pain from this condition often is due to chronic degenerative causes yet relatively uncommon. Sacroiliitis can be secondary to rheumatic, infectious, drug-related, or oncologic sources. Some specific examples of non-degenerative conditions that can lead to sacroiliitis are ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthropathy, Bechet disease, hyperparathyroidism, and various pyogenic sources.
