The human brain is a highly metabolically active organ, accounting for about 25% of a person's metabolic demand, despite comprising only 2.5% of a typical individual's body weight. Consequently, the brain is exquisitely sensitive to disruptions in blood flow. Complex homeostatic mechanisms act to maintain cerebral blood flow at a relatively stable rate of about 50 ml/100g of brain tissue per minute, through a process known as cerebrovascular autoregulation. When this blood flow is compromised, the result is cerebral ischemia, one of the most common mechanisms of brain dysfunction and damage. The extent of neuronal injury resulting from compromised cerebral perfusion depends upon both the extent and duration of the hypoperfusion.
