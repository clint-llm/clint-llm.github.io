Cultural sensitivity remains a crucial aspect of the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric patients. There are many culture-specific syndromes as well as pharmacologic considerations that the diligent physician or provider should be aware of when encountering patients from different backgrounds. Not addressing cultural concerns when assessing patients may lead to unnecessary or even incorrect treatment modalities. Educating patients and their families regarding mental health diagnoses and treatments is vital, as it ensures proper management of the patient’s symptoms. Patients and families from different cultures may never have been exposed to mental health treatment or may not believe in such treatment. Open discussions need to be held to cultivate an understanding of the patient’s mental health concerns to ensure the development of good rapport with patients and families.
