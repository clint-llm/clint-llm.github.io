Grief-related stress can lead to high blood pressure, tachycardia, and increased levels of cortisol. It can disrupt cholesterol-filled plaques that line coronary arteries and constrict blood vessels.Â These changes can increase the risk of myocardial infarction. Increased levels of stress lead to catecholamine surge, which increases platelet aggregation. If a plaque ruptures, platelets form a blood clot on top of the ruptured plaque obstructing blood supply.

Takosubo cardiomyopathy is caused by grief or fear that leads to stimulation of adrenal glands and progresses to elevated levels of adrenaline, which creates reduced blood flow to the heart.
