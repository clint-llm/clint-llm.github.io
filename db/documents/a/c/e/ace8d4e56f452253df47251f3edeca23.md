Polypharmacy, old age, underlying frailty pose multi-level challenges in the management of complications. Complications of polypharmacy include adverse drug reactions(ADRs), falls resulting in head injury, mild cognitive impairment with and without behavioral changes, and dementia.

Polypharmacy can lead to ADRs from multiple drug interactions, herbal supplements, and over-the-counter medications. The most predominant risk factor for ADRs is the number of drugs taken, i.e., more the medicines, the risk of ADRs increases exponentially. Other adverse events from polypharmacy include decreased medication compliance resulting in worsening of underlying medical problems, poor quality of life, increased office visits, unnecessary drug costs, excessive healthcare expenses, hospital admissions, and even death.
