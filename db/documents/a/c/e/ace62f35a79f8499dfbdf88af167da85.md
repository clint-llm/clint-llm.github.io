Ticks are arachnid ectoparasites of the order Ixodida.

Tick removal requires awareness beyond the physical act of removing the tick from the patient. Clinicians should consider the type of tick, the geographic distribution of ticks in general, and any need for further therapies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is an excellent resource for all clinicians caring for patients with tick bites.
