As with any surgery, vaginal reconstruction is not without complications. These complications may be minor such as wound dehiscence, skin necrosis, or partial flap loss to major such as flap failure, fistulas, or hernias. These complications are more likely in patients with preoperative radiation. Immediate flap reconstruction decreases the likelihood of major complications, but there is still a risk. The patients should be counseled preoperatively about these possible complications.

Total or partial flap loss is a relatively low-risk complication given the hardy nature of the pedicled flaps generally utilized in vulvovaginal reconstruction. These complications can largely be avoided with appropriate preoperatively planning and stringent attention to avoiding flap tension and twisting/kinking of the pedicle. The major complications often seen in pelvic exenteration include evisceration or deep pelvic abscesses. Bringing healthy vascularized tissue for dead-space filling and tissue replacement (as opposed to tense primary closure) helps avoid these complications.
