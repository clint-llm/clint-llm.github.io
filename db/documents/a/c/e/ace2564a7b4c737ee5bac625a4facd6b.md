Lower blepharoplasty is mainly done for cosmetic purposes. Most cases present with aesthetic problems in the form of dermatochalasis (excess lower eyelid skin) and steatoblephron (prolapsed fat pad). Functional problems are a less common indication when compared with upper blepharoplasty. All lower blepharoplasty cases should be evaluated for the need for canthal support either in the form of canthopexy or canthoplasty.
