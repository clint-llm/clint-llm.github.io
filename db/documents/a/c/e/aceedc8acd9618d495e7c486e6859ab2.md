Although altitude-related illnesses are a common cause of patient decompensation at altitude, exacerbations of underlying chronic conditions must be kept in the differential diagnosis. Exacerbations of pulmonary artery hypertension, congestive heart failure, peripheral edema, symptomatic valvular heart disease, dysrhythmias, and acute pneumonia/bronchitis may occur at any altitude and must be considered in a hypoxic and/or dyspneic patient.

High-altitude illnesses such as HAPE may occur in isolation or concurrently with other altitude illnesses. A clinician must perform a thorough history and assessment to evaluate for other altitude illnesses such as high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), acute mountain sickness, high-altitude headache, high-altitude syncope, and high-altitude bronchitis/cough.
