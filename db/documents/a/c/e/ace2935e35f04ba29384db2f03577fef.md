Nearly 90% of patients are discharged home from the emergency department after their head injury.

Prognosticating outcomes following TBI has long been a goal of investigators. The ability to accurately prognosticate serves a great value in assisting treating physicians, researchers, and patient's families. The International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials (IMPACT) study provides an advance in TBI prognostication and is available online for use.
