Glaucoma affects 70 million people worldwide and is the second leading cause of blindness both in the United States and across the entire planet. Of these 70 million glaucoma sufferers worldwide, 74% suffer specifically from open-angle glaucoma and in the United States, nearly 80% of all glaucoma is OAG. Nearly 10% of all glaucoma patients are bilaterally blind, and bilateral blindness due to OAG has been estimated to affect 5.9 million people in 2020. There are at least 2.7 million people aged ≥40 years with glaucoma in the United States, and the number of patients suffering from all forms of glaucoma worldwide is projected to rise to 79.6 million by 2020. The highest prevalence of OAG can be found in African-American patient populations (Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness in African-Americans) with Latin American and Chinese prevalence approaching African-American levels in older patients populations. Women are disproportionately affected by all forms of glaucoma, comprising approximately of 55.4% of all cases of OAG. It is important to remember that longevity also plays a role because glaucoma affects primarily elder populations. The longevity factor should be taken into consideration when considering the epidemiology of glaucoma as both women and developed countries have greater longevity compared to male and non-developed countries, respectively. By 2020, OAG is projected to have the highest prevalence rate in Europe followed by China and India.

**Risk Factors:**

- Old age (African American over 40 and Caucasian over 65 years old)

- Race (African-American, Afro-Caribbean, and West African patients have a four-fold increased risk of developing OAG)

- Family history (The Rotterdam Eye study found 9.2 times higher risk of developing OAG if first degree relatives had glaucoma)

- Elevated IOP

- Myopia

- Increased cup-to-disc ratio

- Disc hemorrhage

- Thin central corneal thickness

- Low ocular perfusion pressure

- Low blood pressure (systolic and diastolic)

- High blood pressure (systemic arterial hypertension has been associated but not confirmed risk factor for OAG)

- Type 2 diabetes mellitus

- High pattern standard deviation on visual fields

- Migraine or vasospasm

- Low intracranial (CSF) pressure

- Oral contraceptive pill

- Other risk factors include smoking, obesity, alcohol, anxiety, stress, and sleep apnea
