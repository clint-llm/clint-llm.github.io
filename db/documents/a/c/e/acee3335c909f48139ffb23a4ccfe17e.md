Chemoembolization is the technique of injecting substances designed to decrease or stop tumor growth into the arteries that feed a tumor. Injected substances include chemotherapy medication along with particles that decrease the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the tumor. Chemoembolization is one of several techniques geared toward treating either primary liver cancer or cancer that has metastasized to the liver. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and technique involved in performing hepatic chemoembolization. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with primary liver cancer or liver metastases.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the blood supply to the liver.
- List the indications for hepatic chemoembolization.
- List the complications of hepatic chemoembolization.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies to enhance care coordination and communication to advance the use of hepatic chemoembolization and improve patient outcomes.
