In patients treated for HA, overdosage with fludrocortisone can cause fluid retention, low K+, very suppressed PRC and, precipitate congestive heart failure. Less severe but clinically significant side-effects include constipation due to increased colonic mucosal Na and water reabsorption, weight gain due to fluid retention and muscle weakness due to hypokalemia. Dosing should be titrated to PRC levels in the upper limits of the normal range. Undertreated children will have poor growth. When the diagnosis is delayed in infants with severe disease, mortality is increased.
