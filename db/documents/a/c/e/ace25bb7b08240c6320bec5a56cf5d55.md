Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) is defined when it presents within three months of birth. It consists of heavy proteinuria, edema, hypoalbuminemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, hypercoagulability, and hyperlipidemia. Management is very challenging as patients are prone to complications such as infection, thrombosis, and failure to thrive. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of congenital nephrotic syndrome and emphasizes the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of congenital nephrotic syndrome.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of congenital nephrotic syndrome.
- Outline the management options for congenital nephrotic syndrome.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration amongst the multidisciplinary team to add to the care of patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome.
