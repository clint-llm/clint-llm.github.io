Patients with oropharyngeal cancer can present with a variety of symptoms depending on the location of the tumor. The most common presentation include persistent sore throat, dysphagia, odynophagia, dysarthria, presence of a lump in the neck, and otalgia. In addition, the patients may also complain of voice changes (hoarseness), unexplained weight loss, and hematemesis.

Physical examination of the oropharynx may reveal either an ulcer, or a red or white patch on the base or posterior one-third of the tongue, posterior and lateral pharyngeal walls, soft palate, or tonsils.
