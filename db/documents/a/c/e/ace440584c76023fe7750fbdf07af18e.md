Anifrolumab is safe, tolerable, and effective for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. In MUSE and TULIP-1, at higher anifrolumab doses, there were numeric increases of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to study discontinuation. However, statistical significance was not evaluated. To date, there is no distinct anifrolumab serum level that predicts effectiveness and toxicity. Routine measuring of serum levels in clinical practice remains unclear. There is no antidote available. Phase IV clinical trials would help assess the possible toxic effects of anifrolumab.
