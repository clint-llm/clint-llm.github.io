The success of ATTR amyloidosis treatment with tafamidis is monitored and assessed by echocardiograms, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and scintigraphy with bone tracers to diagnose infiltrative cardiomyopathy.

- Liver function test (LFT)

- Renal function test (RFT)

- Complete blood count (CBC)

- Thyroid function test

- Prothrombin time

- Biomarkers of heart failure (NT-proBNP and Troponin I)

- Electrocardiogram (EKG)-  Low voltage in the limb leads and/or a pseudo-infarct pattern in the precordial leads.

- Changes in echocardiography measures from baseline such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), interventricular wall thickness, left ventricular stroke volume, and global longitudinal strain (as mentioned in the appendix)

- Quality of life as measured by the KCCQ-OS (Kansas city cardiomyopathy questionnaire-overall summary) and six-minute walk test (6MWT)
