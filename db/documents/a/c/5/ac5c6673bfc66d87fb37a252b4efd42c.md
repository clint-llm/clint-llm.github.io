Proton pump inhibitors represent a class of medications used to treat a wide variety of pathologies related to the stomach's acid production. This activity reviews the indications, action, contraindications for proton pump inhibitors as a valuable agent in managing acid-related disorders. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of acid-related disorders.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of proton pump inhibitors. 
- Describe the potential adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors. 
- Review the appropriate monitoring for patients on proton pump inhibitors. 
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance proton pump inhibitor outcomes.
