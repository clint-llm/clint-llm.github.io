The diagnosis and treatment of vertebral artery dissection are not simple and best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a radiologist, emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, neurologist, andÂ vascular surgeon. Once imaging has made the diagnosis, the treatment depends on patient symptoms.

For those patients that survive the initial dissection, the prognosis is usually good. Approximately 10% of patients die initially. In one clinical follow-up study, 80% achieved a full recovery. Death is typically secondary to extensive intracranial dissection, brainstem infarction, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. The goal of management is to prevent stroke, which is the complication of vertebral artery dissection. Management is done with anticoagulation, typically heparin. For those who have neurological deficits, appropriate rehabilitation therapy is necessary. The pharmacist should educate the patient on medication compliance, managing blood pressure, and discontinuing smoking. The pharmacist should also monitor the INR to ensure that it is in the therapeutic range.

Endovascular or surgical treatments are reserved for patients with concomitant complications or those whose maximal medical therapy has been unsuccessful. Most dissections will resolve over time with no neurological deficits. Close communication with the team members is vital if one wants to improve outcomes.

The recovery can be prolonged and full recovery is often not possible.
