It is the responsibility of healthcare professionals that the patient has a good understanding of the disease and the appropriate treatment available for the disease. Thymic hyperplasia is usually an incidental finding and can cause significant anxiety among patients. It is vital for healthcare providers to provide emotional support to the newly diagnosed patient. The approach to hyperplastic thymus should be multidisciplinary, including primary care physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, radiologist, pathologist, thoracic surgeon, neurologist, and an endocrinologist in order to establish a definitive diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment.

If the diagnosis of thymic mass is an incidental finding, a biopsy should be performed to differentiate thymic hyperplasia from thymoma or other malignancies and make a definitive diagnosis. Patients who are asymptomatic and have no local or systemic manifestations can be closely monitored by primary care providers. Patients with serious manifestations such as superior vena cava syndrome or myasthenia gravis should be referred to a thoracic surgeon for thymectomy.
