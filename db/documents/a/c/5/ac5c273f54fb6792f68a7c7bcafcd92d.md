A complete physical exam including a genital exam is crucial. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (b-HCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are the tumor markers that can be elevated in these patients

Mediastinal germ cell tumors are noted as an anterior mediastinal mass in an x-ray. Teratomas can manifest with derivatives of more than one germ layer that can be seen in an x-ray including in bones, calcification, and teeth. Although chest x-rays can identify a larger mediastinal mass, a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest is required to define the size, borders, and location of the mass accurately. Patients with an extragonadal germ cell tumor have a higher risk of harboring a metachronous testicular tumor. A testicular ultrasound is mandatory to rule out a co-existing testicular tumor.

The differential diagnoses of mediastinal non-seminomatous germ cell tumors include retrosternal thyroid tumors, lymphomas, and thymic tumors. A workup for the anterior mediastinal tumors noted above is recommended, including obtaining serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). A tissue diagnosis is needed for a definitive histologic diagnosis and to plan subsequent management. However, seeding is an issue and in the appropriate clinical setting with elevated markers, a biopsy is not required.
