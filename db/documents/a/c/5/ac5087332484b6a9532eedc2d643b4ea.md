Patients who have experienced traumatic brain injury should be educated on the potential for post-traumatic headaches. While these headaches may be debilitating and possibly life-long, treatment options are available and include behavioral, pharmacological, and interventional. Furthermore, providers should reassure patients thatÂ post-traumatic headaches are not life-threatening. While there is no concrete clinical presentation for PTHA, patients and the care team should be aware that PTHA may take characteristics of primary and other secondary headaches.
