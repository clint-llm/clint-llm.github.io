Transmembrane proteins are necessary for allowing the transport of certain substances across cell membranes because the phospholipid bilayer or electrochemical gradient would otherwise impede their movement. Active transport is one manner by which cells accomplish this movement by acting against the formation of an equilibrium, typically by concentrating molecules depending on the various needs of the cell, e.g., ions, sugars, and amino acids. Primary/direct active transportÂ predominantly employs transmembrane ATPases and commonly transport metal ions like sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium through ion pumps/channels. Secondary active (coupled) transport capitalizes on the energy stored in electrochemical gradients established via direct active transport, predominantly created by sodium ions via the sodium-potassium ATPase, to accordingly move other molecules against their respective gradients, notably without directly coupling to ATP.
