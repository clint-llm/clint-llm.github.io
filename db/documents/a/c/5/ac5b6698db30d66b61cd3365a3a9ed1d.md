Job syndrome is a rare immunological disorder characterized by recurrent infections. The disorder is primarily managed by the hematologist and infectious disease expert but the outpatient follow-up is done by the primary caregiver and nurse practitioner as part of interprofessional team management. Most of these patients require long term antibiotic therapy combined with drainage of an abscess, so a pharmaceutical consult is in order to appropriately target antimicrobial therapy.

The management of non-immunological manifestations must be interprofessional. It aims to treat complications. Thus, scoliosis, depending on its severity, as well as bone fractures and degenerative joints diseases may require orthopedic surgery. Dental abnormalities require adequate stomatological treatment. Cardiovascular complications are managed in a specialized environment.
