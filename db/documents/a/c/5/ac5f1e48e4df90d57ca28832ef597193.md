Cellular stressors generate free radicals causing damage to DNA. The resulting DNA damage creates mutations that are normally repaired by DNA mismatch repair systems. If the stressors induce mutations within DNA mismatch repair or replication systems, this can lead to irreversible genome breaks and damage and loss of the original genome template.

The rate of somatic mutations is often faster than the mismatch repair system allowing the mutated cells to continue proliferating.

Somatic mutations early on in cell development can lead to a variation in the typical phenotypic presentation of a respective cell line. Mutations arising in early neurocognitive development can cause mosaicism of prodigy cell lines contributing towards brain development. Large-scale mosaicism in neurocognitive tissues can cause intellectual disability and epilepsy.
