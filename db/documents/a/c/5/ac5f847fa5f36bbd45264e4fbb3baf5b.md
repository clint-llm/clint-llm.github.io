Gastrointestinal bleeding scan (GIBS) is a non-invasive diagnostic radionuclide imaging study to evaluate patients with a suspected overt GI bleed, especially involving mid and lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It is performed with 99mTc-RBCs and helps determine the bleeding status (active or intermittent), gross localization, and estimation of the amount.

For purposes of geographical localization and potential intervention, GI bleeding typically classifies as upper, mid, and lower. Upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) includes bleeding up to the level of the ampulla of Vater, which is within reach of esophagogastroscopy; this can identify major causes such as gastric and duodenal ulcers, esophageal varices, esophagitis, and gastritis. Mid GIB includes up to the level of the terminal ileum, which undergoes an evaluation with capsule endoscopy; this can diagnose etiologies such as Meckel diverticulum, angiodysplasia, and Crohn disease.
