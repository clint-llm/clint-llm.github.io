The symptoms of vaginal atrophy can be vague and non-specific. In addition, many women do not disclose their symptoms to their clinician. Patients should not only be screened for symptoms during an evaluation but should be educated on what symptoms to watch for, especially in the postmenopausal population. This allows patients to be vigilant and more open to presenting these symptoms to their clinicians when they arise.
