Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome remains underdiagnosed. Clinicians need to recognize presenting clinical and radiographic features to avoid unnecessary testing and provide a prompt diagnosis. The interprofessional team may consist of primary care, emergency medicine, neurology, radiology, pharmacists, and specialty care nurses. Cerebral vascular imaging is crucial at identifying patients with RCVS. Although RCVS is self-limiting and commonly resolves with no sequela, clinicians need to provide appropriate supportive therapy and understand the possible complications that can leave patients with permanent neurological deficits or death. Emergency and critical care nurses monitor patients, administer treatments, and provide updates to the team. Pharmacists should review medications used for acute therapy for dosage and drug-drug interactions. Nursing can assist with procedures as well as providing patient counsel on the condition and administering medication, coordinating with the ordering clinician and the pharmacist. The interprofessional team approach to reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome will lead to better outcomes with fewer complications. [Level 5]
