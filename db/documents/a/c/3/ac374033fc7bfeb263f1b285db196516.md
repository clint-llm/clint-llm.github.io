Nursing plays a vital role in the pre-operative preparation for the block, the block placement, and the post-operative management of the catheter. Before placing the block, the nurse should participate in the timeout procedure, which includes verification of procedure, side of procedure, patient allergies, and potential contraindications. During the actual procedure, the nurse should be monitoring the patientâ€™s level of sedation and vital signs. The nurse can also help with patient positioning during the procedure. Post-operatively, the nurse will monitor the analgesia provided by the catheter, as well as watch for potential complications, including bleeding, local anesthetic toxicity, and pneumothorax.
