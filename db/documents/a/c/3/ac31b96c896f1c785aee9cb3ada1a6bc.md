The inclusion of arytenoid subluxation/dislocation must be a consideration in the differential diagnosis of prolonged postoperative hoarseness after endotracheal intubation. Although rare, it is a complication that can cause significant distress to patients. It has an excellent prognosis if diagnosed and treated promptly.

Gentle instrumentation of the airway and completely deflating the endotracheal tube cuff before extubation may prevent this injury. The use of a stylet appears to protect against arytenoid dislocation.
