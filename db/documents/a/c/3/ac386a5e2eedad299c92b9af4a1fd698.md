Overall, a good prognosis is expected for diabetic amyotrophy, as this is a self-limited process. The course of the disease tends to worsen progressively, followed by stabilization and ultimately complete recovery, with some cases presenting with some degree of residual motor deficit. The disease course happens in a period of months and lasts up to 2 years after onset.
