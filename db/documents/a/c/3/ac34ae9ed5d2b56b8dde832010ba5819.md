**Anterior Triangle**

The carotid sheath is a thick layer of fascia that encases the superior portion of the common carotid artery, the proximal portion of the internal and external carotid arteries, the internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve. The carotid sheath emerges from the posterior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid. It ascends through the carotid triangle before its contents pass deep to the posterior belly of the digastric muscle and continue along the lateral aspect of the neck. The common carotid artery runs anteromedial to the internal jugular vein within the sheath and bifurcates between the third and fourth cervical vertebrae, which aligns with the superior border of the thyroid cartilage. The internal carotid artery does not give off any branches in the neck and ascends posterior to the external carotid artery to enter the cranial cavity. The external carotid artery branches directly following the bifurcation and provide blood supply to most structures of the head and neck.

There are eight branches of the external carotid artery, though only the four most proximal are within the boundaries of the anterior triangle. The superior thyroid artery exits from the anterior aspect of the carotid artery and descends to supply the superior pole of the thyroid gland, the thyrohyoid and cricothyroid muscles, and the internal larynx via the superior laryngeal artery. The ascending pharyngeal artery arises from the posterior aspect of the external carotid, just superior to the superior thyroid artery. This artery dives deep to pierce the pretracheal fascia and supply pharyngeal constrictor muscles. The lingual artery originates from the anterior surface of the external carotid and immediately passes deep to the mylohyoid muscle to supply the muscles of the tongue and the sublingual salivary gland. The facial artery also branches off of the anterior surface of the external carotid just superior to the lingual artery. It then passes deep to the posterior belly of the digastric and stylohyoid muscles and continues its tortuous course superficial to the mylohyoid muscle before hooking over the inferior edge of the mandible just anterior to the masseter muscle. The facial artery supplies the submandibular salivary gland, the soft palate, and many more structures of the face via its numerous branches.

The anterior triangle is home to lymph nodes, including the submandibular and submental node basins. The submandibular nodes exist deep to the submandibular gland within the submandibular triangle. They drain the oral cavity and some of the soft tissue structures of the lower face. The submental lymph nodes lie within the submental triangle and drain the lower lip, floor of the mouth, and apex of the tongue. Both of these groups of lymph nodes are clinically important in deep neck space infections and also head and neck cancer.

**Posterior Triangle**

The most prominent vascular structure of the posterior triangle is the subclavian artery. This artery is found in the subclavian triangle and becomes ensheathed in prevertebral fascia as it crosses deep to the anterior scalene muscle. Directly medial to the anterior scalene, the subclavian artery gives off the thyrocervical trunk, which further branches into the suprascapular, transverse cervical, ascending cervical, and inferior thyroid arteries. The suprascapular and transverse cervical arteries course laterally over the anterior surface of the anterior scalene and supply the muscles of the scapula and the trapezius, respectively. The ascending cervical artery ascends within the prevertebral fascia to supply the deep muscles of the neck. The inferior thyroid artery continues superomedially to the inferior lobe of the thyroid, eventually anastomosing with the superior thyroid artery.

There are numerous lymph nodes associated with the posterior triangle that drain local structures and move lymphatic fluid along the chain. The posterior auricular and occipital nodes lie near the apex of the triangle, on the superficial surface of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius tendons. The superficial cervical nodes exist on the anterior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid, while the deep cervical nodes are on the deep surface of the sternocleidomastoid. The posterior cervical nodes accompany the jugular vein as it pierces the investing fascia and enters the posterior triangle. The supraclavicular lymph nodes are on the superior surface of the middle third of the clavicle.
