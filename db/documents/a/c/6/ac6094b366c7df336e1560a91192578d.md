There are a few contraindications to consider when performing a temporoparietal fascia flap transfer:

- When used as a pedicled flap, the surgeon should first consider the anatomical reach limitations of the proposed TPFF.

- The surgeon should be mindful that previous radiation therapy may have altered the microvascular anatomy of the flap and potentially can lead to a higher failure rate.

- Prior trauma, surgery, or manipulation of the superficial temporal vascular system (e.g., STA biopsy for temporal cell arteritis) may have interrupted the flap's vascular supply.
