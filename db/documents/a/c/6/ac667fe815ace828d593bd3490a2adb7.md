Hypothyroidism affects multiple organ systems across all age groups and affects patient well-being and ability to function on a daily basis. Treatment is with levothyroxine monotherapy (Grade A, Best Evidence Level 1).

Effective treatment calls for a team-based and patient-centered approach. When patient symptoms are not adequately controlled an endocrinology consult should be obtained.

Endocrinology consultation is also recommended in complex scenarios such as preconception, pregnancy, congenital and pediatric hypothyroidism, failure of treatment, co-existing cardiac or other endocrine disorders, difficulty in interpretation of thyroid test results, drug-induced hypothyroidism.

It is helpful to work closely with a pharmacist to determine medication and food interactions, the effect of changes in levothyroxine formulations, to investigate the causes for the requirement of unusually high doses of levothyroxine or fluctuating TSH levels. Prompt notification of unusually high levels of TSH by laboratory personnel, close monitoring of vital signs and mental status by nurses can facilitate early treatment and better outcomes, especially in the inpatient setting such as in myxedema coma. Rapid response teams can be effectively utilized when hypothyroidism causes hemodynamic instability.
