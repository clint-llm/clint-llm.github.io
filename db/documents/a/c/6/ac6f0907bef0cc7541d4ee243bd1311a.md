The Allen test is used to assess collateral blood flow to the hands, generally in preparation for a procedure that has the potential to disrupt blood flow in either the radial or the ulnar artery. These procedures include arterial puncture or cannulation and the harvest of the artery alone or as part of a forearm flap. A negative Allen test means that the patient likely does not have an adequate dual blood supply to the hand, which may present a contraindication to the planned procedure or at least suggest that further evaluation is necessary. This activity reviews the Allen test technique and discusses the interprofessional team's role in applying this maneuver to improve patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the vessels evaluated by the Allen test.
- Describe the indications for performing the Allen test.
- Outline the technique for performing the Allen test.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving communication in regards to the significance of a negative Allen test.
