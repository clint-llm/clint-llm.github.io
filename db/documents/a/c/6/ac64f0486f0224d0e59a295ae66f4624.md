The patient is asked to remove shoes and stand with both feet together. Next, the examinerÂ instructs the patient to hold their arms next to the body or crossed in front of the body. The first stage of the test involves asking the patient to keep their eyes open while the examiner assesses the patient's body movement relative to balance.

The second stage involves instructing the patient to stand erect with their eyes closed while the examiner notes any balance impairment for a duration of one minute. Swaying of the body may be observed. However, this indicates the proprioceptive balance correction for the lack of visual or vestibular compensation. The Rhomberg test is positive when the patient loses balance with their eyes closed. Loss of balance can be defined as increased body swaying, foot movement in the direction of the fall, or falling.

The sensitivity of the test can be increased by:

- "Sharpened Romberg test"- narrowing the patient's base of support with feet in a heel-to-toe tandem position or

- Conducting the test in foam rubber to nullify the proprioceptive inputs from the foot.
