The full-field electroretinogram (ffERG) is a specialized electrophysiologic test of retinal function in response to a full-field light stimulus. There are 6 standard protocols for isolating the electrical activity from the rods and cones. The ffERG is a valuable tool for objectively diagnosing and monitoring retinal disease. This activity reviews the ffERG procedure and technique and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients using this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for ffERG.
- Describe the typical ffERG findings associated with rod-cone dystrophy.
- Review the interfering factors of the ffERG.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by retinal disease using ffERG.
