The etiology of Takayasu arteritis is largely unknown. At its core, it is an inflammatory disease, and it is thought that autoimmune cell-mediated immunity may be responsible for the disease. Eventual transmural fibrous thickening of the arterial walls is what ultimately leads to ischemic changes and formation of alternating areas of pseudoaneurysm.
