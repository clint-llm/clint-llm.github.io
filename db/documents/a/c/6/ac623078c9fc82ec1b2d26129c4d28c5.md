Ricin was used in the assassination of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov in London in 1978; a pellet containing ricin was found in his leg during an autopsy. A Bulgarian defector, Vladimir Kostov, survived a similar assassination attempt in Paris involving the injection of a pellet containing ricin under his skin ten days prior. In August 1981, double-agent Boris Korczak survived being shot by an air gun with a pellet containing ricin while at a grocery store in Virginia. In 2003, ricin was detected in a facility that handled mail for the White House. However, no one was harmed. In April 2013, envelopes addressed to President Barack Obama, Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker, and Lee County, Mississippi Judge Sadie Holland tested positive for ricin; Tupelo, Mississippi, resident Everett Dutschke was arrested later that month and plead guilty in May 2014. In May 2013, actress Shannon Richardson mailed letters containing ricin to President Barack Obama, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Mark Glaze, who at that time was executive director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns. All suspected cases of ricin exposure should be reported to poison control and the health department. Ricin is included on the United States Department of Health and Human Services Select Agents and Toxins List under 42 CFR 73.3.
