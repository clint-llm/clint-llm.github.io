Zellweger syndrome is a fatal and progressive disease with multiple congenital anomalies. Even with improved care, the survival rate is poor. There are reports of affected children living up to 2 years depending on genetic-phenotypic variability, and they typically die from respiratory failure, apnea, or complications from an infection.

Due to poor outcomes andÂ no specific treatment available, genetic testing and counseling for family planning should be offered to potential carriers prior to pregnancy. Prenatal or preimplantation genetic diagnosis is also available for potential carriers.
