Approximately 25% of patients with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome require long-term institutionalization. The patients that depend on long-term care often have one or more comorbidities (somatic and psychiatric).

**Mental Status Complications**

Global confusion often resolves gradually after treatment.

One in five patients who demonstrate signs of the amnestic state after initiating treatment will have a complete recovery. The remaining patients will have varying degrees of persistent learning and memory impairments.

Maximum recovery may take years and is dependent on abstinence from alcohol.

**Ataxic Complications**

Approximately half of the patients with ataxic symptoms will recover completely. The other half will have an incomplete recovery, with a residual slow, shuffling, wide-based gait, and the inability to tandem walk.

Vestibular dysfunction improves in about half of all patients.

**Ocular Complications**

After starting treatment, patients typically recover from Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in a predictable pattern. Improvement of ocular abnormalities is the most dramatic, usually occurring within hours after thiamine administration.

If the ocular abnormality does not improve after administrating thiamine, the diagnosis of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome should be reevaluated.

Vertical nystagmus may persist for months while the fine horizontal nystagmus can persist indefinitely.

Sixth nerve palsies, ptosis, and vertical-gaze palsies all typically recover completely.

**Mortality**

Mortality usually occurs secondary to infections and hepatic failure, but some deaths are attributable to defects of prolonged thiamine deficiency.

The mortality rate is 10% to 15% in severe cases.

Prognosis depends on the stage of disease at presentation and time of treatment.
