Mycobacterium kansasii is a slow-growing, non-tuberculosis mycobacterium (NTM) that, like other mycobacterial species, tends to cause six clinical patterns of infection: pulmonary disease, skin and soft tissue disease, musculoskeletal infections including monoarticular septic arthritis and tenosynovitis, disseminated disease, catheter-associated disease, and lymphadenitis. Chronic pulmonary cavitary disease in the upper lobe is the most common presentation of M. kansasii infections, and patients may be initially be misdiagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the six main presentations of mycobacterium kansasii.
- Describe pulmonary mycobacterium kansasii infection from pulmonary tuberculosis infection.
- Explain the management options for mycobacterium kansasii infections.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and to enhance outcomes for patients affected by mycobacterium kansasii infection.
