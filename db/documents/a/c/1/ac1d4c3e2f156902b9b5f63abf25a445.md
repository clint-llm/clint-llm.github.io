Streptococcal meningitis requires immediate treatment with antibiotics. Delays in implementing treatment are not acceptable.

**S.pneumoniae**

Initial treatment for pneumococcal meningitis consists of vancomycin plus one of the third-generation cephalosporins: cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The antibiotic therapy can undergo review after antibiotic sensitivity is available â€“ if bacteria is penicillin-susceptible, switch to penicillin is acceptable. For patients with a history of anaphylaxis to cephalosporins or penicillins, chloramphenicol is an option. Adjuvant therapy with dexamethasone is recommended - research showed a significant reduction in mortality and all unfavorable outcomes in patients with pneumococcal meningitis compared to sole antibiotic treatment.

**S.agalactiae**

Penicillin G monotherapy is suitable for the treatment of meningitis caused by GBS. Ampicillin is an acceptable alternative.

**S. viridans, Group A Streptococcus
**

Penicillin G is effective for the treatment of meningitis caused by S. viridans or group A Streptococcus.

Supportive care, including fluid management, reduction of intracranial pressure, antipyretics, and analgesics, are valid parts of the therapy.
