As a healthcare professional tasked with the care of newborns or infants, an understanding of normal fontanelle morphology, variations, and average closure timelines is essential. Many medical conditions can affect fontanelle morphology and may be life-threatening. A complete history and physical examination with particular attention to the analysis of the fontanelles can provide valuable insight into the infant’s health status and assist in formulating an appropriate differential diagnosis. If uncertainty arises, it is imperative to consult the pediatric neurosurgery team to be involved in the infant’s care.
