Historically, erythema ab igne affects women more often than men and has been reported to be in a 10:1 distribution; however, this is likely older data representing older causes of EAI, such as coal fires and other household issues exposures that women may have had more exposure to traditionally. Newer data suggests still that women are about twice as likely to have erythema ab igne, and it is more likely to appear on the anterior legs.

Although it can appear at any age, a previous study noted that the average age was 28.6 +/- 10.4 years.
