Wound complications of an open abdomen are associated with a morbidity rate as high as 25% and have been found to increase significantly if the abdomen is left open for longer than eight days. Complications that can arise from an open abdomen are entero-atmospheric fistula formation, bleeding, infection, multiple organ failure, intra-abdominal abscess, sepsis, loss of bowel function, loss of fluids and protein, loss of abdominal domain, and ventral hernias.

It has been found in recent years that as many as 40% of emergency laparotomy cases are left open. Out of concern for overuse as well as the potential complications of leaving an abdomen open, some institutions have sought ways to streamline the use of the open abdomen in trauma patients. One such institution found that by emphasizing hemorrhage control, the early use of blood products, and minimizing the administration of large amounts of IV fluids in trauma patients undergoing laparotomy, the number who received DCL decreased from 36.6% to 8.8%. This reduction was associated with a decrease in mortality from 21.9% to 12.9% in trauma patients receiving laparotomy over the same period.
