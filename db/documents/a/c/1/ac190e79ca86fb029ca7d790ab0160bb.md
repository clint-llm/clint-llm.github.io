Pathogenetically, plasma cell Castleman disease correlates with the overproduction of IL-6 and overexpression of IL-6 receptors that lead to the proliferation of B lymphocytes, vasculogenesis, resultingÂ in a series of systemic symptoms such as fever, anemia, hypoproteinemia, and proteinuria. In some cases of mixed CD, IL-6 increase also is found to favor hepcidin production from the liver that can cause iron-deficiency anemia.

Nontypical plasma cell populations with limited light chains in Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin A (IgA) can be seen. The genome of the human lymphotropic virus HHV-8 in HHV-8 associated CD encodes a viral analog (vIL)-6 of IL-6 that further stimulates angiogenesis, hematopoietic and lymphocytic activity.
