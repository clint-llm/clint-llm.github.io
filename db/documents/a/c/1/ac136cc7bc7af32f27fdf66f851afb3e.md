Bowel perforation results from insult or injury to the mucosa of the bowel wall resulting from a violation of the closed system. This exposes the structures within the peritoneal cavity to gastrointestinal contents. Bowel perforation can be secondary to many factors, most commonly inflammation, infection, obstruction, trauma, or invasive procedure. Patients presenting with abdominal pain and distension, especially in the appropriate historical setting, mustÂ be evaluated for this entity as delayed diagnosis can be life-threatening due to the risk of developing infections such as peritonitis. Management includes stabilizing the patient while making surgical consultation. Even appropriately managed, bowel perforation can lead to increased morbidity and mortality from post-repair complications such as adhesions and fistula formation.
