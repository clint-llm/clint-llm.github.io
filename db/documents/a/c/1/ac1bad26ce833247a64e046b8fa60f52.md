Clinical staging of angiosarcoma is based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging System for soft tissue sarcoma - which is based on tumor size, depth, theÂ presence or absence of regional lymph nodes, distant metastases, and histological grade. All hepatic angiosarcomas are considered deep tumors, as they are located beneath the superficial fascia. Stage II and III hepatic angiosarcomas are rare, making their outcomes more difficult to predict. The majority of cases in studies were stage I or IV.
