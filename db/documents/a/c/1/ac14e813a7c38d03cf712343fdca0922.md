Compartment syndrome of the forearm is a relatively common clinical problem, and prompt surgical intervention can be limb saving. Orthopedic, vascular and general surgeons should be familiar with surgical decompression of the forearm.

**Forearm Fasciotomy**A standard OR table with a hand table is preferred. Starting on the anterior forearm, an incision should begin just proximal to the wrist crease and extend proximally to the distal ulnar aspect of the elbow flexion crease. Proceed through the subcutaneous tissue and the fascia into the anterior compartment. A small nick is made in the fascia, and Mayo scissors are slid down the length of the forearm compartment releasing the compartment. Assess the deep and superficial muscles. Now mark the second radial sided anterior incision. This incision is a middorsal straight-line incision that begins 3 cm proximal to the wrist crease and extends down to the radial aspect of the elbow flexion crease. After going through the subcutaneous tissue and fascia along the entire length of the radial sided incision, finger dissect and release the posterior compartment and mobile wad. Examine all the muscles in both compartments. All nonviable necrotic tissue in any fasciotomy should be debrided. However, after the fascial releases, muscles will bulge out and even some slightly devitalized appearing muscle may recover over time. After adequate release on all three compartments has been achieved many dressing options can be explored. There are reports of good outcomes with negative pressure wound therapy, tissue expanders, wet to dry dressings.
