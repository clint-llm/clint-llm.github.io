Lipoprotein(a) is a general promoter of atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Due to its structure, Lp(a) leads to reduced fibrinolysis. Specifically, apolipoprotein(a) carries a similar structure to tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and plasminogen. This allows it to compete with plasminogen for its specific binding site and hence interfere with its function, which leads to reduced fibrinolysis. Thrombogenesis is also stimulated by Lp(a) as it leads to increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.

Lp(a) induces atherosclerosis as it carries cholesterol and attaches to oxidized phospholipids. It also attaches to macrophages and leads to the formation of foam cells. This mechanism ultimately leads to the deposition of cholesterol within the atherosclerotic plaques.

It is uncertain if Lp(a) has any benefits for the human body. One theory has been that Lp(a) has a role in wound healing. However, those with markedly lower Lp(a) levels do not appear to have any long-term health risks.
