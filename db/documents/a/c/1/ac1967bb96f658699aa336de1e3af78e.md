Laparoscopic approaches should be considered for oophorectomies unless there is a concern for malignancy or otherwise indicating an open approach.

**Positioning**

Consider the need for vaginal access. If needing access to the perineum or vagina for support, then the patient should be placed in the modified lithotomy position with care to avoid injury. Otherwise, adnexal surgery can be performed in the supine position. Depending on the length of the case, age of the patient, and size of the mass, consider placing a Foley/urinary catheter for bladder drainage.

**Entry and Setup**

Entry to the abdomen is traditionally through the umbilicus; however, if there are concerns for adhesions, abnormal anatomy, or size of the adnexal mass, other locations such as Palmerâ€™s point are an option. Once intra-abdominal, accessory trocars should be strategically placed to optimize the economy of motion during surgery and avoid injury. Anatomy of the anterior abdominal wall should be reviewed to avoid vessel (namely the inferior epigastric artery) and nerve injury with trocars or an open incision. The patient is then usually placed in the Trendelenburg position to give better exposure to the pelvic viscera.

**Surgical Steps**

Traditionally, a right oophorectomy will be easier than a left oophorectomy due to the sigmoid colon. There are a few approaches to oophorectomy, and none have shown to be superior. In one method, the IP ligament (with the ovarian artery) and the ureter are first identified. Then, an incision is made on the peritoneal surface (using either electrocautery or sharply) parallel to the IP between the ureter and IP. This retroperitoneal space is then dissected to increase the distance between the ureter and IP ligament. Once the IP is isolated from the ureter, it can be ligated.

**Special Considerations**

If performing a risk-reducing oophorectomy, it is important to ligate the IP ligament 2cm proximal to the ovarian hilum to ensure no pathology is left behind. This tissue should undergo protocolized sectioning by the pathology department to ensure there is no malignancy.
