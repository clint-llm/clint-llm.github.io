Regular histological stains can not identify iron deposited in the tissue. So, special stain, e.g., Prussian blue stain is commonly used to detect tissue iron overload. A blue granular appearance with Prussian blue stain suggests iron deposition in the tissue. In the hepatocyte, iron deposition begins in the periportal areas. It then progressively involves centrilobular areas, Kupffer cells, and biliary epithelial cells. Over time, iron deposition leads to fibrosis and micronodular cirrhosis. Similarly, iron deposition and fibrosis are seen in cardiac myocytes, the pancreas, endocrine glands, and skin.
