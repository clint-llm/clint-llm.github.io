While multiple theories have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of white centered retinal hemorrhages, the most widely accepted is that of retinal capillary rupture and intraretinal hemorrhage. Retinal capillary rupture occurs as a result of endothelial cell dysfunction. Extravasation of red blood cells follows vessel rupture with subsequent activation of the clotting cascade and formation of a platelet-fibrin plug at the site of the damaged endothelium. Histological studies revealed the whites lesions are composed primarily of platelet-fibrin thrombi.
