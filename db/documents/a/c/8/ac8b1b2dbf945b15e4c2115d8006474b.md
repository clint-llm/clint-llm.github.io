GVA fibers are primarily made of unipolar neurons. Each of these neurons is comprised of a cell body, an axon, and dendrites. The unipolar cell body of a GVA fiber can be found somewhere along a cranial nerve or in the dorsal root of the spinal cord. The cell body controls all the functions of the neuron and allows information to pass between the dendrites and axons. The axon is a long, tubular structure that conducts electrical impulses away from the cell body. Dendrites are tree-like projections that receive input from other cells and transmit this information to the neuronal cell body. Furthermore, these dendrites make up the receptive field that allows the neuron to detect specific changes in its surrounding environment.

Visceral afferent fibers are supported by Schwann cells. This support cell is a type of glial cell that supplies nutrients to peripheral nerves and has a role in nerve regeneration.

Three types of sensory receptors can activate GVA fibers: mechanoreceptors, nociceptors, and chemoreceptors. Each of these receptors detects a specific stimulus and additionally has a differing set of nerve fibers associated with them. Mechanoreceptors respond to mechanical pressure or physical deformation.
