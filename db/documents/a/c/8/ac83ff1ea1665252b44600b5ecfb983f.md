Paramedian forehead flap transfer is a very versatile and reliable technique, most commonly utilized for nasofacial reconstruction. Primary care clinicians and dermatologists who have patients with nasal or periocular defects should refer these patients promptly to general plastic or facial plastic surgeons for definitive repair. Surgeons with high-volume local/regional facial flap reconstruction practices who are supported by experienced wound care nurses will provide the best care for these patients, with all involved parties keeping open communication lines in the event of any concerns or issues, working as a cohesive interprofessional healthcare team. Optimal outcomes will occur in healthy non-smokers who are well-educated about the perioperative process, postoperative recovery, potential complications, and expected final appearance of the flap.
