Poroma is a very well-circumscribed tumor.

Poroid cells are cuboidal keratinocytes, and the pattern is non-palisading and monomor­phous ovoid nuclei with discrete nucleoli. The cytoplasm is usually eosinophilic and stains positively with periodic acid–Schiff (PAS). Interestingly, some atypical features of malignant tumors can be observed in poroma, including a variable number of mitosis, highly vascularized stroma, and foci of necrosis.

The degree of ductal differentiation varies greatly between poromas. Dermatopathologists can be aided by carcinoembryonic antigen immunostaining, which is a tool to confirm the presence of ductal differentiation. This staining labels the luminal surface of both apocrine and eccrine ducts.

- Presence of elongated tubules lined by columnar cuticular or polygonal cells that usually exhibit hints of apocrine secretion along the luminal border and also contain an amorphous, eosinophilic material in their lumina

- The connection of aggregates of neoplastic cells to preexisting infundibula seem like connections between excretory ducts of apocrine glands

- Presence of follicular differentiation in the form of epithelial lobules similar to the tumor of follicular infundibulum or trichoblastoma

- Presence of isolated sebocytes and their small clusters in neoplastic cells

Porocarcinoma is composed of anaplastic cells that contain large irregular and hyperchromatic nuclei and are glycogen-rich.
