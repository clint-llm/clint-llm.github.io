Clinical management of vitamin D toxicity is mainly supportive and focuses on lowering calcium levels.

- Vitamin D and calcium supplements should be discontinued. In addition, excessive bed rest should be avoided to prevent hypercalcemia due to immobilization.

- Isotonic saline should be used to correct dehydration and increase renal calcium clearance.

- In severe toxicity resulting in severe hypercalcemia (serum calcium >14 gm/dL), calcitonin and bisphosphonates can be used. Dosing is recommended as follows:

- Calcitonin at 4 U/kg intramuscularly can be administered and repeated every 12 hours up to 48 hours.
- IV bisphosphonates can be administered concurrently: Pamidronate 90 mg IV over 2 hours and zoledronic acid 4 mg IV over 15 minutes.
- Coadministration of calcitonin and bisphosphonates has been shown to increase the efficacy of calcitonin.

- Calcitonin can lead to tachyphylaxis, while the effect of bisphosphonates can persist for a longer duration. Therefore, calcium levels should be carefully monitored when using these medications.

- The use of IV glucocorticoids is controversial and usually reserved for treating vitamin D toxicity related to granulomatous disease. This medication works by reducing calcitriol levels, which in turn lowers plasma calcium levels. By decreasing intestinal absorption and increasing urinary excretion of calcium, it helps regulate calcium levels in the body.
- Hydrocortisone 100 mg/d or prednisone 40mg/d for 5 d.

- Patients may need hemodialysis due to renal failure or correct refractory hypercalcemia.

- The patient’s medication list should be reviewed to adjust the future doses of vitamin D supplements.

- Patient counseling is needed to avoid vitamin supplement overuse.

- The Endocrine Society suggests monitoring 25-hydroxy vitamin D and calcium serum levels for patients on high-dose vitamin D replacement therapy.
