Pulmonary hypertension can occur due to a variety of causes, as described above, but conditions such as PAH and CTEPH require highly specialized multidisciplinary care. An expert center is designated based on the availability of an interprofessional team, including a cardiologist, pulmonologist, rheumatologist, cardiothoracic surgery, interventional radiology, nurse specialist, pharmacists, social workers, and on-call experts. Such centers usually get referrals and therefore have large volumes, which tends to provide the best standard of care with better clinical outcomes.

Interprofessional care involves coordinated activity and open communication between all care team members, with each contributing from their areas of expertise. CliniciansÂ will focus on their particular practice expertise, coordinating their actions with other disciplines. Nurses provide invaluable input, assisting in patient evaluation, helping with surgical procedures when necessary, counseling patients, and coordinating activities between the team members. Pharmacists will coordinate medication regimens, perform medication reconciliation, counsel patients on their drugs, and answer clinician questions regarding medications. Other areas, such as psychological professionals, will likewise coordinate their activities within the context of the rest of the care team. Interprofessional care teams provide the optimal approach for patients with pulmonary hypertension, leading to improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]
