First coined by William Mackenzie in 1840, sympathetic ophthalmia refers to bilateral ocular inflammation secondary to unilateral eye trauma or surgery.

Per the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) working group definition in 2021, the diagnosis criteria for sympathetic ophthalmia are as follows: (1) history of unilateral ocular trauma or surgery AND (2) ocular inflammation in both eyes or, if the inciting eye has no view, detectable inflammation in the sympathizing eye AND (3) either anterior uveitis with vitreous inflammation OR panuveitis with choroidal involvement.

Penetrating ocular trauma and vitreoretinal surgeriesÂ have the highest risk of developing sympathetic ophthalmia.
