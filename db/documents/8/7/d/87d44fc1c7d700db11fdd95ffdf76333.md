The interprofessional team is essentialÂ to the diagnosis and management of UVCP. Through the use of clinical examination and direct laryngoscopy, otolaryngologists can help identify UVCP and formulate a differential diagnosis. Radiologists can further aid diagnosis through the use of cross-sectional imaging. Definitive management can be achieved with voice therapy and support from the speech and language therapists, with otolaryngologists providing surgical management in those who do not respond to initial therapy.
