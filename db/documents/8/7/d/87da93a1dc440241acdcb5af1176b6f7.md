Tinea barbae is a rare dermatophytosis infection with only a few hundred cases reported in the literature. Most of the reported cases of tinea barbae in the literature were either single case reports or small case series. Though the data available is limited, it has been very reassuring, as almost all cases responded well to oral antifungal therapy with complete resolution.
