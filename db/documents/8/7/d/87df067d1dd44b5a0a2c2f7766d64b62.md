Women presenting with HG should be managed by an interprofessional team that provides comprehensive careÂ and an integrated approach to help achieve the best patient-centered outcomes. Midwives and primary health care providers should ensure timely referral of women with HG to avoid unnecessary delay in the most appropriate management of these women. Clear and legible communication among the interprofessional team members will help deliver the best standard of care for women with HG. Women with severe and intractable (HG) should be managed in the hospital, and the nurse should document all her observations accurately. The nurse should inform the obstetric provider of any untoward change in the maternal observations. Assessment of fetal wellbeing plays a very crucial role in the management of women with (HG). If there is any deterioration of the general condition of the woman with (HG), early transfer to critical care units should be considered. Intensivists and critical care team members should be involved in managing women presenting with severe and/or intractable (HG). The woman's preferences, views, and choices should be respected at all times. [Level 5]
