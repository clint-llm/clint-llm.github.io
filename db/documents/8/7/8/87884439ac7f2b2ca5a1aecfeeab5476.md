FA is the most common hereditary ataxia, accounting for approximately 50% of all ataxia cases and approximately 75% in patients less than 25 years of age.

FA is more prevalent in the White population than any other race, as the mutation is thought to originate from a common European ancestor. The carrier rate for FA is estimated to be 1 in 75. As an autosomal recessive disease, it affects males and females equally. The age of onset is usually in early adolescence, most commonly during the age of 8 to 15.
