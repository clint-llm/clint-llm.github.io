Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including chronic hypertension with or without superimposed pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia with or without severe feature, Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes and Low Platelet Count (HELLP) syndrome or eclampsia present a significant risk of morbidity to both mother and fetus. Although appropriate prenatal care with close observation to detect signs of end organ damage and prompt delivery to reduce or avoid adverse effects have produced reduced morbidity and mortality, morbidity and mortality still do occur. While hypertension itself presents concerns during pregnancy, adverse effects from progression to pre-eclampsia/eclampsia along with HELLP syndrome present the primary concern. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hypertension in pregnancy and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe hypertension in pregnancy,
- Explain the causes of hypertension in pregnancy. 
- Outline the management strategies for the different causes of hypertension in pregnancy. 
- Summarize a structured interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of pregnant patients with hypertension.
