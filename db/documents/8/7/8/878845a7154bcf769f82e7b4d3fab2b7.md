If bullae are tense and tender, incision and drainage followed by wet dressing are recommended. Bullae may also be deflated with a sterile needle, leaving the blister roof intact. Wet compresses are helpful for rapid resolution of the bulla followed by topical antibiotics. BDD can coexist with and may be secondary to clinically indiscernible bacterial infections of the upper and lower respiratory or gastrointestinal tract, which underlines the need for systemic antibiotic therapy.

Topical antibiotics alone are inadequate in most cases. Systemic antibiotics are commonly recommended to avert the development of new lesions and the spread of infection to other sites. Oral antibiotics also decrease the chances of spread to other people. B-Lactamase-resistant antibiotics (flucloxacillin, dicloxacillin, cloxacillin) are the drug of choice because S. aureus is often resistant to penicillin. For cases that show MRSA positivity along with systemic signs, intravenous vancomycin is indicated.
