Measurement: Currently available methods for apo B measurement include automated immunoassays. Reference material is available that has allowed for the standardization of Apo B measurements.  The bias and imprecision for 22 immunonephelometric and immunoturbidimetric assays ranged were usually below 5%.

There is much recent interest in the role of remnant particles in ASCVD.  Assaying Apo B48 serves as a reliable measure of chylomicron remnants.

Apolipoprotein A acts as a surrogate marker of HDL plasma concentration, and evidence of the utility of the ApoB: Apo A ratio as a predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been reported, especially in the INTERHEART study. However, given the controversy about the role of HDL in preventing atherosclerosis, there is no strong indication to measure apoA.

The estimated non-HDL-C, i.e., total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol, has received strong backing as a predictor of CVD providing similar information as ApoB measurement.  However, while there is a correlation between the two measures, discordance has been noted, particularly in patients with dyslipoproteinemias; thus, they should not be considered equivalent measures.  Nonetheless, when measurement of LDL-C is unreliable, as with hypertriglyceridemia, non-HDL-cholesterol is a valuable adjunct to monitoring therapy.
