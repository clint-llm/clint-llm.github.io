Asherman syndrome should be treated by a surgeon experienced with hysteroscopy, sometimes with sonographic or laparoscopic guidance. These surgeons often recommend removing scars with scissors but may also use other modalities with care taken not to create further disease. Preoperative and postoperative treatment with oral, transdermal, or intramuscular estrogen preparations may help to reduce scarring postoperatively and promote regeneration of the normal endometrium.

Devices to prevent the apposition of the uterine walls may also reduce scar formation. The devices are placed intraoperatively but need to be monitored carefully to reduce the unintended risk of atrophy of the wall due to pressure from the device.

Experimental protocols to rebuild the endometrium by infusing stem cells derived from the patient may provide some promise in the future. These stem cells may be derived from the patient's blood cells, fresh or freeze-dried amniotic tissue, or other sources. However, further studies are needed to confirm the safety, efficacy, and risks associated with these protocols.

Although adhesive gels containing synthetic hyaluronidase have been studied and show promise in reducing the recurrences of the adhesions, evaluation of these studies has not confirmed their benefit.

Reevaluation one to two weeks postoperatively may allow earlier identification of recurrent adhesions while small and allow resection before these adhesions worsen.
