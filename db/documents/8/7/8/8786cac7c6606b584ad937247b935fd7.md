Refractory shock carries a mortality rate of up to 60%. The key to survival is to identify the cause and treat promptly and initiate combination vasopressor therapy early. Unfortunately, even with multiple rescue therapies, multi-organ failure is common, so patient monitoring is vital. An interprofessional team of intensivists, ICU nurses, and pharmacists should work together in identifying any drug interactions and choice of rescue therapy. The ICU nurses should monitor the patient for signs of organ failure like oliguria, poor oxygenation, coagulopathy, loss of pulses, abdominal pain (secondary to mesenteric ischemia), and stroke. Close communication is important between the interprofessional team to improve outcomes. If the patient undergoes cardiac surgery, monitoring complications is vital.
