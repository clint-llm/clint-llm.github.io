Local anesthetics (LAs) in children are used for procedures from topical application for peripheral IV starts to neuraxial use for regional anesthesia. Recently, intravenous infusions of local anesthetics for systemic neuropathic pain have been used. LAs can also be administered via subcutaneous, intramuscular, and perineural routes.

Eutectic mixture of LA (EMLA) cream is a mixture of 2.5% lidocaine and 2.5% prilocaine that is often used to numb the skin for peripheral IV starts, subcutaneous port access, port wine birthmark treatments, and lumbar punctures.
