Treatment of early-onset scoliosis is a team-based interdisciplinary care approach.Â This includes pediatric, genetic, pulmonology, cardiology, anesthesia, surgeon, social work, and physical therapy experts. In certain cases, it can include the pediatric intensivist if anticipating a stay in the intensive care unit following surgery. Consultations with these specialists should include a pre-operative meeting to maximize the medical status of any patient undergoing a complex spinal deformity procedure.
