Disease progression in progressive supranuclear palsy usually occurs fairly rapidly and relentlessly.

In a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis, predictors of shorter survival included the progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson (PSP-RS) phenotype compared with the progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism (PSP-P) phenotype, early falls, and early cognitive symptoms (both more common in the PSP-RS phenotype).
