The exact pathogenesis of pustular psoriasis has not been fully elucidated. However, based on the expression of certain cytokines and responses to specific medications, several mechanisms have been proposed. A combination of genetic susceptibility and exposure to certain inciting factors (e.g., withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids) lead to an upregulation of specific cytokines and accumulation of neutrophils in the epidermis.
