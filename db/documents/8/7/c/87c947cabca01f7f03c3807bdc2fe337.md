Nerve fibers that transmit both nociceptive and non-nociceptive information innervate the outer annulus of the intervertebral disc. Blood vessels that supply the outer annulus travel along with these nerve fibers. Pain from a herniated or degenerated intervertebral disc does not only occur from the mechanical compression of the spinal nerve root or spinal cord within the canal but also be secondary to inflammation of the nociceptive neurovascular supply of the intervertebral disc. Also noted, are the nerve growth factor-dependent neurons that play a role in the modulation of pain in response to inflammation of the intervertebral disc
