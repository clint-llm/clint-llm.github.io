Bone marrow or fat emboli have been suspected to cause the majority of adult cases of ACS. Analysis of postmortem bronchoalveolar lavage in patients who died of SCD frequently reveals fat containing alveolar macrophages. Bone marrow ischemia and necrosis are characteristic of vaso-occlusive crises, which can result in the release of bone marrow and fat into the venous circulation. These particles can then travel to the lungs triggering vaso-occlusion and ACS.

Other causes of ACS include infection, asthma, hypoxemia, oversedation, and post-operative complications. In children, infection is often a common inciting event. Asthma exacerbated bronchospasms can lead to hypoxia, which leads to sickling. Patients with SCD and asthma are two to four times more likely to get ACS than patients with SCD alone. Chronic hypoxemia is seen in many patients, especially in children overnight. Of note, these patients can have normal oxygen saturation during the day but develop hypoxia at night, leading to sickling. Postoperative patients can have hypoventilation due to pain or medications that can cause sedation. Hypoventilation in these settings may precipitate sickling in the pulmonary circulation resulting in ACS. Patients with sickle cell disease are more likely to develop in situ thrombi in the pulmonary circulation rather than a pulmonary embolism. However, pulmonary embolism should still be considered if the patient has signs of an extremity deep venous thrombosis or a clinical picture suggestive of pulmonary embolism.
