Because of advances in neuroscience, the structures included in the limbic system have undergone redefinition multiple times. However, the structures included in the limbic system are in the general region that borders the cerebral hemisphere and brainstem, lateral to the thalamus, underneath the cerebral cortex, but above the brainstem. The particular embryologic origins can separate the currently defined major structures of the limbic system. The mesencephalic components are from visual, auditory, and somatosensory inputs processed in the region. The diencephalic components are the hypothalamus, anterior thalamic nuclei, and habenular commissure. The telencephalic components contain the cortical and subcortical regions; which are the olfactory bulbs, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, fornix, columns of the fornix, mammillary body, septum pellucidum, amygdala, cingulate gyrus, entorhinal cortex.

While the limbic system was initially suggested to be the sole neurological system involved in regulating emotion, it is now considered only one part of the brain to regulate visceral, autonomic processes. In general, the limbic system assists in various processes relating to cognition; including spatial memory, learning, motivation, emotional processing, and social processing.
