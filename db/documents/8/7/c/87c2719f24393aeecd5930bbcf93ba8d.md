The management of pleural disease is complex and often poses a management dilemma. This usually requires a multidisciplinary team and inter-professional communication between specialists in pulmonary medicine, thoracic surgery, and oncology, especially in patients with malignancy as an etiology of the disease. The decision to perform pleurodesis should be undertaken after careful discussion between the patient and the medical team. The nurse plays an essential role in the management of the patient in the preoperative and postoperative phases in terms of education of the patient and family, control of postoperative pain, and early mobilization after the procedure. To improve patient selection and outcomes after pleurodesis, an inter-professional team is exceptionally vital and integral to the safety of this complicated procedure.
