The iliopsoas muscle runs near different viscera; some pathologies affecting the muscle can simulate a disease of the internal organs. In the presence of a lesion of the right muscle, the pain is felt in the lower right quadrant, mimicking appendicitis. Hypertrophy of the muscle can prevent the correct passage of the fecal material of the colon. This may be responsible for compression of the femoral nerve and the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh at the level of the lacuna musculorum and the genitofemoral nerve at the level of the vessel’s lacuna gap (lacuna vasculorum), below the inguinal ligament.

It is difficult to diagnose a specific problem in the complex iliopsoas, but the following will demonstrate some evaluation procedures for identifying recurrent dysfunctions.

**Iliopsoas Hematoma**

A hematoma in the iliopsoas muscle could occur from direct trauma or a spontaneous hematoma. The latter could be caused by hemophilia, liver disease (cirrhosis), or errors in blood coagulation management (previous cardiac valve interventions).

**Iliopsoas Snapping**

Iliopsoas snapping (IS) or coxa saltans is a dysfunction of the iliopsoas complex, which creates audible and palpable noise during active hip movements, with or without pain. There are three types of IS: external, internal, and intra-articular.

After an accurate history (about 50% of IS occurs after a trauma to the hip) and a general palpatory inspection to highlight some anomalies, the active iliopsoas snapping test is performed. From the position of the Fabere test with the patient supine, the operator places his hand on the inguinal area. The patient returns the lower limb to a neutral position (abduction, external rotation, extension, and rest).

**Iliacus Muscle Hematoma**

Hematoma of the iliacus muscle is an infrequent event. As with the psoas major muscle, hematoma could occur due to diseases related to blood coagulation, either hereditary or acquired.

**Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy**

Using magnetic resonance imaging tests in patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, the iliopsoas muscle was shown to be (in 67% of patients) less involved in the disease, with a course of slower strength loss. The tone and size are maintained over time, but the patient cannot use the muscle well (neuromuscular coordination), particularly during walking. These characteristics are also found in other dystrophies (dystrophinopathy).

**Groin Pain**

Groin pain can result from iliopsoas tendinitis, which could derive from previous surgery or functional overloads. In the first case, an endoscopic iliopsoas tenotomy is generally recommended, while in the second case, it is advisable to reduce the muscle's workload.
