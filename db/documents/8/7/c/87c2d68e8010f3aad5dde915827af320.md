The management of tufted hair folliculitis is best done with an interprofessional team that also includes nurses and pharmacists.

Treatment of tufted hair folliculitis is not codified, and there is no satisfactory therapy for this condition. If a cause can be identified for tufted hair folliculitis, treatment is aimed at the underlying disease. Otherwise, therapy should be directed toward decreasing discomfort and improve appearance. To improve outcomes, clinicians should not aggressively pursue surgical options as they often lead to more harm than good.

The outcomes for most patients are guarded. The condition is known to cause significant emotional distress and hence a mental health nurse should be consulted.
