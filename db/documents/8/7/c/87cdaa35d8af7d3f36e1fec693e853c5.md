Relevant Anatomy

- Lower eyelid margin: this should rest at the inferior limbus with no scleral show and its lowest point slightly lateral to the pupil.

- Lower eyelid crease: should rest 2 mm below the lash line medially and 5 mm below the lash line laterally.

- Lamellae of the lower eyelid: anterior lamella (skin and orbicularis oculi muscle), middle lamella (orbital septum and tarsal plate), posterior lamella (lower eyelid retractors and palpebral conjunctiva).

- Lower eyelid retractors: consists of the capsulopalpebral fascia (web-like band of connective tissue which transmits forces from the inferior rectus to the lower lid) and the inferior tarsal muscle, both of which insert onto the tarsal plate.

- Post-septal infraorbital fat pads: there are small medial (nasal), large central, and small lateral (temporal). The fat in the medial compartment is classically lighter in color and denser than the fat of the other compartments. The clinician can best visualize the infraorbital fat pads with the patient looking upwards.

- Inferior oblique muscle: this muscle separates the medial and central fat pads of the lower lid.

- Arcuate expansion: separates the lateral and central fat pads of the lower lid.

- Sub-orbicularis oculi fat (SOOF): a supraperiosteal submuscular fat excess located below the lateral half of the infraorbital rim.

- Orbicularis oculi muscle: this muscle has a pretarsal component (approximately 4 mm) and pre-septal component (from the inferior border of the tarsus to the arcus marginalis or orbital rim). Medially, the orbicularis attaches just below the orbital rim without an intervening ligamentous structure, which contributes to the formation of the nasojugal groove (tear trough). The lateral orbicularis is secured to the bone via the orbital retaining ligament. The orbital portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle extends inferiorly from the arcus marginalis and overlies the upper maxilla.

Characteristic signs of aging to the lower eyelid and midface

- Dermatochalasis: excess lower lid skin.

- Steatoblepharon (pseudoherniated orbital fat): occurs secondary to globe descent within the orbit, weakening of the orbital septum, and attenuation of the orbicularis oculi muscle.

- Double-convex pattern of the eyelid-cheek transition: this is caused by fat herniation above the orbital rim (the first convexity), hollowing over the infraorbital rim (nasojugal groove or tear trough), and ptotic cheek tissue inferiorly (the second convexity).

- Negative vector: describes a posterior displacement of the orbital rim relative to the lower lid.

- Lid laxity: can be identified using 1) the snap test, where the lower lid is pulled inferiorly and observed to see how quickly it returns to its original position (should occur immediately) and 2) the distraction test, where the lower lid gets pulled from the globe, and the distance is measured (greater than 6 mm is abnormal). Note: Patients with lower lid laxity are prone to develop lower lid malposition post-operatively.

- Malar bags (festoons): hammocks of lax skin and orbicularis muscle that appear as bag-like structures, typically rest below the orbital rim
