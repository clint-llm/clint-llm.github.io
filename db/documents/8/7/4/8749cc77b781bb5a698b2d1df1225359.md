A contracted socket is itself a grave complication. With every failure, the ability to retain a prosthesis deteriorates, and the morbidity increases. Reconstruction is always associated with a risk of infection, which is higher in immunocompromised patients.

Flap or graft-related complications like necrosis, fat atrophy, the formation of deep subconjunctival cysts, post-operative hematoma, granuloma formation, ulceration, and dehiscence at the donor site as discussed above, may ensue.

Implant-related complications include implant exposure, extrusion, migration, infection, and orbital volume deficiency.
