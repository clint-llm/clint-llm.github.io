A seizure is an episodic, excessive, and disorderly neuronal activity in the brain. These have traditionally been classified into partial and generalized seizures. Partial seizure refers to abnormal neural activity that is located in only one area of the cerebral hemisphere and having a fixed focal or localized onset. When there is no impairment in consciousness, it is called a simple partial seizure, and when there is impairment in consciousness, it is called a complex partial seizure. Patients with simple partial seizures remain aware and awake throughout the seizure, and some patients can even talk during the episode. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of simple partial seizures and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of a simple partial seizure.
- Describe the features of simple partial seizures.
- Outline the treatment strategies for simple partial seizures.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team in educating the patient and family on how to avoid seizure-related complications, which can lead to better patient outcomes in those with simple partial seizures.
