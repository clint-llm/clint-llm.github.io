**Laboratory**

**Liver Chemistry Panel
**

- Serum total and fractioned direct bilirubin should be obtained. In cholestasis, predominantly direct hyperbilirubinemia (more than 50% of total bilirubin) is observed. Serum alkaline phosphatase is also evaluated 3 times more than the upper normal limit in cholestasis,Â while normal or mild elevation in transaminases (ALT/AST) is a pure form of cholestatic jaundice. Serum albumin is usually normal except in cirrhosis and chronic liver disease where albumin is decreased.

**Hematology
**

- Leukocytosis is found in cholangitis, alcoholic hepatitis, and underlying malignancy.

- Acute severe anemia can be found due to hemolysis. Evaluation of peripheral smear, reticulocyte count can help to differentiate. Chronic anemia can be seen in cirrhosis or underlying malignancy.

- Elevated prothrombin time can be seen with cholestasis which rapidly reverses with vitamin K supplementation as opposed to patients with cirrhosis.

**Radiological Evaluation
**

- Abdominal ultrasound can help to identify if there is any biliary ductal dilation and help differentiate hepatocellular causes of cholestasis (where ducts will be normal size) versus biliary obstruction (where ducts will be dilated).

- If dilated biliary ducts are encountered on initial ultrasound, then magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography can be used to assess bile ducts to identify stone, stricture vs. malignancy. CT scan can be helpful as well; however, MRI has better sensitivity.

**Liver Biopsy
**

- Helpful in intrahepatic cholestasis to evaluate for various possible underlying etiologies.
