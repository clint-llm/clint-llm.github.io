**Patient Positioning**

The patient can be supine, sitting, semi-sitting, or semi-lateral decubitus. It is most often done with the patient sitting at a 30-degree angle, and a pillow or blanket is placed beneath the patient's chest with the patient looking away from the side of the block. The key things to keep in mind when positioning the patient are:

- The patient should be able to lie comfortably and still in the same position.

- The area on the neck should be adequately exposed.

- There should be enough space between the patient and bed for the ultrasound probe and needle to fit properly if an in-plane posterolateral approach is desired.
