When patients present with pulmonary symptoms and have eosinophilia, one should consider acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES).  Secondary pulmonary eosinophilia occurs due to known causes, such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), parasites, medications, radiation effects, and malignancies. These patients should be referred to a pulmonologist for definitive workup. Once the diagnosis is made the patient may be followed by the primary care provider, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. The outcomes depend on the cause.
