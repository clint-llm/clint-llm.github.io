The radial nerve is responsible for innervating the extensor muscles of the wrist and digits. Consequently, injury to the radial nerve results in the inability to properly utilize these extensor muscles. As a result, the hand hangs flaccidly in a position of flexion when the patient attempts to bring the arm to a horizontal position. This is known as wrist drop. Causes of wrist drop can range for penetrating trauma to external compression to systemic nutritional deficiencies. Treatment may not be required or may involve avoidance of compression or splinting, or, in some cases, surgery. This depends on the nature and extent of the injury to the radial nerve. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of wrist drop and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with wrist drop.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the causes of wrist drop.
- Describe the presentation of wrist drop.
- Outline the treatment options for wrist drop.
- Explain the importance of optimizing care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by wrist drop.
