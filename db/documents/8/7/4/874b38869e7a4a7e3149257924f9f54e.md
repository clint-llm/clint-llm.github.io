During a neonatal recording, it is essential to pay attention to the following

- Minimize disturbance to the neonate.

- Appropriate equipment preparation and positioning enables the technologist to observe and document gestational age (GA), conceptional age (CA), state of the infant, clinical data.

- Minimize interference and artifacts.

- As the skin resistance in neonates tends to be high, skin preparation is of utmost importance. Adequate use of conducting paste helps in keeping the impedance below 5-10 kOhms.
