Histopathology of the kidney shows fibrin deposition in the capillary lumen with extensive necrosis of the renal cortex and widespread renal arterial thrombosis.

Immunofluorescence demonstrates glomerular IgM, C3, and C1q deposition.

Electron microscopy shows swollen mesangium with intraluminal platelet microthrombi and subendothelial space widening filled with fibrinogen. Obliterating endarteritis may be seen later.
