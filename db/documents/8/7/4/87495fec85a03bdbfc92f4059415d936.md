Understanding basic skin anatomy is crucial to understanding the anatomy and physiology of flaps. The deep and superficial vascular plexus supply the skin. The deep vascular plexus is also known as the subdermal plexus. This vascular supply serves two main functions- nutritional support and thermoregulation. All flaps rely on the skin's plexuses for survival.

There are four basic types of cutaneous flaps- random, axial, reverse flow axial pattern flaps, and island flaps. Random flaps rely on blood supply from the subdermal plexus, which is supplied by unnamed musculocutaneous perforators.

Reverse flow axial pattern flaps are axial flaps in which the main blood supply is divided proximally. The blood flows in a retrograde manner through the distal vessel, which is accomplished via venae comitantes, bypass vessels, and valvular incompetence. Finally, island flaps also represent a type of axial pattern flap raised on a pedicle that lacks skin to facilitate transfer to a distant site.
