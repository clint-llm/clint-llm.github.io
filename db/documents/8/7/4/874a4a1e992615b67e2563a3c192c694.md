The brain and the spinal cord receive their blood supply from the carotid arteries which branch from the aortic arch and the vertebral arteries. These branch off from the central subclavian arteries. The internal carotid artery is the main supplier of nutrient-rich blood to the brain. The spinal cord, however, receives its supply from the branches of the vertebral arteries. Each artery courses along the side of the neck forming a single basilar artery in the brain superiorly while branching bilaterally inferiorly to form a single anterior spinal artery at the level of the foramen magnum. This supplies the anterior portion of the spinal cord which covers most except for the dorsal columns. These are more posterior and require tributaries to supply this part. The dorsal columns receive blood supply by the right and left posterior spinal arteries which also originate from the vertebral artery and together, these travel in the subarachnoid space.

The anterior spinal artery is the major blood supply for the spinal cord. It descends from the level of the foramen magnum along the anterior surface of the spinal cord. As it continues to descend, the artery receives communication with other branches that enter the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramen. The artery of Adamkiewicz anastomosis with the anterior spinal artery which feeds the lower thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spinal cord.

The venous drainage of the spinal cord is accomplished by the 3 anterior and 3 posterior spinal veins. These veins drain into the internal and external vertebral plexuses which empty into the systemic segmental veins.

The lymphatics of the spinal cord are indirectly connected with the general lymphatic and venous systems. They open into the subarachnoid space.
