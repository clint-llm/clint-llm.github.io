Male hypogonadism, acquired or congenital, can be caused by defects that interfere with the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis. It is essential to distinguish between primary hypogonadism (which originates in the testes) and secondary hypogonadism (which originates in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland). Symptoms highly suggestive of hypogonadism include decreased spontaneous erections, decreased nocturnal penile tumescence, decreased libido, and reduced testicular volume. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of male hypogonadism and describes which patients are most likely to benefit from screening. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with male hypogonadism.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of male hypogonadism.
- Explain the pathophysiology of male hypogonadism.
- Review the evaluation of male hypogonadism.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to patients with male hypogonadism.
