The diagnosis and management of spontaneous intestinal perforation require an interprofessional team approach. Diagnosis is based on clinical and radiographic findings. The initial evaluation is often by a neonatologist. Radiologists play a critical role in determining the presence of free air, which is pathognomonic for spontaneous intestinal perforation.

Once the diagnosis is made, the initiation of treatment requires the involvement of a pediatric surgical team. Establishing vascular access for antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and lab analysis is crucial. A nutritionist must be involved when initiating total parenteral nutrition, and a pediatric gastroenterologist may have to be consulted later in the hospital to manage complications related to prolonged TPN. An interprofessional team approach that includes open communication channels between all team members and meticulous documentation of all interventions and findings is vital to improving the outcomes for the patients.
