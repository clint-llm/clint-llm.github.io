The diagnosis and management of BPI is extremely complicated and controversial. The injury is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, neurosurgeon, hand surgeon, physical therapist, internist, nurse practitioner and the primary care provider. After a diagnosis of BPI is made, the surgical timing for the treatment of BPI remains a topic of controversy.

There are few contraindications to brachial plexus surgery. In general, surgery should be avoided if the patient is not medically or psychologically cleared for surgery or if local wounds or infections obstruct the surgical approach. Adequate surgical exposure may be further obscured by edema and scar tissue in the cervical region. Other contraindications are determined on an individual basis. Chronic injuries to the brachial plexus that are more than 12 months old present a relative contraindication for surgical repair except in children who have greater regenerative potential.

Low-demand patients and patients with underlying joint contractures may be poor candidates for surgery due to difficulty in achieving substantial functional improvements. Patients who may be noncompliant or unable to progress through the rigorous physical therapy regimen, which may continue for several years, are likely to have poor outcomes.
