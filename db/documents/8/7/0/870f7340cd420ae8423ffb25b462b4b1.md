Cholestasis can occur either in a hepatocellular pattern where there is an impairment in bile synthesis. Bile is a highly complex,Â water-soluble medium. Bile formation included multiple different mechanisms of conjugation with multilevel regulation. The content of bile is transported in canaliculus via transported protein which creates a chemical and osmotic gradient through which water enters the canaliculi. Identification of abnormalities within some of these transporter proteins has led to an understanding mechanism of certain diseases better such as benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (F1C1 locus gene) and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (F1C2 locus gene). Failure to transport this bile salts lead to its accumulation within the liver. The strong detergent-like effect of the bile salts causes membrane injury and impairment of membrane function. Another mechanism of cholestasis is the physical obstruction to bile flow at the level of extrahepatic biliary ducts. Retained bile similarly causes hepatotoxicity.
