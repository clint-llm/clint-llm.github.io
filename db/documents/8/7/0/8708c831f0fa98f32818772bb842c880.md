In preparation for the procedure, you should ask your patient to partake in

- Tobacco cessation at least 3 to 4 weeks before surgery

- Exercising

In addition to specific patient preparation, the surgeon should also have on hand

- Blood on call to the operating room for the patient, should it be needed, (with cell saver available)

Addition, pre-operative stress testing, cardiac angiography, or intervention (open or percutaneously) have reduced mortality for aortic operations.

Perioperative antibiotics should be administered to help decrease surgical site wound infections.
