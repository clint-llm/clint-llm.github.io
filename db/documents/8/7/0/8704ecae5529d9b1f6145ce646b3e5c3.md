Most patients with severely elevated BP have no acute end-organ damage (hypertensive urgency). Nevertheless, some patients have signs and symptoms of acute, ongoing injury, which is recognized as hypertensive emergency or formerly as malignant hypertension.

It is generally not recommended to decrease the BP too quickly or too much as ischemic damage can occur in vascular territories that have become habituated with the elevated level of BP. For most hypertensive emergencies, the MAP should be reduced gradually by approximately 10 to 20% within the first hour and by a further 5% to 15% over the next 24 hours, with a final goal of approximately 25% reduction compared with baseline.

Many patients have poorly controlled essential or secondary hypertension. Thus, long-term management turns out to be the primacy once the hypertensive crisis has been addressed.
