The glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, formerly known as gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) was first isolated in 1973 from porcine small intestine based on its ability to inhibit gastric hydrochloric acid secretion. Soon after, in 1980, it was found that GIP is a weak inhibitor of acid secretion and potent stimulator of insulin post meals.
