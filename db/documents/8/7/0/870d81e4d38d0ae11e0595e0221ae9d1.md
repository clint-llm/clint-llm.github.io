Research has not established the frequency of chest wall tumors in males versus females. The age of presentation varies; however, younger patients have smaller and more benign tumors, whereas older patients tend to have larger and more aggressive tumors.

The primary chest wall tumors have an incidence of less than two percent of the population.

The sarcomas of the chest wall form in the cartilage, soft tissues, and bones of the chest cavity, including chondrosarcomas, osteosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, plasmacytomas, malignant fibrous histiocytomas, and Ewing sarcomas. The most common primary malignant chest wall tumors are chondrosarcomas.

Approximately fifty to eighty percent of chest wall tumors are malignant, and fifty-five percent of these arise from bone or cartilage and forty-five percent from soft tissue.
