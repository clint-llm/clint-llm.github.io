Hypocarbia is a result of hyperventilation. Increased ventilation to the alveolar space quickly removes gaseous CO2. This increases the diffusion gradient of CO2 from blood to alveoli. Subsequently, CO2 is more readily removed from the body. There are virtually no mechanisms outside of decreasing respiratory rate to regulate this loss.

The estimation of change in pH with hyperventilation can be done with the help of the following:

- Acute respiratory alkalosis: Change in pH = 0.008 x (40 - PaCO2)

- Chronic respiratory alkalosis: Change in pH = 0.017 x (40 - PaCO2)
