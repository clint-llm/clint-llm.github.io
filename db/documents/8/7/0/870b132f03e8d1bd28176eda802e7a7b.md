The exact mechanism of action for inhaled anesthetics remains mostly unknown. Fundamentally, inhaled anesthetics work within the central nervous system by augmenting signals to chloride channels (GABA receptors) and potassium channels while depressing neurotransmission pathways. These pathways, including acetylcholine, both the muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, glutamate or NMDA receptors, and serotonin (5-HT receptors).

Isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane all decrease systemic blood pressure by decreasing systemic vascular resistance. For the most part, these agents preserve cardiac output, but cardiac depression can be seen if combined with other IV agents or in patients with acute cardiogenic shock.  Desflurane has been known to cause hypertension and tachycardia with rapid administration of the agent.

Nitrous oxide can cause myocardial depression, but this effect is offset by the sympathetic increasing leading to minimal hemodynamic changes.

Volatile anesthetic agents are not true respiratory depressant drugs in the sense that they decrease the respiratory rate seen by other agents.  They do decrease tidal volumes but with the respiratory rate increase.  This is not equally matched; therefore, the minute ventilation can decrease.
