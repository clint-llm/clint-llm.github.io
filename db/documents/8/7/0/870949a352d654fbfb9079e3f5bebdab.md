Cocaine can be snorted, swallowed, injected, or smoked. Its pharmacodynamics involves multiple complex mechanisms, although its half-life is short at about 1 hour. This drug binds and blocks monoamine (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) reuptake transporters with equal affinity. Monoamines accumulate in the synaptic cleft resulting in enhanced and prolonged sympathetic effects. The principal actions of cocaine on the cardiovascular system are from alpha- and beta-1-adrenoceptor stimulation resulting in increased heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, and myocardial contractility, which are major determinants of myocardial oxygen demand. Cocaine and its metabolites may cause arterial vasoconstriction hours after use.
