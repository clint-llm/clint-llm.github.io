The prognosis for corneal foreign bodies varies with location and depth, and type of substance. Superficial and peripheral corneal foreign bodies have an excellent prognosis, without long-term vision deficits, in most cases.

Centrally located or full-thickness corneal foreign bodies still have an excellent long-term prognosis. However, they are associated with more complications and require closer and more frequent follow-up appointments.

All centrally located rust rings come with a greater risk of visually significant scarring. However, close and frequent follow up can help avoid this outcome.
