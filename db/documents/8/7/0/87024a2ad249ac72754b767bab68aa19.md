The simplest test often available to evaluate an oncologic patient presenting with neck or back pain is an x-ray of the spinal column. Plain anterior and posterior (AP) and lateral images are often non-sensitive or specificÂ and require at least 50% bone erosion before an abnormality can be observed. Spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for evaluating these lesions. MRI would show extension, levels involved, and canal compromise, as well as provided clues to the etiology of the metastasis. However, this is not always possible, for example, when a patient has an implanted pacemaker or internal defibrillator. Myelography associated with or without computed tomography (CT) imaging should be considered in patients that are not candidates for MRI. Myelography provides the advantage of sending cerebrospinal fluid for pathology evaluation, but it has significant limitations when a lesion completely occludes the canal. In these cases, multiple spinal injections of contrast might be required to bypass the level of obstruction. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan is another modality that is sensitive but offers poor anatomical localization.
