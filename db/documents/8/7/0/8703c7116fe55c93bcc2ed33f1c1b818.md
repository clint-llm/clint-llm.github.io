The facial artery has multiple branches that supply many structures.  Supplied by the facial artery, the buccinator and levator anguli oris are two muscles that lie deep to this vasculature.  The artery may pass through, or over (normal variant), the levator labii superioris.

The facial artery has a cervical branch that gives rise to four other vessels before continuing its course into the face. The vessels of the cervical branches are the ascending palatine artery, tonsillar branch, submental artery, and glandular branches.  On the face, four main vessels arise from the trunk of the facial artery: the inferior labial artery, superior labial artery, lateral nasal branch (to the nasalis), and the angular artery.
