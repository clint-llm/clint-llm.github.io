Aphthous ulcers or canker sores are very common oral mucosal lesions, whose etiology remains a mystery. These shallow ulcers while benign have a very high morbidity and thus an interprofessional team is recommended for management. In most people, aphthous ulcers are recurrent and often take 1-3 weeks to resolve. However, the ulcer-free period varies from individual to individual. There are many treatments for these oral mucosal lesions and the choice depends on the severity and personal experience. Unfortunately, there is no single therapy that works in everyone and no treatment is better than the other. Patient education by a team of clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists is the key to prevent morbidity. Smoking should be discontinued and one may have to avoid the triggers- mostly certain foods. Patients should be educated that in most cases, these ulcers resolve without any treatment.
