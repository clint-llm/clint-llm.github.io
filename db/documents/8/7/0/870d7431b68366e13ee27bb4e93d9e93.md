Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gives rise to ACTH and melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). This association is clinically important for Addison disease.

ACTH receptors are in the adrenal cortex, in particular, the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis. The receptors are G protein-coupled receptors, thus stimulating adenylyl cyclase. This leads to an increase in intracellular cAMP and activation of protein kinase A.
