As outlined in the treatment/management section below, a number of measures should be taken while the patient undergoes evaluation for rAAA. In hemodynamically unstable patients, the patient can be taken to the operating room based on symptoms alone (hypotension, flank/back pain, and pulsatile abdominal mass) or with confirmation of diagnosis with a bedside ultrasound. Although no studies have specifically addressed the diagnostic characteristics of bedside ultrasound in rAAA, the systematic review of the literature revealed sensitivities of 98% to 100% and specificities of 94% to 100%. These results are similar to screening ultrasound performed in radiology suites, which have reported sensitivities of 94% to 100% and specificities of 98% to 100%. In the hemodynamically stable patient, the diagnostic study of choice to identify rAAA is a CT with intravenous (IV) contrast, as it affords the ability to identify the proximity/involvement of the renal arteries as well as aneurysm morphology.
