The development of the cochlea originates at gestational day 4 from the surface ectoderm. It begins as an otic vesicle that develops into the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear. The dorsal aspect of the labyrinth develops into the utricle and semicircular ducts while the ventral aspect transforms into the cochlea and saccule.

The brain regions associated with central auditory processing develop with the various regions of the brain (auditory cortex: telencephalon; medial geniculate: diencephalon; inferior colliculus: mesencephalon; and the cochlear and superior olivary nuclei: rhombencephalon). These areas are fully functioning by birth. These regions are highly plastic. Therefore, auditory processing is in a constant form of change and development that lasts throughout life.
