Since 1970, the rate of cesarean delivery has increased dramatically from 5% in 1970 to 30% in 2005.

Complications in patients undergoing TOLAC can occur; however, appropriately selected patients can benefit from attempting a vaginal delivery in the appropriate setting. When successful, VBAC is associated with a decrease in maternal morbidity and decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies. Patients who have undergone successful VBAC benefit from the avoidance of surgical recovery in the postpartum period. Increase in VBAC deliveries also will serve to decrease the overall cesarean delivery rate. More recently it is recognized that as the number of cesarean sections a patient undergoes increases so does the risk of significant obstetrical complications. These complications include massive postpartum hemorrhage, placenta previa, and related placental disorders.
