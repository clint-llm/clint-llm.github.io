According to the 2017 classification system put forth by the American Academy of Periodontology, necrotizing periodontal disease is a category of diseases that affects the periodontium through theÂ extent of ulceration and necrosis. Within this group, there are three major subsets:

- Necrotizing gingivitis

- Necrotizing periodontitis

- Necrotizing stomatitis

The differences between these subsets are based on the extent and site of damage. Necrotizing gingivitis is used to describe necrosis and ulceration limited to the gingiva (gums). A progression of that condition is necrotizing periodontitis, where there is damage to and loss of the periodontium surrounding each tooth, including the gingival tissues, alveolar bone, and periodontal ligament. Lastly, necrotizing stomatitis is a term used to describe the destruction of the mucous membranes in the mouth and the areas beyond the mucogingival junction, such as the cheek, tongue, and palate.
