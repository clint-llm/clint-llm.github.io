Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers (nNMBs) administration serves as primary therapy in facilitating endotracheal intubations and adjuvant therapy in the perioperative maintenance of anesthesia and care of the critically ill patient. Primarily nNMBs (rocuronium, vecuronium, pancuronium, atracurium, cisatracurium, mivacurium) areÂ used to facilitate airway management and decrease the risk of laryngeal injury during regular and emergent intubations.

**FDA-Approved Indications**

- Endotracheal intubation: Primary; improve intubation outcomes, facilitates airway management.

- Surgical procedures: Adjunctive; combined with anesthetics, improves surgical field prep.

- Mechanical ventilation: Adjunctive; improves outcomes in mechanical ventilation.

Currently, there are no FDA off-label indications.
