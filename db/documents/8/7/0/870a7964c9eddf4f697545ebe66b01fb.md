Patients with recurrent conjunctivitis should be monitored by both a primary care clinician and an ophthalmic specialist. The primary careÂ provider should communicate any history relevant to giant fornix syndrome, such as congenital diseases, previous surgeries, and trauma history. Ruling out systemic disease may also fall on the shoulders of primary care providers. Emergency and urgent care physicians and nurses have a role if the patient visits these clinics regularly and does not have a primary care physician managing their care. Ophthalmic specialists should pay attention to the history of the 'patient's eye signs and symptoms as GFS is often misdiagnosed for months to years. If treatments fail to improve the symptoms and signs, the ophthalmic specialists should consider giant fornix syndrome to prevent the constant recurrence and degradation of the conjunctivae and surrounding tissues.
