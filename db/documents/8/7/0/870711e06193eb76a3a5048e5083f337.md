Pressure injuries of the skin and soft tissue are formed when the pressure above a certain threshold causes prolonged tissue ischemia, eventually leading to necrosis. Injury from reperfusion is also a contributing factor, as the return of blood supply after a period of ischemia can cause the formation of reactive oxygen species triggering an inflammatory response. In patients positioned at an incline, internal structures such as bone and muscle are displaced downward due to gravity, which can lead to tissue hypoxia as blood vessels are distorted or flattened.

One type of pressure injury is the Kennedy ulcer. It occurs suddenly in a terminal patient. There are gaps regarding the physiopathology of this ulcer as the current knowledge is based on hypotheses. There is a lack of knowledge about care approaches, but, it is clear that the main objective in this situation at the end of life would be to prioritize patient comfort and quality of life.
