Patients presenting with an anorectal abscess often experience significant perineal pain and occasionally drainage. Systemic signs, such as fever, are rare in immunocompetent patients. The pain experienced is often exquisite, preventing a patient from sitting or tolerating a physical exam. Deeper abscesses may cause low back pain or pressure.

A thorough history and physical examination are necessary to classify the fistula and create a treatment plan appropriately. Previous diagnoses of inflammatory bowel disease, rectal or anal neoplasm, previous anorectal disease, and prior surgeries are important in diagnosis and treatment planning. Baseline fecal continence should be assessed and documented. In the presence of multiple fistulas or ongoing recurrence, a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease should be considered.
