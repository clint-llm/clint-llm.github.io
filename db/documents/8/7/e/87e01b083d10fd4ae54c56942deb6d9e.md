Hydrazines (R2N−NR2) are a class of chemical compounds with 2 nitrogen atoms linked by a single covalent bond and may carry up to four alkyl substituents.

Commonly encountered examples include hydrazine, hydrazones, 1,1-dimethylhydrazine, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, and monomethylhydrazine (MMH). In its pure form, hydrazine (H2N-NH2) is a clear, colorless liquid chemical with an ammonia-like odor.

Throughout this activity, the word "hydrazines" refers to hydrazine, 1,1-dimethylhydrazine, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, and monomethylhydrazine.
