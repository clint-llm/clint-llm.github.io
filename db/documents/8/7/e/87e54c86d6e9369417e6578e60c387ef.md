The superior laryngeal nerve and recurrent laryngeal branches of the vagus nerve mainly innervate the larynx.

The superior laryngeal nerve arises from the inferior ganglia of the vagus nerve and descends adjacent to the pharynx, behind the internal carotid artery prior to splitting into the internal and external branches.

The branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (aka the external laryngeal nerve) descends beneath the sternothyroid muscle to supply the cricothyroid muscle. This is the only muscle of the larynx that is not supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

The internal branches of the superior laryngeal nerve (aka the internal laryngeal nerve) transverse with the superior laryngeal artery through the aperture in the thyrohyoid membrane. It provides sensory innervation to the laryngeal cavity superior to the level of vocal folds. It is responsible for the sensory afferent part of the cough reflex.

The recurrent laryngeal branches of the vagus nerve supply sensation to the laryngeal cavity below the level of the vocal folds. They run immediately posterior to the thyroid gland and are responsible for innervation of all the muscles of the larynx except the cricothyroid, and for sensation inferior to the vocal folds.
