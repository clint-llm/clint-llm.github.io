The primary function of uterine contractions is to expel the fetus from the uterine cavity. However, contractions also play an essential role in minimizing postpartum hemorrhage. Knowing the normal physiology of uterine contractions also allows clinicians to better differentiate between the true onset of labor and prodromal labor, also known as Braxton Hicks contractions. Braxton Hicks contractions occur sporadically and do not increase in strength. They are irregular in duration, frequency, and intensity, are unpredictable and non-rhythmic and are more uncomfortable than painful. True labor consists of contractions at regular intervals. As labor progresses, these contractions become stronger, and the time between each contraction decreases. The first stage of labor is divided into two phases, which are defined by the degree of cervical dilation. The latent phase is during the dilation from 0 to 6 cm, while the active phase starts from 6 cm to full cervical dilation of 10 cm. The second stage of labor starts with cervical dilation of 10cm and ends with the delivery of the baby. The third stage of labor starts when the fetus is delivered and ends with the delivery of the placenta.
