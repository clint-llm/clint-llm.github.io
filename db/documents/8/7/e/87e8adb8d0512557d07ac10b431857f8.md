The fibrous pericardium is the outer layer and holds the heart in place and protect it from surrounding infections. It is composed of thick connective tissue. The serous pericardium has two layers, the visceral and parietal layers. The visceral pericardium helps to minimize friction, and the parietal pericardium provides additional defense. This activity reviews the cause, presentation and pathophysiology of fibrinous pericarditis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of fibrinous pericarditis.
- Describe the physical signs of fibrinous pericarditis.
- Summarize the treatment of fibrinous pericarditis.
- Outline modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by fibrinous pericarditis.
