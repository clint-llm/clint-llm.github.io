Since decompression sickness is a clinical diagnosis and there are no radiological or diagnostic laboratory studies, a practitioner must obtain as thorough a dive history as possible. This should include all dives in the dive series leading up to the event. The diver's computer, if available and the data can be accessed, is a valuable source of information. A health history, medical examination, and neurological examination should be completed. As noted previously, the provider should be alert for other symptoms of DCS.
