There is no exact treatment in the meantime for Tangier disease, and the attempts are to increase HDL through lifestyle modifications through maintaining regular aerobic exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, smoking cessation, and replacement of monounsaturated for saturated fatty acids raise HDL cholesterol. These interventions could improve the symptoms, especially the peripheral neuropathies. There is no firm evidence of the benefit from drug therapy to target low HDL cholesterol and optimize their LDL level, but lipid-lowering agents such as statins, niacin, and fibrates can be given either alone or in combinations.

The treatment is administered based on the manifestation such as tonsillectomy in case of tonsil enlargement leading toÂ mass symptoms or airway obstruction. Corneal transplantation may be required in case of corneal opacities, transient bracing (such as ankle-foot orthosis), and exercise for those with peripheral neuropathy. Precautions such as avoidance of high-impact sports or activities should be thoroughly prescribed in order to prevent splenic rupture if the patient has splenomegaly.

A future therapeutic approach is suggested through upregulating cholesterol uptake by hepatocytes or downregulating HDL metabolism. This can be achieved by targeted gene therapy, which causes ABC1 overexpression leading to increase cholesterol pick up within the cells.
