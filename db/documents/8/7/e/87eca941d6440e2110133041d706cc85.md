In addition to receiving the right posterior intercostal veins, the azygous vein communicates with the vertebral venous plexus that drain the back, vertebrae, and structures in the vertebral canal. The azygos vein also receives the mediastinal, esophageal, bronchial veins, hemi-azygos, and accessory hemi-azygos veins. The hemi- and accessory hemi-azygos vein crosses the midline at T9 and T8, respectively, posterior to the aorta, thoracic duct, and esophagus. In some instances, the hemi-azygos and the accessory hemi-azygos combine to form a shared vein crossing the midline at T9 emptying into the azygos vein.Â  The azygous vein enters the thorax through the aortic hiatus in the diaphragm just to the right of the cisterna chyli.
