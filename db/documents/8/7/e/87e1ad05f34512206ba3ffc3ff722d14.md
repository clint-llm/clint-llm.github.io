Cavernous sinus thrombosis is usually septic, but can also be aseptic. Septic cases can follow central facial infections, especially within the danger triangle of the face (from the corners of the mouth to the bridge of the nose). These include abscess or cellulitis, sinusitis (especially sphenoiditis and ethmoiditis), dental infections, extractions or procedures (even a posterior superior alveolar nerve block entering the pterygoid plexus), maxillofacial surgery, otitis media, and mastoiditis. Aseptic causes are less common than septic causes. These include trauma, surgery, or pregnancy.

A variety of infectious organisms can cause cavernous sinus thrombosis although the majority are bacterial. Staphylococcus aureus may account for two-thirds of cases, and methicillin resistance should be considered. Other typical organisms include Streptococcus species (approximately 20% of cases), pneumococcus (5%), gram-negative species such as Proteus, Hemophilus, Pseudomonas, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, as well as gram-positive species such as Corynebacterium and Actinomyces. Several of these (Bacteroides, Actinomyces, Fusobacterium) are anaerobic.  Fungal infection in cavernous sinus thrombosis is less common but can include Aspergillosis (most common), Zygomycosis (such as Mucormycosis) or Coccidiomycosis in immunocompromised individuals. Rare precipitants of cavernous sinus thrombosis can include parasites, such as toxoplasmosis, malaria, and trichinosis, as well as viral causes such as herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, measles, hepatitis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Immunosuppression, such as uncontrolled diabetes, steroid use, cancer, or chemotherapy, maybe a risk for not only developing cavernous sinus thrombosis but also developing complications.

The biggest risk factors are facial infections, acute sinusitis, and periorbital infections. Thrombophilia is a significant risk factor for cavernous sinus thrombosis. Women who are pregnant, post-partum, or receiving oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy may be at increased risk. A variety of thrombophilic genetic disorders may lead to cavernous sinus thromboses. These include factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin G20210A mutation, antithrombin III, protein C or S deficiency, or increased factor VIII. Acquired disorders such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, hyperhomocysteinemia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and obesity could also contribute to cavernous sinus thrombosis risk. Other risk factors for thrombosis include severe dehydration, such as in the hyperosmolar non-ketotic state, nephrotic syndrome, and sickle cell disease.
