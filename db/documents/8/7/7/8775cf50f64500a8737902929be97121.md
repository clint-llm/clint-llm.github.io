There are more than 50 species of Cryptococcus;  C. neoformans and C. gattii cause the majority of infections, and some consider them the only pathogens in humans.

C. neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that can be found in aged pigeon droppings which causes mild infections, from airway colonization or asymptomatic ones in laboratory workers to severe infections like meningitis or disseminated disease. It is the most common species from the Cryptococcus genre in our region (Brazil) and other temperate weathers around the world.

The major predisposing factor to cryptococcal infection is HIV; however, the predisposing factors in non-HIV patients are as follows

**Syndromes and Autoantibodies**

- Idiopathic CD4 lymphopenia

- Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis with autoantibodies to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor

- Autoantibodies to interferon-gamma

**Monogenic Disorders**

- Primary immunodeficiency owing to GATA2 mutations.

- Chronic granulomatous disease

- Hyperimmunoglobulin E recurrent infection syndrome (Job syndrome)

- X-linked CD40L deficiency (hyper-IgM syndrome)

**Polygenetic modifiers**

- Fc gamma receptor (FCGR) II polymorphism

**Comorbidities**

- Sarcoidosis, autoimmune disease, steroid treatment

- Hepatic disease

- Solid organ transplant conditioning
