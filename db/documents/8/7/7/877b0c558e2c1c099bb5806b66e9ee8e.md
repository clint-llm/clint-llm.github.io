Peritoneal metastasis (PM) is a relatively rare diagnosis. Due to the lack of satisfactory preoperative detection methods and imaging studies, accurate incidence data is absent. Although registry data have suggested a rise in the overall incidence of peritoneal malignancy in the last two decades, advancements have been made in health technology to manage the condition. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is of primary peritoneal origin only 3% of the time; most often, it is the result of metastatic disease. One large population-based study from Ireland has shown the annual incidence of peritoneal metastasis to have increased from 228 in 1994 to 402 in 2012. Females accounted for the majority of cases, and 70% of patients were 60 years of age or older at the time of diagnosis.

The incidence rate differs among the different types of primary cancers leading to peritoneal carcinomatosis. In the U.S., colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers with a higher rate of occurrence. Estimates of the incidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis in colorectal cancer are at around 5 to 8%, which accounts for 2 to 3 out of 100000 individuals per year.
