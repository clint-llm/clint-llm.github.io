CM-II is encountered relatively common, with an incidence of about 1 in 1000 live births. However, the true frequency is difficult to determine. It is commonly associated with neural tube defects in nearly 100% of cases, with myelomeningocele being the most common defect. Furthermore, if a child is found to have myelomeningocele at birth, most (about 95%) are associated with CM-II. CM-II is the most common Chiari malformation type that presents in childhood.
