In suspected C. perfringens infections, stool studies should be performed, which include stool culture and ELISA testing for CPA toxin. Stool studies will often also include WBCs, ova, and parasites to help rule out other etiologies. In more severe clostridial infections, imaging will be warranted to help identify the affected tissue.

An outbreak of foodborne disease is defined as the “occurrence of two or more cases of a similar illness from ingestion of a common food.”

Infection is confirmed in the following cases:

- Positive stool culture (i.e., growth of at least 10colony-forming units [CFU] C. perfringens/g)

C. perfringens can be confirmed as the source of an outbreak when either of these is positive:

- Stool cultures are positive from at least two affected individuals

- Enterotoxin is detected in stool from at least two affected individuals

- The culture of the suspect food grows at least 10 CFU C. perfringens/g

In cases of clostridial myonecrosis, imaging such as an X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan of the affected area should be obtained in addition to blood tests, which include:

- Complete blood count

- Metabolic panel

- Blood culture

- Creatine kinase levels

- Arterial blood gases

- Lactic acid
