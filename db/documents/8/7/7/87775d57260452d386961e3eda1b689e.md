The aim of surgical management in UVCP is "medialization" of the affected cord to improve voice quality. There is no consensus on the timing of surgical intervention; however, surgeons traditionally propose a "watchful waiting" period of 6 to 9 months to accomodate for spontaneous motion recovery or accommodation by the unaffected vocal cord.

Injection thyroplasty involves injection of a substance close to the affected vocal fold, moving it medially to create better contact with the adjacent cord. The procedure can be performed under local or general anesthetic with equal efficacy.

Type 1 Isshiki thyroplasty is a more permanent, medialization technique wherein a window is cut into the thyroid cartilage, and the vocal cord moved medially through use of an implant. Like injection thyroplasty, there are numerous implant materials available.

Laryngeal reinnervation utilizes functioning nerves in the vicinity of the recurrent laryngeal nerve to reestablish tone and movement within the larynx. The ansa cervicalis, phrenic, and hypoglossal nerves have all been used as nerve pedicles with good results on voice outcomes.

A systematic review by Siu et al. compared the outcomes of injection thyroplasty, type 1 thyroplasty, laryngeal reinnervation, and arytenoid adduction procedures. Despite a good body of evidence for all methods, no technique has shown a statistically significant advantage in voice outcome or quality of life compared to others.
