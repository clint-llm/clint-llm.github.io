Dyskinetic or athetoidÂ cerebral palsy is a subtype of cerebral palsy that is caused by a brain injury that occurs during late pregnancy or the early birth period. Dyskinetic cerebral palsy is marked by abnormal posturing, tone, and involuntary movements. Increased risk factors for dyskinetic cerebral palsy include brain injury and lack of oxygen during birth as well as kernicterus, which is marked by increased bilirubin.

Dyskinetic cerebral palsy is the second most common subtype of cerebral palsy after spastic cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy overall is the most common childhood disability cause. The diagnosis of dyskinetic CP is made clinically through taking a history, performing a physical exam, as well as neuroimaging. The goal of treatment and management is aimed at improved functional outcomes and increased quality of life. This is best achieved through an interprofessional team approach.
