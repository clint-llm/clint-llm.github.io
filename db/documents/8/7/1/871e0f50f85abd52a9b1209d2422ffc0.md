There are four general mechanisms responsible for the pathophysiologic impacts of arthropod bites and stings. Mechanical injury to tissue during bites and stings results in pain and swelling and provides a portal of entry for bacteria which can result in secondary infection. Allergic responses to arthropod salivary antigens are common and contribute to the development of localized and systemic rashes and cutaneous pruritus. The most significant allergic response to arthropod bites and stings is the development of anaphylaxis, which can be rapidly fatal. While someÂ arthropods can deliver toxic venom, the most significant pathophysiologic impact of arthropod bites is their potential to transmit several clinically important diseases.
