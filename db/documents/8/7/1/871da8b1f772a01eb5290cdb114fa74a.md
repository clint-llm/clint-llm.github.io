Tear film abnormalities and contact lens wear can alter corneal topography maps. In addition, the patient's eye movements, ptosis, and improper placement of the patient's head on chin rest can cause problems in data acquisition.

Comparison between topography maps of the same patient cannot be made between devices. K1, K2, and sim K astigmatism may not be the same across all devices.

There are several indices that are unique to a particular device. K max, for instance, is measured by Schiempflug tomography and not by Orbscan or Placido-based instruments.

Instilling fluorescein or mydriatic drops significantly affected the pachymetry at the pupillary center by 17+/- 53 microns in a study involving 131 eyes of 131 patients who had pentacam analysis before and after instilling either fluorescein, mydriatics, or both.

**Displaced apex syndrome:**Asymmetric bowtie pattern can be produced due to astigmatism in a completely normal eye when the curvature reference axis does not pass the corneal apex. Placido-based topography may label such eyes as ectatic, but these eyes have a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/20, normal pachymetry, and orthogonal astigmatism and have good results after refractive surgery.
