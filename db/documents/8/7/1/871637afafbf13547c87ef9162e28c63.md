Long-term treatment includes supplementation with CDCA.

Treatment in presymptomatic individuals appears to prevent clinical manifestations. Early treatment in symptomatic patients has shown to limit the progression and reverse neurologic deficits in some cases. Statin medications alone or in combination with CDCA have also been shown to decrease cholestanol concentration and improve neurologic clinical manifestation.Â As statins pose an increased risk of myopathy, coenzyme Q10 is taken concomitantly to improve muscle weakness.

Patients are treated symptomatically for the neurologic and non-neurologic manifestations of CTX. Cataract extraction is a frequent procedure in these patients. Neurologic complications of epilepsy, spasticity, and parkinsonism are treated symptomatically. Calcium and vitamin D are supplemented for patients with osteoporosis.
