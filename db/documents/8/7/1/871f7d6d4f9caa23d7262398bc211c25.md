Patients with DIPG and family members should have a complete understanding of the disease and prognosis to have realistic expectations. The timeline of how early the patient is diagnosed will have an important part in how the family reacts to the situation. It is why, in the early phase, psychologists, psychiatrists, and family therapists should form part of the team.Â The realities of deficits, physical impediments, and overall conditions after treatments should be clearly explained to the parents. Thorough training of how to manage these situations is necessary, including nasogastric nutrition, foley catheter, the possibility of being bedridden, and sacral ulcers.
