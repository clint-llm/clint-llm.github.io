The thoracic wall is primarily innervated by the intercostal nerves, which are the anterior rami of spinal nerves of T1-T11 and the anterior ramus of T12 is aÂ subcostal nerve. Each intercostal nerve supplies a dermatome and a myotome. Only the anterior ramus of T1 forms the lower trunk of the brachial plexus; the remaining intercostals do not form a plexus.
