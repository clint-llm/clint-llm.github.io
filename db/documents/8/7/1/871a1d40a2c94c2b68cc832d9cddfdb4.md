- Monitor complete blood count (CBC), serum creatinine, and PT/aPTT. In patients undergoing PCI, measure activated clotting time (ACT).

- Attach cardiac monitoring to detect dynamic EKG changes.

- Monitor for reperfusion arrhythmias during and after the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

- Check arterial line insertion site for evidence of bleeding manifestations.

- Troponin I rises after 4 hours (peaks at 24 hr) and is elevated for 7–10 days, more specific than other protein markers.

- CBC: look for thrombocytopenia and anemia due to bleeding. It is strongly recommended to measure platelet count within 2 to 6 hours of administering eptifibatide to detect thrombocytopenia.

- Serum creatinine: Since eptifibatide gets cleared renally, it is essential to monitor renal function tests.

- PT/aPTT: to monitor the risk of bleeding

- ACT: eptifibatide has an additive effect on activated clotting time (ACT) when used together with heparin. Therefore, aPTT and ACT require close monitoring when administering these agents concurrently.
