The diagnosis depends on clinical examination. However, microbiological swabs need to be taken to identify causative organisms and sensitivities.

If there is suspicion of deep-seated infection, ultrasound or CT/MRI imaging might be of benefit.

For preoperative risk assessment for SSI, various tools can predict the likelihood of developing an infection based on the risk factors. There are traditional systems such as the national nosocomial infection surveillance system, the Australian Clinical Risk Index, and the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation, which are all internationally recognized. However, their value is somewhat limited because many risk factors are missing from their calculations. Some have weak discriminatory abilities or do not risk-stratify for specific surgeries. Due to the need for individualized treatment, more specialty and even operation-specific scoring systems are emerging, such as the Infection Risk Index in cardiac surgeryÂ or Surgical Site Infection Risk Score.
