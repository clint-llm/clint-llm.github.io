The incubation period of glanders is usually 1 to 21 days but can be months or years. In humans, the first symptom of glanders is usually fever, followed by pneumonia, pustules, and abscesses. The acute form of the disease usually is fatal within 7 to 10 days of onset. Chronic glanders does occur, which can cause death within months; survivors remain carriers of disease. The incubation period of melioidosis also can be highly variable; it may range from as little as 2 days to as long as several years. Symptoms of acute melioidosis include fever, cough, pleurisy, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, anorexia, and night sweats. Melioidosis may present in many ways, ranging from acute or chronic localized infections to sepsis. Abscesses of the liver, spleen, prostate, and parotid glands have been documented. Intra-abdominal infections may be present without focal abdominal pain. These abscesses often appear loculated on CT scans and have been described as having a “honeycomb” appearance. Chronic melioidosis is defined as a duration of symptoms longer than 2 months and occurs in 10% of patients.
