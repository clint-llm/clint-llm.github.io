The crystalline lens is almost spherical at birth, with an anteroposterior thickness of 3.5 mm and an equatorial diameter of 6.5 mm. This increases to 5mm thickness and about 9Â to 10 mm equatorial dimensions by adulthood. In the presence of weak zonules, there is a lack of tension at the equatorial plane, resulting in a more spherical and convex lens. This shape of the lens leads to high lenticular myopia and often subluxation because of weak zonules.

The two primary pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in microspherophakia are as follows:

- During the fifth to sixth decade of embryonic life, there can be a developmental delay or defective insertion of secondary lenticular fibers. This usually results from malnourishment and defects in tunica vasculosa lentis.

- Due to abnormal development of lenticular fibers, the zonules may become rudimentary, and the lens may remain spherical rather than normal biconvex shape.
