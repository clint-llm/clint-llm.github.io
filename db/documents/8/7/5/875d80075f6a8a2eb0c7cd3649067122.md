The construction of underground passages is becoming significantly more common.   Roadways, water siphons, subways, and electrical lines are only a few of the reasons this industry has become so popular.  As we run out of usable space on the surface of the earth, underground passages will become even more important to our environment.  The modern tunnel boring machine (TBM) has eliminated the need to excavate by hand but has not eliminated the need for CAWs to perform their duties while under the extremes of atmospheric pressure.  These workers are still required to enter the face of the TBM to perform inspections, repair tools (rippers and cutters) and all the machinery responsible for the excavation process.
