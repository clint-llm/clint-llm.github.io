Pancreatic abscesses contain cellular debris, enzymes, and liquid and can be from an infectious or non-infectious source. They are usually serious complications in patients with pancreatitis who develop pancreatic pseudocyst. To avoid mortality in these patients, a high index of suspicion should be present in patients with pancreatitis who fail to improve with conservative management. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of pancreatic abscess as well as highlights the importance of an interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pancreatic abscess.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of pancreatic abscess.
- Outline the management options available for pancreatic abscess.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of pancreatic abscesses and improve outcomes.
