The etiology of pancytopenia can be broadly categorized as a central type that involves production disorders or a peripheral type that involves disorders of increased destruction.

**Decreased production (central type):**Pancytopenia due to decreased production is mainly secondary to nutritional deficiencies. Pancytopenia caused by bone marrow failure is known as aplastic anemia. Aplastic anemia could be idiopathic/autoimmune, secondary to infections (such as parvovirus B19, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus), after drug toxicity, or chemotherapeutic agents (methotrexate, dapsone, carbimazole, carbamazepine, chloramphenicol). Pancytopenia can also be related to inadequate intake (as seen in eating disorders and alcoholics) or malabsorption.

**Bone marrow infiltration/replacement:**The production of cell lines is also impaired when the bone marrow is infiltrated by malignancies (lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma) or granulomatous disorders. Metastatic tumors can also cause bone marrow replacement late in the disease, thus producing pancytopenia.

**Increased destruction (peripheral type):**Peripheral destruction of cells can be associated with many autoimmune conditions (such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis) and splenic sequestration (alcoholic liver cirrhosis, HIV, tuberculosis, malaria). Hypersplenism affects platelets and erythrocytes more than leukocytes.

With the current **Covid-19 pandemic**, pancytopenia has been reported secondary to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Despite extensive workup, a subset of patients has unexplained cytopenia, classified as idiopathic cytopenias of unknown significance.

The table below summarizes the causes of pancytopenia according to the mechanisms involved:

- Autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], rheumatoid arthritis [RA], sarcoidosis)

- Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)

- Aplastic anemia/paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria

- Drugs

- Cytotoxic drugs
- Idiosyncratic reactions to medications

- Large granular lymphocyte leukemia

- Nutritional abnormalities (B12 and folate deficiencies, excessive alcohol, malnutrition)

- Viral infections



- Non-malignant

- Myelofibrosis
- Infectious (e.g., fungal, tuberculous)
- Storage diseases

- Malignant

- Acute leukemias
- Chronic leukemias/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN)
- Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)
- Multiple myeloma
- Metastatic cancer

- Consumption

- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (e.g., associated with sepsis, acute promyelocytic leukemia)

- Splenomegaly

- Portal hypertension/cirrhosis
- Infections (e.g., EBV)
- Autoimmune disorders (e.g., SLE, RA/Felty syndrome)
- Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia
- Storage diseases (e.g., Gaucher)
- Malignancies (e.g., lymphomas, MPN)
