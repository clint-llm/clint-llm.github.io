Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is more commonly seen in the pediatric age group rather than adults, and this anatomical pathology is seen more frequently in boys than in girls, with up to twice the number of cases in males compared to females. The left side is as well affected twice as often as the right side. It is the most common cause for antenatally detected hydronephrosis at around 80% of all causes.

UPJO has an estimated incidence of 1 in 1000 to 1500.

Although it is more common in pediatrics, that does not make it rare to be seen in adults.
