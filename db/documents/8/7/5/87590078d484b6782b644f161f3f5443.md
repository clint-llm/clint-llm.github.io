Scleroderma is a chronic, autoimmune connective tissue disorder that is primarily characterized by thickening and hardening of the skin and other tissue. In localized scleroderma, the skin is the main organ system involved and muscles and bones may or may not be. In systemic scleroderma, internal organs such as the digestive tract, heart, lungs, and kidneys may be affected. The severity of this condition varies. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of scleroderma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiologic basis of scleroderma.
- Contrast the presentation of localized versus systemic scleroderma. 
- Contrast the management strategies for localized versus systemic scleroderma. 
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to relieve symptoms and slow progression of disease in patients with scleroderma.
