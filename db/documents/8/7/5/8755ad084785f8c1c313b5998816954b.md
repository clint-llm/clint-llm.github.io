The most critical factor in the diagnosis of chronic bronchitis is a typical history to exclude other possible diseases of the lower respiratory tract.

The investigations which assist in confirming the diagnosis of chronic bronchitis are a complete blood count with differential. A serum procalcitonin level can help in distinguishing associated bacterial from non-bacterial infections. A chest x-ray in the elderly and when physical findings suggest pneumonia is important. A culture of the sputum when a bacterial infection is suspected is indicated. The additional investigations are a helpful measurement of oxygen saturation and pulmonary function test.
