Odontoid fractures occur as a result of trauma to the cervical spine. In younger patients, they are typically the result of high-energy trauma, which occurs as a result of a motor vehicle or diving accident. In the elderly population, the trauma can occur after lower energy impacts such as falls from a standing position. The most common mechanism of injury is a hyperextension of the cervical spine, pushing the head and C1 vertebrae backward. If the energy mechanism and resulting force are high enough (or the patient's bone density is compromised secondary to osteopenia/osteoporosis), the odontoid will fracture with varying displacement and degrees of comminution.

The odontoid fracture can also occur with hyperflexion of the cervical spine. The transverse ligament runs dorsal to (behind) the odontoid process and attaches to the lateral mass of C1 on either side. If the cervical spine is excessively flexed, then the transverse ligament can transmit the excessive anterior forces to the odontoid process and cause an odontoid fracture.
