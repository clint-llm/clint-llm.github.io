Physiotherapy can be necessary for as long as two to three months following an initial dislocation. Physiotherapy is vital, as if the medial retinaculum does not heal and the VMO does not adequately rehabilitate, recurrent dislocation will ensue. Studies suggest there is a 20 to 40% risk of re-dislocation, with even higher rates following a second dislocation.

It is common for patients to remain symptomatic after the first dislocation. Atkin et al. found that at 6 months, 58% of patients experience limitation in strenuous activities.

Patients with anatomic abnormalities as the main reason for their dislocation may also sustain a dislocation to the contralateral patella requiring treatment.Â Stability, however, tends to increase with advancing age of the patient.
