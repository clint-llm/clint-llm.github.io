Posner Schlossman syndrome, also known as glaucomatocyclitic crisis, is an infrequently encountered cause of inflammatory ocular hypertension. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of uniocular rise in intraocular pressure, out of proportion with minimal intraocular inflammation. Cytomegalovirus infection of the anterior chamber may be associated with this disease. Once thought to be benign, it is now known to be associated with significant ocular morbidity and loss of vision. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of Posner Schlossman syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of Posner Schlossman syndrome.
- Outline the pathophysiology/histopathology of Posner Schlossman syndrome.
- Explain the common physical exam and investigation findings associated with Posner Schlossman syndrome.
- Review the interprofessional management and care of patients with Posner Schlossman syndrome.
