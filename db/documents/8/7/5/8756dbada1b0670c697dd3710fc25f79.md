There are no absolute contraindications to FDG PET/CT. Allergic reactions to FDG are extremely rare. Most PET scans are performed with a low dose without contrast CT. However, if the CT is done with iodine contrast, appropriate precautions should be taken in patients with iodine allergies.

If PET/CT scan is indicated for a pregnant patient, a risk versus benefit analysis should be done.

PET/CT examination should be rescheduled if the patient did not follow the preparation instructions.
