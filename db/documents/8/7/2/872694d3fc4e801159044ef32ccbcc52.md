Though relatively benign for immediate adverse reactions, anesthetic gases have beenÂ observed in specific individuals to cause malignant hyperthermia. Classically, halothane was the most common agent causing this reaction; however, all volatile gases (halothane, isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane) and depolarizing neuromuscular blockers (succinylcholine) have induced this reaction.

There has been a suggestion that these agents are involved with postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). There is only a confirmed correlation between the administration of general anesthesia, both IV and inhalation agents, and PONV incidence.
