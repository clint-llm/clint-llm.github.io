During ongoing biofeedback therapy, primary monitoring is for fatigue, which can be exacerbated by ongoing treatment. Depending on the modality, nurses check for discomfort that some patients may experience, such as in some forms of fecal incontinence where probes and balloons are inserted into the rectum to stimulate defecation. Nurses also observe for complications such as reactions to sensor tape.
