The etiology of systemic sclerosis and the exact contributing genetic susceptibility is not fully understood. However, several factors are thought to play a role, and environmental exposure in genetically susceptible individuals is thought to be plausible. Some studies showed that the risk of systemic sclerosis is increased in first-degree relatives; on the other hand, in a twin study, the concordance for systemic sclerosis was found to be relatively low.

Some of these non-MHC loci have also been implicated in other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, suggesting that immune dysregulation is a very important factor in systemic sclerosis development.

Infectious agents, specifically viruses, have been studied and thought to be a factor in SSc development. These include cytomegalovirus (CMV), parvovirus B19, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Several findings and theories have been studied in this regard. These include possible molecular mimicry as some of these viruses contain antigens that were found to share immunogenicity with endothelial peptides. Profibrotic molecules were found to be stimulated by CMV in certain tissues. Also, CMV has been implicated in the allograft vasculopathy, inducing similar vascular pathologic changes as SSc.

Certain drugs have been implicated in SSc such as bleomycin, taxol, pentazocine, and cocaine.
