Although stoma formation is a life-saving surgery in managing many gastrointestinal diseases, many patients suffer complications related to the intestinal stoma. Stoma complications can be classified as early or late. Early complications, such as cutaneous irritation or hematoma, are generally treated conservatively. However, late complications such as stoma prolapse and the parastomal hernia can be managed conservatively or surgically. 10% to 70% of patients may develop stoma complications, and their quality of life and their sense of well-being can significantly be affected. The most commonly occurring complications of intestinal stoma include the following:

- Ostomy prolapse

- Ostomy stenosis

- Parastomal hernia

- Cutaneous irritation

- Ostomy retraction

- Obstruction/Ileus

- Ostomy ischemia/necrosis

- Fluid and electrolyte imbalance

- Hemorrhage/Hematoma

- Fistula
