In the United States, around fifteen percent of inpatient patients report penicillin allergy, of which approximately one percent have a severe penicillin allergy.

Having to substitute another class of drugs rather than beta-lactams can cause a tendency to use broad classes of antimicrobials to be used to treat the patient's infection. The consequences of using inappropriate allergy labels include increase broad-spectrum antibiotics use, limited therapeutic options, increased toxicity, and increased hospital costs. Charneski et al.'s study on 11,872 inpatients revealed that 11.2% of inpatients had allergy labeled with antimicrobial and had increased hospital length of stay, greater antimicrobial use, higher intensive care admission rate, higher readmission rate, and higher mortality.

Adequate history and physical exam, skin testing, and challenge dosing are few ways to assess the allergy. Nurses can be vital in assessing drug allergies. Pharmacists can also play a pivotal role while updating EMR about patient's medication lists and drug interactions.
