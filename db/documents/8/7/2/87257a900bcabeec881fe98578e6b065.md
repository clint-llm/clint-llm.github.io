Scapholunate advanced collapse requires strong interprofessional communication between the patient, the doctor, and the hand therapists involve in care. The operations needed to treat this process are typically complex procedures that will require hand therapy post-operatively. Managing patient expectations is also critical. Four-corner arthrodesis is a complex procedure that can have long-term implications on a patient's occupational functionality. An informed decision with knowledge of outcomes should be discussed with the patient to establish whether surgery is advisable, especially in those with significant comorbidities. Alternative treatments should also be discussed. A preassessment that includes blood tests, an electrocardiogram, and further imaging to guide surgical course can be obtained. An anesthetic review by an anesthesiologist or certified nurse anesthetist should also be performed in patients with comorbidities, as well as guiding pain relief as appropriate. A physical therapy assessment during the course of recovery is also an important step in the immediate and long-term post-operative course. Follow-up clinic visits also play a role in expediting the correction of postoperative complications.
