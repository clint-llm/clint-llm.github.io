Due to streptokinaseâ€™s thrombolytic mechanisms of action, patients need monitoring for bleeding. The patient's thrombin time, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, complete blood count, and any signs of bleeding demand careful surveillance. Patients also need monitoring for signs and symptoms of reinfarction or vessel occlusion. Re ports of nonfatal instances of reinfarction are between 2.8% and 6%. Patients should also receive monitoring for signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction, including fever, shivering, rash, or in rare cases, anaphylaxis. Patients who have recently had exposure to beta-hemolytic streptococci may be resistant to streptokinase therapy because it is a derivative of streptococci polypeptides.
