Contraindications to flutamide use include patients with a hypersensitivity to flutamide or those with severe hepatic disease.

It is advised not to concomitantly use flutamide alongside drugs such as idelalisib and ivacaftor, as this will result in serious adverse effects. Idelalisib strongly inhibits the enzyme CYP3A4 in the liver and intestines resulting in increasing the level of flutamide in the body. A metabolite of Ivacaftor, M1, has the same effect potentially if taken with flutamide. Other drugs with similar effects on the CYP3A4 enzyme but with less serious complications are crofelemer, dabrafenib, elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, tenofovir, iloperidone, letermovir, and mitotane. These drugs do not necessarily require alternatives, but patients should be monitored closely for adverse effects. Other drugs that come with precautions are teriflunomide, which inhibits CYP1A2 leading to increased levels of flutamide in the serum, and warfarin. Flutamide increases the effects of warfarin, resulting in increased prothrombin time in patients taking both. Other substances to be mindful of when treating a patient with flutamide are maitake and taurine. Maitake is a mushroom with possible antitumor effects, as shown in animal and in-vitro trials. Maitake can increase serum levels of flutamide. Taurine is an organic compound that found its way into popular energy drinks. Flutamide also interacts with taurine, but it is unknown the significance of this interaction.
