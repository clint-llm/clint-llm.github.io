A coordinated interprofessional team approach is essential for ensuring optimum outcomes with toric IOL implantation. The optometrist evaluates the best-corrected spectacle refraction and performs corneal topography and optical biometry required for IOL power and axis calculation.

They upload the patient's values in online toric IOL calculators and generate patient reports pre-operatively which helps in deciding the axis of implantation and the planning of incisions. The operating theatre personnel ensures the appropriate IOL and other instruments required for the pre-operative marking and performing phacoemulsification. An ophthalmologist/ optometrist or trained personnel can perform the pre-operative axis marking on the patient.

A trained ophthalmologist performs the surgery under peribulbar/sub-tenon/ topical anesthesia. An anesthetist may be required to monitor the patient intraoperatively in patients with systemic ailments and in anxious or uncooperative patients to provide intravenous sedation.

The postoperative care of the patient is taken care of by the ward nurses who counsel the patient regarding the dosage and the procedure of administration of topical medications and other postoperative instructions. The optometrist and ophthalmologist can do the postoperative follow-up of patients at routine intervals.
