Food intake and energy balance are an integral part of the life of every organism, including human beings. Obesity is an emerging epidemic in the modern world. The worldwide obesity burden has increased 27.5 % for adults in the last three decades.

According to the CDC data, the prevalence of obesity in the United States was as high as 42.4% from 2017 to 2018. It is imperative to understand the weight and appetite regulation mechanism to understand the pathogenesis of obesity and potential targets for current and future therapies in weight management. The human body has its homeostatic control of weight by balancing food intake and energy expenditure. It tries to keep weight at a set point. It is the imbalance in this homeostatic regulation that leads to obesity. Current research has identified the central and peripheral regulatory mechanisms of weight and appetite by identifying neuronal pathways and hormones secreted by the gut and adipocytes. These systems work synergistically with their short and long-term regulatory effects.
