**Punch Biopsy and Histopathological Examination of Skin Tissue**

The most specific test is the examination of grains or granules from discharge both visually and microscopically. This can be performed on spontaneous drainage or manually expressed material from the sinus. A punch biopsy is not necessary in many cases. However, if drainage material cannot be expressed or examined, a deep punch biopsy can be diagnostic. Grains of microcolonies are found in subcutaneous tissue. Therefore a deep punch or excisional biopsy is needed to get access to the morphological structures of eumycetoma.Â H&E staining of the tissue sections, fungal staining techniques like PAS show details of fungal grains.

**Imaging and Additional Diagnostic Modalities**

Appropriate treatment of eumycetoma starts with precise identification of causative agent and the extent of disease. To determine disease burden, imaging including X-ray, ultrasonography, CT, and MRI may be required.
