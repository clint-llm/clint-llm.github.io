Chronic pain is one of the most prevalent health problems and poses a considerable burden on the economy and society. Amid the current opioid crisis, there is a need for the exploration of alternative pain therapies. Peripheral nerve stimulation offers a relatively safe option for the management of such painful pain conditions. The use of peripheral nerve stimulation can provide regional anesthesia without exposing the patient to the systemic side effects of opioid medications. Since these procedures are minimally invasive, they offer an alternative for patients who are not candidates for major joint replacement surgeries secondary to contraindication to general anesthesia.
