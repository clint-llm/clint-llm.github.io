When this disorder was first identified, affected children were certain to die, but now CGD can be managed and has a high survival rate. Management of CGD is based on 3 principles: 1) lifelong antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis, 2) early diagnosis of infection, and 3) aggressive management of infectious complications. Globally, therapy involves trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and itraconazole. Some countries also add interferon-gamma therapy. However, this therapy is not accepted universally. This combination of treatments can reduce severe infections from one per patient per year to almost one per patient per ten years. Live bacterial vaccines are best avoided.

Treatment of acute infections should start early and include determining the exact complicating infectious agent and selection of antibiotics or anti-fungal therapies. Early and aggressive therapy is essential in preventing the spread of infection. Additional diagnostic procedures should be used to identify the microorganism for infections that fail to respond to therapy within 24 to 48 hours. For fungal infections, antifungal therapy should be started before a diagnosis is confirmed. Surgical removal of refractory fungal infections may be necessaryÂ as well. Oral glucocorticoids are commonly prescribed for inflammatory manifestations of CGD. The use of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors in patients with CGD can be associated with high-risk infections and is not generally recommended.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only established curative treatment for CGD. Making a rapid diagnosis is important to identify if HCT is possible. In patients who have undergone HCT, the success rate is highest in young and disease-free individuals. Ultimately, the decision to undergo HCT depends on the prognosis, donor availability, access to transplantation, and patient preference.

Patients without an HLA-compatible donor for HCT may be candidates for gene therapy. Gene therapy may also be suited for CGD patients since the disease often results from single genetic defects. This process includes the transfer of autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) by retroviral vectors and semi-random integration into the genome. Retroviral vectors provide normal genes to reconstruct the NADPH oxidase activity in deficient cells. Until now, gene therapy's success has been limited. Some patients have experienced severe complications, including death, due to abnormal clonal hematopoiesis caused by vector integration. As gene repair technology becomes more advanced, DNA editing using short palindromic repeat/CRISPR associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) may be used to repair defective genes in X-linked recessive CGD cases. This method of gene therapy has been shown to restore NADPH oxidase in vitro.
