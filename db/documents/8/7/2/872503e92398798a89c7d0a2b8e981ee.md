The term “la belle indifference” is a French term that translates to “beautiful ignorance.”

According to the DSM 5, the mere presence of la belle indifference does not confirm the diagnosis of CD. However, la belle indifference is most commonly seen in patients with CD, so this article will focus primarily on its association with CD. For a full review of CD, please refer to the conversion disorder article by StatPearls.

In the DSM 5, CD is classified under somatic symptom and related disorders (SSD). Other diagnosis included under SSD includes somatic symptom disorder, psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, illness anxiety disorder, and factitious disorder. The most common presentation of FNSD/CD includes weakness or paralysis of one side of the body or bilaterally, abnormal movements (including tremors, myoclonus, dystonic movements, etc.), seizures (psychogenic neuroleptic seizures), swallowing problems (globus), speech problems (dysphonia or aphonia), sensory loss (vision or olfactory issues) and syncopal episodes.
