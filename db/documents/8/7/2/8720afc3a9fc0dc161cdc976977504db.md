Epidermoid tumors are congenital lesions that arise from ectodermal cells misplaced during the closure of the neural tube in the process of embryogenesis. They start to form during the very early stages of the development of the embryo during the closure of the neural tube where epithelial cells are trapped. They have a benign nature and slow growth rate. Epidermoids consist only of ectodermal germ cells, while dermoids contain both ectodermal and mesodermal germ cells. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with epidermoid tumors and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of epidermoid tumors.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of patients with epidermoid tumors.
- Outline management options available for epidermoid tumors.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in patients with epidermoid tumors and improve their outcomes.
