A cutdown is contraindicated when there is trauma to the targeted site or in patients with a massive pelvic injury with suspected avulsion of the iliac veins. Cutdown should not be performed when there is an active infection over the site of interest, when coagulopathies are present, or when less-invasive methods of venous access are possible. In the event of bilateral lower extremity trauma compromising the integrity of the GSV, the basilic vein in the upper extremity may beÂ an alternative access site.
