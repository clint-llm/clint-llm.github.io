The virus is transmitted when the mosquito feeds, passing infected saliva into the host. Â The early phase following transmission includes viral replication in dermal dendritic cells and keratinocytes. This phase is followed by the visceral-organ dissemination phase, which includes viral replication in draining lymph nodes, viremia, and spread to the visceral organs. The third and final phase spreads to the central nervous system (CNS).

The mechanism for viral CNS entry is unclear but may include a direct crossing of the blood-brain barrier, passive transport through the endothelium, infected macrophages crossing the blood-brain barrier or direct axonal retrograde transport. Once in the CNS the virus primarily induces inflammation and a subsequent loss of neurons within the spinal cord and brainstem gray matter.
