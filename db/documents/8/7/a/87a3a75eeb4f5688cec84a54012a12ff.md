The Jodhpur technique has been successfully used in two major indications [at present]:

**(1) Stable Vitiligo**- In one published study conducted in 154 patients, 437 vitiligo patches were treated with the Jodhpur technique followed by PUVA therapy. Researchers observed more than 75% re-pigmentation in 41% of the patches.

**(2)****CNHUs**- Recently, researchers attempted repurposing of the Jodhpur technique for chronic non-healing ulcers involving the leg, refractory to multiple ulcer-treatment modalities. Seventeen patients with lower limb CNHU of varied etiology were enrolled. Of these, 7 (41.2%) were of diabetic origin, 4 (23.5%) were secondary to chronic venous stasis (in patients who were either poor candidates for vascular surgery or had failed one), 4 (23.5%) were trophic ulcers secondary to leprosy, and 2 (11.8%) were of vasculitic origin. All (100%) ulcers showed complete healing within 5 to 6 weeks with no complications [**data and study under publication**].
