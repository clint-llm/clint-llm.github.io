The oral cavity is surrounded by the lips and is composed of two separate regions, the vestibule, the area between the cheeks, teeth, and lips, and the oral cavity proper. The oral cavity proper is mostly filled with the tongue and bounded anteriorly and on the sides by the alveolar processes containing the teeth and posteriorly by the isthmus of the fauces. Anteriorly, the roof forms by the hard palate and posteriorly by the soft palate. The uvula hangs downwards from the soft palate. The mylohyoid muscles constitute the floor of the oral cavity proper. A mucous membrane known as the oral mucosa is composed of stratified squamous epithelium and forms the inner lining of the mouth. Several submandibular and sublingual salivary glands secrete viscous and mucoid fluid to lubricate and keep the oral cavity moist.

The mouth not only plays a vital role in the initial intake and digestion of food and water but also is essential for the formation of speech and normal respiration. The teeth, which are the chief structures of the oral cavity, tear and grind ingested food into pieces small enough for digestion. The tongue enables the digestion of food through compressing and pressing food against the palates; this leads to theÂ formation of the food bolus subsequently swallowed down the esophagus.
