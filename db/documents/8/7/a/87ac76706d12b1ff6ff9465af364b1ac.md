Consultation with an infectious disease specialist or practitioner experienced in caring for HIV-infected patients is recommended for management of HAART regimen. Psychiatric consultation may also be indicated as HIV-infected patients with HAD commonly have comorbidities including generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder and agitation and may present with psychosis. A neurologic evaluation may be necessary to fully complete workup for alternative causes of cognitive deficits.
