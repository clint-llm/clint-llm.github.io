Thought to originate from the granule cell precursors in the external germinal layer (EGL) of the developing cerebellum, tumor growth starts in the fourth ventricle and can grow to occupy it completely. After that, the tumor spreads to the cerebellar vermis and the brainstem, seeding the craniospinal axis. Medulloblastoma is a highly malignant tumor with a propensity for local invasion and distant metastatic spread through the subarachnoid system (i.e., within the brain and along the spinal cord, also known as "drop mets").

Extraneural metastases in pediatric medulloblastomas are an infrequent occurrence (approximately 7%). The most frequent sites of extraneural metastasis in children include bone (78%), lymph nodes (33%), liver (15%), and lungs (11%). The average time to develop after maximal surgical resection is approximately 20 months. Survival in these cases is dismal and in most cases, can be less than six months.

Notably, the most common cytogenetic mutation encountered in medulloblastoma is isochromosome 17q, resulting from the loss of the short arm (p) with a resultant gain of genetic material from the long arm (q). Also, deletions in the short arm have also been frequently reported, leading to loss of heterozygosity of 17p, (i.e., 17pLOH).
