Long-term management of ACS includes hydroxyurea, PRBC transfusions, and hematopoietic cell transplants. Hydroxyurea decreases the frequency of ACS by 50% in adults and 30% in kids. Hydroxyurea increases the concentration of HbF and is the only medication shown to decrease the incidence of ACS. Chronic transfusions can be used during the transition to hydroxyurea, in high-risk periods (winter), if hydroxyurea is inadequate, or if the patient is recovering from a life-threatening ACS. Risks of chronic transfusions include infection, iron overload, and allosensitization. Hematopoietic cell transplant has > 80% success and is indicated when the patient has had multiple episodes of ACS. This requires an HLA-matched sibling donor and carries all the risks associated with myeloablative regimens.

Long-term complications of repeated ACS include interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension, however, the causation of this association is not well proven.
