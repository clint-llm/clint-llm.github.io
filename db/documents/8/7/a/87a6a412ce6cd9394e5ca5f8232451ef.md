Due to the potential for serious maternal and neonatal morbidity, uterine rupture must be excluded in all cases of vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. The classic symptoms described for uterine rupture include acute onset abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, a non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing, and a change in the contraction pattern on tocodynamometry.

The most important initial laboratory test is hemoglobin or hematocrit. If significant bleeding has occurred, coagulation tests (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, thromboelastogram) should be considered. If significant bleeding has not yet occurred, baseline hemoglobin or hematocrit can be used to monitor for ongoing blood loss.

In a stable patient with a possible minor rupture, an ultrasound can be helpful to rule out other etiologies for vaginal bleeding, such as placenta previa, placental abruption, or spontaneous abortion. The following findings on abdominal ultrasound support the diagnosis of uterine rupture: an abnormality in the uterine wall, a hematoma next to a hysterotomy scar, free fluid in the peritoneum, anhydramnios, or fetal parts outside the uterus.

Ultimately, the diagnosis of uterine rupture is often confirmed when hemoperitoneum and fetal parts are identified during laparotomy.
