In the early inflammatory stage, biopsy specimens of active lesions show perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with plasma cells in the dermis, telangiectatic endothelial-lined spaces, and mild atrophy of the epidermis. Histological examination of late lesions demonstrates an atrophic epidermis, and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate with plasma cells and occasional histiocytes or mast cells.
