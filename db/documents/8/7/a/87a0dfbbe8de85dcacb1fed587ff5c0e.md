A comprehensive history, along with adequate physical examination, is important to establish the diagnosis. History of the location of pain, onset, characteristics, and duration, along with associated symptoms like fatigue, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, could be helpful to establish a diagnosis.

For primary dysmenorrhea, the physical examination is usually normal.Â A pelvic examination is not necessary for adolescents and women with characteristics of primary dysmenorrhea/ Pelvic examination is indicated in adolescents and women who have previously been sexually active and when the secondary cause is suspected or if there is a lack of response to treatment. The common findings that indicate secondary dysmenorrhea are:

- Young age (around menarche) primary dysmenorrhea vs. older age > 25 years old (secondary dysmenorrhea)

- Fluid in the vaginal vault of foul odor or whitish grayish in color. (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease)

- Associated dysuria, dyspareunia, dyschezia, infertility, nodularity, adnexal masses, tenderness (endometriosis, non-gynecological etiology)

- Abnormal bleeding with the enlarged symmetrical uterus (Adenomyosis)

- Abnormal bleeding with the enlarged asymmetrical uterus (Fibroids)

- Obstructive anatomical abnormalities and history of other congenital anomalies

- Pelvic masses (fibroids, neoplasms, ovarian cysts)
