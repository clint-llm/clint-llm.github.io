HTLV-1 is a common virus that is almost always asymptomatic during acute infection but is known to result in significant morbidity and mortality in up to 5% of affected individuals through conditions including ATLL and HAM/TSP. Clinical conditions usually develop years or decades after initial infection, and this often results in a delay of diagnosis, implication of HTLV-1 associated disease, and, therefore, appropriate management. ATLL and HAM/TSP are associated with significant morbidity, yet there remains uncertainty regarding the prediction of disease development, progression, and optimal management.
