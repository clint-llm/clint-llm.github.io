Pemphigus is a broad term used to describe a rare group of bullous autoimmune diseases that affect the skin and mucosal membranes. The hallmark presentation of pemphigus is the presence of widespread flaccid blisters and erosions erupting on the skin and oral mucosa. Drug-induced pemphigus is caused by a combination of biochemical interactions and aberrant stimulation of host B cells producing intracellular IgG antibodies. These autoantibodies attack the desmogleins, causing the cells within the epidermis to separate, a process called acantholysis. While there are several factors known to trigger the disease, drugs continue to be the leading cause of pemphigus. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of drug-induced pemphigus, including inciting agents and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the patient presentation of drug-induced pemphigus in a patient.
- Review the typical drug class offenders that most commonly contribute to drug-induced pemphigus.
- Discuss the treatment and management strategies to address drug-induced pemphigus.
- Describe the possible interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and treatment of drug-induced pemphigus and improve outcomes.
