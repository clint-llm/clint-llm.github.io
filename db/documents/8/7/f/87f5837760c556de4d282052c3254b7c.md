Histopathology shows perivascular T-cell lymphocytic infiltrate around superficial small blood vessels composed of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD1a+, CD36+, dendritic cells, cellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, ELAM-1), LFA-1; this infiltrate consequently will lead to endothelial cell swelling and narrowing of the lumen.

Extravasation of red blood cells with marked hemosiderin deposition in macrophage is present in the superficial dermis, which can be seen by an iron stain.
