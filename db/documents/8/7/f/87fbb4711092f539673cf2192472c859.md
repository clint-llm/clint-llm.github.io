Congenital Ectopia Lentis (EL) can result in aqueous flow obstruction. Various forms include the following:

- Marfan syndrome - Bilateral supero-temporal subluxation of the lens with occasional acute dislocation and PBG in early childhood

- Homocystinuria - Bilateral inferonasal lenticular subluxation with acute anterior chamber dislocation and PBG are common.

- Weill-Marchesani syndrome - Microspherophakia, ciliary body hypoplasia, PBG, and inverse glaucoma are associated.

- Others: Ehler-Danlos syndrome, sulfiteÂ oxidase deficiency, hyperlysinemia, aniridia, Alport syndrome, Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, and Peter anomaly type 3

Acquired includes the following:

- Trauma - Can cause anterior dislocation of lens and PBG. Traumatic rupture of the lens causes immediate LPIG or a delayed PAG.

- Post-surgery - Retained loose lenticular matter can precipitate an acute attack of LPIG or a chronic PAG.

- Intumescent cataract - Can cause PMG.

- HMSC - Micro-ruptures in the lens capsule cause PLG.
