Mutations in the CHD7 gene is the most common cause of CHARGE syndrome. In the rare case, it is autosomal dominant inheritance, which means it is transmitted from parent to child. Most cases arise from de novo mutations, which means that they are not inherited but occur sporadically. Therefore, abnormalities of the CHD7 gene, which usually occur de novo, can be found in over 90% of all children who meet the clinical diagnostic criteria.

The CHD7 gene controls the creation of a protein that regulates developmental pathways through chromatin organization. Mutations in the CHD7 gene lead to the making of an abnormally nonfunctional, short CHD7 protein, which interrupts the regulation of gene expression and disordered neural crest development. If these changes occur during the embryonic period, it leads to the development of the typically pleiotropic signs and symptoms of CHARGE syndrome.
