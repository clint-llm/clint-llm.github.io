Clonidine is a 40-year-old antihypertensive medication that acts as an agonist on alpha-adrenergic and imidazoline receptors. Clonidine is an antihypertensive drug that lowers blood pressure and heart rate by relaxing the arteries and increasing the blood supply to the heart; it has the following FDA-approved indications:

- Hypertension, as mentioned above; pediatric use for hypertension is off-label

- Treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children (FDA approval 2010 for the extended-release dose form)

- Management of tics commonly found with Tourette syndrome

- Adjunct therapy for severing cancer-related pain

- As an adjunct in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome

Clonidine has multiple off-label uses, such as managing withdrawal symptoms from opioids, benzodiazepines, and alcohol and treating anxiety, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Because of the effect of clonidine on the sympathetic nervous system, specifically, the reduction of circulating epinephrine, it has been used in many other aspects of medicine, for example, control of hot flashes in menopause, restless leg syndrome, and prophylaxis of vascular migraine headaches. Also, there is a test for phaeochromocytoma called the clonidine suppression test; in the lab, they measure the catecholamine levels before and after a dose of oral clonidine, which, in healthy people, should cause a decrease in the level of catecholamines in circulation.
