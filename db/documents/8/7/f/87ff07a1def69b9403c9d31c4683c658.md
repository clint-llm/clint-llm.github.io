Neurilemmomas and neurofibromas can often be managed non-operatively, with observation if asymptomatic or causing minimal symptoms. If there is a concern for malignancy or are symptoms causing distress, surgery is the mainstay of intervention. The goal of any surgical treatment is the removal of the tumor without neurological impairment. Removing neurilemmomas without damaging the nerve is easier than in the removal of a neurofibroma due to the fibrous capsule containing neurilemmomas.

Electrophysiologic monitoring is important during the removal of neurilemmomas. A longitudinal incision is marked over the tumor site, allowing for exposure of normal nerve proximal and distal to the tumor. Using vessel loops, the healthy nerve is wrapped proximal and distal to the tumor, and the nerve is carefully dissected away from the tumor capsule using Metzenbaum scissors. The tumor is generally removed as a solitary mass when possible.
