Treatment for ductal carcinoma in situ is multimodal and involves a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and hormone therapy that is personalized to the patient's specific diagnosis and preferences.

Surgical treatment options for DCIS broadly include breast-conserving surgery followed by radiation or a simple mastectomy. With either treatment option, it is important to emphasize that there is equivalent long-term survival.

DCIS, by definition, is noninvasive, and axillary lymph node involvement in DCIS is rare; thus, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is not indicated during breast-conserving surgery. Data from the NSABP B24 trials demonstrate that axillary recurrence rates irrespective of treatment (BCT vs. mastectomy) were 0.36 per 1000 patient-years of follow up.

Medical management of DCIS consists primarily of endocrine therapy in patients with ER-positive or PR-positive DCIS. It is well supported by the data that 5 years of endocrine therapy in the appropriate patient does reduce the risk of both ipsilateral and contralateral disease.
