In patients displaying signs of urosepsis, initial treatment should include fluid resuscitation and administration of broad-spectrum IV antibiotics.

Immediate catheterization of the patient is important in patients with suspected pyocystis. This has dual therapeutic and diagnostic benefits through drainage of infected tissue and acquiring pus for culture, respectively. Once sensitivities are obtained, the antibiotic choice can be tailored to reflect this.

Following catheterization, bladder irrigation should be used to prevent the re-accumulation of infected debris and to assist in clearing the initial collection. This can be continuous irrigation using a three-way catheter or can be done using frequent bladder washouts. Irrigation should be continued in the community for up to 3 months, several times a week, to attempt to eradicate any infection.

The previous positive urine culture of Proteus mirabilis is a significant risk factor for the development of pyocystis following urinary diversion procedures.Proteus mirabilis should be considered for a cystectomy.

Cystectomy may be necessary for patients not responding to IV antibiotics and irrigation. The need for cystectomy in patients with pyocytis is reportedly up to 25%.
