The lacrimal duct system transmits tears from the surface of the eye to the nasal cavity. Tears enter the duct system at the lacrimal punctae and conduct through canaliculi within the eyelids. The canaliculi drain into the lacrimal sac. Tears continue down the intra-osseous lacrimal duct where they exit into the nasal cavity at the inferior meatus. Obstruction of the lacrimal duct system results in epiphora or excessive tearing. This condition is particularly common in children but is also common in adults.
