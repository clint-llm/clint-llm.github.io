Sternal fractures are the result of motor vehicle collisions in 60% to 90% of cases. They typically result from the chest striking the steering wheel, with most injuries occurring in older vehicles with no airbag deployment. Fractures are slightly more prevalent in females than males. Sternal fractures are more common in older patients, which appears to be due to the more elastic chest wall of younger patients. Younger patients are more likely to incur intrathoracic injury because the energy of the impact is not as like to be absorbed by the sternum. Sternal fracture occurrence has tripled with the use of vehicular shoulder restraints, likely secondary to the deceleration forces concentrated directly to the sternum.
