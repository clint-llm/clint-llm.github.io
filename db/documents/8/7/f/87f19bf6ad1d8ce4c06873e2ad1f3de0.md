Cellular respiration converts ingested nutrients in the form of glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen to energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). CO2 is produced as a byproduct of this reaction.

- C6H12O6 + 6O2 --> 6CO2 + 6H2O

The O2 needed for cellular respiration is obtained via inhalation. The CO2 that is generated is removed from the body via exhalation.
