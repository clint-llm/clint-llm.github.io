The superficial peroneal nerve has both motor and sensory components. The motor component of the nerve innervates the lateral compartment of the lower leg which includes the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis muscles. Motor activation of these muscles by the superficial peroneal nerve is primarily responsible for eversion and mild plantar flexion of the foot.

The medial dorsal cutaneous nerve and intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerves are the terminal branches of the superficial peroneal nerve. These nerves handle the sensory component of the superficial peroneal nerve to the dorsum of the foot although it does not provide sensory innervation to the first webspace. Instead, the dorsal peroneal nerve provides sensory innervation to this area.
