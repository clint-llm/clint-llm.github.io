Oligodendroglioma (OG) is a type of diffusely infiltrating glioma and constitutes approximately 5% of primary intracranial tumors. They often involve the cortical gray matter and are most commonly seen in the frontal lobes. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of oligodendroglioma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of the central nervous system neoplasm oligodendroglioma.
- Review the presentation and diagnosis of oligodendroglioma.
- Describe the management options available for oligodendroglioma.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with oligodendroglioma.
