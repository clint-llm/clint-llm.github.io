Indications for cooling include any signs of heat-related illness in the presence of elevated body temperature. Previously, heat-related illness has been defined as core body temperature greater than 40 degrees C. However, any elevation above normal body temperature in a symptomatic patient is an indication to consider cooling. The objective is to rapidly decrease the temperature below 40 degrees C, with the final goal of reaching the normal range (36 degrees C to 38 degrees C). It is important to note the patient's other vital signs, as hemodynamic instability indicates severe heat stroke, in which case, rapid cooling is the most crucial intervention to stabilize the patient.
