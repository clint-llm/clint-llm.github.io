The barium swallow study, also known as a barium esophagogram or esophagram, is a contrast-enhanced radiographic study commonly used to assess structural characteristics, and to some extent the functional characteristics of the esophagus.

A barium swallow study may be used in the diagnosis of a wide range of pathologies including esophageal motility disorders, strictures, and perforations.

The barium esophagogram is noninvasive and readily performed, requiring only radiographic still-image capability and contrast medium. As such, it is a useful exam despite the current wide availability of CT imaging. The use of barium sulfate contrast is considered to result in a more sensitive study when compared to those utilizing water-soluble agents such as Gastrografin/diatrizoate. Barium provides better contrast images.
