The deterrents in prurigo nodularis treatment are the severe intensity of the itch which can lead to psychological distress, chronic nature of the condition, the long duration of the therapy and the potential side effects of the medication.

Discussion with the patient should include advantages and disadvantages of the therapy, side effects and possible use of off-label medications. Patient education can thus promote treatment adherence. The potential length of therapy should also be discussed as prurigo nodularis is difficult to treat and the patient may become frustrated with lack of improvement.
