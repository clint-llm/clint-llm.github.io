A national detection program should be implemented to help curb the disease burden in communities. These programs are responsible for sample processing and result feedback to treating healthcare professionals. Infection control is another integral part of improving the disease outcome. It requires coordination between public health, treating facilities, and the local community. Drug administration under directly observed therapy (DOT) requires feedback pathways between patients, observers, and treating healthcare professionals.Â In most countries, the patients are assigned a "Case Manager" usually by public health. Communication between the patient and treating professional helps the case manager solve treatment problems and help achieve treatment goals.

Effective patient education about tuberculosis infection, treatment objectives, medications, and their side effects, appropriate infection-control measures vastly improve chances of treatment success and prognosis. Healthy educators and pharmacists play crucial roles here and must be utilized where available.

All these different medical disciplines need to function as a cohesive, collaborative interprofessional healthcare team to improve patient outcomes.

Drug-resistant TB is a major problem now. Communication between clinical pharmacists and treating health professional help in selecting appropriate therapy and minimizes unnecessary drug exposure.
