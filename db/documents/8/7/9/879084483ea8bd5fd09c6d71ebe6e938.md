The palmaris longus is a small, fusiform-shaped muscle located on the anterior forearm of the human upper extremity. This muscle belongs to the superficial forearm flexor group, with a most common proximal attachment at the medial epicondyle of the humerus via the common forearm flexor tendon and a most common distal attachment into the connective tissue fibers of the palmar aponeurosis and the flexor retinaculum, a ligamentous structure forming the roof of the carpal tunnel and containing the median nerve and digital flexor tendons.

The functional contribution of the palmaris longus appears to be minimal, but it has clinical significance due to its frequent intraoperative harvest for many surgical procedures, often involving tendon repair in the upper extremity. The thin distal tendinous portion, superficial location, and lack of functional significance make the muscle easily accessible and ideal for intraoperative harvest for tendon reconstruction and other surgical procedures.
