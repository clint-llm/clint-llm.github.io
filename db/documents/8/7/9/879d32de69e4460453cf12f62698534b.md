Injury to the phrenic nerve or hemidiaphragm is a direct cause of elevated hemidiaphragm. Indirect causes of elevated hemidiaphragm include a traumatic injury, neurologic disease, or cancerous processes within the thoracic and abdominal cavity. The presenting symptoms of diaphragm disease can range from asymptomatic to severe respiratory distress. Diagnosing the cause of elevated hemidiaphragm is vital to its treatment and management. However, several conditions may present with similar symptoms and radiographic findings, which should be ruled out.

The differential diagnosis for elevated hemidiaphragm includes:

**Subpulmonic Effusion**- Fluid collected at the base of the lung and the line of demarcation may look similar to an elevated hemidiaphragm.

**Diaphragmatic Hernia**- Most commonly seen in newborns, a diaphragmatic hernia occurs when there is an incomplete closure of the diaphragm muscles, causing a pathological opening in the diaphragm. Morgagni hernia is usually in the anterior portion of the diaphragm, and radiograph examinations may resemble an elevated hemidiaphragm.

**Diaphragmatic Rupture**- Rupture of the diaphragm may occur secondary to traumatic injury.

**Diaphragm or Pleural Tumor**- The tumor may extend along the surface of the diaphragm or push on the diaphragm and resemble an elevated hemidiaphragm.
