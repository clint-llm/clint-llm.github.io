In PD, the examination of a patient with akinesia would reveal freezing mid-movement, festination of both gait and speech, and repetitive upper limb movements.

In akinetic patients secondary to PSP, the rigidity is mainly axial rather than appendicular. The earliest manifestation occurs with recurrent falls, due to profound rigidity, but atypical manifestations like non-specific dizziness, generalized motor slowing, and personality change, could also be present. Slowing of vertical saccades is the most common eye movement manifestation, along with difficulty in down-gazing.

Antenatally, a patient carrying a fetus with possible fetal akinesia can present with reduced fetal movement. Later in the pregnancy, the patient presents with polyhydramnios, evidenced by abnormally increased fundal height.

In a live birth with fetal akinesia syndrome, the following sequence is often observed as a result of a lack of fetal movement.

- Fetal joint contractures

- Pulmonary hypoplasia

- Polyhydramnios

- Micrognathia
