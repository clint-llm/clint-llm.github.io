The exact causes of morbidity and mortality in this patient population are still poorly understood. Without treatment, the natural course of the excited delirium syndrome potentially includes the development of rhabdomyolysis and subsequent acute renal failure, acute hepatotoxicity with transaminitis, and gross electrolyte derangement. Patients may further suffer myocardial infarction secondary to both demand ischemia in the setting of tachycardia and due to coronary vasospasm. Neurologic sequelae, including seizure and further autonomic dysfunction such as hyperthermia and progression to dysautonomia, may occur. Deaths reported in excited delirium syndrome often include lethal arrhythmias. An additional complication may come about due to the agitated/combative nature of the patient precluding full or timely evaluation and treatment.
