The treatment of invasive lobular carcinomas has been a topic of debate due to the potential bilaterality and multifocality that characterize these tumors. Determining the extent of invasive lobular carcinoma is very important in deciding the treatment modality. The multidisciplinary approach to the treatment includes surgery, hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

Mastectomy/lumpectomy is the treatment of choice of invasive lobular carcinomas in most large series, and prophylactic contralateral mastectomy is not infrequently performed. If adequate preoperative investigations exclude extensive multifocal and contralateral disease, conservative treatment is most appropriate for invasive lobular carcinomas. The wider negative margins are not necessary in cases of invasive lobular cancer.

Surgery and radiotherapy provide locoregional control.

Adjuvant hormone therapy is also indicated, given the high percentage of cases that are positive for ER and PR.

Chemotherapy is of limited benefit for patients with invasive lobular carcinoma, owing to the low proliferation rates observed in the vast majority of classic invasive lobular carcinoma.

The factors like age, lymph nodes status, tumor size, Ki-67 biomarker, hormonal status can be associated with both recurrence and survival, and histology alone cannot be considered the only predictor.
