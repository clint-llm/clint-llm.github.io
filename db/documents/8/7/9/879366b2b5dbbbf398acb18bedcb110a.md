Since test performance mainly reflects the integrated activity of the heart and lungs, information derived from the test will be relevant to assessing the degree of impairment associated with conditions affecting either or both of these organs. Therefore, pulmonologists and cardiologists will often be the clinicians requesting the 6MWT and using the data obtained. Other healthcare professionals that may use the 6MWT include primary care providers and anesthesiologists as part of preoperative risk assessments or in the general evaluation of patients with COPD.

Modified reference equations are available for use in offices with limited space.

Proper training of respiratory therapists, nurses, medical assistants, and other personnel conducting the test is an essential aspect of the procedure. Without their dedicated participation through its performance, the test may not be conducted reliably or safely. Accurate and timely notification to the ordering or supervising providers of test results or complications will improve patient outcomes and safety.
