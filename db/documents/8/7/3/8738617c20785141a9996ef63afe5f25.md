The management of this condition requires the collaboration of the entireÂ interprofessional team. The primary healthcare provider should be aware of this condition, especially if the patient presents with a progressive decline in renal function associated with bland urinary sediment. These patients should be referred to a nephrologist to manage renal insufficiency and prepare them for renal transplantation if mandatory. Nurses and pharmacists can also contribute with patient counseling about the condition, and in the case of pharmacists, regarding proper dosing and medication compliance. If it is confirmed that the patient carries the mutated gene, other family members should be screened for that mutation as their probability of being affected is high, and early screening could improve the prognosis and outcomes, so a genetics specialist may also need to be included in case management.

All interprofessional team members are responsible for documenting their observations and interventions in the patient's medical record, so all providers operate from the same data. If they notice any issues of concern, then open communication with appropriate team members is crucial to initiating proper therapeutic interventions so the patient will receive optimal care. This interprofessional model that includes clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other specialists will lead to the best patient outcomes. [Level 5]
