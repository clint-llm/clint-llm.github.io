Skin rash is one of the most common clinical presentations of drug-induced lupus.Â The pathological examination of the biopsy from the skin rash in patients with DIL is similar to those with SLE. The subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) rash is one of the common rashes which may reveal vacuolar interface dermatitis with lymphohistiocytic infiltration of the upper dermis in a perivascular pattern, epidermal atrophy, dead keratinocytes, and dermo-epidermal degeneration.
