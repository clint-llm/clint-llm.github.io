Entheses are boney insertion sites of tendons and ligaments. Enthesopathies are defined as the pathologies that affect the entheses.

Anatomically, the entheses are usually found outside the joint capsule with exceptions, including the sacroiliac, sternoclavicular, and distal interphalangeal joints.
