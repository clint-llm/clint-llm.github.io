Due to the wide variable presentation of HRM, several classification systems have been proposed to better differentiate the phenotypical presentation to help improve diagnosis, treatment, and prognostic data. The first classification proposed by Pruzansky in 1969 focused on the characteristics of the mandible and glenoid fossa. In 1987, David et al. proposed the SAT (skeletal malformations, auricular involvement, and soft tissue defects) system, which was further expanded by Vento et al. to become the OMENS (orbit, mandible, ear, nerve, soft tissue) classification.

- Pruzansky system. This system organizes mandibular hypoplasia into 3 groups based on radiological findings and was later modified by Kaban et al. to include the temporomandibular joint.

- SAT (skeletal malformations, auricular involvement, and soft tissue defects) system. This system is based on the alphanumeric TMN system for cancer staging.

- OMENS (orbit, mandible, ear, nerve, soft tissue) system. This system is the most inclusive and was later modified to OMENS plus to include extracranial structures. Each anatomic category is assigned a numerical score from 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe). OMENS grading is considered more flexible and sensitive to the wide, heterogeneous phenotypic presentation of HFM.
