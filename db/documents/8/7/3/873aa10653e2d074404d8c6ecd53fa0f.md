The management of patients with brain metastases is best done with an interprofessional team that includes a neurosurgeon, an oncologist, neurologist, radiation therapist, palliative care specialist, pain consultant, anesthetist. Most of these patients are frail and have a reduced life expectancy; hence the need for aggressive measures is not warranted. A team approach should discuss the best approach taking into account patient status, comorbidity, and life span. Many of these patients simply benefit from palliation and pain control.
