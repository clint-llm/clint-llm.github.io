Therapeutic communication has been widely studied and has been shown to have multiple benefits.

Most recently, therapeutic communication has been primarily adopted to structure communication in physician, nursing, mental health, and social work interactions.

Unfortunately, some studies have shown deficiencies in the training and implementation of empathetic or therapeutic communication.

As might be apparent, some of these identified barriers can be addressed at a systems level, and others at the level of patient-provider communication. One frequently expressed concern regarding therapeutic communication is that providers may not have enough time to address emotional concerns. This issue regarding lack of time has not been supported in the literature. Studies in physicians have demonstrated only a marginal change in the consultation time when an empathic response is given, and improved communication skills did not show an association with a longer duration of the consultation.

Other predictors of successful therapeutic communication include differences in language, education difference between patient and provider, patient’s education level, and perceived patient view scores.
