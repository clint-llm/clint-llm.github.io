A macular hole is mostly idiopathic or related to vitreomacular traction syndrome. The macular hole may be associated with various forms of macular pathology including:

- After laser treatment

- Intraocular surgical intervention

- Epiretinal membrane

- Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV)

- Hypertensive retinopathy (HTNR)

- Diabetic retinopathy (DR)

- Vitelliform dystrophy

- Ruptured retinal arterial macroaneurysm (RAM)

Other rare associations are

- Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO)

- Retinitis pigmentosa (RP)

- Alport syndrome

- Valsalva retinopathy

- Stargardt disease

- Syphilis

Apart from this, ocular pathology, which may predispose the eye to develop a macular hole, is myopia with or without posterior staphyloma.
