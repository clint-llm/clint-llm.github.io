Maintenance of a patent airway and adequate ventilation during upper respiratory tract surgery can be difficult due to the need to maintain an unobstructed view of structures in the surgical field. It is usually achieved by placing smaller specialized (laser-resistant) endotracheal tubes and jet ventilation devices or utilizing intermittent or spontaneous ventilation techniques. This process is also complicated by using medical lasers that can cause a fire in an oxidizer-rich (oxygen, nitrous oxide) environment. Numerous recommendations exist, and comprehensive guidelines were created to minimize the risks inherent to these types of surgeries. This activity reviews the methods of ensuring adequate ventilation in a patient undergoing laser airway surgery, mechanisms of associated adverse events, and methods to prevent them and highlights the interprofessional team's roles in caring for patients undergoing laser airway surgery.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors common for laser surgeries of the airway.
- Describe the technique of maintaining a safe airway during the upper respiratory tract laser surgery.
- Identify the most common complications associated with laser surgery of the airway.
- Summarize some of the protective measures the interprofessional team can participate in when performing laser surgery of the airway.
