The consequences of ocular trauma range from complete recovery to irreversible blindness and greatly depend on the mechanism and type of injury. Understanding ocular anatomy, types of ocular trauma, and the variety of inciting events and sequelae is essential to appropriately assess, triage, manage, and ultimately reduce morbidity, blindness, and recurrence. This article will discuss the types of ocular trauma, epidemiology and risk factors, national trends, and practice patterns, as well as prognosis and prevention with an emphasis on patient counseling. Additionally, this activity will highlight the importance of the interprofessional team in evaluating, managing, and reducing the risk of visually significant ocular injuries.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanisms of ocular trauma with their sequelae.
- Review the epidemiology of ocular trauma and resulting complications.
- Outline methods and guidelines to reduce the risk of severe ocular trauma and to appropriately triage traumatic injuries.
- Summarize recommendations and counseling strategies to reduce the risk of blindness in monocular and other high-risk patients.
