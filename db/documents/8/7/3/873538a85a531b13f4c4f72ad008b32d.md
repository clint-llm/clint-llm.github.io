In the event of a suspected overdose, the clinician should discontinue the drug or adjust the dose. DeterminingÂ if the symptoms result from an actual cefepime overdose or preexisting comorbidities may be difficult. If suspicion is high or symptoms do not subside after dose adjusting or discontinuing, blood and/or cerebral spinal fluid levels should be obtained to evaluate if the toxicity stems from elevated cefepime levels. Dialysis may be necessary in severe cases.
