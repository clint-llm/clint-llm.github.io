MCNs are well-encapsulated and usually large-ranging up to 25 cm. The origin is from the pancreatic ductal cell. MCNs can present as a spectrum from benign to borderline and, frankly, malignant lesions. They are usually slow-growing. MCNs lacking features of malignancy are considered to be premalignant.
