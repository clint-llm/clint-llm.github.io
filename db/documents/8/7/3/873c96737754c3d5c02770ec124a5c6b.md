Since diuresis and natriuresis occur so rapidly using ethacrynic acid, reductions in blood volume lead to a decrease in mean arterial pressure. Reduced cardiac index and reflex tachycardia can also occur due to the sudden decrease in preload.

When diuresis is excessive, decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate result in severe azotemia and uremia.

Of note, the most novel adverse effect of ethacrynic acid is ototoxicity, which can be seen after only one use, especially when delivered intravenously.

Transient hearing loss can beÂ observed in patients after one-time use of intravenous ethacrynic acid and can occur as quickly as 15 minutes after administration. Transient hearing loss has also been observed after long-term oral use, particularly in patients with decreased renal function since the kidneys metabolize ethacrynic acid.

Gastrointestinal side effects are less common and include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and epigastric pain that are usually temporary. In a few rare cases, ethacrynic acid has been implicated in pancreatitis and hepatitis, though causality remains unclear. Further, similar to thiazides, because it is an organic acid and can compete with urea in the nephron, ethacrynic acid can cause an increase in serum uric acid, precipitating acute gout.
