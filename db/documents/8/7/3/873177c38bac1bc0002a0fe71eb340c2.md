The ACGME requires pediatric residents to gain competence in thirteen procedures, and despite formal training, studies show that residents desire more procedural training.

Classically observational checklists have been utilized in the assessment of procedural skills; the scores are then based on completed or omitted observed steps. Another form of competency assessment is a global rating scale (GRS), which provides a more global impression on a skill's performance

Some high technology simulators such as mannequins and computer-based simulators can also provide real-time procedural feedback, including depth of compressions, bag-mask pressure, or timing of procedures. The usefulness of data like those mentioned in real patient practice, however, is not well understood. As Cheng et al. note, compressions on a mannequin do not translate well to appropriate compressions on a live infant.

Further studies identifying standardized methods of evaluating procedure skills, solidifying time to skill decay, defining best practice for skill maintenance, and improved patient outcomes are several goals of future pediatric SBME.
