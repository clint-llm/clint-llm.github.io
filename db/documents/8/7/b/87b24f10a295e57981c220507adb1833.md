Polymyxin B and colistin (polymyxin E) are used clinically from the polymyxin class of antibiotics when indicated for systemic antibiotic therapy. Polymyxin B is the active drug, while colistin is the less toxic prodrug colistin methanesulfonate.

Polymyxin B is administered topically for ophthalmic and otic use via droplet solution for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis and bacterial otitis externa.

Also, both drugs can be given off label via inhaled administration through a nebulizer. A bronchodilator such as beta-2-agonist is recommended 15 to 20 minutes before aerosolized administration to prevent bronchospasm. Lastly, the administration of both polymyxin B and colistin can be via intrathecal or intraventricular routes, where only preservative-free injections should be given via this latter route of administration.
