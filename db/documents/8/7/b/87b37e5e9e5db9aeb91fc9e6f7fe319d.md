Anteroseptal myocardial infarctions are commonly caused by the rupture of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque in the left anterior descending artery. Delayed or missed diagnosis of an anteroseptal myocardial infarction can lead to high morbidity and mortality. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of anteroseptal myocardial infarctions and highlights the importance of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with anteroseptal myocardial infarctions.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for anteroseptal myocardial infarctions.
- Summarize the pathophysiology of anteroseptal myocardial infarctions.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with an anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
- Explain why an interprofessional heart team approach is paramount to optimizing patient outcomes for patients with myocardial infarctions.
