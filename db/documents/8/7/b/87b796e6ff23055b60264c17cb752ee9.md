Because fluvastatin can cause elevated liver enzymes, patients must be regularly followed and have their liver enzymes monitored. In addition, patients require education regarding refraining from drinking or eating grapefruit; this can lead to inhibition of the liver enzymes and, consequently, high drug concentrations in the circulation. Finally, if the patient develops muscle pain, the clinician mustÂ check CPK levels and rule out rhabdomyolysis.
