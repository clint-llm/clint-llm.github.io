Normocytic normochromic anemia is not typically severe, although it can progress with time and with the evolution of the underlying cause. Prognosis is worse when accompanying certain chronic conditions, such as bone marrow failure, autoimmune conditions, or malignancy. Similarly, the prognosis may be altered by a comorbid condition like coronary artery disease, especially in older patients. Likewise, anemia due to acute blood loss, if treated early, has a good prognosis. Mortality rates are low in hemolytic anemias. The etiology of the hemolysis and the underlying disorder, such as sickle cell anemia or malaria, determine morbidity.

In general, the underlying disease is the strongest indication of the prognosis of normocytic normochromic anemia.
