Otitis media is a global problem and is found to be slightly more common in males than in females. The specific number of cases per year is difficult to determine due to the lack of reporting and different incidences across many different geographical regions. The peak incidence of otitis media occurs between six and twelve months of life and declines after age five. Approximately 80% of all children will experience a case of otitis media during their lifetime, and between 80% and 90% of all children will experience otitis media with an effusion before school age. Otitis media is less common in adults than in children, though it is more common in specific sub-populations such as those with a childhood history of recurrent OM, cleft palate, immunodeficiency or immunocompromised status, and others.
