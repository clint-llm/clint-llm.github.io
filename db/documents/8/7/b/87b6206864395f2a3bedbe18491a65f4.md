Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic and progressive cholestatic liver disorder of unknown etiology. Inflammation, fibrosis, and stricturing of intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic biliary ducts characterize PSC.

Established subtypes of PSC are:

- Classic: Affects small and large bile ducts

- Small-duct: Affects only small bile ducts

- Associated with autoimmune hepatitis: Affects small and large bile ducts

PSC is linked to ulcerative colitis and may be complicated by the onset of cholangiocarcinoma. Over the past few decades, the use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has led to more recognition of this disorder. There is no cure for PSC, and the condition is managed with ursodeoxycholic acid. Some patients end up with a liver transplant, but then they have to deal with an immunosuppressed state and its associated complications.
