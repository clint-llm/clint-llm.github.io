The histopathology of bullous systemic lupus erythematosus demonstrates subepidermal blistering with a dense neutrophilic infiltration in the upper dermis concentrated on the papillary tip with the association of nuclear dust and fibrin. These findings have a similarity to the histology of dermatitis herpetiformis. However, a good distinguishing feature is the presence of large deposits of mucin in the reticular dermis.

Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) staining of perilesional and uninvolved skin shows the deposition of immune-reactants along the dermato-epidermal junction (DEJ). IgG constitutes the majority of immunoglobulins, but other classes such as IgA and IgM are seen. Complements are frequently seen in the involved skin. Granular, linear, or a mixed pattern of immune reactant deposition are seen in the basement membrane zone (BMZ). Indirect immunofluorescence staining performed with basement membrane zone-split skin may also be positive for antibodies to type VII collagen on the dermal side.
