Medical simulation can be used to demonstrate clinical competency or for recertification. Once a professional is in practice, there are no standardized means to assess clinical competency other than shadowing them in their practice or reviewing their cases.  The current standard among many hospital systems to maintain certification is by an individual attesting that they can still perform a procedure. Using a validated system to demonstrate a skill or procedure through simulation offers more standardization and objectivity than the methods currently in place in many healthcare organizations.

Surgical specialties are increasing their use of task trainers and virtual reality in surgical training and certification.

Additionally, simulation can be used as an opportunity to enhance current practice.  Medical simulation allows for a practicing professional to strengthen existing skills or gain new skills without compromising patient safety or increased risk of harm to patients.  This may be achieved through a short course or with periodic simulations and has been utilized for nursing education to improved recognition and intervention for patients showing deterioration on the floor as well as for improving interprofessional relationships between nursing and care management.
