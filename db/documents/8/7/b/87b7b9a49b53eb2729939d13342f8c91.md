Chronic pancreatitis can present with prolonged abdominal pain with intermittent pain-free periods, weight loss, and relief of abdominal pain when leaning forward. However, in some cases, patients can be asymptomatic. Nausea, vomiting, and steatorrhea or greasy, foul-smelling, difficult-to-flush stools can also occur. Glucose intolerance or pancreatic diabetes is another finding later in the disease process. These are classic presentations in patients with a past medical history of alcohol abuse, tobacco use, malignancy (with ductal obstruction), hyperlipidemia, systemic disease, autoimmune disease, cystic fibrosis, among others).

Other symptoms include weight loss, diarrhea, and steatorrhea.

During an acute attack, the patient may draw the knees towards the chest to relieve the pain. Sometimes a mass may be palpated indication presence of a pseudocyst. Signs of malnutrition are common in long-standing cases.
