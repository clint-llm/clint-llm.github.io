Glucagonomas are typically slow growing; however, they are usually advanced by the time of diagnosis. The predictors of survival are dependent on age, tumor grade, and distant metastases. The cure is rarely achieved once the tumor is metastatic.

As per the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, the post-resection follow up includes history and physical examination, serum glucagon level, CT or MRI in the initial 3 to 12-month period.Â  After 1 year, it is recommended to follow the same measures every 6 to 12 months up to a maximum of 10 years.
