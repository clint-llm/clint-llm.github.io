The clinical findings of viral meningitis can vary by age and immune status.

Older infants and children may have a biphasic fever, first peaking with systemic constitutional symptoms and a second febrile phase with the onset of neurological signs.

It is important to obtain a travel history in patients with suspected viral meningitis, as many viruses have specific geographical distributions.
