Boerhaave syndrome is also known as spontaneous esophageal rupture or effort rupture of the esophagus. Although vomiting is thought to be the most common cause, other causes include those that can increase intra-esophageal pressure and cause a barogenic esophageal rupture. This activity describes the etiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of patients with Boerhaave syndrome and explains the role of an interprofessional team in evaluating and managing affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of Boerhaave syndrome.
- Outline the evaluation of Boerhaave syndrome.
- Explain the conservative and invasive treatment options and their indications in the treatment of Boerhaave syndrome.
- Describe the interplay among the interprofessional team in diagnosing, treating, and rehabilitating patients with Boerhaave syndrome.
