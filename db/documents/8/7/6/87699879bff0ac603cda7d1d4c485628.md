Major birth defects like conotruncal cardiac anomalies, thymic hypoplasia, or velopharyngeal insufficiency, should prompt consideration of velocardial facial syndrome in a newborn infant, particularly if the patient also has hypocalcemia.

Psychiatric symptoms, such as difficulties in learning or attention deficit disorder may be the presenting complaints of patients with velocardial facial syndrome, particularly in older adolescents and adults.

The four features most commonly are developmental delays, cardiac anomalies, palatal anomalies, and immune deficiency.

Features of a velocardial facial syndrome:

- Dysmorphic facial features: long narrow face, tubular nose with a bulbous tip, narrow palpebral fissures, small mouth, and ears

- Development and learning disabilities, particularly in math

- Hypernasal speech

- Hypocalcemia and hypoparathyroidism

- Hypo- or hyperthyroidism

- Psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, depression, autism, attention-deficit, obsessive-compulsive

- Recurrent seizures

- Cardiovascular malformations

- Scoliosis

- Renal and urogenital anomalies

- Strabismus

- Recurrent infections

- Obesity
