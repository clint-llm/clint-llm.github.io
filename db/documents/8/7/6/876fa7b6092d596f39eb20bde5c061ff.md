The esophagus is a tube-like structure that transports food and other edibles from the mouth to the stomach. This is accomplished through the sequential and well-coordinated movement of food from the proximal esophagus to the distal esophagus and finally into the stomach. Disruption in this well-coordinated movement results in a variety of esophageal motility disorders, which are furtherÂ classified as either primary or secondary

It is approximately 25 cm long anatomically and has two sphincters, one at the proximal upper part and the other at the distal end.
