Treatment depends on the etiology of the hypothalamic dysfunction, as well as the patient's presenting signs and symptoms.

- For tumors, surgery or radiation may be required. Hypothalamic gliomas are usually observed. A biopsy can be performed for those not involving the optic chiasm and tracts.

- For hypothalamic hamartomas, if symptomatic with uncontrolled seizures, surgery is recommended. Thermoablation and radiosurgery can also be used.

- For hormonal deficiencies, therapeutic hormone replacement is used.

- Nutritional guidance and certain medicines may be used to regulate the patient's appetite.

- Delayed puberty in Frohlich syndrome is treated in males with human chorionic gonadotropin and later with testosterone; in females with estrogen and later estrogen-progestin.

- Kallmann syndrome requires lifelong sex hormone replacement.
