The anterolateral thigh flap has become an essential part of the plastic surgeon's armamentarium, and its widespread use involves a team approach wherein the plastic surgeon plays an important role in the management of a multispecialty problem. The ALT flap can be used to cover difficult open complex lower extremity fractures, which will involve the plastic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon, anesthetist, physical medicine specialist, and physiotherapist. This orthoplastic approach in extremity reconstruction involves the simultaneous application of the principles and practice of orthopedic and plastic surgery to enhance and optimize patient outcomes following limb reconstructive surgery.

Similarly, in head and neck reconstruction where a multidisciplinary team approach is essential to prevent the locoregional and distant spread of tumors, the concept of wide local excision combined with immediate reconstruction with free flaps and adjuvant chemoradiation is gaining popularity. In these cases, the ablative and reconstructive surgeon are often one and the same, although plastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons, and oral-maxillofacial surgeons are often called upon by the head and neck surgical oncologist or otorhinolaryngologist.
