Effective interprofessional teamwork and communication are integral to patient safety. The Institute of Medicine highlighted the effect of poor communication on deleterious healthcare outcomes in the 1990s.

The future of patient safety and avoidance of medical errors should be predicated upon systems based error prevention as opposed to sole reliance on a healthcare providerâ€™s vigilance. Handoff periods are particularly vulnerable to deficiencies in verbal communication due to language impediments, misunderstandings, interruptions, and hesitation to speak up against authority.
