Taeniidae have a worldwide distribution except for Taenia asiatica that appears to be restricted to Asian countries.Taenia solium and Taenia saginata have a global distribution, the highest prevalence is found in areas with poor access to adequate clean water and sanitation and areas that ingest raw or under-cooked meat.T. solium has been effectively controlled in most of Europe, North America, and Australia while the highest prevalence is found in Africa, Asia, Latin America, East Europe, China, Pakistan, and India.T. saginata has its highest prevalence in Southern and Eastern Africa.

Diphyllobothriasis has a global distribution with some decline in human disease in North American, Asia, and most of Europe but also a reemergence in some areas, including Russia, South Korea, Japan, and South America.D. latum is thought to be the most common cause of Diphyllobothriosis; however, recent studies show that due to the difficulty in classifying species, D. latum may be misdiagnosed as other emerging species. D. latum is mostly reported in northern Europe, Russia, and North America; however, it also was recently found in South America (Chile).
