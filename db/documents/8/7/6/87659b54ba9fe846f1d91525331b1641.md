Elevation of HDL cholesterol without a substantial increase in HDL particle can result in cholesterol overloaded HDL particles, which in one community-based cohort study showed an increased progression towards carotid atherosclerosis as measured by carotid intimal medial thickening in asymptomatic patients with no underlying atherosclerotic disease. CETP inhibitors and niacin both raise HDLC levels without having any effect on HDL function or number of particles and therefore tend to increase cholesterol overloaded particles.
