The proper and legal administration of in-hospital opioids are well characterized, as are the biochemical nature of the receptors involved. As of early 2019, research interests in opioid consumption focused on risk reduction in both the prevention and the subsequent management of opioid use disorder. There is growing reliance on evidence-based medicine principles in the management of opioid-tolerant patients and those with opioid substance use disorder. There is a large body of evidence at this point supporting opioid agonist management for the medication-assisted treatment of those with opioid substance use disorder.

Some have called for the study of nation-of-origin features of heterogeneous opioid responses, noting for example that the capacity to metabolize codeine to morphine, which is several thousand times more effective for pain control per mg than codeine, is very rapid in those whose nation of origin is near the Horn of Africa. This enzymatic conversion is far slower in many White race individuals, giving these patients ineffective pain control with codeine. There are likely other variations in opioid responses that are to date poorly characterized regarding predicting which patient will have what response to which specific opioid.
