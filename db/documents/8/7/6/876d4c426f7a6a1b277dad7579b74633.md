The incidence varies between 0.3% and 4.9%. The CASS registry found coronary artery ectasia in 4.9% of coronary angiograms. Coronary artery ectasia classifies as small (vessel size under 5 mm), medium (vessels size 5 to 8 mm), and giant (vessel size over 8 mm).

Based on shape, coronary artery ectasia can be divided into "saccular," when the transverse diameter is larger than the longitudinal diameter, or "fusiform" when the longitudinal diameter is larger than the transverse diameter.
