Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is generally a relatively safe therapy for various conditions. However, there are some adverse side effects. When adverse, side-effect data was collected from 2009 through 2010 on patients treated in monoplace chambers, it showed side-effect rates estimated around 0.4%. About half of all adverse events fall under the category of "ear pain" and a quarter are classified as "confinement anxiety." When examining the complications of hyperbaric oxygen treatment, there are two categories: side effects of pressure and side effects of oxygen. The side effect of pressure is barotrauma, which can affect any closed, air-filled cavity (including but not limited to ears, sinus, teeth, lungs, and bowel). The side effects of oxygen can further be subdivided into three categories: pulmonary, neurologic, and ophthalmologic. Confinement anxiety is more an effect of the physical space of the chamber and not a true complication. This activity describes the complications of HBO and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the issues of concern with HBO therapy.
- Describe the complications of HBO therapy.
- Summarize the management of HBOT complications.
- Outline the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the safe use of HBOT and improve outcomes.
