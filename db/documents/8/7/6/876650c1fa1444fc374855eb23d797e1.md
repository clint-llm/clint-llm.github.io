Idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis accounts for fewer than 10% of all patients presenting with primary glomerulopathy. Type 3 RPGN is more common than types 1 or 2. More than 50% of patients with crescentic glomerulonephritis present with acute nephritic syndrome and rapidly deteriorating renal function; however, other modes do occur such as asymptomatic 15%; nephrotic, 10%; and chronic renal failure, 15%.

A seasonal predilection is observed in Type I RPGN or anti-glioblastoma multiforme disease with peaks in spring and early summer. There is male gender predilection for type 1 and type 3 RPGN. Type 1 is common in younger patients whereas type 2 and 3 occur in older adults with a peak incidence in the fourth to sixth decades.

Renal failure at presentation carries an increased risk of end-stage renal disease and death despite immunosuppressive therapy.
