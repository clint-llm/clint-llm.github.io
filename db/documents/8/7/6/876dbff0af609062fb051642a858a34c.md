The coronary arteries are the first vessels to branch from the aorta, and they provide a crucial supply of oxygen and nutrients to the layers of the heart. The right coronary artery and its branches mostly supply the right side of the heart, although they also reach part of the left atrium, a posterior portion of the left ventricle, and even the posterior third of the interventricular septum. Unlike vessels in peripheral locations of the body, these vessels dilate during exertion to meet the increased demands of the myocardium. However, the lack of anastomoses amongst the coronary arteries leaves the heart at risk of ischemia and infarction if blood flow through the vessels is severely compromised, such as with atherosclerosis.
