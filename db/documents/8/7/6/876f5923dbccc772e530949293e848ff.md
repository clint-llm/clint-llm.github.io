Diagnosis of hemifacial spasm is made clinically based on the detailed clinical history and a neurological and local physical examination. Electromyogram (EMG) can be used in the early stages of the disease when it is difficult to distinguish clinically from facial myokymia, blepharospasm, complex partial motor seizures, or motor tics. The diagnostic finding on electrophysiological testing is lateral spread and variable synkinesis on blink reflex testing. Stimulation of one branch of the facial nerve leads to the contraction of facial muscles supplied by a different branch. Needle EMG characteristically shows irregular, brief motor unit potentials with high frequency (150 to 400 Hz), and facial twitching can be clinically correlated with this finding.

In cases with suspected facial nerve compression, it is necessary to rule out the vascular malformation or tumor at the brainstem exit site of the nerve. Advanced MRI scanning techniques such as high-resolution T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo or gradient-echo imaging with gadolinium assist in better visualization. MR angiography is reserved for those planned for microvascular decompression surgeries.
