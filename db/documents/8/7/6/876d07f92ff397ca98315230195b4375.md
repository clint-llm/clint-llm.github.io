Patient education is key in ensuring adequate clinical outcomes for this disease. Patient education on medical compliance, including compliance with medications as well as routine monitoring, can help delay LV dysfunction and optimize the timing of surgery. Patients should be encouraged to follow up regularly with a cardiologist for routine echocardiography to improve long-term outcomes.
