Initial treatment in these patients is aggressive resuscitation via the PALS/ACLS algorithm. Do not give anything by mouth (NPO) to patients in whom inborn errors are suspected. Since the emergency provider cannot know which portion of the metabolic pathway is deranged, it is prudent to prevent the patient from utilizing his or her native pathways for carbohydrate metabolism, clearance of metabolites, or accessing of stored energy. Therefore, the patient should receive pure substrate (glucose) at a volume that obviates the need for the patient to break down glycogen or fatty acids. This should be accomplished with 10% dextrose solution at a one and a half maintenance rate. The patient may need to be provided insulin (0.05 U/kg/hour to 0.2 U/kg/hour) to manage hyperglycemia. Patients with elevated ammonia may be given nitrogen scavengers such as sodium benzoate or sodium phenylacetate, but patients with ammonia levels greater than 600 require dialysis. Most patients who are ill with suspected inborn errors of metabolism require monitoring in an intensive care unit setting.
