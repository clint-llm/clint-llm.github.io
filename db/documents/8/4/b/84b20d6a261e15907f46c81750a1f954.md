Laser hair removal is performed by many healthcare workers including nurses, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, primary care providers and other cosmetic surgeons. Unfortunately, because of lack of oversight, complications are common during this procedure. To make matters worse, patients are often given unrealistic expectations. The key is to use the correct laser, especially in dark skinned individuals. Common adverse effects of laser or IPL-based hair removal include post-treatment erythema, pain, and burning.

Overall, lasers can remove hair but rarely does the procedure provide a permanent cure for hair growth. Touch up maintenance treatments are required for most patients in the long term.
