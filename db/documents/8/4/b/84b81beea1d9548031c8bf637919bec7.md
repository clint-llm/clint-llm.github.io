Histamine toxicity or scombroid poisoning (scombrotoxism, scombroid ichthyotoxicosis, Mahi-Mahi flush) is the principal chemical agent of fish food-borne disease found in the United States. The second most common is ciguatera poisoning. It also may occur with contaminated Swiss cheese ingestion. Most commonly, the symptoms of scombroid toxicity mimic the pathophysiology of histamine release, including face and neck flushing, diarrhea, urticarial rash, and headache closely. Patients can rarely have severe bronchospasm or cardiac effects, usually in those patients with predisposing medical conditions such as asthma or significant cardiac disease.
