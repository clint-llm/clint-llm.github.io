Immune thrombocytopenic purpura can occur with infections (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus), malignancy (e.g., adenocarcinoma and lymphoma), and common variable immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hepatitis, and thyroid disease).

In these diseases, anti-platelet antibodies form, leading to platelet destruction. Drugs such as acetazolamide, aspirin, aminosalicylic acid, carbamazepine, cephalothin, digitoxin, phenytoin, meprobamate, methyldopa, quinidine, rifampin, and sulfamethazine may also cause autoimmune thrombocytopenia,Â  Autoantibody production against platelets is advocated as one etiology for ITP.
