Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of cortical AChE activity in vivo has been used to measure the efficacy of dementia therapy. There are reports of decreased activity of acetylcholinesterase in patients with Alzheimer disease. By measuring AChE activity and using it to gauge cholinergic innervation expressed by axons and nerves, investigators may configure and assess the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors as it contributes to the management of Alzheimer disease.
