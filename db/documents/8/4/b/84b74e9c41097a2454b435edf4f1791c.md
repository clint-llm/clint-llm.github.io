The aorta is supplied by a network of small vessels known as the vasa vasorum. The vasa vasorum are most prevalent superior to the renal arteries. As a result, the infrarenal abdominal aorta is predisposed to aneurysm formation as inflammation and oxidation rates in the aortic walls increase as vasa vasorum decrease. Lymphatics drainage closely follows vascular supply. The cisterna chyli, located just inferior to the diaphragmâ€™s aortic hiatus, receives lymphatics from much of the lower limbs and abdomen. Lymph then moves superiorly through the thoracic duct.
