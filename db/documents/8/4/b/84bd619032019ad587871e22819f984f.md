The management and treatment of malocclusion require an interprofessional team of dental healthcare workers, including but not limited to general dentists, dental hygienists, orthodontists, and oral surgeons. An interprofessional team approach to treating malocclusion will allow for earlier diagnosis during routine oral hygiene appointments with a general dentist and dental hygienist.

If a malocclusion is too severe to be treated by a general dentist, a referral can be made for the patient to seek treatment by an orthodontist. In cases ofÂ malocclusion requiring surgical treatment, an oral surgeon can work with the orthodontist to correct the misaligned jaw utilizing orthognathic surgery.

Dental hygienists and general dentists play a critical role in monitoring the oral health and state of disease, if applicable, of the patient receiving orthodontic treatment. Many patients who receive traditional braces have a tougher time practicing proper oral hygiene. One of the most commonly neglected sites is the interproximal posterior areas of dentition. Gingivitis may develop if plaque builds up over time in the patient's supragingival and subgingival pockets. Depending on the severity of the disease, oral hygiene instruction and prophylaxis or scaling and root planing may need to be performed by the dentist or dental hygienist.
