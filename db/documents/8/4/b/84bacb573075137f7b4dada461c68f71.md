The standard of care for evaluating injuries to the hand is plain film imaging. True lateral, anterior-posterior, and oblique views are necessary for each affected digit. The films must demonstrate a clear view of the affected digit. Unaffected fingers must not obscure the view of the affected digit. Examiners should remember that rotational deformities are most commonly diagnosed on the physical exam rather than on plain films.
