Indications for atropine only include a few conditions, but this alkaloid is life-saving. All interprofessional healthcare team members should be aware of how to use atropine, the dose, and the method of administration. Clinicians can use this drug in patients with bradycardia and poisoning from cholinergic agents; atropine can immediately reverse the slow heart rate and reduce mortality. Nursing staff should always make sure that atropine is available in the cardiac arrest cart. More importantly, a syringe and needle should also be available as the drug can only be administered intravenously. Similarly, the anesthesia nurse should ensure that atropine is available in the operating room at all times. On almost every cardiology and cardiac surgery floor, atropine may be necessary, so it should be readily available. The pharmacist is the team member responsible for ensuring that stock supplies of atropine are available in each department, verifying dosing, and performing medication reconciliation for drug-drug interactions.

**Outcomes**

Atropine is a very useful drug to reverse bradycardia from many causes. It works immediately and is relatively safe when used at therapeutic doses. There are countless reports on the number of lives saved through the use of atropine in patients with bradycardia or organophosphate poisoning.
