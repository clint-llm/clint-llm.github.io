Carotenemia is best managed by an interprofessional healthcare team. Clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs) will be primarily responsible for making an accurate diagnosis, although the issue may first be noticed by patients, parents, or nursing staff. Once diagnosed, the clinician and nurse will continue to follow and counsel the patient and their family if necessary and monitor the patient's progress and response to corrective actions. Patient education in collaboration with a dietitian improves the outcome of the condition and prevents further unnecessary investigations. Clinicians should provide a simple explanation of the problem and how it is linked to the diet. This will help with treatment compliance and appropriate food choices. Any interprofessional team member who notes a significant change in the patient's condition or a failure to respond to interventions should document their observations in the patient's health record and reach out to other team members as appropriate to enact corrective measures. This interprofessional approach will drive the best outcomes. [Level 5]
