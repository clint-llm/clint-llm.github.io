Rickettsia is a group of vector-borne organisms that cause acute febrile illnesses throughout the world. While the clinical presentation of rickettsial infection is similar, the causative species and epidemiology can vary depending on the region. It is important to recognize both the typical symptoms and the epidemiology of a given region to correctly diagnose and treat these infections promptly, as they can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This activity reviews the disorders caused by rickettsial infection, including presentation, evaluation, and treatment. This activity also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of rickettsial infections.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of rickettsial infections.
- Describe the presentation of rickettsial infections.
- Review the treatment and management options available for rickettsial infections.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of rickettsial infections and improve outcomes.
