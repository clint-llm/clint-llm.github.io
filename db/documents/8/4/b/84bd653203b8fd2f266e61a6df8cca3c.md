Most normocytic anemias appear to be the result of impaired production of red cells or a deficiency of erythropoietin in cases of renal failure. As in the case of anemia associated with chronic infections or various systemic diseases, the symptoms are usually connected to those of the underlying condition, although sometimes anemia may be the most prominent sign. Likewise, the complications will differ according to the complication of the underlying disease. These include:

- Hypoxia (hypoxic respiratory failure, end-organ damage)

- Renal osteodystrophy (in chronic kidney disease, through secondary hyperparathyroidism)

- Cardiorenal anemia syndrome: Severe anemia causes a decline in blood perfusion to the kidneys, causing additional kidney damage

- Cardiovascular disease

- Multiorgan failure

- Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly

- Jaundice

**Anemia Causes**

- Cardiovascular compromise

- Shock

- End-organ dysfunction

- Functional limitation
