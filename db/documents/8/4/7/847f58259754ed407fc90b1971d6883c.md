Thoracic discogenic pain syndrome (TDPS) is rare making it challenging for the healthcare team to diagnose and treat the condition. The rarity of TDPS is attributed to the particular orientation, structure, and function of the thoracic spine in the vertebral column. Despite this rarity, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and physicians should be familiar with its diagnosis and treatment and work as an interprofessional team to provide treatment. [Level V]
