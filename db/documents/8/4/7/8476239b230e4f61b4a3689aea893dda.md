Due to the unpredictable behaviors, irritability, and the possibility of psychotic behavior of methamphetamine users, especially during the hospital visit due to the overdose or complication, the safety of medical and security staff is important. Hence, the advice is always to use precautions when dealing with these patients. Another healthcare worker or security personnel should always accompany these patients. The triage nurse should be fully aware of the adverse effects of amphetamine and ensure that the emergency department is fully aware of the individualÂ admitted. This interprofessional team approach to addressing these patients should include clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists, who can collaborate and communicate across interdisciplinary lines to ensure these patients get the care they need, whether misusing the drug or in the rare instances where it has a therapeutic indication.
