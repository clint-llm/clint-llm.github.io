Modern-day medicine has been revolutionized to be personalized and specific based on individualized specific disease characteristics. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are a prime example of personalized therapeutics enabled by advances in our knowledge of immunology, molecular biology, and biochemistry. As an example, a disease such as cancer can be evaluated for the presence of certain properties (i.e., hormone receptors in breast cancers), which can, in turn, be targeted by mAbs to provide a "tailored" therapy. The earliest documented use of (indirect) antibody therapy was by Dr. Edward Jenner in 1796, when he inoculated pustular fluid from smallpox lesions to elicit immunity in the recipient. It was not until 1975 when the generation of mAbs for use in humans was established by Drs Kohler and Milstein.

The antibodies generated by this immune response are proteins that have high specificity and affinity for the antigen/ molecule they were generated against. Kohler and Milstein utilized these principles to conceive what came to be called a "hybridoma" (a fusion cell composed of myeloma cells and splenic B lymphocytes, both murine in origin).

Despite the initial challenges associated with murine methodologies of mAb development, research continued, and the development of alternative methods overcame these limitations. Chimeric clones were the next developments, whereby human crystallizable fragment (Fc) regions were attached in place of murine ones.
