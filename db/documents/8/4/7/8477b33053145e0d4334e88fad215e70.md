Because PAF mediates the actions of other signaling molecules, its activity is controlled at the molecular level. One of the ways to control the activity of PAF is the variable expression of the PAF receptor on cell surfaces. PAF receptor gene, located on chromosome 1, has two distinct promotors (PAFR promoters 1 and 2). As a result, there are two PAF receptor transcripts (PAFR transcripts 1 and 2) differentially expressed in human tissues. Peripheral leukocytes and differentiated eosinophilic cell lines express PAFR transcript-1. Heart, lungs, spleen, kidney express PAFR transcript-2.

PAFR transcript-1 is mostly involved in inflammation and pathological processes and is synthesized in response to stimulation by PAF in a positive feedback manner through the activation of NF-kB. PAFR transcript-2 is controlled by various hormones and cytokines such as estrogen, TGF-beta, retinoic acid, or T3. Retinoic acid and thyroid hormone are potent inducers of PAFR transcript-2. Estrogen also increases PAFR transcript-2 levels, and TFG-beta decreases its levels.
