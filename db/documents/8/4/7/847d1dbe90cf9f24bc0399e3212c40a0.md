**Can Screening for a Suicide Lead to Harm?**

To date, there is insufficient data to determine for screening for suicide leads to harm to the individual or societyÂ as a whole. Presently, the USPSTF has concluded that the evidence for suicide screening in primary care/nursing is inadequate and that the balance between harm or benefit cannot be determined.

The costs of screening for suicide are minimal. Except for some time and the use of questionnaires, there are no other exorbitant costs. The latest data reveals that less than 20% of primary care physicians screen adolescents or seniors for suicidal risk factors.

**Suicide Resources**

- Prior to discharging patients with depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideations, it is important to prove them with resources and referrals.

- The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be reached at 1-800-273-TALK (8255); this site operates 24/7 and has trained counselors available at all times.

- The patient should be asked to contact the US Substance Abuse and Mental health Services administration online and ask for FREE wallet cards which provide information about the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

- The Friendship Line is free and available to people over the age of 60. It operates 24/7 and can be reached at 1-800-971-0016. The Friendship Line assists seniors who feel lonely, depressed, or are contemplating suicide.

- Finally, the patient should be provided with the names of local mental health care professionals who can be reached in case of an emergency.

An integrated and collaborative interprofessional team approach is necessary to identify those at the highest risk of suicide and appropriately manage their risk. The clinical nurse or psychiatry-trained nurse can assist the medical team by screening patients for suicide risk using validated screening tools. Communicating these findings with the clinicians can help patients receive appropriate medical and social support to decrease their risk. The community nurse, specialty-trained social worker, and case manager can help monitor and follow up on those identified at the highest risk of suicide to ensure they follow up with the treatment plan advised and that their needs outside of medical therapy are met. Nurses also assist the clinicians by educating the patients on suicide prevention aids and resources to seek the help they need if and when necessary. A multifaceted interprofessional team approach can reduce the number of suicide-related deaths without overburdening the current healthcare system. [Level 5]
