Primary congenital glaucoma is a treatable condition, and the outcomes are good if diagnosed and treated on time. So is the case with other diseases of the disease spectrum. These patients can either come directly to the ophthalmology clinics or are referred from other specialties. A pediatrician or pediatric surgeon, while treating a patient with multiple syndromic manifestations, can refer the child to the ophthalmology clinic to rule out ocular involvement.

Similarly, an optometrist can raise the alarm and send a referral if he notices abnormally increasing refractive error on serial retinoscopy. So, pediatricians, optometrists, and general ophthalmologists should be primed for the disease. This will ensure timely referrals. Associated systemic abnormalities should be looked for, and appropriate referrals should be made. Patients with maxillofacial abnormalities in AXR anomaly should be sent to maxillofacial departments for needful.

In patients with poor vision, low vision clinic referral should be done to ensure appropriate training of the patients and lifestyle modifications. Prenatal counseling might help in some. Collaboration, shared decision-making, and communication are key elements for a good outcome. The interprofessional care provided to the patient must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to planning and evaluating all joint activities.
