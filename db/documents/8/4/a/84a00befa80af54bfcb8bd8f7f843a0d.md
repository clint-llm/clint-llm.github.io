Events during the two phases of healthy vascular development, vasculogenesis, and angiogenesis underlie the zone 1 and zone 2 pathologies seen in ROP.

Vascular development in the retina is not completed in certain portions of the retina until after term. Specifically, the nasal and temporal portions do not complete development until 32 and 40 weeks, respectively. After birth, exposure to atmospheric oxygen and supplemental oxygen results in a rapid swing from relative hypoxia in utero to hyperoxia. Synthesis of IGF1, a vitally important hormone that regulates VEGF mediated vascular growth, is dependent upon adequate amino acid and energy supplies. A relative nutritional deficiency after birth in preterm infants results in depressed serum IGF1 levels. Together, hyperoxia and low IGF1 result in delayed retinal vascularization. Developing capillaries undergo vasoconstriction and eventual obliteration. These changes constitute phase 1 of ROP. Phase 2 of ROP consists of a decline of normal angiogenesis with predominant pathologic angiogenesis.

There is an increase of VEGF release into the vitreous, a drop of IGF1 levels, and peripheral avascular retinal neurons are damaged through hypoxic injury. High levels of VEGF in the vitreous results in the growth of pathologic vessels out of the retina.
