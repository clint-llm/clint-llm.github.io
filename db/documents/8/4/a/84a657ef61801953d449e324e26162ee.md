A systematic review highlights the need for a collaborative, interprofessional, and multi-pronged approach to reduce infections, including ventriculitis.

The nurse looking after patients with ventriculostomy must be vigilant about signs of infection and report any abnormality to the interprofessional team. The infectious disease nurse and consultant should be involved early in the care to help select the appropriate antibiotics and make recommendations regarding the catheter.Â  The pharmacist should ensure that the antibiotics selected are sensitive to the organism isolated and that the drugs are safe, reporting any concerns to the team. The wound care nurse should recommend appropriate cleaning solutions for the ventriculostomy site. Only through education and collaboration of the whole interprofessional team, can management and outcomes be improved.
