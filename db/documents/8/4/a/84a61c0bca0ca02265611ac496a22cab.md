The most common ECG abnormalities involving calcium channel blockers other than dihydropyridines are sinus bradycardia, variable degrees of atrioventricular blocks, bundle branch block, QT prolongation, and junctional rhythms. Dihydropyridines maintain normal sinus rhythm and can cause reflex sinus tachycardia.

Hypotension and bradycardia, when progressive, can eventually lead to cardiogenic shock. Also, hyperglycemia is common with all subclasses of CCBs and can be a useful clinical marker for poisoning severity. Both of these effects lead directly to metabolic acidosis.

Profound hypoperfusion and end-organ ischemia with a severe overdose can cause clinical evidence of end-organ failures like seizures, myocardial infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, bowel infarction and ischemia, and stroke.

Reports of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema with CCB overdose are few, and the mechanism is not well defined. Sudden rapid precapillary vasodilatation causing an increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure may explain it. Overaggressive administration of crystalloids in an attempt to correct hypotension exacerbates the damage.
