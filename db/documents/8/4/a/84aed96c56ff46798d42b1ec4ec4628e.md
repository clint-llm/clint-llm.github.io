Amylase levels are routinely evaluated in patients suspected of acute pancreatitis. However, while it is sensitive, it is not specific.

Appropriate reference ranges should be applied to assess serum amylase levels as they differ based on age and different ethnic and racial groups. A study found that 32% of Asian Americans and 50% of Native Americans had higher total amylase levels above the upper limit of normal compared to the White population.
