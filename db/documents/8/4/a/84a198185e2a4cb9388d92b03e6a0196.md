The most common indication for obtaining breast MRI in clinical practice is to evaluate for breast cancer. Studies have shown increased sensitivity in diagnosing breast cancer when MRI supplements mammography in comparison with mammography alone or combined mammography and ultrasonography.

- Those with the lifetime risk of 20% or greater

- BRCA mutation carriers

- Untested first degree relative of BRCA carrier

- History of chest irradiation between ages 10 and 30 years.

- Women with genetic syndromes predisposing for breast cancer

In patients already diagnosed with breast cancer, MR imaging is crucial for further evaluation including

- Preoperative assessment of the extent of cancer in newly diagnosed patients for surgical planning

- Screening of contralateral breast in conditions where there is an increased risk of bilaterality such as lobular carcinoma

- Breast cancer staging for treatment planning

- Monitoring tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy such as chemotherapy or hormonal therapy

Preoperative assessment for multifocal and multicentric lesions is important for appropriate treatment, which can decrease re-excision rate and recurrence rate.

Other indications for breast MRI include

- Women with dense breasts, as they have one to two-fold increased risk of breast cancer than the general population

- To differentiate scar versus recurrence

- Woman with suspected inflammatory breast cancer - MRI demonstrates skin enhancement

- Axillary nodal metastasis with unknown primary or occult breast lesion on mammography and ultrasound

- To assess the stability of silicone breast implants

- Patients with nipple discharge with inconclusive findings on other imaging studies

Brown et al. conducted an online survey among primary care providers (PCP) and specialists regarding the frequency of ordering breast MRI which showed that the specialists order more breast MRI studies compared to PCPs.

Some challenges that present with the use of breast MRI include high cost, lack of availability in some of the breast centers, longer examination time, need for intravenous contrast medium, and false positive reads.
