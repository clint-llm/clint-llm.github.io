Asterixis can either be unilateral or bilateral and is typically asynchronous, irregular and variable in frequency and amplitude. Although the clinical sign may suggest an underlying process, the clinical history of the presenting illness is fundamental in triggering further workup.

Bilateral asterixis is most commonly associated with metabolic encephalopathies, especially hepatic. The presumption in hepatic encephalopathy was that damage to brain cells due to the impaired metabolism of ammonia was predominantly related to the development of asterixis in hepatic encephalopathy,

Unilateral asterixis is usually because of focal brain lesions in the thalamus, although there have been reports of lesions in the midbrain, parietal cortex, and frontal cortex causing unilateral asterixis

Asterixis is a significant yet poorly understood clinical sign and is part of the West Haven Criteria used to grade the severity of hepatic encephalopathy as it seems to be a relatively sensitive sign of the disease but is non-specific.
