Because the disorder may be associated with systemic symptoms, the workup should include the following:

- Complete blood cell count (CBC); may show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count with a large percentage of neutrophils, anemia of chronic disease, and/or leukemic-type reaction

- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein may be elevated

- Liver function test

- Human chorionic gonadotrophin (blood or urine) in female patients

**Imaging**

Because of bone and joint pain, imaging frequently is done. In the early stage, X-rays will only show reactive changes. About 50% of patients will demonstrate lytic lesions on a plain film X-ray, and the bone scan may show multiple areas of increased uptake. The lesions are destructive and often resemble acute osteomyelitis. Cultures of these bony lesions are often negative.
