Post-intubation laryngeal edema is often asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic but could sometimes present with post-extubation stridor (constituting nearly two-thirds of the stridor cases) in which scenario, the patients might end up on reintubation in about half the cases. A well trained and organized anesthesia or ICU team, including medical and nursing staff, as well as respiratory therapists, could safely handle a difficult to intubate and/or ventilate situations incase it arises during the course of events. Difficult fibreoptic intubations may need expert support, or otorhinolaryngology consult for emergency open tracheostomy. Close coordination and interaction between various health professional teams to ensure the best outcome in a given patient.
