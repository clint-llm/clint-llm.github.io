Infection with toxoplasma has been shown to be upwards of 60% in some parts of the world, and although primary infections can be self-limiting, there is a risk for more severe disease with reactivation of latent infection. Patients can reduce their risk of being infected by:

- Cooking food to safe temperatures or freezing meats for several days at sub-zero temperatures prior to cooking

- Thoroughly washing or peeling all fruits and vegetables.

- Thoroughly washing surfaces that have come in contact with raw meat, poultry, seafood, and unwashed fruits or vegetables

- Avoiding unpasteurized goat's milk

- Wearing gloves and performing appropriate hand hygiene after contact with litter boxes and after contact with any sand or soil that may have been in contact with cat feces.
