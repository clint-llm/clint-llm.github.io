The intrinsic muscles of the larynx serve a variety of functions, many of which can be categorized by their action on the vocal ligament. The adductors are the thyroarytenoid (vocalis), lateral cricoarytenoid, and interarytenoid muscles.

The epiglottis is drawn posteriorly over the laryngeal inlet to prevent bolus aspiration. The aryepiglottic muscles originate at the apex of the arytenoids and insert at the lateral border of the epiglottis. Similarly, the oblique arytenoid muscles originate at the arytenoid apex and insert at the aryepiglottic fold. The thyroepiglottic muscle originates on the internal surface of the thyroid cartilage and inserts on the margin of the epiglottis. When contracting, this muscle inferiorly displaces the epiglottis. These muscles work synergistically to close the laryngeal inlet by pulling the epiglottis posteriorly and inferiorly.

Several cervical muscles act extrinsically on the larynx to aid in phonation and swallowing. Muscles inserted on the superior aspect of the hyoid (geniohyoid, digastric, mylohyoid, thyrohyoid, and stylohyoid muscles) and pharynx (stylopharyngeus, palatopharyngeus, and pharyngeal constrictor muscles) act in conjunction to elevate the larynx. Those muscles inserted on the inferior surface of the hyoid (sternohyoid and omohyoid muscles) and the sternothyroid muscle act to depress the larynx.
