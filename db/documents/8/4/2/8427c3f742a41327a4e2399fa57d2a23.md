The complications in MEN1 can occur secondary to the pathophysiology or the surgical treatments.

Regarding pathophysiology, pituitary tumors can cause pituitary insufficiency and visual field defects. Parathyroid tumors can cause metabolic bone disease and kidney stones. Tumors of gastro-entero-pancreatic tissue can cause excessive secretion of gastrin, insulin, glucagon, or vasoactive intestinal peptide, damaging the gastrointestinal system. Similarly, full-body complications may occur as a result of metastases.
