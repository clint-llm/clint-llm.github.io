The thyroid gland is a major endocrine organ that produces triiodothyronine (T3), tetraiodothyronine (T4), and calcitonin. These hormones are essential for bodily function and metabolism. This endocrine gland has a highly vascular blood supply due to its physiologic significance.

The superior thyroid artery (STA) arising from the external carotid artery (ECA), and the inferior thyroid artery (ITA) branching from the thyrocervical trunk create the blood supply to the thyroid gland. The STA and ITA anastomose bilaterally at the thyroid gland giving this organ a dual blood supply.

External Carotid artery branches: Superior thyroid artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, lingual artery, facial artery, occipital artery, posterior auricular artery, maxillary artery, superficial temporal artery.

Thyrocervical Trunk branches: inferior thyroid artery, suprascapular artery, ascending cervical artery, transverse cervical artery.
