A pseudocyst is a collection of pancreatic fluids adjacent to the pancreas. It is seen more commonly after an episode of chronic pancreatitis and less commonly with acute pancreatitis. Common risk factors include gallstones, alcohol consumption, and abdominal trauma.Â Pseudocysts can be asymptomatic, or they can present with vague symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. It is seen on CT imaging as a well-demarcated homogenous fluid-filled mass near the pancreas. If complications do not develop, most pseudocysts resolve spontaneously. Generally, initial treatment is conservative with analgesics, antiemetics, and a low-fat diet. Persistent symptoms and complications such as hemorrhage, infection, or progressive increase in size may warrant invasive treatment. Warning signs that should prompt immediate medical evaluation include coffee ground appearing vomitus, persistent loss of appetite, unintentional weight loss, severe abdominal pain, intractable vomiting, or yellowing of the skin and eyes.
