Tracheostomy is one of the most important surgical procedures performed on children. Tracheostomy has become a viable alternative for a clinical condition requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation with the benefit of reducing airway resistance, reducing the need for deep sedation, improving patient comfort, and allowing for proper care of airway. Anesthesiologists, pediatricians, and otolaryngologists need to understand the indications, contraindications, and side effects associated with the procedure. Anesthesiologists need to understand the pathophysiology of the disease and surgeon to understand the neck anatomy so that procedure could be done uneventfully with lesser postoperative complications.
