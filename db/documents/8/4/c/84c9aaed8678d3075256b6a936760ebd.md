Both the vagus and phrenic nerves descend into the mediastinum. Both the proximal trachea and esophagus descend into the superior mediastinum. They may be exposed via a left cervical neck incision.

The left recurrent laryngeal nerve originates from the left vagus and traverses the aortic arch in between the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery. The nerve then passes underneath the aortic arch, just adjacent to the ligamentum arteriosum. From here, the nerve descends into the tracheoesophageal groove.

The sympathetic trunk crosses bilaterally next to the vertebral bodies.
