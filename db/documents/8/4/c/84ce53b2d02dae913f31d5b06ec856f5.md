Given that the brachialis muscle is an important elbow flexor, it is clinically relevant. Impaired elbow flexion can result from several etiologies, including neurologic, neurovascular, muscle rupture, or traumatic causes. Generally, injury to the biceps brachii is more commonly the cause of elbow flexor trauma, although there is also documentation of isolated injuries to the brachialis muscle.

Additionally, there has been documented use of brachialis tendon transfer, specifically to reconstruct the flexor digitorum profundus and the flexor pollicis longus after brachial plexus injuries.

For a manual evaluation of the strength of the brachialis muscle, the operator puts his resistance on the patient's wrist while the latter holds the elbow extended and with the palm of the hand forward. The patient will have to flex the elbow without supination; in this way, we are evaluating the flexor muscle strongest at the elbow.
