Approximately 10% of cases of cryptogenic cirrhosis are discovered incidentally during evaluation of other issues such as possible gallbladder disease, and nearly 45% of patients only had complaints of vague symptoms such as fatigue or previously unexplained lab abnormalities.

Important history to obtain would entail a prior diagnosis of fatty liver disease, obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, exposure to blood or needles, family history of liver disease, personal or family history of autoimmune diseases, alcohol history, medication history such as methotrexate, and occupational history.

Patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis may present similarly to those with cirrhosis from other known etiologies and may have signs and symptoms that include jaundice, altered mental status, palmar erythema, spider angiomata, abdominal distention, weight loss, edema, varices, asterixis, and other cause-specific findings.
