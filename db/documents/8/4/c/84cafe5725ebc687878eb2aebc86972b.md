The main site of action is limited to the ascending limb of the nephron’s loop of Henle, which is responsible for sodium and chloride reabsorption. Normally, the ascending loop of Henle reabsorbs 25% to 30% of the tubular fluid’s sodium while remaining relatively impermeable to water (except in the presence of antidiuretic hormone, which allows water reabsorption through aquaporin channels). By inhibiting active sodium transport via inhibition of the Na-K-2Cl symporter, ethacrynic acid prevents the kidney from forming hypotonic urine. These ions retained in tubular fluid create an electrochemical gradient that prevents reabsorption of calcium and magnesium as well. In turn, this increases the osmotic force inside the renal tubule and prevents water from leaking into the renal interstitium. As a result, ethacrynic acid leads to increased natriuresis and diuresis.
