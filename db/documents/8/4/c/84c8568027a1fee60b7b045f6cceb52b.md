Sensory fibers are more prone to damage from nerve compression compared to motor fibers; thus, paresthesias and numbness and tingling are often the first signs of carpal tunnel syndrome. Motor fibers are affected as the severity of carpal tunnel syndrome progresses. Patients often have weakness in thumb abduction and opposition. Fine motor skills become affected; patients have difficulty dressing themselves or opening jars. As sensory fibers die, the pain gradually subsides; while motor fibers die, the muscles atrophy. Patients may also lose their ability to determine two-point differentiation between two objects, 6 mm apart.

Pillar pain is common with surgery, pain lateral to the site of surgical release.

Complications of surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome can include the following:

- Inadequate division of the transverse carpal ligament

- Injuries of the recurrent motor and palmar cutaneous branches of the median nerve

- Vascular injuries of the superficial palmar arch

- Lacerations of the median and ulnar trunk

- Postoperative wound infections

- Painful scar formation

- Complex regional pain syndrome
