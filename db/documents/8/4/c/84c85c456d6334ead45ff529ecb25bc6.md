An established prerequisite for developing this syndrome is the co-ingestion of large amounts of calcium and absorbable alkali. The mechanism of the development of hypercalcemia remains unclear. Increased absorption of calcium from the small intestine, an effect strongly influenced by calcitriol levels, plays an important role. In addition, increased intake of vitamin D may contribute to the development or worsening of the condition.

Hypercalcemia has various effects on the kidney, eventually resulting in hypovolemia. It decreases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by causing vasoconstriction and natriuresis by indirectly inhibiting the Na-K-2Cl channels in the medullary thick ascending limb of the nephron.Â It also decreases water reabsorption by inhibiting the antidiuretic hormone receptors (V2 receptors) in the basolateral membrane of collecting tubules in the kidney.

The resultant hypovolemia contributes to the development of alkalosis by increasing bicarbonate reabsorption.

Certain factors worsen the situation further by increasing calcium levels or causing hypovolemia. These include taking drugs such as thiazide diuretics that decrease calcium excretion and cause natriuresis and vitamin D, increasing calcium absorption from the gut. Older individuals are at a higher risk of developing hypercalcemia and subsequent alkalosis following the intake of calcium supplements due to decreased bone buffering of the excess calcium.
