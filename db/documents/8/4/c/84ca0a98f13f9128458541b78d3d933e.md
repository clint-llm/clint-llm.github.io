Histologic changes account for the altered appearance of the external ear noted after an auricular hematoma. The cartilage of the ear is usually composed of elastic cartilage. Secondary to trauma, the normal cartilage structure of the ear changes. Two weeks after the auricular hematoma develops, cartilage formation occurs on either side of the hematoma. By three weeks, the hematoma is replaced by soft tissue. By eight weeks post trauma, the soft tissue is replaced by cartilage. By fourteen weeks, bony formation, calcification, and further cartilage growth occur.[7]
