Korsakoff syndrome is, for the most part, a clinical diagnosis. It should be diagnosed when the signs and symptoms described above are present in a patient with risk factors for thiamine deficiency. Thiamine blood tests often take days to result and should not delay empiric treatment. Regarding neuroimaging, CT and MRI of the brain are not often indicated for emergent diagnosis of Korsakoff syndrome, although they may be warranted to rule out other causes of the patientâ€™s symptoms. Non-emergent MRI can reveal specific findings of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome including changes in the mamillary bodies, thalami, tectal plate, and periaqueductal areas but sensitivity is only 53%.
