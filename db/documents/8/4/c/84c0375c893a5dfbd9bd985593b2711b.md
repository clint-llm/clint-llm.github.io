The retina is a layer of neurosensory tissue in the eye that converts light into neural signals that the brain interprets as images. The macula is the part of the retina with the highest concentration of cones, which are essential for central vision.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drives the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), where new vessels grow under or through the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) via breaks in the Bruch membrane.
