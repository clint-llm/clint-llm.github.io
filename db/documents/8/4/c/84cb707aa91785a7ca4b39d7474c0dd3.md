Common causes of SI joint injury include pregnancy, traumas such as hip fractures, hypermobility, hypomobility, leg length discrepancies, obesity, and surgeries such as lumbar fusion. The differential diagnosis of sacroiliac joint injury includes synovitis, capsulitis, and enthesitis, infection, piriformis syndrome. Osteitis condensins ilii, and malignancies such as multiple myeloma are also a part of the differential. Functional causes can occur with scoliosis or short legs. Posterior sacral ligaments tears can cause pain in SI joint injury.

Furthermore, hip osteoarthritis should be considered in addition to SI joint osteoarthritis for low back pain and pelvic pain.
