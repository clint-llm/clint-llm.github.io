Meperidine, also known as pethidine, is in the class of phenylpiperidine as a hydrochloride salt synthetic form of the opioid, which is a white crystalline with a melting point of 186 degrees C. This medication has calcium sulfate, dibasic calcium phosphate, starch, stearic acid, and talc as inactive ingredients. Clinicians use meperidine is used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It has intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous injection, syrup, and tablet forms. In the 20th century, it was the drug of choice amongst the opioids in the management of acute pain by most of the physicians and the management of some patients with chronic pain. Meperidine is also being used as an adjunct to preoperative medications to reduce shivering.

Meperidine appeared to be safer with a lower risk of addiction when compared to other opioids and because of the anticholinergic effects associated with less biliary spasm or renal colic. However, it appears that risks of addiction, biliary spasm, and renal colic are equal to other opioids. Additionally, due to its toxic metabolite is known as normeperidine, which has serotonergic properties, it correlates with an increased risk of serotonin syndrome and seizure. These issues have led to the removal of meperidine from the World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines, the list of most effective and safe medicines in the health system in 2003.
