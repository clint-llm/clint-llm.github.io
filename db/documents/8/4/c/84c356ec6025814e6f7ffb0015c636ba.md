The World Health Organization (WHO) promotes national policies and invests in diarrhea treatment and control in developing countries. In developed countries, this takes place through local and federal health care agencies. Such organizations have a paramount role in educating the general population and populations at risk. They will help train health care providers and develop region-specific programs to curb the spread of bacterial diarrhea.
