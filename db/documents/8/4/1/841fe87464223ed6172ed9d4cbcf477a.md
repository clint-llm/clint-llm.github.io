The pathophysiology is not fully understood. A neurotic temperament or pre-existing anxiety may predispose individuals. Following a vestibular insult, medical event, and/or acute psychological distress, it is postulated that a patient's dependence on visual-somatosensory cues, environmental vigilance, and changes in posture occurs. This is exacerbated in individuals with high anxiety and body vigilance, as they further focus on their surroundings and pay closer attention to their posture to compensate for the perceived dizziness.
