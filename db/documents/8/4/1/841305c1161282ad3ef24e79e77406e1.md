Ultrasound, mammogram, and MRI may be necessary for evaluating rupture concerns as well as implant displacement mentioned prior to physical exam for gel implants. Saline implant failure isÂ obvious as one mound will become noticeably smaller. If in doubt, have the patient use a molded cup bra that does not stretch and examine her mounds weekly or monthly in the molded cup bra. If there is a leak of any kind, space in the cup will increase as the implant volume diminished from a failing saline implant.
