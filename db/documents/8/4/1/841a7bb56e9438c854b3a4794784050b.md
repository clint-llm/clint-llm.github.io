Hyponatremia is defined as serum sodium below 136 mEq/L. In response to decreased serum tonicity, extracellular water will shift into cells where there is higher tonicity via the process of osmosis, in an attempt to normalize the gradient, thereby causing cerebral edema.

The brain is able to adapt to a decrease in serum tonicity by several proposed mechanisms. One protective mechanism is through the displacement of water from the cells into the cerebrospinal fluid. Another mechanism called volume regulatory decrease includes the removal of intracellular solutes and water via ion channels to reduce brain swelling and normalize brain volume. With chronic hyponatremia (greater than 48 hours in duration), other adaptive mechanisms include the efflux of organic osmolytes (glutamate, taurine, and glycine) with water, which also reduces cellular swelling.

With the rapid correction of hyponatremia, the brain is unable to recapture lost osmolytes, leading to dehydration of brain tissue and demyelination of white matter. The main cells affected in the brain are the astrocytes. Recent studies in rat models that show that astrocyte apoptosis is preceded by myelin loss and was observed within 48-72 hours after the correction of hyponatremia.
