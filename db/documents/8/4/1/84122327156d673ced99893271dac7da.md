Macroscopically, atrial myxomas are often pedunculated and soft in texture. The myxoma diameter varies from 1 to 15 cm with a weight of between 15 and 180 g. The tumor can present with a smooth, villous, or friable surface. The villous and friable myxomas tend to be associated with embolic events, while the smooth myxomas are usually large and present more with an obstructive picture.
