Doppler at the stenotic region demonstrates increased velocity with the characteristic "diastolic runoff pattern." Additionally, transthoracic echocardiography provides assessment for other accompanying congenital heart abnormalities, including ventricular septal defect, bicuspid aortic valve, mitral valve abnormalities, and left ventricular hypoplasia.
