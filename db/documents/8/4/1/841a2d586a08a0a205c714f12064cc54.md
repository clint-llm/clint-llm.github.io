Skin lesions of pityriasis rotunda have a chronic course and can persist for months to years, with alternating periods of exacerbation (especially during winter or pregnancy) and remission.

Follow-up of pityriasis rotunda skin lesions without treatment is the other option because of possible spontaneous resolution. Since underlying diseases, mainly malignancies, have been associated with pityriasis rotunda, physicians should be aware of the importance to rule out such diseases based on anamnesis, physical examination, and the appropriate investigations.
