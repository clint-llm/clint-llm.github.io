Patients with angiodysplasia may be asymptomatic or present with mild to moderate occult lower GI bleeding without abdominal pain. History should include all the same elements as it would in the evaluation of upper and lower GI bleeding. Patients may present with occult blood in stool and iron deficiency anemia. Physical examination in a hemodynamic patient may show symptoms and signs of anemia. A systolic ejection murmur during the cardiac examination may raise suspicion for underlying aortic stenosis. Angiodysplasia lesions may be found incidentally in endoscopy for other reasons. Orthostasis or hypotension may rarely occur in acute and heavy bleeding. Although bleeding stops spontaneously in most patients, it may recur. Angiodysplasia-related GI bleeding can happen anywhere in the GI tract but more frequently seen in the cecum, rectosigmoid area, the rest of the colon, small intestine, and stomach in descending order.
