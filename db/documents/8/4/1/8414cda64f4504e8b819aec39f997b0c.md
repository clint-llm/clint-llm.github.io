Patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection usually present with symptoms and signs characteristic of acute myocardial infarction (MI). Chest or shoulder pain, syncope, dyspnea, diaphoresis, and nausea associated with elevation of cardiac enzymes are the most common presentation. A small proportion (3% to 14%) of patients present with resuscitated ventricular arrhythmias. Some cases present as sudden unexplained death, although, because of the challenges of accurate post-mortem diagnosis, this condition is under-represented in most cases.

A high index of clinical suspicion is required for women presenting with typical chest pain and ECG or cardiac biomarker abnormalities.
