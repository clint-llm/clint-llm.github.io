Although the exact etiology remains debated, the consensus favors multiple genetic and environmental risk factors that play varying levels of contributing roles in its clinical manifestations.

Environmental factors such as maternal smoking and maternal diabetes have the strongest association with clubfoot.

Genetics likely has a role to play, although a specific gene alteration remains unclear. Research shows that 24.4% of cases have an associated family history, though it has not identified a definite mode of inheritance.

- DistalÂ arthrogryposis

- Congenital myotonic dystrophy

- Myelomeningocele

- Amniotic band sequence

- Any other associated genetic syndrome

- Trisomy 18
- Chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome

Approximately 7% of clubfoot cases will have another anomaly at birth, and 7.6% will have a neurodevelopmental condition of some degree.
