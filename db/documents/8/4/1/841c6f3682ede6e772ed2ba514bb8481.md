The common adverse effects associated with midazolam use are hiccoughs, cough, nausea, and vomiting. Thrombophlebitis, thrombosis, and pain on injection are other adverse effects. The incidence of thrombophlebitis is less than with diazepam but similar to that of thiopental. Midazolam causes anterograde amnesia, drowsiness, ataxia, falls, and confusion in the elderly. Residual hangover effect can happen with nighttime administration of midazolam, which can impair the cognitive and psychomotor abilities, which can result in falls in elderly and impaired coordination during driving. Hypotension and tachycardia can occur with rapid intravenous administration. A higher dose can result in midazolam infusion syndrome and respiratory depression. Instances of midazolam infusion syndrome require continuous ventilator support. Paradoxical effects of midazolam are possible in individuals with a history of alcohol abuse and aggressive behavior, potentially leading to involuntary movements, verbalization, uncontrollable crying, and aggressive behavior. Respiratory depression can happen with a dose of 0.15 mg/kg, and the risk increases when used along with fentanyl. Concomitant use of midazolam with other CNS depressants can result in severe respiratory depression and death even at therapeutic doses.

Long-term use of midazolam is associated with lasting memory deficits, which are only partially reversible after discontinuing the drug. For pregnant women, the administration of the drug in the third trimester causes benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate resulting in hypotonia, cyanosis, and apnoeic spells. Neonates may suffer from diarrhea, tremors, and hyperexcitability. About one-third of individuals receiving midazolam can suffer from tolerance after using the drug for four weeks. Withdrawal syndrome can occur if the dose tapers too rapidly. Symptoms due to the withdrawal of benzodiazepine include irritability, clonus, hypertonicity, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, and hypertension. Sudden discontinuation of midazolam can result in status epilepticus.
