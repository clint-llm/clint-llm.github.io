Imaging is critical in determining the severity of disease and subsequent treatment. Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs are necessary. Increased talonavicular uncoverage and increased talo-first metatarsal angle (or Simmons angle) will present on the AP foot radiograph. The normal talo-first metatarsal angle is around 7 degrees, and angles over 16 degrees indicate flatfoot deformity.
