During the course of the disease, mediastinal gem cell tumors can metastasize into surrounding structures. Common sites of metastasis are adjacent structures, including bone, lungs, liver, and thoracic lymph nodes. During treatment, chemotherapy-associated complications can arise. In addition, post-surgical complications such as the development of pyothorax, phrenic nerve injury, and excessive blood loss can alsoÂ be noted as possible complications in managing mediastinal germ cell tumors.
