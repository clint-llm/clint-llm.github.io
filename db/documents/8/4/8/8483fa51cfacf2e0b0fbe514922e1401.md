Blepharoplasty refers to the aesthetic or functional surgical manipulation of the upper or lower eyelids. Upper and lower lid blepharoplasty both have their own set of indications and may be undertaken during the same procedure or at different times. Understanding the anatomy of the upper and lower eyelids is key to the identification of deformities that may be amenable to surgical correction while also preventing unwanted complications from these same surgical procedures.
