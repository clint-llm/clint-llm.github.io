Tricyclic antidepressants impose their therapeutic effects by inhibiting presynaptic reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in the central nervous system (CNS). This effect in the CNS can cause seizures. TCAs are weakly basic, and an acidic environment facilitates the formation of the ionized form and potentiates this effect. In cases of toxicity, TCAs block a number of receptors, including peripheral alpha-adrenergic, histaminic, muscarinic, and central serotonin receptors. Blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors can cause hypotension. Blockade of muscarinic receptors can cause signs of anticholinergic toxicity, such as tachycardia, fever, dry mouth and skin, decreased bowel sounds, and altered mental status. Blockade of histamine receptors can also cause altered mental status. TCAs can cause cardiac toxicity. Blockade of fast sodium channels in myocardial cells slows the action potential and provides a membrane stabilizing effect. The characteristic QRS prolongation seen in TCA overdose occurs secondary to prolongation of phase “0” of the myocardial action potential. This effect can lead to heart block and bradycardia. QT prolongation seen in cases of TCA overdose occurs due to potassium channel blockade that may potentially cause torsades de pointes. TCAs can also exert a quinidine-like toxic effect on the myocardium that can cause decreased cardiac contractility and hypotension.
