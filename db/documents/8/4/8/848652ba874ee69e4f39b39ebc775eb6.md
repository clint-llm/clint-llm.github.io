Preparation should be involved prior to suctioning the airway. Suctioning should only be started only after all supplies and necessary personnel are gathered and consent is obtained.

Preoxygenation with 100% oxygen should be initiated prior to suctioning. This is in preparation for the hypoxia that is precipitated by suctioning, both from mechanical interruption and cessation of oxygen flow briefly. Lubrication of the ends of the catheter with petroleum jelly is recommended if suctioning through the nose. The suction catheter should be introduced slowly down the nose and mouth. It is recommended to stop if there is increased resistance and reintroduce after a brief period of oxygenation and interruption. The catheter should be introduced to the desired depth, and then suctioning should be started. Brief, 10-second suction duration is usually recommended to avoid mucosal damage and prolonged hypoxia.

On withdrawing the catheter, slow spiral motions should be performed to minimize mucosal trauma. If there is a need for repeated suctioning, care should be taken to maintain and normalize vital signs in between suction episodes with special attention to the heart rate and oxygen saturation levels.

Suctioning via the ET tube is usually in two forms: open suction and closed suction. Many recent studies do not recommend the use of normal saline instillation prior to the suctioning episode. There are studies supporting the increased risk of hypoxia, bradycardia, and vagal stimulation/aspiration with normal saline used for suctioning.

Rarely patients may need to be sedated or given analgesia prior to suctioning their airways.

The adequacy of suctioning can be assessed by the clearance of secretions, improved breath sounds, improved air entry, good pulse oximetry readings, and improvement in respiratory distress in a patient.
