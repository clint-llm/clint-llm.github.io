Predisposing factors that increase RBD diathesis include elderly age, male sex, narcolepsy, antidepressant use, and neurological disorders. RBD can be divided into three categories:

- Idiopathic RBD

- Drug-induced RBD

- Secondary RBD due to medical condition

Idiopathic RBD is most suggestive in neurodegenerative synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, olivopontocerebellar degeneration, multiple-system atrophy, and Shy-Drager syndrome.

Drug-induced RBD is common in individuals who are taking antidepressants. The most likely antidepressants that will incite an RBD episode are serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine), tricyclic antidepressants (mirtazapine, protriptyline, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine, imipramine), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (phenelzine and selegiline).

RBD with concomitant narcolepsy may be considered a distinct phenotype of RBD. It is characterized by less violent or complex behavior during REM sleep, earlier age of onset, equal sex distribution, and hypocretin (orexin) deficiency (a lab diagnosis specific for narcolepsy type 1).
