Infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have a multitude of long term complications that persist beyond the period of infancy. Respiratory complications include chronic lung disease, home oxygen requirement, aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary hypertension, and obstructive airway disease. Gastrointestinal complications such as oral feeding aversion, gastroesophageal reflux, and growth failure are common. Neurocognitive delays, behavioral disorders, sensorineural hearing loss are also noted. Hernia recurrence is another risk that can present months to years later, especially in infants with large defects. Orthopedic deformities such as pectus, asymmetry of the chest wall, scoliosis have also been described in a significant number of infants post CDH repair.
