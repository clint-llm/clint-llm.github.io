The precise mechanism of action exhibited by phenothiazines is not entirely known. Yet, phenothiazines act primarily through inhibiting the dopamine receptor at the mesolimbic pathway with a selective activity at the D2 receptor. This inhibition antagonizes the hyperactivity of dopamine at the synapse and reduces positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations associated with schizophrenia.
