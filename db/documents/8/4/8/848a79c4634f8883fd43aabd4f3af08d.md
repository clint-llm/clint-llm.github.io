Pityriasis versicolor has been reported worldwide, but it is more common in warm and humid conditions. The prevalence is as high as 50% in tropical countries and as low as 1.1% in cold climates such as Sweden. Pityriasis versicolor occurs more frequently in adolescents and young adults probably due to the increase of sebum production by the sebaceous glands which allow for a more lipid-rich environment in which Malassezia can grow. Pityriasis versicolor affects men and women equally and no specific ethnic predominance has been noted.
