The diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis requires aÂ high index of suspicion, given that the classic clinical symptoms may not be present.

Although myoglobin is the first enzyme to be elevated in rhabdomyolysis, levels often return to normal within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms.

Though myoglobinuria is pathognomonic for rhabdomyolysis, it is important to note that rhabdomyoglobinuria is not always present or visible.****

Urinalysis should be employed to evaluate for myoglobinuria and assess the presence or severity of renal damage or acute kidney injury.

A thorough history and physical examination are critical to diagnosing rhabdomyolysis, though they are not always helpful in determining the underlying cause.

Though imaging is not generally indicated in cases of rhabdomyolysis, given that it is a clinical syndrome often diagnosed with supportive laboratory tests, MRI, bone scintigraphy, ultrasound, or CT can be used to demonstrate some changes in muscle tissue.
