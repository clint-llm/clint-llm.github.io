The enzyme G6Pase is primarily expressed in the liver, kidney, and intestine. It has its active site on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Glucose-6-phosphate translocase is responsible for translocating Glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) from the cytoplasm into the ER lumen. The complex of G6Pase and G6PT catalyzes the final step of both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis for glucose production. Deficiency of either causes an accumulation of glycogen and fat in the liver, kidney, and intestinal mucosa.
