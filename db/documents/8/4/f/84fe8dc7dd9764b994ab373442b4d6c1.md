Recurrent migraines are often functionally disabling and can impair quality of life. Prophylactic therapy may decrease the frequency, severity, and duration of migraine attacks, increase responsiveness to acute migraine therapy and improve quality of life. Migraines are different from other headaches by the following attributes:

- Lasting 4 to 72 hours

- Unilateral location

- Pulsating quality

- Moderate to severe intensity

- Aggravated by physical activity

- Associations with nausea, vomiting, phonophobia, or photophobia

Migraine headaches may have an aural phase before the onset of the headache.
