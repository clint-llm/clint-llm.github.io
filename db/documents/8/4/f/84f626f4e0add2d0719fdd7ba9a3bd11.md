Age and gender do not predict who will suffer from opioid-induced endocrinopathy, as much as the duration of opioid use itself will. Patients with OIE will typically present with generalized complaints of fatigue, depression, sleep disturbance, immune suppression, hyperalgesia, weight gain, decreased libido, infertility, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, anemia, osteoporosis, and other related symptoms.

Obtaining a detailed drug history is essentialÂ as polypharmacy may contribute or mask a patient's symptoms. It is important to obtain an accurate understanding of a patient's medical history and detailed symptomology in order to help rule out other medical conditions and diseases on the differential diagnosis. Illicit substance use, depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol use disorder, over the counter and herbal medication use, domestic abuse, nutrition and dietary habits, possible causes of anemia, and possible causes of osteoporosis, should be considered when developing a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with symptoms possibly related to OIE.

On examination, possible findings may include depressed psychomotor tone, mood lability, pallor, primary hypogonadism.
