Staging of invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast is established clinically by imaging studies and physical examination before treatment and is determined pathologically based on histopathological examination of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes after surgery.

The most commonly used clinical staging system for invasive lobular breast carcinoma is the one adopted by the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union for Cancer Control.

Its basis is the TNM system (T, tumor; N, nodes; M, metastases). T, N, and M are compound to make five stages (stage 0, I, II, III, and IV) that reveal information about the extent of the regional neoplasm (tumor size, nodal involvement, chest-wall invasion, or skin involvement) and metastasis to distant sites.
