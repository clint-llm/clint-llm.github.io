It is now clear that HBO therapy does have detrimental effects on the eye. However, this appears to be true after repeated sessions and there is little evidence to show that a single session can cause glaucoma or cataracts. Nevertheless, patients who undergo repeated HBO treatments need to follow up with an ophthalmic nurse, ophthalmologistÂ  and the internist to assess for eye symptoms. The preventable risk factors for eye disease should be minimized and the patient encouraged to eat healthy, wear sunglasses when going outdoors and avoid smoking. Healthcare workers should not empirically prescribe HBO treatment without a valid reason.
