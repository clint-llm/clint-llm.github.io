Children who are suspected of having Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia should be referred to a pediatric center that specializes in cancer for evaluation and treatment.

For children with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, induction therapy consists of anthracycline, vincristine, 1-asparaginase, and a corticosteroid.

Today consolidation therapy is widely used and include therapy with a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs with good results.

Maintenance therapy utilizes oral 6-mercaptopurine or methotrexate delivered once weekly or once monthly.  Successful treatment of children with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia involves administration of a multidrug regimen that is divided into several phases (i.e., induction, consolidation, and maintenance) and includes therapy directed to the central nervous system (CNS).

Most treatment protocols take two to three years to complete.

CNS prophylaxis is done via an intrathecal approach. Patients often require 8-16 intrathecal treatments.

If the patient has Ph-chromosome positive ALL, the current treatment includes the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib or ponatinib. Several trials have shown a good response to these agents.

Stem cell transplantation can sometimes be used as a treatment in which patient's normal source of blood cells (bone marrow) is replaced by healthy young blood cells (stem cells) from a healthy well-matched donor. However, with improvements in chemotherapy, the role of transplantation is declining in ALL.

Recently CAR-T cell therapy has been investigated in ALL with excellent results. Several studies show high rates of remission. Unfortunately, CART is also associated with serious toxicity that includes cerebral edema and cytokine release syndrome, which can be fatal.

All blood products must be irradiated prior to transfusion to prevent transfusion-related graft versus host disease, which is universally fatal.

Splenectomy is rarely required for Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia. Splenectomy can help boost platelet count but does not affect the outcome of leukemia itself. Splenectomy can be performed for severe symptoms that are not amenable to chemotherapy treatment such as abdominal pain. Radiation can also be used in cases of the enlarged spleen to try and reduce the size of the spleen in most cases.

Tumor lysis syndrome is a life-threatening complication that occurs in patients receiving chemotherapy. It is characterized by hyperuricemia, elevated potassium and phosphate and decreased levels of calcium. Renal failure is invariably present.
