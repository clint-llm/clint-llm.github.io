There are numerous ways in which to provide anesthesia to patients that are in pain so that they may obtain relief. Aside from the management of pain, this anesthesia will also allow the clinician to perform procedures effectively and prevent further discomfort to the patient. A method of providing this anesthesia resides in the form of targeting tissues or a peripheral nerve itself, both of which propagate signals of pain from tissues to the brain and brainstem.

Adequate anesthesia may be accomplished by the local infiltration of an anesthetic directly into a tissue, or in a targeted manner such as a nerve block. Local infiltration of an anesthetic agent allows for the repair of simple injuries to a given anatomic location, but its use is limited in those who have suffered injuries to a larger surface area or have multiple separated injuries. Additionally, local infiltration of a wound may distort the area of repair. In such cases, a nerve block is an option to provide a larger region of anesthesia with a smaller relative amount of anesthetic.
