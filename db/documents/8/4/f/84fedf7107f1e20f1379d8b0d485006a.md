Hypospadias is the second most common congenital disorder in males after cryptorchidism, but it is the most common penile congenital malformation.

The incidence of hypospadias in the US has been reported to be one out of every 250 males (0.4%) while in Denmark the estimated prevalence is 0.5% to 0.8%. A South American study estimated the global prevalence at 11.3 of 10,000 newborns (less than 0.1%).
