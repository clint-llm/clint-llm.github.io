Kienböck disease refers to avascular necrosis of the lunate carpal bone, known as lunatomalacia. It was first recognized and described by Austrian radiologist Robert Kienböck in 1910.

**Relevant anatomy:**The proximal carpal row of the mid-carpal joint is largely responsible for wrist motion, as opposed to the relatively fixed distal carpal row. The lunate is the central bone in the proximal row, and it articulates with the scaphoid, capitate, triquetrum, and occasionally the hamate. More proximally, the lunate is a component of the radiocarpal joint, and it also articulates with the ulna via the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). Of note, nearly 10% of the axial-radial/ulnar/carpal load is transmitted through the TFCC and subsequently to the ulna, and 35% through the radiolunate articulation.
