Patients should be counseled according to the severity of the disease. In the case of mild floaters, the patient should be assured that in most cases, these floaters settle on their own and become less noticeable. Patients should be given hand-written instructions emphasizing the need to re-consult if new symptoms like a sudden increase in floaters/flashes, vision loss, and peripheral loss of vision appear.
