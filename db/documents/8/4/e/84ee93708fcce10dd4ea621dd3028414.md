Bartter syndrome is difficult to recognize. Untreated cases are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, as such the healthcare team including nurses, nephrology nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and physicians must work together to identify and manage the treatment. The pharmacist should evaluate medication choice,  drug-drug interactions, and compliance. The nurse should assist with the coordination of care in the interprofessional team and patient education.

The team should be aware Bartter-like syndrome is associated with aminoglycoside and can be seen for 2 to 6 weeks after termination of antibiotics. This requires the team to monitor the patient closing and provide prompt replacement of potassium, calcium, and magnesium as needed.
