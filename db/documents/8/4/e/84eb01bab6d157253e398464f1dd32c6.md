The decision to continue with operative vaginal delivery should continuously be re-evaluated during the delivery progresses. If there is no descent, further attempts should be discontinued and cesarean section considered.

Rocking motions and applying torque to achieve rotation should be avoided.

The maximum time to safely complete a vacuum extraction and the acceptable number of detachments are unknown. It is recommended that vacuum-assisted deliveries be achieved with no more than three sets of pulls and a maximum of two to three cup detachments or pop-offs. The total vacuum application time should be limited to 20 to 30 minutes.

Sequential application of the vacuum and the forceps or vice versa is discouraged due to a higher risk of fetal and maternal injury.

**Advantages of Vacuum Extraction and Forceps**

**Vacuum Extractors**

- Easy to learn

- Quick delivery

- Less neonatal craniofacial injury

- Less maternal discomfort

- Less maternal genital trauma

- Less anesthesia required

**Forceps**

- Fewer neonatal injuries (cephalohematoma, retinal hemorrhage, and transient lateral rectus palsy)

- Higher rate of successful delivery vaginally
