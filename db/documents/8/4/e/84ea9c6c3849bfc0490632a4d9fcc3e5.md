With the advances in medicine, both in molecular and genetic testing, the incidence of the disease is rising. It is now thought to be anywhere between 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 100,000 births, though the prevalence is largely unknown. It is thought that of all the cases of cholestasis observed in the pediatric population, nearly 10-15% are due to PFIC. In addition to this, approximately 10% of liver transplants in children are a result of this genetic condition. There does not seem to be a documented difference between males and females. Although a condition often diagnosed in children, it can go undiagnosed until adulthood.
