An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach is needed for a patient with chronic liver disease to achieve the best possible outcomes. The earlier signs and symptoms of a complication are identified, the better is the prognosis and outcome. The team consists of primary care physicians, gastroenterologists/hepatologists, dieticians as needed, and a social worker and community nurses who can monitor the patient and make referrals as necessary to prevent the development of complications. Routine labs and endoscopy and the ultrasound as appropriate are required. The liver transplant team should closely monitor patients who are transplant candidates.
