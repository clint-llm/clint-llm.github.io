After the introduction of the vaccine, the incidence of the disease has rapidly decreased. Before 1920, in the United States, there were approximately 200,000 cases of the disease annually. But after the immunization program, the number has rapidly declined, and now about 1000 cases are being reported annually. The majority of the cases are seen in those with low socioeconomic status, living in overcrowded conditions, lack of immunizations, travel history from endemic regions, and comorbid conditions. These numbers, however, are higher in certain parts of the world like South-east Asia and Africa.

In terms of mortality in the United States, the number has decreased from 100 to 200 cases to 0.001 cases per 100,000 population after the introduction of vaccinations. There is no racial and sexual predilection of the disease. Diphtheria is considered to be the disease of childhood, mainly affecting the children of age group below 12; however, people around 40 and those with comorbid conditions are at risk of getting infected. As the immunity against the bacteria gradually wanes off, the likelihood of being infected increases if the individual is not up to date with immunizations with the booster doses.
