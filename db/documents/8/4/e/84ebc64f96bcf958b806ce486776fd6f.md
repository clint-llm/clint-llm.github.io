Anthraquinones laxatives work in three ways:

- It stimulates the active transport of chloride into the gut, which in turnÂ causes an osmotic gradient and pulls water into the gut lumen.

- It inhibits Na-K ATPase on the enterocytes, which further inhibits the reabsorption of water, sodium, and potassium, ultimately excreting it into the feces.

- It stimulates local prostaglandins, which stimulate peristalsis and decreases transit time through the bowel.

The adverse effects of Senna and other stimulant laxatives include hypovolemia, leading to dizziness, palpitation, and syncope; miscarriages in women; and decreased absorption of oral medications due to uptake inhibition.
