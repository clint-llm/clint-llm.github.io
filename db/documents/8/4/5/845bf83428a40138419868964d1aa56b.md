The superior tarsal muscle has specific physiologic variants when comparing different individuals, and these center around the attachment of the muscle to the superior tarsal plate. Four variations exist, and they are below:

- The superior tarsal muscle attaching to the upper border of the superior tarsal plate

- 2M: The superior tarsal muscle attaches to the medial aspect of the plate
- 2L: The superior tarsal muscle attaching to the lateral aspect of the plate

- The superior tarsal muscle attaches along the whole extent of the superior tarsal plate.

The third variation was the most frequently observed variation.
