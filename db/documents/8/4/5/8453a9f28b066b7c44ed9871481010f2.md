Hot flashes are sudden-onset, spontaneous, and episodic sensations of warmth usually felt on the chest, neck, and face immediately followed by an outbreak of sweating. They are the most common reason women seek medical care during the perimenopausal period, especially if the symptoms impair their quality of life. The onset of hot flashes can be associated with perspiration, heart palpitations, headache, weakness, fatigue, faintness, and anxiety, and they can be triggered by warm environments, hot drinks, or emotional stress. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of hot flashes and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.
