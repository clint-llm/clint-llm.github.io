The management of hypertriglyceridemia is by an interprofessional team that includes an endocrinologist, gastroenterologist, internist, primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and a cardiologist. Besides pharmacological therapy, the key is to educate the patient on changes in lifestyle and addressing the secondary causes.

Lifestyle changes include dietary changes such as reduction of carbohydrate intake, avoidance of sugar-sweetened beverages, and processed carbohydrates, regular exercise, and weight loss. Weight loss of 5% to 10% is associated with a reduction of triglyceride levels. Similarly, regular aerobic exercise can reduce triglycerides. The amount of decrease in triglycerides due to exercise and dietary modifications is usually variable.

In addition to pharmacotherapy and lifestyle modification, addressing the secondary contributors is important. Alcohol cessation and tighter glycemic control in diabetes are effective strategies to control secondary contributors. The primary goal of reduction of triglyceride levels in patients (with triglycerides of more than 500 mg/dL) is to decrease the risk of pancreatitis. When the triglycerides are moderately elevated (200 mg/dL to 500 mg/dL), the goal should be to prevent cardiovascular events and disease. Reducing non-HDL cholesterol levels down to 30 mg/dL above the LDL goal helps in cardiovascular risk reduction.
