The management of Toxocara is complicated as it is more than human disease and requires a One Health approach. Domestic animal carrier rates directly impact the risk of acquisition, vertical transmission is common in dogs and cats, and no vaccine exists. Thus, interprofessional collaboration is necessary for adequate control. The first challenge is increasing awareness.Â Toxocara is considered a neglected tropical infection, given the minimal level of research, funding, and publicity it receives despite carrying a significant disease burden. The role of the primary caregiver and nurse practitioner is invaluable in educating patients on preventing this parasitic infection.
