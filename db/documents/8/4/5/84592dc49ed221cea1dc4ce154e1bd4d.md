**Absolute Contraindications**

- In patients taking nitrates or nitroglycerin, concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors leads to excessive preload reduction. This phenomenon is common in patients using long-acting nitrates like isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, and transdermal nitroglycerin patches as prophylaxis for chronic angina concomitantly initiating PDE5 inhibitors. American College of Cardiology recommends patients taking PDE5Is to wait for at least 1 to 2 days after the last PDE5I dose before administering nitrates.

- Vardenafil is known to cause minor QT prolongation and is, therefore, contraindicated in patients taking type 1A, type 3 antiarrhythmics, and patients with congenital prolonged QT syndrome.

**Caution is Necessary for Patients with the Following Relative Contraindications**

- History of MI, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia in the past six months

- Resting hypotension or hypertension

- History of heart failure or unstable angina

- Concomitant administration of alpha-blockers
