The approach to the uveitis patient must be comprehensive. The importance of a careful, complete history, including family, social, travel, and medication histories and review of systems cannot be overemphasized.  It is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an ophthalmologist, neurologist, neonatologist, obstetrician, infectious disease expert, internist, infectious disease pharmacist, and specialty-trained ophthalmology nurse. Immunosuppressed patients usually need long term treatment and follow up. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner should educate the patient on preventive measures. Early detection and treatment are necessary to prevent vision-threatening complications.

The clinician or specialist will initiate treatment, and agent selection should receive a consult with a board-certified infectious disease pharmacist with the latest antibiogram data; this will lead to targeted therapy and help prevent antibiotic resistance. The pharmacist can also advise on other medications used in management, and perform medication reconciliation. Nursing will work with the patient on counseling, followup, and monitor treatment effectiveness and check for potential adverse drug reactions, informing the clinicians of any concerns. This type of interprofessional approach is crucial to the successful treatment and management of chorioretinitis/uveitis. [Level V]
