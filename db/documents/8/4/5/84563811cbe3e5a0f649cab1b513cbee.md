Hair growth rate and hair density decrease with age. Hair loss, known as alopecia, is a common occurrence. It can be due to drugs, diet, hormone imbalances, altered mitotic activity, growth cycle abnormalities, among others. A thorough history, physical exam, hair pull test, daily hair counts, part width, clip tests to examine the hair shaft, hair growth windows, and hair pluck, and trichograms can all be used to diagnose hair disease. Scalp biopsies, hormone studies, and a potassium hydroxide examination for fungi may also need to be performed in certain cases. It is important to diagnose hair disease correctly, as the treatment for hair loss is dependent on the diagnosis.

Male pattern baldness, known as androgenetic alopecia, is a common condition in which hair loss occurs as men age. With increased dihydrotestosterone binding to the follicle of hair receptors, each successive anagen cycle shortens in length. In these individuals, follicles shrink and gradually produce shorter, thinner, more vellus-like hairs. Possible treatments may include slowing the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in men with this condition.
