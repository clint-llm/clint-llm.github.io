PSS is more commonly seen in younger patients (in their 20s and 30s) with a male to female ratio of 2:1. Often these patients will not have any other significant medical comorbidities. The incidence ranges from 1 to 2 per 100,000 individuals per year in various studies. It is more commonly encountered on the right side. Venous TOS is less common than neurogenic TOS but more common than arterial TOS. Often affected individuals with PSS will be athletes, specifically, those engaged in the repetitive over-the-head motion of their arms, including baseball or softball pitchers, swimmers, rowers, or weightlifters.
