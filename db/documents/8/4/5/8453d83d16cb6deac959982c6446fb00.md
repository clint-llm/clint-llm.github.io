Bile duct injury is a complex and challenging problem for the surgeon. It frequently requires expertise from the endoscopist, gastroenterologists, and interventional radiologists. In more complicated cases hepatobiliary or even transplant surgeons may need to intervene. Infectious disease physicians will need to provide input in the patient presenting with uncontrolled sepsis. Intensivists play a vital role in the management of these patients in the immediate postoperative period after complex reconstructions or for patients presenting with severe sepsis and multiorgan failure.
