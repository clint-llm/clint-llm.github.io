Patients who note episodes of dizziness, syncope, nausea, loss of balance, and other neurological symptoms accompanying rotation of the head should be evaluated for rotational vertebral artery syndrome by a medical professional as symptoms are nonspecific and could indicate numerous different pathologies. For patients diagnosed with bow hunter syndrome, they can usually be managed non-operatively with neck immobilization and anticoagulation. Still, they should undergo careful monitoring under the supervision of a medical specialist.
