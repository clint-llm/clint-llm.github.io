Patients with CD may be asymptomatic or report blurriness of vision.

Slit-lamp (biomicroscopy) examination findings are usually the first step in differentiating the different types of corneal dystrophies. Symptoms often group among the dystrophies based on anatomic location. An overview of typical symptoms and biomicroscopic findings are presented below, organized by anatomical classification. A more detailed description of these findings will be mentioned in other StatPearls articles on each separate dystrophy. The symptoms and findings are:

**Epithelial and subepithelial dystrophies**: Patients will usually suffer from recurrent corneal erosions with these dystrophies, with different degrees of severity. History and biomicroscopy findings are as follows:

**EB****M****CD**: This CD presents with irregular, gray, map-like patches or intraepithelial (Cogan) microcysts.

**Meesmann CD**: While MECD typically presents asymptomatically, or with mild symptoms of visual acuity loss and eye irritation, it can progress to painful erosions due to foreign body sensation, and potentially be severe enough to cause significant subepithelial fibrosis and vision loss.

**ERED****:**The recurrent erosions start in the first decade, and episodes can be severe and last for up to a week.

**Subepithelial Mucinous CD****:**Similar to ERED, SMCD may present with subepithelial opacifications, with most of the findings in the center of the cornea.

**Lisch Epithelial CD****:**presents with gray whorled to band or club-shaped densities, even feather-shaped (see figure 2).

**Gelatinous Drop-Like Dystrophy****:**GDLD starts with a presentation similar to band keratopathy, but it progresses to mulberry-like subepithelial nodules that grow in size over time (see figure 2).

**Epithelial-Stromal Dystrophies**: Not only will patients have corneal erosions, but visual acuity loss and photophobia may occur as well, due to stromal involvement.

**Lattice CD**: On biomicroscopy, LCD presents with linear/branching opacities, forming a ropy lattice structure (see figure 3).

**Granular CD**: If patients are symptomatic, corneal erosions starting in the first decade are likely to be seen. Visual imparity usually presents in the 5th decade of life. Biomicroscopy will present with crumb or flake-like opacities, with the spaces between the opacities clear of deposits (see figure 3).

**Reis-Bücklers CD:**This dystrophy can present in childhood with geographic, map-like findings similar to EMBCD (see figure 4).

**Thiel-Behnke CD****:**The patient will present with symptoms like RBCD; however, they tend to be milder in TBCB, with visual impairment beginning later in life, and erosions starting in the first or second decade.

**Stromal Dystrophies**: Corneal haze is often noted in these dystrophies, which affects visual acuity in most patients.

**M****acular****CD**: MCD presents with corneal haze and grainy, ground glass-like opacities, made of glycosaminoglycans. (see figure 4).

**Schnyder CD**: Early findings by the second decade involve central crystalline subepithelial deposits with a stromal haze that progresses to a ring-like structure.

**Congenital Stromal CD**: CSCD typically presents with symmetric corneal clouding with white flaky stromal opacities.

**C****entral****C****loudy****D****ystrophy of François**: CCDF presents with a lizard-like patterned gray stromal opacities, called crocodile shagreen.

**Fleck CD****:**This dystrophy presents with small white oval dandruff-like opacities.

**Posterior Amorphous CD**: PACD presents with sheet-like opacities, both centrally and peripherally, along the posterior stroma.

**Pre-Descemet CD****:**This dystrophy presents with a condition similar to cornea farinata, which describes the accumulations as gray-white dust-like opacities made of lipids on biomicroscopy.

**Endothelial dystrophies**: Patients with these dystrophies have blurriness and visual disturbances such as haloes around light, due to corneal edema and thickness.

**F****uchs****E****ndothelial****CD**: FECD presents with guttae, or drop-like conglomerates, along Descemet’s membrane (see figure 5).

**C****ongenital Hereditary CD**: CHED presents with diffuse ground glass-like corneal haze and edema, along with focal gray spotting.

**Posterior Polymorphous****CD**: PPCD can present with a variety of asymmetric or unilateral biomicroscopic findings, including vesicles, breaking bands, or gray haze (see figure 5).

**X-linked Endothelial CD****:**XECD presents with diffuse milky opacities with band keratopathy as well as moon crater-like endothelial cells.
