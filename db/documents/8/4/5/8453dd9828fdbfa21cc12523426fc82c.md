Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung, also known as squamous cell lung cancer, is a type ofÂ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Among NSCLC, adenocarcinoma is the most common, followed by squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, especially in women. This is attributed to the change in the pattern of cigarette smoking, but there is no definitive evidence.
