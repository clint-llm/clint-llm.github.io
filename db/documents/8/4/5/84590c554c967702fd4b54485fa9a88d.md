The thenar eminence of the hand is made up of four muscles: the opponens pollicis muscle, the adductor pollicis muscle, the abductor pollicis brevis muscle, and the flexor pollicis brevis muscle. These muscles make up what is considered the "ball" of the palm.

Since the opposition of the thumb moves the first digit across the palm to touch the tips of the other digits. Other muscles perform the movement of the digits toward the thumb. TheÂ medial side of the hand has the hypothenar eminence. Within the hypothenar eminence, there is a muscle the pulls the fifth digit (little finger or pinky) across the palm towards the thumb. This muscle is called the opponens digiti minimi muscle. The opponens digiti minimi muscle's action is the opposite motion when compared to the opponens pollicis muscle, but allows the thumb to touch the tip of the fifth digit. The lumbrical muscles, flexor digitorum superficialis muscle, and the flexor digitorum profundus muscle all produce the motion that allows the thumb to touch the tip of the other fingers.
