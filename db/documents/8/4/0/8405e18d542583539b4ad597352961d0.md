The diagnosis of Hartnup disease is by urine analysis showing neutral aminoaciduria except for proline. The neutral amino acids (valine, serine, phenylalanine, histidine, glutamine, leucine, asparagine, citrulline, isoleucine, threonine, alanine, tyrosine, tryptophan) undergo analysis by paper chromatography of urine. Indican is also present in the urine, produced as a by-product of degradation of tryptophan by colonic bacteria.
