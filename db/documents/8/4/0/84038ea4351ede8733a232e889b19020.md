Secukinumab is a novel biologic agent specifically targeting interleukin-17 (IL-17) involved in a pathological process. It is a fully human monoclonal antibody. Many clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy in managing plaque psoriasis in 2015, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis in 2016. Additionally, the drug has a commendable safety profile. FDA-approved indications include moderate to severe psoriasis, hypertrophic palmoplantar psoriasis, generalized pustular psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. It can be used off-label for rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, familial Mediterranean fever, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS). This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring of secukinumab, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating indicated disorders as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of secukinumab.
- Review the various indications for using secukinumab.
- Outline the adverse event profile of secukinumab.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance secukinumab where it is indicated and improve patient outcomes.
