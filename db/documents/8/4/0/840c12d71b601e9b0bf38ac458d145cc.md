Acromegaly and gigantism are disorders of growth hormone hypersecretion. The most common cause is a growth hormone (GH) secreting adenoma in the pituitary gland. Gigantism occurs when growth hormone hypersecretion occurs before the fusion of the long bone epiphysis and is characterized by tall stature. Acromegaly occurs when GH hypersecretion occurs after the fusion of the epiphysis leading to large extremities and characteristic facies. An elevated insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) level establishes the diagnosis. The first line of treatment is surgical excision of the tumor; however, this rarely results in a cure, and further medical treatment with somatostatin analogs or radiation is usually necessary. This activity explains the evaluation and management of gigantism and acromegaly and emphasizes the role of the interprofessional team in improving the care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of gigantism and acromegaly.
- Describe the IGF-1 levels in the initial evaluation of gigantism and acromegaly.
- Summarize the surgical, medical, and radiation therapy in managing gigantism and acromegaly.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients affected by gigantism and acromegaly.
