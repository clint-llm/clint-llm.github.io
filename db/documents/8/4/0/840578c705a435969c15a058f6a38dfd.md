SAD is associated with the winter season, where repetitive depression episodes often surge. The disease's existence brings about several speculations as to its existence.

Summer-onset of SAD tends to have distinct symptoms from the winter-phase SAD. These include insomnia, weight loss, agitation, lack of appetite, and increased irritability. The main interest is the replicability of these symptoms at the onset of their respective seasons, although with different severity. Reduced sunlight interferes with the normal body rhythm leading to the depressive symptoms mentioned above. Historically the risk of one contacting SAD is associated with younger age, female gender, family background, the presence of other depressive disorders, and living far from the equator.
