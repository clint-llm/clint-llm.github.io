The outcomes of acute nickel toxicity can vary depending on the levels and duration of exposure. The course of toxicity can range from self-limited with symptomatic management in an outpatient setting to requiring hospitalization with close monitoring. In the case of nickel carbonyl exposure, symptoms can onset within an hour of exposure and progress to severe delayed symptoms within the next 48 hours. Over a period of 1 to 2 weeks, pulmonary fibrosis, consolidation, and cerebral edema may develop.

While patients with acute nickel toxicity can recover, some may experience long-term effects such as neurasthenic syndrome.

Following dermal sensitization to nickel, the hypersensitivity response is typically long-lasting and can persist indefinitely. Once an individual becomes sensitized to nickel, subsequent exposures to even trace amounts of nickel can trigger an allergic reaction. However, it is important to note that the intensity of the reaction may vary depending on the frequency and duration of exposure. Extended periods between exposures can potentially lead to a diminished allergic response, but complete resolution of the hypersensitivity is uncommon.
