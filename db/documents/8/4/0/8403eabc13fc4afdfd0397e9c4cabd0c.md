Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), a progestin, is similar in structure to naturally-occurring progesterone. The mechanism of action of progestin involves binding the progesterone receptor in the hypothalamus, female reproductive tract, and the pituitary and inhibiting the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). By decreasing the frequency of release of GnRH, MPA blunts the midcycle LH surge and prevents follicular maturation and ovulation. MPA changes a proliferative endometrium to a secretory one in the endometrium, making it difficult for implantation. Finally, MPA also impairs sperm migration into the uterus by increasing the viscosity of the cervical mucus.

In premenopausal women experiencing amenorrhea and irregular uterine bleeding, MPA can be used to establish a normal menstrual cycle. MPA also decreases the endometrial growth in postmenopausal women and menopausal women who receive estrogen therapy. MPA acts on endometrial lesions and decreases endometrial-related pain in patients with endometriosis.
