Enterprise-level simulation management systems have been designed by multiple manufactures to assist with the assessment and evaluation of learners, inventory management, case and curriculum storage and tracking, center utilization, and learner attendance. These systems can also support financial decision-making based on the data collected and maintained. Many of these systems are web-based and can have data storage on-site or using remote, cloud-based solutions.Â Individual simulation may offer learner performance tracking specific to the product or system. It is important to ensure consistent storage and use practices across all systems used within a single center or institution.
