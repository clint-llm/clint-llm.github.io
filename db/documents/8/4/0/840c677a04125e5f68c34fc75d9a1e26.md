Many interfering factors affect the results of every step of the sputum diagnosis. Any deviation from the standard procedure of sample collection, culture, staining, biochemical, molecular, and antimicrobial susceptibility tests can significantly impact the diagnostic result, directly affecting the patient's clinical management. Therefore, strict laboratory workflow procedures and well-trained laboratory technologists are required to perform the sputum analysis.

Collecting a good quality sputum sample is the first step for getting an , the pathogens identified from sputum culture do not always originate from lower respiratory tract infections because they may be part of contaminant sites or preexisting in the oral flora. Thus, standard microbiological procedures for organisms' isolation and identification are critical for the sputum quality assessment (QA).

QA remains an essential tool in the lab for distinguishing the real respiratory pathogens from the possible colonizing flora. Finally, it is vital to check the quality of commercial products that need to be approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and European and Australian similar agencies. Inferior quality culture plates, expired staining kits, or ineffective molecular biology kits are directly related to poor performance. Several agencies determine the quality performed in a laboratory, and the College of the American Pathologists plays a major in dictating laboratory standards and quality control procedures, which are essential to avoid different interfering factors.
