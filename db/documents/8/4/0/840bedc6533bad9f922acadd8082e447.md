Seroma aspiration can routinely be carried out by an individual clinician at the patientâ€™s bedside or clinic setting. An appropriately trained nurse may carry out the procedure, although any concerns regarding possible infection, hematoma, or wound dehiscence warrant review by a physician.

In cases where ultrasound-guided aspiration is required, this can be referred to a radiologist if the clinician is not appropriately trained.
