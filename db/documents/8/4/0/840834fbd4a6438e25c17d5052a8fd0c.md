The evaluation and diagnosis of air leak start with a detailed history and physical examination. Ancillary studies are necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

**Chest X-ray**

This is the most common and readily available study for the diagnosis of air leaks. The presence of a radiolucent area of air in the lung field with the absence of lung marking is highly suggestive of a pneumothorax. Pneumothorax can have different appearances in a supine and upright chest X-ray. Pneumothoraxes in a patient on mechanical ventilation might enlarge and become a tension pneumothorax. Radiological signs in tension pneumothorax are a mediastinal shift, loss of lung volume or “shrinking" of the lung, flattening of the heart, and vascular shadow.

Pneumomediastinum radiologically can be seen as a column of air in the mediastinum. If the amount of air is large enough, it can displace the thymus to produce the thymic sail sign.

Pneumopericardium is seen as a collection of air around the pericardial sac on routine chest X-ray.

**Chest Ultrasound**

This imaging is gaining popularity in the diagnosis of pneumothoraxes. It has close to 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity for the diagnosis of pneumothorax when compared to a CT scan.

It can be useful for the diagnosis of pneumothorax not seen on plain X-ray. The presence of subcutaneous emphysema can impair the accuracy of the ultrasound reading.

The sonographic sign of pneumothorax is the absence of lung sliding. In the presence of a pneumothorax. This sliding is absent. In the ultrasonographic assessment to identify pneumothorax, two ribs are identified with the pleural space between them. The normal back-and-forth movement or "shimmering" of the pleural line is usually absent.

**CT Scan**

CT scan is a useful imaging study for a patient with a persistent air leak. CT of the chest helps to differentiate bullous disease of the lung from pneumothorax. It also helps to differentiate other lung and pleural pathologies. CT scan is considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of air leak and ALS. The risk of CT is radiation. Also, this imaging study can be challenging on a critically ill patient on mechanical ventilation and vasoactive drips because the transport of the patient to facilitate the imaging study can be potentially dangerous.
