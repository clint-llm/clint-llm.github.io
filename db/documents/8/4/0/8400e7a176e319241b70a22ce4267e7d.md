In summary, a comprehensive management strategy focuses on maintaining the airway, supporting adequate oxygenation, maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion without further increasing the intracranial pressure and decreasing the cerebral metabolic rate are key for a positive outcome. This effort is best achieved with a coordinated collaboration among emergency department teams, radiology suites, neurology and neurosurgical teams, critical care teams including physicians, nurses and respiratory therapists. Social workers are helpful to navigate the complex social and legal aspects of abusive injury most times of subdural hematoma.

**Outcomes**

A subdural hematoma is not a benign disorder; mortality rates of 30% to 80% have been reported. Even those who survive may never fully regain functioning. Good outcomes are seen in less than one-third of patients. Younger patients tend to have better outcomes compared to older individuals. However, the ultimate prognosis depends on the cause and extent of brain injury. Those patients with minimal brain parenchymal injury have the best outcomes.
