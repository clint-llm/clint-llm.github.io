**Warnings and Precautions**

Sildenafil has systemic vasodilatory effects and, as such, should be prescribed with caution to patients who may be sensitive to such blood pressure changes, such as patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction and impaired autonomic control of blood pressure.****Caution is needed when combining sildenafil with alpha-adrenergic blocking drugs and other antihypertensive agents.

The use of sildenafil can infrequently result in a prolonged erection lasting more than 4 hours, also known as priapism, which, if left untreated, may result in damage to the penile tissue. Furthermore, sildenafil use requires caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis and patients with conditions potentially predisposing them to priapism, such as sickle cell anemia or multiple myeloma.

The use of PDE5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil, may increase the incidence of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) in males over age 50. Therefore, patients with a previous history of NAION or with a “crowded” optic disk should be prescribed sildenafil with caution.

Sildenafil metabolism is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2C9; thus, strong inhibitors of these isoenzymes may lead to the accumulation of sildenafil with subsequent toxicity.****The combination of sildenafil with the endothelin antagonist bosentan to manage pulmonary arterial hypertension has correlated with increased serum concentrations of bosentan and reduced levels of sildenafil.

Sildenafil, at its lowest dose, is recommended when initiating therapy in patients who are on alpha-blockers due to potential systemic hypotension. Caution is also a requirement in patients taking mixed alpha/beta-blockers unless there is specific information regarding coadministration.

**Adverse Effects**

Doses greater than 100 mg of sildenafil have resulted in no increase in efficacy but an increase in side effects. Patients on sildenafil most commonly (2%) reported headaches, flushing, dyspepsia, nasal congestion, back pain, myalgia, nausea, dizziness, and rash.

Sildenafil has shown associations with changes in color vision, alterations in light perception, and hazy vision.

Epistaxis was reported in 13% of patients taking sildenafil with PAH secondary to connective tissue disorder. Epistaxis was not observed in patients with idiopathic PAH. Epistaxis was reported higher in sildenafil-treated patients with a concomitant oral vitamin K antagonist. The safety of sildenafil is not established in patients with active peptic ulceration or bleeding disorders.

Cases of a sudden loss of hearing or decrease in hearing, sometimes accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors, including sildenafil. It is not possible to decide if reported cases are related directly to the patient’s underlying risk factors attributing to hearing loss, the use of sildenafil, or both or to other factors. Advise patients to seek prompt medical care in the event of a sudden loss of hearing or decrease while taking sildenafil.
