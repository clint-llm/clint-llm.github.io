The clinical issues in the AIAN community need to be addressed through a coordinated care plan amongst all healthcare providers, including doctors, nurses, and the supportive staff. The entire interprofessional healthcare team (clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, therapists, ancillary staff) needs to understand the history of the tribe they are serving and respect their culture and differences. There is Level 3 to 4 evidence (in terms of historical cohorts, cohort-case control studies) demonstrating an improvement in the care provided to this community when the providers respect the culture and differences in the AIAN community.
