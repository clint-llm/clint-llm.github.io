Some patients diagnosed with narcolepsy type 2 will eventually present with cataplexy and have the diagnosis changed to narcolepsy type 1. Many patients have symptoms that do worsen over time. Although it is unlikely that symptoms will improve on their own over time, they are generally well managed with a combination of behavioral interventions and medications. Additionally, there are new treatments currently being investigated that may allow for immunomodulation or administration of orexin agonists small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.

Children often suffer from poor school performance and social interactions. Job impairment is common and most patients are not able to be gainfully employed.
