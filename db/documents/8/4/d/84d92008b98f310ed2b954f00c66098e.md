X-rays are a simple and inexpensive first imaging evaluation for suspected failed back surgery syndrome. X-rays are useful for detecting vertebral and sacroiliac defects and/or misalignment and are superior to MRIs for the detection of spondylolisthesis.

MRI with and without gadolinium contrast continues to be the gold standard imaging modality for failed back surgery syndrome due to its excellent ability to detect soft tissue abnormalities such as epidural fibrosis and disc herniation.

Other tests may be used to elucidate the etiology of failed back surgery syndrome and differentiate it from other causes of lower back pain. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein may be used to evaluate for possible infection, especially in patients with constitutional symptoms or a predisposition towards infection.
