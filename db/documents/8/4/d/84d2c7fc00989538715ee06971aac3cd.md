Mucorales are present in soil and decaying matter, in immunocompetent people, the spores of Mucorales that reach the respiratory tract adhere to the nasal mucus and are eliminated either by swallowing or sneezing, if there is any wound in the mucous membranes, the polymorphonuclear neutrophils phagocytose and destroy the fungal structures. Neutrophils are the host defense against these infections; therefore, individuals with neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction are at the highest risk. This is seen clinically in leukemia patients and bone marrow transplant patients, who are at the highest risk.

Rhizopus arrhizus studies have demonstrated that the ketone bodies present in these patients are metabolized by a ketone reductase, which allows them to survive in conditions with an acid medium; thus, the fungi become hyphal forms in host tissues and then invade blood vessels. This extensive angioinvasion results in vessel thrombosis and tissue necrosis.Â  Diabetes patients usually present with clinically uncontrolled diabetes and the increased amounts of circulating glucose, providing excellent conditions for the rapid development of filamentous structures that first bind to blood vessels and then penetrate them, completely clogging them in a few days and causing extensive areas of ischemic necrosis.

Also, metabolic acidosis prevents chemotaxis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, causes decreased phagocytic activity, and reduces local inflammatory response in a patient whose immune system is already compromised from one or more additional diseases.
