The exact pathogenesis mechanism leading to the development of LCA is not known. However, the association of the LCA with congenital and immunological disorders does point towards the possible role immune dysregulation plays in the pathogenesis of these tumors. There have been case reports describing the association of cancers of the lung, colon, pancreas, kidney, and ovary with LCA. Also rarely reported are leiomyosarcoma, lymphoma, and melanoma. Therefore, one should always be mindful of the possibility of and rule out other neoplasms in all patients diagnosed with LCA.

The majority of the LCAs are known to be benign, though there have been reported cases of two subtypes of malignant LCA, known as littoral cell angiosarcoma and littoral cell hemangioendothelioma.
