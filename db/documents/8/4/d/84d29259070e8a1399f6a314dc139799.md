There is an overlap of DSM 5 diagnostic criteria within the diagnoses of impulse control disorder (ICD). It can be hard to distinguish the protean subcategories. However, discrete features can help to differentiate better. ODD distinguishes itself from CD and IED, as children with the former are typically not physically aggressive, nor do they present with a history of criminal activity.

Those with ODD express a more non-compliant and annoying disposition, whereas those afflicted with its counterpart ICDs actively violate the rights of others, as in CD, or experience violent intractable tantrums, as in IED. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) can also resemble ODD and IED; however, DMDD is more pervasive than ODD and frequent than IED. Furthermore, DMDD and ICDs are mutually exclusive, with DMDD taking precedence if criteria are met for both.

Impulsive and oppositional behavioral patterns are observable across a plethora of psychiatric disorders, including mania, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, substance use disorder, psychosis, and cluster B personality disorders.
