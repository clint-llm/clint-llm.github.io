Salas et al. suggest utilizing the routine use of CLC because it can reduce tension between members of trauma teams.

Education is one of the most important means by which to arm faculty and trainees in terms of improvement in patient safety. As stated by the US Institute of Medicine (IOM), teams that work together should train together.

Immersive simulation scenarios allow for in-depth debriefing regarding roles, responsibilities, and information sharing as they relate to patient management. With proper debriefing, simulation provides insight into different interprofessional teams’ vantage points, allowing for an environment of mutual support. Culture change can occur in an environment where the patient is at the center of a shared mental model. interprofessional simulation allows for the development of mutual respect and trust via a team rather than an individual-oriented approach. The simulation, therefore, represents a safe environment for the deliberate practice of efficient communication strategies. Video recordings of participants during simulation activities can help facilitate learning along with a structured debrief. A meta-analysis of 609 studies suggests that simulation can aid in the augmentation of medical knowledge, time management skills, process, and procedure skills.
