Although rare, at the time of biopsy or surgical resection of the lesion, the patient potentially can undergo a carcinoid crisis due to excess secretion of neurosecretory granules. This is combated with the use of somatostatin analogs. Carcinoid syndrome is a rare complication and not common with primary bronchial lesions without metastasis. Cushingâ€™s syndrome may result as a result of excess ACTH production from neurosecretory lesions.
