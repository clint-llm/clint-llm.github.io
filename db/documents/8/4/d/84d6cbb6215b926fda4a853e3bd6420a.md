Atrioventricular (AV) conduction is evaluated by assessing the relationship between the P waves and QRS complexes. Normally, there is a P wave that precedes each QRS complex by a fixed PR interval of 120 to 200 milliseconds. AV block represents a delay or disturbance in the transmission of an impulse from the atria to the ventricles. This can be due to an anatomical or functional impairment in the heartâ€™s conduction system. This disruption in normal electrical activity can be transient or permanent, and then further characterized as delayed, intermittent, or absent. This activity describes the causes, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of atrioventricular block and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Recall the causes of AV block. 
- Summarize the ECG features of atrioventricular block.
- List the treatment and management options available for atrioventicular block.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the diagnosis and management of patients with atrioventricular block.
