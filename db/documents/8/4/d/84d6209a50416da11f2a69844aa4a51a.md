If the infection is not contained and treated, the infection may spread to the following areas:

- sigmoid sinus

- transverse sinus

- meninges

This is as a result of spread intracranially. The infection more commonly spreads along the investing layer of deep cervical fascia, leading to:

- Jugular vein thrombosis

- Cranial neuropathies

- Trismus

- Superficial extension with cutaneous fistula formation

Long-term complications can include:

- Death

- Meningitis

- Cranial neuropathy

- Hearing loss
