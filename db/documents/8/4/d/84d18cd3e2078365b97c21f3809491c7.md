Evaluation usually occurs in conjunction with the first complaint of delayed development of adolescent puberty. Constitutionally delayed puberty or constitutional growth delay with prepubertal body proportions can be a normal condition that corrects itself through the later onset of puberty and may be caused by some genetic and environmental factors. During the evaluation of such patients, laboratory tests should be conducted to exclude hormonal deficiencies and other systemic syndromes. Thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, along with IGF-1 and gonadotropin levels (LH and FSH), would be normal with skeletal age in constitutionally delayed growth conditions but may be outside of the normal range in patients with a genetic disease. Urinalysis and routine blood work could also be used to screen these patients to identify inflammatory or autoimmune disorders. Also, patients who manage chronic pain with opioids have an increased association with induced hypogonadism later in life.
