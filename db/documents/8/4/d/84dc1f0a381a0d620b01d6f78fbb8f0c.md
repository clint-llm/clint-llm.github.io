Transforaminal epidural steroid injections are commonly used to treat radicular pain, and there have been case reports of spinal cord infarction and acute paraplegia following this procedure. Typically, a posterior approach with a subpedicular technique is utilized. The needle tip is placed in the “safe triangle” in the superior aspect of the neural foramen, where it is immediately superior and lateral to the targeted nerve, which decreases the chance of traumatic injury to the nerve. While this method avoids injury to the nerve root, disruption of blood supply to the anterior spinal cord can occur with this procedure in the thoracic or upper lumbar spine if the needle tip is in the vicinity of the AKA, or other anterior medullary arteries. Case reports have suggested that acute paraplegia was due to direct needle injury, induced vasospasm, or embolization. Thus, it has been proposed that when epidural injections are performed at L3 and above, the needle should be placed in the inferior foramen instead.
