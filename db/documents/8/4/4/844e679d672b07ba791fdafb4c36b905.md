Commonly, most people have experienced ambient pressure change when diving to the bottom of a deep pool, as an occupant of an aircraft, or as a passenger in a car when driving through various elevation changes. ETD and MEBT remain the two most common complications of SCUBA diving, commercial diving, and clinical hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT). There is significant variability in the incidence and prevalence of ETD and MEBT reported in the literature, ranging from 4.1 – 82%.

Reports vary in terms of statistically significant differences regarding gender, age, allergies, type of diving, water temperature, season, smoking history, septal deviation, and previous history of otitis media. A history of head and neck cancers, as well as radiation treatment, have been associated with a higher incidence of ETD and MEBT, presumably secondary to radiation soft tissue damage of the ET or pharynx. Patients with an enlarged or shorter cochlear aqueduct, enlarged vestibular aqueducts, or an anatomical communication between the middle and inner ear may be at increased risk of IEBT.
