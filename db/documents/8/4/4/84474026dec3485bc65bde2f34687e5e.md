Registry study places the incidence of C2 fracture at 6 per 100,000 people. OfÂ 6370 patients with C2 fractures in Sweden, 51% were male, and the average age was 72 years. Those who were younger, male, and presenting with spinal cord injury were more likely to undergo surgical intervention. In the pediatric cohort, C1 to C2 injuries represented 7.7% of spine fractures presenting through a multi-institutional series following after trauma from multiple blunt mechanisms.
