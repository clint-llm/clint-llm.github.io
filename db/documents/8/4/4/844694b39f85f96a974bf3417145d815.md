- Gastrointestinal: gastroesophageal reflux, hiatal hernia, peptic ulcer disease

- Pulmonary: pneumothorax, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism

- Musculoskeletal: costochondritis, rib injury, muscle spasm, chest wall injury

- Psychiatric: panic attack, generalized anxiety

- Cardiac non-ischemic: pericarditis, myocarditis

- Vascular: aortic dissection
