Diagnosis of chest wall tumors for healthcare providers and other healthcare professionals requires a high index of suspicion despite nonspecific history and physical examination. Coordination with radiology is imperative as patients must undergo chest radiographs, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or PET scan. An interprofessional approach including but not limited to: primary care, nursing staff, radiology technicians, radiologists, pharmacists, interventional radiologists, pulmonologists, oncologists, and surgeons will be involved in a majority of the cases of chest wall tumors. Operative and perianesthesia nurses participate in care and monitor patients. They also are involved in patient and family education. The patient's prognosis centers around the underlying pathology of the disease; however, having an interprofessional approach to the patient will help expedite management and prevent further morbidity and mortality.
