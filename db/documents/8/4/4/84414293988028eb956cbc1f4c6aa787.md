Erb palsy relates to an injury of cervical spinal nerves C5 and C6. C5-C6 nerves form part of the brachial plexus, comprised of ventral rami of cervical spinal nerves C5-C8 and thoracic nerve T1. These nerves network from the spine and pass through the cervicoaxillary canal in the neck and the ribs, and emerge into the axilla. Most commonly, the brachial plexus is injured by traction of the neck during delivery. The most important risk factors are macrosomia and shoulder dystocia. It usually occurs in macrosomic infants who needed to be pulled from the birth canal. This maneuver causes stretching of the brachial plexus, which may injure it.  However, brachial plexus injury can also result independently of shoulder dystocia and average weighing neonates.
