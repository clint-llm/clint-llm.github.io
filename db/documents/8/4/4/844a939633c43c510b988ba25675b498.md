An interprofessional team provides a holistic and integrated approach to accurately diagnose and help achieve the best possible outcomes. The complications that commonly accompany holoprosencephaly require a multidisciplinary approach. Endocrine dysfunction that commonly accompanies some variants of HPE should be treated life long by a pediatric endocrinologist. Associated gastrointestinal anomalies are attended to by pediatric gastroenterologists. Neurological anomalies like seizures, movement disorders, facial anomalies, and hydrocephalus, are attended to by the neurologist and the neurosurgeon.

Dysphagia or reflux related to the cleft palate is treated by a plastic surgeon in conjunction with the pediatric surgeon. The importance of psychological aid and genetic counseling must not be undermined and should be offered to all parents. Child psychiatrists and psychologists can be consulted for the emotional and behavioral consequences of holoprosencephaly.

Collaboration with shared decision making and good communication among the interprofessional team is key for a good outcome. The interprofessional care provided to the patient must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to planning and evaluation of all joint activities. The earlier signs and symptoms of a complication are identified, the better is the prognosis and outcome.
