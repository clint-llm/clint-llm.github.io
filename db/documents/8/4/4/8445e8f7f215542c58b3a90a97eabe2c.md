Clinical or radiologic suspicion for a peroneal tendon injury with or without an os peroneus fracture may warrant consultation with a podiatrist or orthopedic surgeon and/or advanced imaging (MRI or ultrasound), specifically in the setting of patients that failed conservative therapy. Nurses and physical therapists are also valuable assets in caring for these patients. These healthcare professionals need to function as a cohesive interprofessional team. Operative outcomes are based on level-IV and level-V studies. Thus, an interprofessional approach individualized to the patient’s case and involving a primary care provider, an orthopedic surgeon, a radiologist, and a physical therapist will provide the most optimal course of treatment.
