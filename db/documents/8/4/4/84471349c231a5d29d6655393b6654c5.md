Microtia is sometimes associated with congenital defects; therefore, syndromes such as Goldenhar, Treacher Collins, Melnick-Fraser, and others should be considered. Other common defects such as prominauris, cryptotia, cup or lop ear deformity, Stahl's ear, and lobule deformities may be mistaken for microtia, but may be treated effectively within three weeks of birth using an external ear molding system due to the flexibility imparted to neonatal auriclular cartilage by circulating maternal estrogens. Aural atresia is often associated with grade 3 and 4 microtia and should be evaluated.
