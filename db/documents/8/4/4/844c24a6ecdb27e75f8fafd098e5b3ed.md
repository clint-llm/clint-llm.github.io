**Breasts**

The onset of breast tissue development (thelarche) in the female is the first secondary sexual characteristic to develop in puberty. Free estrogen acts on intracellular receptors to promote the development of both ductal and stromal elements. The fatty stromal elements compose most of the breast growth during puberty; by its completion, only a minor amount of ductal tissue remains within the breast.

Due to relative estrogen dominance during puberty, up to 40% of boys may develop transient breast enlargement (gynecomastia), which is secondary to ductal and stromal hypertrophy.

**Testicles**

Pre-adolescent males typically have a testicular length of less than 2.5 cm or a testicular volume of less than 4 mL. It is the growth of the testes beyond these measurements which marks the onset of puberty.

**Pubic Hair**

DHEA and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) both result in the production of pubic and axillary hair growth. These hormones act on hair follicles, causing both the thickening and darkening of the pubic hair. The distribution of hair follicles highly responsive to these hormones is genetically determined; thus, certain individuals may be predisposed to a lesser or greater distribution of darkened body hair.
