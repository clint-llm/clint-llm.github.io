Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as Gebrochenes-Herz syndrome, transient apical ballooning syndrome, apical ballooning cardiomyopathy, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, stress cardiomyopathy, and broken-heart syndrome, is a form of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. It is characterized by transient regional systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle mimicking acute myocardial infarction but with only minimal release of cardiac enzymes. There is a paucity of angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease or acute plaque rupture. In most cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, the regional wall motion abnormality extends beyond the territory perfused by a single epicardial coronary artery. The term takotsubo means octopus trap in Japanese. It has a shape that is similar to the systolic apical ballooning appearance of the left ventricle. This activity reviews takotsubo cardiomyopathy and highlights the interprofessional team's role in the recognition and management of patients affected by it.

**Objectives:**
- Describe exam findings consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
- Identify the testing that should be done if takotsubo cardiomyopathy is suspected.
- Explain management considerations for takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
- Summarize a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
