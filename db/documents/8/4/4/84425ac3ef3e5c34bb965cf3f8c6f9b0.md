Trained optometrists are required to perform pre-operative workup of the patient, including measurement of uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuity, refraction, and ocular biometry, including axial length and keratometry values. An anesthetic evaluation is required to assess the patient's fitness for the planned procedure.

The surgery is generally performed under local anesthesia, but anxious patients may require sedation to complete the procedure. Patients with systemic medical conditions like cardiac and neurological pathologies may require monitoring throughout the surgery.

An ophthalmologist usually performs standard phacoemulsification or a femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) to implant the intraocular lens. A skilled operating theatre assistant usually assists while performing the surgery. The ward nurses or the ophthalmologist can do postoperative care and counseling.
