Diagnostic studies should focus on excluding the presence of other conditions producing the patient's cognitive impairment. This may include infectious, neurological, or psychiatric disorders in addition to toxic encephalopathies. Liver function, blood glucose, vitamin B12, thyroid hormone, syphilis and hepatitis serologies may be useful depending on the patient's presentation.Â  The stage of HIV infection may be assessed with CD4 count and viral load.

Neuroimaging such as MRI should be ordered to evaluate for neurologic disorders or cerebrovascular disease. Diffuse cerebral atrophy is usually present and can affect the basal ganglia, white matter and cortical regions. EEG will show generalized slowing in advanced disease.

CSF studies may show elevated viral load, lymphocytic pleocytosis and increased total protein levels however these findings are nonspecific. If drawn, CSF serologies should include toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal antigen, syphilis and viral polymerase chain reaction studies including John Cunningham (JC) virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV).
