The amyloid-beta peptide appears to play a central role in the pathology of Alzheimer disease. Sporadic Alzheimer disease is the most common cause of dementia, with an estimated 50% to 56% cases in autopsy and clinical series. The disease starts insidiously, with age being the principal risk factor. Symptoms typically begin with memory deficits, progressing to other cognitive domains with death, usually in 10 years from diagnosis. A subset of Alzheimer disease called familial Alzheimer disease accounts for 2% to 3% of Alzheimer disease cases. It tends to occur early in life, before age 60, as opposed to sporadic Alzheimer disease, the incidence of which increases with age.
