WS is a genetic disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance.

A relationship between the intrauterine necrosis theory and Waardenburg syndrome with status dysraphicus has also been proposed.Â Among all these different hypotheses, none can explain all the features of Waardenburg syndrome. Individuals with deafness account for 50% of inherited causes, in which 70% have different single genes mutations that alone impair the functions of hearing. Syndromic deafness is also sometimes associated with other developmental abnormalities.
