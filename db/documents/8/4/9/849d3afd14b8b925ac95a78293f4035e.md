Most of the survival data in patients with SCA does not factor in the advent of new medications. The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) (between 1978-88) reported the median age of death for women and men as 42 and 48 years, respectively. This study also showed that acute chest syndrome, renal failure, seizures, high leukocyte count, and low levels of HbF were associated with an increased risk of early death in patients with SCA.

More recent data combining nine studies from Europe and North America (evaluating 3257 patients) listed the following as predictors of mortality:

- Age (per 10-year increase in age)

- Tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity 2.5 m/s or more

- Reticulocyte count

- Log(N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide)

- Fetal hemoglobin

With the approval of newer drugs in 2019 (voxelotor and crizanlizumab), increased use of hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and exploring newer techniques like gene therapy, survival is bound to increase along with the quality of life.
