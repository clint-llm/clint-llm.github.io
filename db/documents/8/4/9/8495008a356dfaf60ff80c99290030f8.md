**Normal Wound Healing**

At times difficult to appreciate, the wound healing process (WHP) is a highly structured and well-organized biological process

- Hemostasis

- Inflammation

- Proliferation

- Tissue remodeling

When a wound forms, whether due to trauma or surgery, immediate vasoconstriction occurs via the action of thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin

The next major step in wound healing involves the accumulation of macrophages, usually around 48 to 72 hours
