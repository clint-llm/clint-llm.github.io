The most common etiologies for anxiolytic and sedative toxicity include but are not limited to improper dosing, misuse/abuse, or drug-drug interactions. An example of improper dosing would be the use of diazepam 5 to 10 mg in an older person with liver disease in which the drug slowly builds up in their system to give toxic side effects like sedation and falls.  Another example would be the use of a 3A4 inhibitor like fluvoxamine, where fluvoxamine inhibits the metabolism of alprazolam, thus causing a build-up of levels in the bloodstream, causing sedation. The use of opioids and benzodiazepines is another cause of accidental toxicity.  Finally, the use of benzodiazepines or barbiturates with alcohol to enhance the intoxication can result in unintended respiratory depression and death.
