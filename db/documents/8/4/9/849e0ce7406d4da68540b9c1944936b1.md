For easily resectable gastrointestinal stromal tumors greater than 2 cm, surgical resection remains the choice of treatment. The goal of surgery is to obtain complete resection (R0) with grossly negative margins without rupture of the tumor pseudocapsule.

For patients with locally advanced disease, neoadjuvant imatinib therapy should be considered before tumor resection. This topic will be discussed further in the medical oncology section.
