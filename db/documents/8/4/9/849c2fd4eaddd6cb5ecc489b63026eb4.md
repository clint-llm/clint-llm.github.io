**Ophthalmic**

Ophthalmological screening and recording of vision, intraocular pressures, gonioscopy, comprehensive slit-lamp examination, and dilated fundus examination should be done to rule out any uveal melanomas. Management of uveal melanomas will depend on the size and location and will involve surgical resection, radiotherapy, transpupillary thermotherapy, or enucleation.

**Dermatologic**

Treatment is required for cosmetic purposes or if there is any malignant transformation. Treatment depends on the size of the lesion and the extent of invasion. Mohs micrographic surgery can be employed to remove the lesions and reconstruct the periocular tissues. For more extensive lesions or metastasis, a combination of surgical excision along with radiotherapy, transpupillary thermotherapy, or chemotherapy may be tried.

Lasers can be employed for the cosmetic treatment of skin lesions by destroying the melanocytes. Pulsed Q-switched laser surgery is the treatment of choice for nevi of Ota and Ito. It targets dermal melanocytes and melanophages by their selective photothermal and photos mechanical destruction, thereby decreasing the pigmentation. Chemical peels, dermabrasion, electrocautery, or cryotherapy are other modalities of treatment for cosmesis.
