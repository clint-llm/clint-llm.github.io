Proper monitoring of patients treated with thalidomide is essential to ensuring a safe and efficacious treatment, as this drug is related to numerous, potentially severe, adverse events and reactions.****

Monitoring of patients treated with thalidomide involves routine healthcare visits to the prescribing physicians. Clinicians may check patients for developing neuropathy via complete neurological exams or EMG studies every six months. Lab work monitoring is also necessary for the elevation of liver enzymes and thyroid function. Patients treated with thalidomide and dexamethasone should be observed for signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and instructed to seek medical care if they develop shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. The patient should report any adverse reactions to the clinician (including increased somnolence, constipation, etc.). Lastly, both physician and patient should be enrolled in the STEPS program to ensure proper monitoring of compliance and adverse reactions (described further in the “toxicity” section).
