The treatment depends on the underlying primary disorder, severity, and nature of organ involvement. In presentations with mixed cryoglobulinemia with symptoms, the treatment is directed at the underlying autoimmune or infectious disorders.

Treatment for cryoglobulinemia focuses on each independent case and includes plasmapheresis and immunosuppression (e.g., glucocorticoids, rituximab) for a patient with rapidly progressing or life-threatening outcomes. The treatment is directed towards the infection or autoimmune disorder existing with symptomatic patients due to cryoglobulinemia.

Hepatitis C infections most commonly cause mixed cryoglobulinemia. The connection between this syndrome and autoimmune/lymphoproliferative disorders is common. The general onset of this disease is slow-paced, but in some situations, rapid progression can occur.

The apparent severity of the disease guides professionals on how best to treat the patient. Though there is no established outline on severity designations, the subsequent descriptions are used for direction:

**Mild Disease**

Presentation in mild cases includes petechial rash without lesions, arthralgia with no apparent organ damage, and mild sensory neuropathy.

**Moderate to Severe Disease**

In this classification, the presentation includes:

- Progressive neuropathy

- Pulmonary vasculitis

- CNS vasculitis presented as a stroke or cognitive impairment

- GI vasculitis associated with bleeding and abdominal pain

- Digital ischemia

The aforementioned clinical indicators do not comprise a complete list of manifestations.

Across the board, mixed cryoglobulinemia's general treatment includes pain control, care for wounds, and prophylactic measures against infections. With patients receiving steroids or immunosuppressive therapy, the appropriate prophylaxis is important. The therapeutic approach taken for treatment should revolve around the existing etiology of the disease.

In mild diseases, immunosuppressive therapy is not required. Treatment is focused on the underlying disease. In moderate to severe cases, the specialized focus is to correct the primary symptoms with immunosuppressive therapy. Typically, immunosuppressive therapy is initiated until a steady state is achieved and followed by the devised regimen. Important note, in patients with HIV or hepatitis B virus (HBV), therapeutic antivirals should be provided before or simultaneously with immunosuppressive therapy.

Treatment with highly concentrated glucocorticoids combined with rituximab is suggested as a baseline treatment for moderate to severe cryoglobulinemia. In cases with no rituximab or if there are no results from its administration, cyclophosphamide is substituted.

In severe conditions such as:

- Hyperviscosity syndrome

- Skin ulcers by cutaneous vasculitis

- Elevated cryocrit concentration – Greater than or equal to 10 percent

The recommended course of action is plasmapheresis, combined with immunosuppressive therapy. Daily exchanges approximately three times per week for a couple of weeks is the recommended course of action.

Cryoglobulinemia undergoing immunosuppressive treatments require special observation with the scrutiny level dependent on severity. Physical examination should always include monitoring of skin involvement and digital ischemia. Kidney association in treatment requires keeping in view the blood pressure, creatinine, complement, rheumatoid factor levels, and urinalysis. Progressive glomerulonephritis should be observed weekly compared to conditions without rapid disease progression, which require monthly evaluation. The defined regimen and overall prognosis are influenced heavily by organ involvement. Outlooks are poor for individuals with intestinal vasculitis and acute gastrointestinal or pulmonary hemorrhage.
