The diagnosis of Waterhouse Friderichsen syndrome requires a high degree of suspicion. With the ongoing bacterial infection, it is highly likely to be confused with septic shock. WFS should be mainly in mind if the shock does not respond to intravenous fluids and vasopressors. Hypotension with low body fluid, hyponatremia, and prerenal azotemia are also features of hypovolemia. So WFS may be confused with hypovolemic shock, especially in the absence of elements of bacterial infection and vomiting as a predominant symptom.

Other conditions presenting as an adrenal crisis merit consideration as well.Â  In neonates, congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency may present as an adrenal crisis within the first few days to weeks of life. Infants with obstructive uropathy, pyelonephritis, or tubulointerstitial nephritis may also present with salt-losing crises with vomiting, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia.
