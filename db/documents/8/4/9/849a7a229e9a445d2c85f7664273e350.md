Itraconazole should have a trough concentration of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L to treat and prevent fungal infections. Trough concentration is the drug’s lowest concentration immediately prior to the next dose.

Regular monitoring can be useful to exclude issues with unanticipated changes in pharmacokinetics or problems with compliance. In addition to monitoring the drug concentration, patients should also have their liver enzymes checked regularly to ensure no hepatotoxicity.
