Points to remember:

- Recurrent sinusitis is a clinical diagnosis defined by four or more distinct episodes of sinusitis per year, with symptom-free intervals between episodes.

- Diagnostic imaging is not recommended for uncomplicated acute recurrent sinusitis; however, a non-contrast CT scan may demonstrate anatomical obstruction in patients with recurrent acute sinusitis.

- Symptomatic treatment with a trial of a decongestant nasal spray, daily intranasal irrigation, and/or a corticosteroid nasal spray is the mainstay of treatment during the first ten days of symptoms.

- A variety of antibiotics may be used to treat suspected bacterial sinusitis. The specific choice of medication should be based on local antibiograms, patient risk factors, allergies, and co-morbidities. Drug resistance should be considered in refractory cases.

- While medical therapy is the mainstay of treatment for most patients, research indicates that surgical intervention is beneficial for a subset of patients with recurrent acute rhinosinusitis. Outcomes are similar to those seen in patients surgically treated for chronic rhinosinusitis.

- Endoscopic surgical techniques are particularly useful for patients with proven turbinate hypertrophy, conchae bullosa, stenosed sinus ostia, frontal sinus cells, Onodi cells, Haller cells, and septal spurs.

- Balloon sinus dilation is a minimally invasive endoscopic approach that effectively treats both recurrent acute rhinosinusitis and chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis.

- Orbital complications of recurrent acute rhinosinusitis include preseptal cellulitis, orbital cellulitis, and cavernous sinus thrombosis. Physicians must remain vigilant in monitoring for the development of cranial nerve deficits or other signs of orbital involvement and provide immediate treatment to these patients.
