The procerus muscle receives its blood supply via branches of the facial artery. The facial artery is a branch of the external carotid artery that supplies the superficial face. Lymphatics from the face, scalp, and neck drain into the superficial ring of lymph nodes; these lymph nodesÂ are known as the pericervical collar. This ring of lymph nodes includes the submental, submandibular, parotid, mastoid, and occipital lymph nodes.
