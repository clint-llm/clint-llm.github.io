Untreated dental infection can readily spread to the surrounding gingiva and soft tissues of the face and neck. The spread of mandibular dental infections into the neck depends greatly on their location in relation to the mylohyoid muscle, as mentioned above.

Cellulitis in its early stages can be identified and treated in the outpatient setting and requires only a physical exam for evaluation.

Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) can be used to evaluate for abscess formation if there is a concern.

A contrasted CT scan of the neck and face should be considered in cases where concern for complex abscess formation or spread to deep neck spaces is suspected.
