In Alaskan Natives and American Indian populations, environmental and genetic risk factors contribute to substance and alcohol use disorder. Genetically, in respect to alcohol use disorder, some populations of Alaskan Natives and American Indians are less likely than other ethnic groups to carry the protective variation of genes that produce the enzymes to metabolize alcohol, including alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.

These protective genes are located at specific alleles, including ADH1B, ADH1C, and ALDH2.

These individuals are often protected from excess alcohol ingestion due to these undesirable side effects that occur with the initial consumption. Alaskan Natives and American Indians are susceptible to the same environmental risk factors for alcohol and substance abuse found in all populations, including a family history of substance abuse, specific personality characteristics, psychiatric comorbidities, gender, and trauma exposure.

Another factor influencing the rates of alcohol and drug abuse within the American Indian and Alaskan Native populations is their communityâ€™s acceptance of recreational substances. Many reservations often capitalize on selling cigarettes and alcohol at a lower cost due to the lower tax rates found on tribal reservations.
