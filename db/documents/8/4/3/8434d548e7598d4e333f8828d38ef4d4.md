Children and their parents/carers should be counseled about the severity and prognosis of these injuries. Nondisplaced and minimally displaced fracturesÂ have the best long-term outcomes.

Displaced fractures are more severe injuries and may result in a late deformity despite appropriate treatment. Nerve injury at the time of injury often recovers spontaneously without intervention; however, further investigation is warranted if this does not occur. Nerve injury is also a risk of surgical fixation with percutaneous pinning. Blood vessel (arterial) injury can also occur at the time of injury or surgery. Other serious complications, such as compartment syndrome, should also be highlighted. A high index of suspicion is warranted. Early, appropriate treatment improves outcomes, even in severe cases.
