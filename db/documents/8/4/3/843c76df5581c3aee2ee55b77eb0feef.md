Simulation has emerged as an important modality for medical education and training. In recent years, it has become more commonplace throughout the healthcare system. This process improves knowledge, competency, and communication among providers, leading to improved patient care. Traditionally, simulations occur in a simulation center, whereas in situ simulation offers healthcare professionals a unique learning opportunity within the confines of their actual work environment. In this, simulation becomes physically integrated into the clinical or work environment. Simulation canÂ replicate various aspects of real clinical practice. Many facilities do not have space or finances to support a traditional simulation center. In these circumstances, in situ simulation is physically integrated into the clinical or work environment. It offers a unique opportunity to practice critical, non-technical skills, particularly teamwork.
