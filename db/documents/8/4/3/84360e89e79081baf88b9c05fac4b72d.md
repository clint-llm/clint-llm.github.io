Phospholipase A (PLA) comprises a supergroup of esterase enzymes present in all human cells that play a key role in mediating the production of free fatty acids and lysophospholipids from glycerophospholipids. These enzymes are essential for regulating homeostasis and disease pathogenesis in every organ system based on their activation and involvement in inflammatory mediation. Over 30 isoforms of PLA have been identified to date and differÂ heavily in function, cofactor requirement, and size. The isoforms fall into six main groups, including cytosolic PLA, Ca-independent PLA, secretory PLA, lysosomal PLA, adipose-specific PLA, and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase. Within each of these groups, research has identified numerous subtypes. This article will focus on summarizing the critical roles for each of the six studied PLA subtypes.
