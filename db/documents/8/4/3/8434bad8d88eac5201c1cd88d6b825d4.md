Patients should be educated regarding lifestyle changes, particularly if CCh is associated with blepharitis and KCS, including avoidance of exacerbating factors (e.g., fans, air conditioners, heating vents, use of digital devices), diet change (low caffeine/alcohol intake, supplementation of fatty acids) and lid care. A recent study showed that the quality of life of patients with CCh was strongly determined by their tear-film instability and increased friction during blinking.
