Managing patients with bites from a bedbug infestation is best approached as a team effort. The clinicians should provide the treatment and guidance to patients and families, local pharmacists help the patients find over-the-counter anti-itch creams to treat symptoms, and patients and families will work with case management and other community sources to guide and coordinate the elimination of the infestation in the patient's home. The key to bedbug bites is to prevent them in the first place. Patients who travel should check their luggage, clothes, and shoes before returning home after a stay in a hotel. It is also essential to check the hotel room for bed bugs, and if there is any suspicion of bed bugs, one should not stay in that hotel. Eradicating bedbugs from home requires a professional. These insects are very resistant to conventional insecticides, and in many cases, toys, and other items may have to be discarded. Thorough vacuuming is often necessary, combined with heat treatment. Patients should be advised against arbitrarily spraying the home with pesticides and insecticides, as this is more likely to result in toxicity to the humans rather than the bedbug. In some cases, it may take weeks or months to eradicate the bedbug.
