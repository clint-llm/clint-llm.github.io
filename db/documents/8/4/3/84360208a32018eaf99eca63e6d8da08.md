No strict contraindications exist for SPECT or PET imaging besides the inability to cooperate with the exam or position the patient in the scanner safely. Anaphylactic reactions to SPECT/PET radiotracers are extremely rare and may warrant using a different type of radiotracer.

Acetazolamide is contraindicated in patients with sulfa allergies, severe electrolyte imbalances, and severe liver or kidney dysfunction.
