- Trichosporon spp. are basidiomycetous, yeast-like, anamorphic organisms that are widely distributed in nature and found predominantly in tropical and temperate areas.

- Hematologic malignancies, neutropenia, HIV/AIDS, end-stage renal disease, corticosteroid use, solid tumors, intravascular devices, prosthetic heart valves, and hemochromatosis are all considered risk factors for invasive Trichosporon infection.

- First-line treatment of Trichosporon is with azoles, either topical (ketoconazole) for superficial infections or oral/parenteral (voriconazole) for disseminated infections. Voriconazole, isavuconazole, and posaconazole show excellent in vitro activity against Trichosporon.

- Echinocandins are not effective against Trichosporon. The echinocandins caspofungin and micafungin showed poor in vitro activity against Trichosporon when used alone.
