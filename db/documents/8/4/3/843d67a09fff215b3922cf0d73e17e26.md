- A high index of suspicion is necessary for TA in newborns with cyanosis and left axis deviation/left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG.

- Patients with TA have a single left ventricle (systemic ventricle), and hence, among the single ventricles have the best long term Fontan procedure outcomes.

- Among single ventricles, TA was the first type for which the Fontan palliation was performed in 1971.
