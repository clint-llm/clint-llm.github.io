In Peters anomaly patients, the main goal of management is to improve vision and prevent amblyopia. The management options include medical therapy or surgery.

**Medical Management**

Medical management includes occlusion therapy with or without mydriasis. Occlusion therapy is effective in mild cases only to prevent amblyopia.

Indications of occlusion therapy include:

- Corneal opacity that is not too dense and with visible fundus

- Unilateral corneal opacity in Peters anomaly

- Asymmetric bilateral corneal opacity

Medical management is also required to control intraocular pressure before and after glaucoma surgery.

**Surgical Management**

Definitive treatment of the Peters anomaly is surgical, but the decision to perform surgery at a young age depends on multiple factors. The surgical intervention relies on the density of corneal opacity, the status of cornea, lens, and other ocular abnormalities.

Surgical options include:

- A) Peripheral iridectomy: This can be done in cases where corneal opacity was limited with a clear periphery and a transparent lens.

- B) Penetrating keratoplasty with cataract extraction (if the lens is also involved).

Indications of penetrating keratoplasty include:

- Pupil occluding the corneal opacity even after dilation with a dilating agent

- Corneal opacity that is too dense with no view of the fundus

- Bilateral dense corneal opacity

Pediatric Keratoplasty Association conducted a survey and noticed that in infants, 65% of corneal grafts are done for Peters anomaly patients.

The risk of Graft Failure increases in these cases:

- Larger and smaller grafts

- Anterior synechiae

- Central nervous system abnormality- Uncooperative patients may have poor postoperative care and compliance.

- Young age

- An increased postoperative inflammatory response

- Other associated congenital ocular defects

**Keratoprostheses**are indicated after multiple failed penetrating keratoplasties and in patients with severe corneal disease. The outcome of this intervention is very poor due to glaucoma, endophthalmitis, and retinal detachment.

**Glaucoma surgery,**including trabeculectomy, diode laser cyclophotocoagulation, trabeculectomy with mitomycin C, and glaucoma drainage device, is generally performed. Primarily, the intraocular pressure can be controlled surgically, but adjunctive medical management may be required.
