As discussed, it is essential to understand the anatomy of the laryngeal cartilages as pathology can cause airway compromise. Pediatricians must be aware of this when dealing with epiglottitis and croup. Surgeons, anesthetists, or emergency physicians attempting to gain emergency airway access in cases of ‘cannot intubate, cannot ventilate’ require a working knowledge of the surface anatomy of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. This knowledge allows identification of the cricothyroid membrane and a cricothyroidotomy to insert an infraglottic endotracheal tube. Otolaryngologists must have a detailed understanding of the laryngeal cartilages as anatomical landmarks during surgery and as sites of invasion of laryngeal cancer that significantly impact staging, prognosis, and management.
