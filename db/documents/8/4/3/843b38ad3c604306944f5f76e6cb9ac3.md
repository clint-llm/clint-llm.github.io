Utilize the Dix-Hallpike maneuver prior to performing the Epley Maneuver as it will allow for localization of the canalith. The following scenario will assume otolith localization to the right inner ear; simply reverse the directions if the otolith is on the contralateral side. A pillow may be placed on the bed and used to allow for the extension of the head past the horizontal.

Positioning: The patient is seated on the exam table, upright. The operator is standing behind the patient, near the head of the bed.
