Vaginal delivery is the preferred method for childbirth; however, there are certain conditions when vaginal delivery is contraindicated. Certain conditions require immediate conversion of vaginal delivery toÂ an emergent cesarean section for childbirth, while some conditions can spontaneously resolve, and trial of vaginal delivery can be attempted.

Conditions that require prompt cesarean section and are contraindications to vaginal delivery can be categorized by the system; certain presentations such as footling breech, frank breech, complete breech, and cord prolapse are indications for emergent conversion to cesarean section.

Relative contraindications also exist for vaginal delivery. There are certain conditions where vaginal delivery can be tried. During labor, if the fetus presents in a brow situation, this may spontaneously convert to face or vertex presentations, which can then progress to vaginal delivery. Nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns, such as Category II and Category III fetal heart rate tracings that can signal fetal hypoxia or acidosis, may represent cord compression and entrapment can indicate avoidance of vaginal delivery.
