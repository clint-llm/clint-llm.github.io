An ophthalmologist should evaluate anyone with a strong family history of LCD. Early diagnosis is vital in children to avoid the development of amblyopia. Genetic counseling and testing may be helpful in diagnosis and family planning. Patients with diagnosed LCD should be followed closely by an ophthalmologist, and treatments should not be delayed. The patientâ€™s pediatrician should be informed of the corneal findings so that appropriate workup for systemic amyloidosis may be completed if necessary.
