Any minor QC flaw in imaging instruments can impact the overall outcome of the image and the diagnostic decision-making process. Every NM department must have a robust QA plan to avoid any minor imaging instrument flaws and maintain the highest standards of image production for a more extended period. The NM department QA plan should be reviewed and updated every two years. A bi-annual review of the department's quality control protocols is highly recommended, and local regulatory bodies should evaluate the results. All employees should be encouraged to participate in any ongoing training opportunities to learn more about QA procedures.
