The blood supply to the left anterolateral papillary muscles derives from branches of the left coronary artery. The blood supply to the left posteromedial papillary muscles most commonly derives from the right coronary artery. In some cases, posteromedial papillary muscles receiving blood supply from branches of the left circumflex artery.[9] The dominant circulation explains this variance in supply in the heart. The article “Papillary Muscle Perfusion Pattern, A Hypothesis for Ischemic Papillary Muscle Dysfunction” by Voci et al. (1995) found the posteromedial papillary muscle to have perfusion by only one vessel in 63% of patients, while the anterolateral papillary muscle more often demonstrated perfusion by multiple vessels.

The blood supply to the anterior papillary muscle of the right ventricle most commonly originates from vessels branching from the left and right coronary arteries, with some anatomical variants receiving blood supply originating only from the left coronary artery.

The lymphatic supply of the papillary muscles forms from lymphatic plexuses with a range of lymphatic vessel sizes.
