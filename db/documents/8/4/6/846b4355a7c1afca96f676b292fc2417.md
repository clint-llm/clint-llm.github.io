Patients that undergo mastoidectomy require an interprofessional team approach for optimal outcomes. Aside from the surgeon, the team includes an anesthesiologist or certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), circulating surgical nurse, surgical technician, and sometimes a video technician. Good communication among all of the team members during the procedure will help to improve outcomes and minimize complications. Post-anesthesia care unit nurses monitor the patient closely after the procedure and good communication with the surgeon is vital should any postoperative complications arise. Postoperative ototopicals are often utilized. Sometimes enteral antibiotics are also prescribed. Pharmacy staff can enhance postoperative care by answering the patient’s questions regarding the medication. There are various randomized controlled trials regarding different techniques, training exercises, and postoperative care. Future high-quality studies will likely address indications for mastoidectomy.
