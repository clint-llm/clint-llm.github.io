In the presence of chronically elevated pulmonary artery pressure, progressive histological changes occur in the pulmonary vasculature. In the pulmonary arteries and arterioles, there is medial hypertrophy, marked intimal fibrosis, and thickening of the adventitial layer with occasional plexiform lesions. The intimal lesions account for the most deleterious effects on reducing the lumen of the pulmonary artery and typically comprise of fibrotic, plexiform, and concentric lesions. The concentric lesions are organized myofibroblasts or endothelial cells that form “onion-skin” layers seen in severe forms of pulmonary hypertension.
