Terazosin is generally well-tolerated. Many adverse effects of terazosin are explainable due to its blockade of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors.

- Statistically significant adverse effects associated with terazosin detected in placebo-controlled trials listed in the FDA database include dizziness, headache, weakness, postural hypotension, and nasal congestion.

- First-dose syncope is rare and may be mitigated by bedtime use. Orthostatic hypotension is common and should merit strong consideration when prescribing terazosin.

- According to the FDA, post-marketing surveys also found priapism, atrial fibrillation, anaphylaxis, and intraoperative floppy iris syndrome associated with terazosin use, though instances of such occurrences were extremely rare.

**Drug Interactions**

Terazosin has been used in many patients on various concomitant medicines; while these interactions are not studied extensively, no interactions are observed.
