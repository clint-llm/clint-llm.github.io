The pulmonary valve receives its innervation from the nerve branch of cardiac ventricular plexus. The entire leaflets contain these nerve terminals except for the coapting edge (the ventricular layer or the lower region of each leaflet). Compared to the aortic valve leaflets, the pulmonary valve leaflets contained more numerous nerve terminals. The activity of acetylcholinesterase or tyrosine hydroxylase and neuropeptide Y are observable in these nerve terminals. With age, the density and distribution of innervation in the aortic valve leaflets decrease, but this does not occur in the pulmonary valve leaflets.
