Patients with a type 1, sliding hernia, do not require surgical management. Medical management of reflux disease with proton-pump inhibitors and H-2 blockers is the mainstay of therapy. Surgical management of asymptomatic patients with paraesophageal hernias also remains controversial. Most experts do not recommend surgical management in asymptomatic patients because the annual risk of developing symptoms in which emergent surgical intervention is necessary is around 2%, yet the mortality rate for elective repair is approximately 1.5%. While consensus is not clear on asymptomatic patients, there is unanimous agreement symptomatic patients benefit from elective surgical repair. The standard of care is laparoscopic repair consisting of four key elements: excision of the hernia sac, maintaining the adequate length of the intra-abdominal esophagus, repair of the hiatal defect, and gastric fixation with the antireflux procedure.
