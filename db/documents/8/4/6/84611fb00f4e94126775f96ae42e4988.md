Pythium is a parasitic aquatic oomycete belonging to phylum Straminipila, order Pythiales, class oomycetes, and family Pythiaceae. It closely resembles fungal keratitis hence also labeled as  “parafungus” or “fungus-like organism.”

It is known to infect animals and humans, where it causes systemic and ocular infections. The organism is usually seen in aquatic habitats with a high prevalence in tropical, subtropical, and temperate conditions. It is more common in males, particularly field workers.

The morphological and microbiological profile also closely mimics fungus. Hence the organism is usually diagnosed by zoospore formation on culture media. The medical management options available are antifungals, antibacterials, and cyanoacrylate glue.Pythium keratitis. Hence, antibacterials are the drug of choice in today’s era.

Early therapeutic keratoplasty is warranted in non-resolving progressive cases.
