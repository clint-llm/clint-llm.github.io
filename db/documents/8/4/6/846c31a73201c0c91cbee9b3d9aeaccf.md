Zonisamide is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity or severe allergic reactions to zonisamide or sulfonamides.

**Drug Interactions**

- Zonisamide is primarily metabolized through CYP 3A4 and has a potential for drug interactions involving these enzyme systems. Ketoconazole, dihydroergotamine, cyclosporine A, and triazolam inhibit zonisamide metabolism by 85% to 95% compared to control. Other CYP 3A inhibitors like diazepam, erythromycin, lidocaine, and terfenadine, can cause a reduction in metabolism by 35 to 45%. Patients receiving CYP 3A inhibitors require lower doses of zonisamide.

- Drugs that can induce CYP 3A can increase the metabolism of zonisamide. Phenytoin and carbamazepine have induced zonisamide metabolism. Other known inducers of hepatic metabolism like phenobarbital and primidone also can increase the metabolism of zonisamide. The dose of zonisamide may need to be increased when used in combination with known CYP 3A inducers.

- Zonisamide does not induce or inhibit hepatic enzymes and does not cause any clinically significant alteration in the pharmacokinetic disposition of other drugs.

- A high concentration of CYP 3A4 in the intestinal wall can metabolize drugs before they are absorbed into the systemic circulation. Some foods like grapefruit juice and lemon juice contain substances that can inhibit the activity of intestinal CYP 3A4. When zonisamide is taken with foods that can inhibit the activity of intestinal CYP3A4, there is potential for increased absorption and adverse effects.
