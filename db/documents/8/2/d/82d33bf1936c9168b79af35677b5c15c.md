Although there is a steadily growing body of data on hyperoxia, the quantity of high-quality information on its clinical effects trails behind. The present list of evidence-based indications for hyperoxia is much more limited than the broad spectrum of clinical conditionsÂ such as impaired oxygen delivery, cellular hypoxia, tissue edema, inflammation, and infection that can potentially be mitigated by oxygen therapy.

The easy accessibility of normobaric hyperoxia calls for a much more dynamic attempt to characterize its potential clinical efficacy. The all-around beneficial profile of actions of hyperoxia justifies an appropriately funded prospective research approach that will establish the efficacy of a safe range of nontoxic doses and treatment duration.
