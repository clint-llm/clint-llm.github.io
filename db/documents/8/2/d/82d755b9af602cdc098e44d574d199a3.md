WE is a serious life-threatening disorder with enormous disability. While thiamine can induce partial improvement, the neuropsychological deficits persist in many cases. The confusional state usually improves when IV thiamine is administered by the learning and memory deficits only improve partially. A small number of patients fail to have any improvement and may develop Korsakoff psychosis, which often requires institutionalization. Very few individuals recover at this point.
