The bundle of His comprises of a complex organization of cells, predominantly consisting of Purkinje-type cells, slender transitional cells, broad transitional cells, and varying amounts of pacemaker cells.

The pacemaker (P) cells are oval in shape and contain “sparse and randomly oriented myofibrils,” simple membranes, and trivial amounts of sarcoplasmic reticulum.

The bundle of His is an elongated segment connecting the AV Node and the left and right bundle branches of the septal crest. It is approximately 1.8 cm long in an adult heart

The bundle of His is characterized by longitudinal collagen partitioning histology, distinguishing it from the AV node.

The intercalated discs in the bundle of His differ from the myocardial cells such that the discs in the bundle of His are oriented obliquely compared to the perpendicular alignment seen in the myocardium cross-sectional view. The bundle of His appears to have more “tongue-and-groove joints” compared to the “jagged perpendicular line” in the myocardium. Also, more tight junctions are found in the Purkinje cells of the bundle of His than in the intercalated discs of the myocardium.
