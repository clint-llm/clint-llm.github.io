The structures of the knee receive much of their blood supply from a plexus of arteries with branches from the popliteal artery and femoral artery. The popliteal artery branches off the superficial femoral artery and runs posteriorly across the knee joint. The superior medial, inferior medial, superior lateral, and inferior lateral genicular arteries branch off the popliteal artery and travel anteriorly to anastomose with other parts of the plexus. Also, a descending genicular artery branches off the superficial femoral artery and anastomoses anteriorly with the other genicular arteries. The anterior and posterior tibial recurrent arteries travel laterally from the anterior tibial artery and also contribute to the plexus. The middle genicular artery travels directly into the joint. In addition, the sural arteries branch off the popliteal artery and travel inferiorly away from the midline. The flexor muscles are supplied mainly by the inferior gluteal, perforating, popliteal, deep femoral, and sural arteries. The femoral artery primarily supplies the extensor muscles.

Much of the lymphatic drainage from the knee and lower leg travel to the popliteal lymph nodes in the popliteal fossa. The popliteal nodes, along with other knee and lower limb lymphatics, drain into the deep inguinal and sub inguinal nodes. The lymphatic system primarily follows vasculature.
