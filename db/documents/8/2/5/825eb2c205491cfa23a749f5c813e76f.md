The differential diagnosis of early-onset includes (differences are written in parenthesis): spinal muscular atrophy 1 (no cardiac involvement), Danon disease (X-linked inherited)

For late-onset: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (no affection of axial muscles), Duchenne-Becker muscular dystrophy (X-linked inherited). Other glycogen storage disorders can be considered; however, the main difference consists of a lack of hypoglycemia in GSD2.
