Initially, the studies should include cardiac monitoring, electrocardiogram, assessment of oxygenation and monitoring of urine output, serum electrolytes, calcium, renal function, glucose, serum lithium level, and thyroid-stimulating hormone

- Patients are susceptible to renal insufficiency with elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine in case of chronic intoxication

- If the initial diagnosis is unclear, brain imaging may be required

- Lithium serum levels normally range from approximately 0.6 to 1.2 mEq/L. Measurement of the serum levels should be carried out at least 6 to 12 hours after the last therapeutic dose to avoid misinterpretation of pre-distributional levels.

Of note, lithium heparin is used as an anticoagulant in some specimen tubes which can falsely increase results of serum lithium
