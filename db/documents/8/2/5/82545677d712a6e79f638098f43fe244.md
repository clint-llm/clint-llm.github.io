Sputum, tracheal washings, or tracheal secretions can be sent for microscopic analysis, including gram stain, cell count, neutrophil count, aerobic cultures, anaerobic cultures, and/or fungal cultures. These usually reveal neutrophilia and the identification of bacterial species. Often, bacterial tracheitis is polymicrobial. Infection of the tracheal mucosa causes local inflammation, swelling, thick exudates, pseudomembranes, and necrosis of the larynx, trachea, and mainstem bronchi. A biopsy is rarely performed unless there is a concern for underlying malignancy or another neoplasm.
