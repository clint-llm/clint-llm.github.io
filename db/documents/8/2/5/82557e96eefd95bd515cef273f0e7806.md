Mandibular body fractures may be associated with significant other traumatic injuries. In some cases, the airway may also undergo compromise. Hence, to enhance outcomes, care of such patients should be achieved with an interprofessionalÂ team approach that includes clinicians and specialty-trained emergency and trauma nurses. For example, if the occlusion is affected, a prosthodontist must be consulted to achieve the patient's maximum and best possible occlusion. Also, in cases of edentulous patients where the fabrication of dentures or a gunning splint is necessary, a prosthodontist can help in fabricating the prosthesis with an appropriate vertical dimension. The trauma nurse will have involvement through the surgical or reduction procedures. Other nursing will have responsibility for monitoring the patient's progress, dietary compliance, and answering any patient questions, keeping the clinician team informed every step of the way. With an interprofessional team approach, patients with mandibular fractures can achieve their optimal outcome and have increased odds of resuming a normal life.[Level 5]
