The bony pelvis and lower limbs receive their vascular supply from the distal continuations of the right and left common iliac arteries. The primary blood supply to the bony pelvis is from the divisions of iliac arteries; the lower limbs receive supply via the obturator artery and divisions of the common femoral artery.

The blood supply to the lower limbs and pelvis has several significant medical, musculoskeletal, and surgical considerations that make a thorough understanding of the anatomy vital to patient care. The goal of this article is to provide a review of the arterial supply of the bony pelvis and lower limb to improve practitioner knowledge and medical care.
