Salivary gland neoplasms encompass a wide array of different histologies and locations, including the parotid, submandibular gland, sublingual gland, and minor salivary glands of the upper aerodigestive tract. The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2017 recognized 11 different benign epithelial salivary gland tumors. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of benign salivary gland tumors and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of benign salivary gland tumors.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with a benign salivary gland tumor.
- Review the management of patients with benign salivary gland tumors.
