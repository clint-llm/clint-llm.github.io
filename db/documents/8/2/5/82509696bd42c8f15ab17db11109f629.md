Each part of the human body develops from either ectoderm, mesoderm, or endoderm. Muscles, bone, connective tissue, lymphatics, blood, and other structures originate from the mesoderm. Limb buds develop from mesenchymal cells that are activated by lateral plate mesoderm around four weeks of gestational age. The limbs become anatomically positioned at birth through the interaction of several growth factors. Essential growth factors include sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and the homeobox (Hox) genes. SHH allows for the proper growth and development of the limbs and interacts with FGF to ensure the normal development of each limb. FGF and Wnt-7 genes contribute to lengthening and dorsal-ventral positioning of the limbs, respectively. Both are localized at the apical ridge. Hox genes are responsible for segmental development in the craniocaudal direction. Specifically, the posterior thigh muscles derive from the paraxial mesoderm of the lower limb buds. Around week 8 of gestational development, the lower limbs begin to rotate medially. This rotation allows the hamstring muscles to reach their final posterior position.
