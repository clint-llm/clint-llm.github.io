Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is a clinical syndrome where a thickened fibro-collagenous peritoneal membrane can encase parts of the small intestine, leading to recurrent small bowel obstructions and malnutrition. This rare disorder is most strongly associated with long-term peritoneal dialysis, as dialysis can cause chronic inflammation and subsequent sclerosis.

Multiple episodes of severe peritoneal infections or systemic inflammatory disorders can predispose a patient to EPS. EPS is also a potentialÂ late-onset complication of kidney transplantation in the absence of systemic inflammation.
