Knee dislocations are infrequently encountered but are potentially limb-threatening injuries. Obesity is an independent risk factor for sustaining this injury. Many knee dislocations can reduce spontaneously prior to clinical evaluation; hence, the diagnosis can be difficult, and the complications from the injury are easy to miss.Â  Undiagnosed vascular injury can lead to prolonged limb ischemia and ultimately amputation.
