Plummer-Vinson syndrome is best managed by an interprofessional team comprised of a primary care practitioner and gastroenterologist. Although esophagogastroduodenoscopies are often performed as the initial evaluation in patients with dysphagia, abnormalities such as rings or webs may be missed. Such patients should be evaluated further with a barium esophagogram. Patients and primary care practitioners need to be aware of the small risk of malignancy associated with this condition. Such patients require long-term follow-up with prompt evaluation if new symptoms such as recurrent dysphagia or weight loss develop.
