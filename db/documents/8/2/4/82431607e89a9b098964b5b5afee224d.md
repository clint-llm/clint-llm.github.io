The rehab process is an important aspect of the management of hamstring injury and plays a crucial role in making the transition back to the sport. A rehabilitation program that encompasses progressive agility and stabilization of the trunk exercises are more effective than a program emphasizing the isolated hamstring muscle**.******A Swedish study found that a rehabilitation protocol emphasizing lengthening type of exercises is more effective than a protocol containing conventional exercises in promoting the time to return to sports.****

A systematic review found that to speed up the process, consideration should also be given to the lumbar spine, sacroiliac, and pelvic alignment as well as posture control mechanisms.****Lengthening hamstring exercises showed the fastest return to play with a lower reinjury rate compared to the conventional hamstring exercises. Treating with PRP after the injury had no proven effect on time to return to play and reinjury risk.

Proximal injuries involving the semimembranosus and its proximal free tendon were associated with prolonged recovery time.****A systematic review found the factors associated with the prolonged recovery time. These were stretching type injuries, recreational type sports, a greater range of motion deficit with the hip flexed at 90°, time to the first consultation less than one week, increased pain on the visual analog scale, and less than one day to be able to walk pain-free after the injury. A rehabilitation program that comprises loading hamstring during extensive lengthening showed evidence of an early return to sport. Besides that, 4 different sessions every day of static hamstring stretching also showed promising results in decreasing time to return to play.
