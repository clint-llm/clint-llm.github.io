The patient is generally placed in the supine position, although they can also be in the upright seated position. Sedation is uncommonly used; however, fentanyl can be administered intravenously if indicated. Examine both nostrils to identify any septal deviation. The use of 2% topical lidocaine gel for significant pain reduction is recommended, which also provides lubrication for the crossing of the nasopharynx. The tube is inserted into the nares after adequate lubrication, with or without the use of a guidewire, depending on the case.  Fluoroscopy is utilized for real-time visualization as the tube traverses through its path to its final destination in the stomach.
