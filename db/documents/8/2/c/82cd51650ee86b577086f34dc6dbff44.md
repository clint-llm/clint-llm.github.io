Healthcare professionals do not universally agree upon the embryological development of the knee joint. One common theory is the menisci, cruciate ligaments, and a joint cavity all develop when the fetus is 8 weeks old. Over the next 2 weeks, the septa of the synovium are resorbed, and larger cavitation develops which ultimately becomes the knee joint. If this larger cavitation fails to join togetherÂ fully, mesenchymal tissue may develop synovial folds. These synovial folds are plicae.
