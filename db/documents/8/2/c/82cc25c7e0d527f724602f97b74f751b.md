The genitofemoral nerve can be injured during surgery in several ways:

- It can be lacerated during injury to the groin. This can occur with penetrating trauma, a knife wound, or surgical exploration of the groin. In some cases, during surgery on the saphenous vein for varicose vein ligation, retractors can cause abrasive injury.

- The genitofemoral nerve can also be injured in the inguinal canal, usually during inguinal hernia repair. In most cases, the injury is unnoticed during surgery and diagnosed in the postoperative period when the patient complains of pain.

- The genitofemoral nerve can also be injured during a motor vehicle accident. The lower back injury may result in an extension of the back while the patient is seated.

- Lifting heavy objects can also cause injury to the genitofemoral nerve.

- When there is spinal stenosis of the L1 or L2 segments, compression fracture, or metastatic lesions to the lumbar spine, the nerve roots, which give rise to the genitofemoral nerve, can be injured.

- Psoas abscess which may occur after an open pelvic fracture or a retroperitoneal hematoma, is also known to cause irritation of the genitofemoral nerve.
