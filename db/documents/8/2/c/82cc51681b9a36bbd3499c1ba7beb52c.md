Morphologically, NK cells are large, granular lymphocytes that are defined by expression of CD56 and CD16 and lack the common T cell marker, CD3, and T cell receptor (TCR) in humans. They constitute 5-15% of the total population of peripheral mononuclear circulating lymphocytes

A variety of activating or inhibitory receptors have been demonstrated on the surface of NK cells as their immunoreceptor. Inhibitory receptors have cytoplasmic tyrosine-based inhibition motifs and recognize self major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules expressed by most of the nucleated cells. However, activating receptors recognize the ligands exhibited by pathological cells and interact with cell signaling pathways to initiate effector activities. Examples of their activating receptors are CD16, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, NKG2C/CD94, and NKG2D/CD94. NK cells have distinct cytoplasmic granules that are structurally and functionally similar to lysosomes, hence called “secretory lysosomes.” These granules have a bilayered membrane that separates their lytic content from the cytoplasm.
