Brain MRI with and without contrast is the gold standard for diagnosis.Â It is essential to notify radiologists to focus imaging in the hypothalamic region to avoid misdiagnosis. Hypothalamic hamartomas differ from the normal grey matter due to decreased intensity in T1 weighted images and increased intensity in T2 weighted images.

Head computed tomographic scan shows a small non-enhancing lesion near the interpeduncular and suprasellar cisterns, usually isodense to the brain. This imaging tool is now considered inadequate for detecting hypothalamic hamartomas and adds additional unnecessary radiation exposure to patients.

Electroencephalography (EEG) usually appears normal during gelastic seizures, although it may be beneficial when other seizure types are present. Continuous video 24-hour EEG would be able to film the patient's laughter spells but do not show any electrical ictal activity during the gelastic seizure. Interictal and ictal EEG may show focal, multifocal, or general spikes in patients with other seizure types and may be beneficial for diagnosis.

Single-photon emission computed tomography show hyperperfusion by the hamartoma after gelastic seizures and normal perfusion in the interictal phase.
