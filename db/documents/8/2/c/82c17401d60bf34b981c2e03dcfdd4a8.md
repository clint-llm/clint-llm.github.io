The distinguishing clinical feature of MG is the fluctuating muscle weakness that varies in severity, worsens with physical activity, and improves with rest. It can be precipitated by a wide variety of factors like infections, surgery, immunization, heat, emotional stress, pregnancy, drugs (commonly aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, beta-blockers, neuromuscular blocking agents), and worsening of chronic medical illnesses. In history taking, patients should be asked about the timing of the symptoms, at what time of the day do the symptoms usually occurs, as well as improvement with rest. Inquire about subtle signs like coughing after swallowing, increase time to finish eating, hoarseness of the voice, easy fatiguability in the climbing up stairs, and slow and frequent errors in writing or typing; these symptoms are most prominent at the end of the day or work shift.

The most common symptoms include the following:

- Extraocular Muscle Weakness: Around 85% of patients will have this on the initial presentation. Common patient complaints include diplopia, ptosis, or both. These symptoms can progress and cause generalized MG involving the bulbar, axial, and limb muscles in 50% of patients in two years.

- Bulbar Muscle Weakness: This can be the initial presentation in 15% of patients and causes symptoms like difficulty chewing or frequent choking, dysphagia, hoarseness, and dysarthria.

- Limb Weakness: This usually involves the proximal muscles more than distal muscles, with the upper limbs more affected than the lower limbs.

- Myasthenic crisis: It is due to the involvement of intercostal muscles and diaphragm and is a medical emergency.

There are no autonomic symptoms like palpitations, bowel, or bladder disturbances that occur in MG as it only involves the nicotinic cholinergic receptors.

The physical examination may reveal normal muscle power because of the fluctuating disease pattern. In such cases, repeated or sustained muscle contractions can demonstrate weakness. Improvement is seen after a period of rest or application of ice (ice-pack test) to the muscle group involved. The pupils, deep tendon reflexes, and sensory examinations are normal.

MuSK MG has clinical features that are quite different from n-AChR MG. It is more common in females, relatively spares extraocular muscles, and commonly involves bulbar, facial, and neck muscles. Myasthenic crisis is also frequent in the MuSK MG.

**Clinical Classification:**The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) clinical classification divides MG into 5 main classes based on the clinical features and the disease severity. Each class carries different prognoses or responses to therapy.

- **Class I:**Involves any ocular muscle weakness, including weakness of eye closure. All other muscle groups are normal.

- **Class II:**Involves mild weakness of muscles other than ocular muscles. Ocular muscle weakness of any severity may be present.

- **Class IIa:**Involves predominant weakness of the limb, axial muscles, or both. It may also involve the oropharyngeal muscles to a lesser extent.

- **Class IIb:**Involves mostly oropharyngeal, respiratory muscles, or both. It can have the involvement of limb, axial muscles, or both to a lesser extent.

- **Class III:**Involves muscles other than ocular muscles moderately. Ocular muscle weakness of any severity can be present.

- **Class IIIa:**involves the limb, axial muscles, or both predominantly. Oropharyngeal muscles can be involved to a lesser degree.

- **Class IIIb:**Involves oropharyngeal, respiratory muscles, or both predominantly. The limb, axial muscles, or both can have lesser or equal involvement.

- **Class IV:**Involves severe weakness of affected muscles. Ocular muscle weakness of any severity can be present.

- **Class IVa:**Involves limb, axial muscles, or both predominantly. Oropharyngeal muscles can be involved to a lesser degree.

- **Class IVb:**Involves oropharyngeal, respiratory muscles, or both predominantly. The limb, axial muscles, or both can have lesser or equal involvement. It also includes patients requiring feeding tubes without intubation.

- **Class V:**Involves intubation with or without mechanical ventilation, except when employed during routine postoperative management.
