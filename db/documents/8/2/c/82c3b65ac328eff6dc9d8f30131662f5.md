Renal angiomyolipomas most often occur as "sporadic" cases (80%), which are isolated but may also be associated with certain "hereditary" conditions (20%) such as tuberous sclerosis and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

Hereditary angiomyolipomas, associated with tuberous sclerosis complex or pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, are caused by a genetic mutation in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes.

Compared to the more common sporadic type, hereditary angiomyolipomas (associated with tuberous sclerosis or lymphangioleiomyomatosis) are likely to be larger, begin at an earlier age, be multicentric and bilateral, grow more quickly, hemorrhage, develop chronic renal failure, and undergo malignant transformation.

**Tuberous sclerosis**is a rare, familial, autosomal dominant genetic disorder that causes benign tumors to develop in various body parts, usually affecting the brain, eyes, heart, lungs, and kidneys. It is also associated with adenoma sebaceum, epilepsy, and mental deficiencies.

Patients with tuberous sclerosis tend to have larger angiomyolipomas when diagnosed (32% will be >3 cm), are more likely to have bilateral and multifocal lesions, and have twice the rate of tumors that increase in size over time compared to non-tuberous sclerosis AML patients.

**Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis**is an exceedingly rare genetic disease often associated with angiomyolipomas that may sometimes be associated with tuberous sclerosis. The overall incidence is about 5 cases per one million women.

All patients newly diagnosed with lymphangioleiomyomatosis should receive renal imaging as screening for angiomyolipomas. However, due to its rarity, routine VEGF-D testing for lymphangioleiomyomatosis is not necessary or recommended for most female patients with angiomyolipomas but should be considered in younger women with multiple renal AMLs, especially if they also have pulmonary issues.
