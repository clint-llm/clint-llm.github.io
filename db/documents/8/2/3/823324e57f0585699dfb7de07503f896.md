The diagnosis of a meniscal injury is made using physical examination and provocative tests, like the Apley compression and distraction tests, in tandem with advanced imaging like MRI.

Hashemi et al. compared the Apley compression test, McMurray test, and Thessaly test in 86 patients and then confirmed their findings through MRI knee and arthroscopy. The Thessaly test was superior to the other clinical tests (P < 0.001) when evaluating meniscal injuries. Thessaly test results were superior in terms of sensitivity (90.6%), specificity (90.7%), accuracy (90.69%), and positive and negative predictive values (85.3 and 94.2). In this study, the author compared the McMurray and Apley tests and found no statistically significant difference (P=0.267).

A prospective observational study was conducted on 106 patients by Shekarchi et al. Compared to MRI results, results of the McMurray test and findings of medial joint-line tenderness were far more specific than those of the Thessaly test (89.1% and 88.0%, respectively); the Thessaly test was more sensitive for medial meniscus tears (56.2%). Regarding lateral meniscus tears, the McMurray test was the most sensitive (56.2%), while all other tests were equally specific.

In a metanalysis, Meserve et al. demonstrated that the Apley compression test had higher specificity and lower sensitivity when compared to the McMurray test.

A meta-analysis conducted by Hegedus showed that it is best to employ a variety of tests to diagnose a meniscal tear rather than relying just on one test. These clinical tests will be less helpful in identifying meniscal disease when anterior cruciate ligament pathology or chondromalacia is present.
