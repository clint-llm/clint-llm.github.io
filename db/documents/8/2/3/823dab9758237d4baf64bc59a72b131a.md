Blood supply to the head primarily derives through the external and internal carotid arteries, which have a direct branching from the aorta.  The vertebral arteries provide vascular supply the brain stem and help to form the posterior aspect of the circle of Willis.

From inside the cranium, blood drains through various sinus channels that ultimately end and join into the internal jugular vein.  Most of the blood from the superficial structures of the head drain via the external jugular vein.  Both the external and internal jugular veins join the brachiocephalic trunk in the thorax and end at the superior vena cava.

The head and neck have several lymphatic channels that help to coordinate drainage to the thoracic ducts.  The right hemicranium lymph drains to the right lymphatic duct while the left hemicranium lymph drains into the thoracic duct (on the left).  Each of these lymphatic ducts them drains into their respective (right and left) subclavian veins.
