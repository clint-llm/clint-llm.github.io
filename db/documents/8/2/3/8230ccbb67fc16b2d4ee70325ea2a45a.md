Research has identified many genes responsible for the development of cardiomyopathies (diseases of the heart muscle) in the past two decades, including those encoding for sarcomere proteins in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), cell-cell junction proteins in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AVC), cytoskeletal and sarcomere proteins in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and sarcomere or Z-disk proteins with restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM).
