The exact cause of CSH is not well understood. However, it is known that CSH incidence increases with aging, as CSH is very unlikely before the age of 50. Furthermore, it is more common in men than in women, especially those with chronic medical conditions (hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and valvular pathologies). Besides, there is an association between neurodegenerative disorders and CSH, as the prevalence of CSH is increased in patients with Parkinson disease, Alzheimer dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies. It is hypothesized that there is a degenerative pathology in theÂ medullary autonomic nuclei, which senses baroreceptors' signals resulting in exaggerated response, manifested as hypotension and bradycardia.
