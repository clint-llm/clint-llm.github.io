The United States Preventive Service Task Force recommends that primary care physicians evaluate women who are candidates for hereditary cancer genetic testing by inquiring about family history of breast, ovarian, tubal or other cancers during annual examinations. If questioning reveals increased risk, referral to a certified genetic counselor (CGC) for possible testing is indicated (Grade B recommendations). Certified genetic counselors and breast surgeons may also aid in the decision regarding tests for BRCA alone, or for different genetic mutations related to other hereditary cancers

BRCA1 mutations are seen in about 7% of families with multiple breast cancers and in about 40% of families with ovarian and breast cancer. BRCA2 mutations are found in 20% of families at high risk for ovarian and breast cancers but in less than 3% of women with earlt onset breast cancer. Other cancers associated with BRCA2 mutations include:

- Pancreas

- Prostate

- Stomach

- Bile duct

- Gallbladder

- Melanoma
