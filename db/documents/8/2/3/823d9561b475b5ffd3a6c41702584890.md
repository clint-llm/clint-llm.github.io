The abducens nerve, also known as cranial nerve VI, is responsible for ipsilateral eye abduction. Visualizing the anatomy of the nerve allows for better appreciation of the causes of abducens nerve palsy. This activity illustrates the anatomy of the abducens nerve, details diagnostic considerations, and reviews treatment options. This activity underscores the interprofessional team's role in the diagnosis and management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the observable ocular deficits typically present in abducens nerve palsy.
- Explain how the workup for abducens nerve palsy varies according to its presentation.
- Identify additional diagnoses that should be considered in patients with abducens nerve palsy. 
- Explain how collaboration amongst interprofessional team members can help inform the diagnosis and management of abducens nerve palsy, leading to better patient outcomes.
