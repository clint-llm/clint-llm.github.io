The pathophysiology of CAPD is classified into two categories based on coexisting conditions:

1) Neurological conditions

- Tumors of the CANS

- Epilepsy

- Cerebrovascular disease

- Extrinsic damage to the brain

- Prematurity and low birth weight

Very few cases of CAPD in children will have an underlying neurological pathology; nonetheless, CAPD may be the only presenting manifestation of a space-occupying lesion. For this reason, when patients present with CAPD, there must be a high level of clinical suspicion for underlying CNS pathology, and performing a thorough neurological and developmental examination is critical.

2) Delayed central nervous system maturation or other developmental disorders

Despite the fact that the human auditory system is already fully developed at birth, myelination in the higher auditory pathways is still occurring up until the ages of 10 to 12 years.
