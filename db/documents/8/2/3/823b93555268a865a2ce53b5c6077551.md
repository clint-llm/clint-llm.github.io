Entropion is an inversion or inward turning of the eyelid margin. This can result in trichiasis, where the eyelashes are directed posteriorly toward the globe. It is one of the most common eyelid malpositions. This malposition can cause corneal and conjunctival damage leading to corneal abrasions, scarring, corneal thinning, or corneal neovascularization. Entropion may be unilateral or bilateral. There are four types of entropion: congenital, involutional, acute spastic, and cicatricial. Lower eyelids are often involutional while the upper eyelid is cicatricial. Lower eyelid entropion is much more common than upper eyelid entropion. This activity aims to help clinicians identify and manage entropion by reviewing the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of this eyelid malformation. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with entropion.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of entropion.
- Summarize the presentation of a patient with entropion.
- Explain the treatment and management options available for entropion.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with entropion.
