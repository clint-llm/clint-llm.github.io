**RTSA has been used to manage and treat the following conditions:**

- Rotator cuff arthropathy,Â which is a degenerative shoulder disease caused by massive rotator cuff tear causing arthritic glenohumeral joint changes and proximal humerus migration.

- Pseudo shoulder paralysis due to irreparable massive rotator cuff tear

- Acute three or four parts proximal humerus fractures

- Post-traumatic glenohumeral arthritis

- Chronic irreducible shoulder dislocation

- Revision surgery for failed ATSA

- Revision surgery for failed proximal humerus hemiarthroplasty

- Inflammatory joint conditions, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis
