An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach is essential when noticing an idioventricular rhythm.

Care coordination between various patient care teams to determine etiology presenting idioventricular rhythm is very helpful. The patient may have underlying cardiac structural etiology, ischemia as a contributory cause, orÂ it could be secondary to anesthetic type, medication, or an electrolyte disturbance. Therefore, close coordination between teams is mandatory. Cardiology nurses monitor patients, administer medications, and inform the team about patient status. Pharmacists verify medications and check for drug-drug interactions; a board-certified cardiology pharmacist can assist the clinician team in agent selection and appropriate dosing. These interprofessional strategies will drive better patient outcomes. [Level 5]

Idioventricular rhythm is benign in most cases, and appropriate patient education and reassurance are important.
