Hypotonic labor is a dysfunction in the propulsive power of the uterus that presents as an abnormal labor pattern resulting in prolonged or protracted delivery, which is a common indication for primary cesarean section. Management options include supportive measures, medical treatment, and surgical interventions. In the absence of cephalo-pelvic disproportion and other absolute indications for cesarean delivery, the prognosis is good when the dysfunction is diagnosed early. This activity describes and highlights the role of the inter-professional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of hypotonic labor.
- Outline the typical presentation in hypotonic labor.
- Describe the management considerations in hypotonic labor.
