Because timolol is a beta-blocker, its overdose symptoms are similar to those of other beta-blockers. Many metabolic and circulatory systems depend on the free circulation of catecholamines. Overdose of beta-blockers can cause catecholamine levels to decrease sharply. This effect can lead to various symptoms, including hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, decreased myocardial contractility and oxygen consumption, tiredness, and fatigue. Clinicians should focus particular attention on patients taking anticholinergics or cardiotoxic medicines, as these may potentiate timolol’s toxic effects.

The first step in managing beta-blocker overdose is to secure the airway and administer cardiac life support if needed. Oxygen and bronchodilators can be used to treat patients with bronchospasm. Atropine should be given to patients experiencing bradycardia or requiring rapid intubation. Sodium bicarbonate and magnesium sulfate may also prove useful in managing the patient’s cardiac symptoms. IV fluids, including dextrose, glucagon, and calcium salts, can be used to treat the patient’s metabolic symptoms. Benzodiazepines can be a first-line treatment for any seizures the patient may experience. Gastrointestinal decontamination or administration of activated charcoal can help decrease the absorption of the beta-blocker in the gut.
