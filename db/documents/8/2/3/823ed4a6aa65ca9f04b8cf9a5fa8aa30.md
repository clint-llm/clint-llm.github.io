Clinically, the main feature is the progressive development of a circumscribed fibrotic ring at the base of the toes, or less frequently, the fingers.

A fibrotic band classically begins within a flexural groove. The lesion is circumferential and often slowly progresses with resultant changes distal to the constriction. Clinical criteria include three findings

- Soft tissue constriction

- Bulbous distal enlargement

- Distal thinning or lysis of phalangeal bones

The disease may manifest through four clinical stages that are visible with radiography. First, a small callus develops and transforms into a circumferential groove or fissure. Next, the portion distant to the band becomes bulbous or globular secondary to impaired lymph and venous drainage with arterial narrowing. The third stage is typified by pain as the bone becomes separated in an intra-osseous or intra-articular location. The last stage is that of bloodless, spontaneous auto-amputation.
