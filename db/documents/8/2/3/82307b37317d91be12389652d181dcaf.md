Incidence is key to understand for the health care team.  Many aspects of medicine depend on allocating resources based on either the incidence or prevalence of a disease process.  The health care team as a whole thus must concurrently decide if the case is a new case (incident case).  Additionally incidence has significant implications for public health and epidemiology as many outbreaks are identified then tracked through incidence to identify and hopefully quell the spread of the disease.
