The signs and symptoms of early-onset GBS disease are clinically indistinguishable from neonatal sepsis caused by other bacterial pathogens, such as:

- Enterobacteriaceae

- Listeria

The prominence of respiratory signs in early-onset disease may lead to confusion with non-infectious causes of respiratory distress, including:

- Respiratory distress syndrome

- Transient tachypnea of the newborn

- Meconium aspiration

The differential diagnosis of late-onset disease depends on the focus of the infection. For example, meningitis in infants of this age may rarely result from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae (type b and non-typeable), and more commonly with viruses. The findings of osteomyelitis may be subtle; refusal to move the arm may be ascribed to neuromuscular disease or Erb palsy.
