Despite the unique look of rhinophyma, it can be mimicked by other conditions. Keffe et al. reported an assumed rhinophyma later pathologically diagnosed as entirely composed of basal cell carcinoma.

In areas with endemic leishmaniasis, any patient presenting with progressive nasal swelling resembling rhinophyma should arouse suspicion of having the Leishmania parasite. Diagnosis is via a smear and a PCR test. Treatment is generally with intramuscular meglumine antimoniate.
