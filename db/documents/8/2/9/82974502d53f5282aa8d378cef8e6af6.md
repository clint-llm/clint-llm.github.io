This article refers to concepts in healthcare quality assurance and patient safety with specific application to vascular medicine.

Vascular medicine is the branch of medicine specializing in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of arteries, veins, and lymphatics. It overlaps its focus with many fields, such as internal medicine (and internal medicine's subfields cardiology, hematology, etc.), vascular surgery, wound management, rehabilitation medicine, and radiology. Although vascular medicine does incorporate vessels supplying the brain and heart, management of those vessels is often performed by neurologic and cardiologic specialists, respectively, and is not discussed here.

The two most common non-neurologic, non-cardiologic vascular problems in the United States are peripheral arterial disease (usually due to atherosclerosis) and vein thrombosis. The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease in the United States remains relatively high in men and certain ethnic groups compared to other countries.

Improving vascular healthcare quality at the individual and population levels requires identifying structures and processes that affect patient outcomes, keeping the structures and processes that facilitate desired outcomes, and altering or eradicating those that inhibit desired outcomes.
