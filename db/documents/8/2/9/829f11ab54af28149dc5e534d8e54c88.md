CAS is a reasonable alternative to CEA in select patients with high-grade asymptomatic (more than 70%) or symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Indications for CAS include high surgical patient risk, such as severe pulmonary disease, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or severe congestive heart failure; a history of prior neck radiation that is anticipated to make open surgical dissection difficult; a history of damage to contralateral vocal cords; the presence of a tracheostomy, contralateral carotid occlusion; and previous CEA with recurrent stenosis.
