Parvovirus B19 is a virus that only infects humans. It is known to cause fifth disease, also known as erythema infectiosum or slapped cheek syndrome, which occurs mostly in young children but can occur in adults. It can also cause an aplastic crisis in those with certain anemias, hydrops fetalis in pregnant women, polyarthropathy, and papular-purpuric gloves and socks syndrome (PPGSS) in young adults. Transmission of the virus occurs through respiratory secretions and blood products. If a woman becomes pregnant and gets infected, the virus can be passed to her baby. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of parvovirus infections and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the conditions caused by parvovirus. 
- Outline the typical presentations of the conditions caused by parvovirus infection.
- Review the management of parvovirus infection. 
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by parvovirus.
