Similar to their indications, the adverse effects of bacteriostatic antimicrobials are dependent upon the drug in question.

Due to their excellent bioavailability in most tissues throughout the body, tetracyclines can easily be deposited into vascularized bones and tissues; this becomes problematic in fetuses and children less than eight years old, where tetracycline antibiotics can deposit and cause a characteristic brown discoloration of bones, which is permanent throughout life. This adverse effect is not inherently toxic and is a relative contraindication. Additionally, this effect is directly dose-dependent.

Macrolide antimicrobials are significant inhibitors of CYP3A4 and have several interactions via these pathways. Specifically, they increase serum concentrations of carbamazepine, corticosteroids, cyclosporin, digoxin, theophylline, valproic acid, and warfarin.

Clindamycin commonly correlates with local hypersensitivity and skin reactions, which can be severe enough to cause toxic epidermal necrolysis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome.C. difficile colitis (up to 20 to 30%) and high rates of diarrhea without underlying infection.

Generally, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is well-tolerated in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. However, there are some drug-drug interactions with warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, digoxin, and oral contraceptives.

Linezolid is generally well-tolerated in the general population.
