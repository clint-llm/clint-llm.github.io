There is a clear environmental etiology to CTE: the repetitive closed-head injury that occurs due to years of playing a variety of contact sports such as boxing, football, rugby, hockey, or lacrosse. Taking into account the similarities that have been noted between CTE and Alzheimer's disease (AD), another neurodegenerative process, there has been speculation that the two share similar genetic risk factors. The gene that has gained the most attention is the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) e4 allele, which may be involved in the inhibition of neuronal growth following brain injury. In addition to genetic risk factors, it has also been hypothesized that various psychosocial factors, the age at which an individual begins playing contact sports, and even exposure to performance-enhancing drugs may all play a role in the development of a later neurodegenerative disease.
