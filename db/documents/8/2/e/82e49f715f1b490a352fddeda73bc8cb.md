Despite all non-invasive methods to detect liver lymphoma, histopathological examination is required to confirm the diagnosis. Histopathologically, primary hepatic lymphoma can be of various types, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or T cell lymphoma, and in some instances non-BÂ non-T cell lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most prevalent compared to other variants of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

In one case series of over 41 patients, 34 (83%) of patients had B cell lymphoma, predominantly of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (27/34) (79.41%). However, there were also rare reports of other cell types, such as T-cell lymphoma, precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma.

Histopathologic features of the commonly reported diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are the abundant mitotically active large and atypical cells in the wall of the mass with pale to clear cytoplasm and vague cell membranes associated with granular, eosinophilic necrotic debris. The nuclei are large with condensed or open chromatin with prominent nucleoli. On Immunohistochemical analysis, positive pan B markers such as CD 20, negative epithelial tumor markers, namely the cytokeratin AE1/AE3, positive pan T cell markers CD3 and Tdt, and the absence of Hep Par 1 coincides with the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
