**Management in Adults**

Some studies recommend an empiric elimination diet in people with malabsorption. However, empirical food elimination in the diet warrants further studies for long-term outcomes and efficacy in adult patients.

**Glucocorticoids**

Glucocorticoids are the mainstay treatment for eosinophilic gastroenteritis. The dose of steroids should be tapered quickly over two weeks. The goal of the tapering dose of steroids is to treat severe symptoms, not tissue eosinophilia because fibrosis is comparatively less common than eosinophilic esophagitis.

**Other Therapies**

Based on the case reports, other therapies include

- Leukotriene inhibitors (montelukast)

- Mast cell stabilizers (oral cromolyn)

- Interleukin- 5 inhibitors

- Ketotifen

- Immunosuppressive drugs

- Biological agents include vedolizumab, mepolizumab (anti-interleukin 5 antibodies) and omalizumab (anti-IgE monoclonal antibody).

**Management in the pediatric population**

The first line is food restriction and then steroids, however, one has to monitor the response to treatment as some cases can relapse or develop resistance to steroids.
