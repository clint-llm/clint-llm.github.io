Heroin is usually used as an illegal drug. In rare settings, heroin is prescribed by doctors for pain control. Heroin given intramuscularly is about two times as potent for pain relief. Heroin is not allowed to be prescribed by doctors in the United States, but prescription heroin is available in rare settings in other countries. Heroin has an average half-life of three minutes in blood after intravenous administration, but the half-life of 6-acetyl morphine in humans is about 30 minutes. Heroin's peak blood level happens after 5 minutes of usage intranasally or intravenously, but its potency after intranasal usage is about half of intravenous usage.
