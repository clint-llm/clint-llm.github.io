Clostridium perfringens was first discovered by William H. Welch, MD, in 1891 at The Johns Hopkins Hospital after an autopsy on a 38-year-old man and was initially named Bacillus aerogenes capsulatus.Bacillus welchii before finally being renamed Clostridium perfringens, derived from Latin for “burst through.”

Classification is based on the production of the six major toxins: alpha-toxin (CPA), beta-toxin (CPB), epsilon-toxin (ETX), iota-toxin (ITX), enterotoxin (CPE), and necrotic enteritis B-like toxin (NetB).

- A: CPA only

- B: CPA, CPB, ETX

- C: CPA, CPB, CPE (+/-)

- D: CPA, ETX, CPE (+/-)

- E: CPA, ITX, CPE (+/-)

- F: CPA, CPE

- G: CPA, NetB

C. perfringens spores can survive normal cooking temperatures. Therefore, it can proliferate in foods that are improperly stored. Outbreaks are most commonly associated with improperly heated or reheated gravy, poultry, or meats.
