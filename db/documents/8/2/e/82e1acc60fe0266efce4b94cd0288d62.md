Hearing function in the inner ear is maintained by the cochlea which is known to have a high oxygen demand. Cochlear hypoxia is associated with progressive ossification, fibrosis, loss of neurons, endolymphatic hydrops, and hearing loss. Direct blood supply to the organ of Corti is minimal; oxygen must diffuse through the perilymph and cortilymph. The labyrinthine artery (internal auditory artery) is a long, slender branch off of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (85%) or the basilar artery (15%). It accompanies the vestibulocochlear nerve through the internal acoustic meatus into the inner ear. Animal models of labyrinthine artery occlusion have shown progressive degenerative changes, fibrosis, new bone formation, and hearing loss. Any pathology that results in vascular occlusion of this artery can result in hearing loss.
