The prognosis after a cerebellar infarction is similar to that of stroke in general. Large ischemic territories are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Over time, the morbidity associated with the disease has declined due to early recognition and treatment. In general, the functional status of patients after a cerebellar infarction is better than those who suffer a cerebellar hemorrhage.
