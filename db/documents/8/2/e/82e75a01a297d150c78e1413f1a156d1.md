Internal degloving injuries are usually associated with high-energy trauma and can be devastating. This injury occurs when a tangential shearing occurs between the dermis and deep fascia, severing the perforating vessels and creating a potential space for fluid collection. Management depends on size, severity, and associated injuries. This activity reviews internal degloving injuries and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with these injuries.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of internal degloving injuries.
- Summarize the presentation of a patient with an internal degloving injury.
- Review the treatment considerations for patients with internal degloving injuries.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients with internal degloving injuries.
