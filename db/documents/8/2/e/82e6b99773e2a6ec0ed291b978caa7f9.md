Typically about half of patients with adenomas are asymptomatic, and the tumor is found incidentally on imaging. The remaining patients have symptoms that could range from a mild, often ill-defined abdominal pain in the right hypochondrium or epigastrium to bloating. Labs outside of the reference range may include elevated alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. In the case of malignant transformation to HCC, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) can be elevated. Hepatomegaly with mild tenderness can be seen. The sudden presentation occurs when the hepatic adenoma ruptures, resulting in acute hemoperitoneum. An enlarged liver would be smooth but slightly tender. It presents with severe abdominal pain with hypotension and/or shock. This event is not uncommon and is often seen with oral contraceptive pill use. It is associated with a significant mortality rate. Tumors that rupture are typically greater than 5 cm, solitary, and superficially located. Often, women are either menstruating or pregnant at the time.
