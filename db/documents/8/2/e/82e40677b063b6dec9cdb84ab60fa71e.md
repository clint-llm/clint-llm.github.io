The blood supply of the posterior surface of the scapula is composed of an anastomosis of several arteries derived from the thyrocervical trunk (a branch of the subclavian artery) and axilla artery (continuation of the subclavian artery beyond the lateral margin of the first rib):

- Thryocervical trunk branches:

- Transverse cervical artery - runs along the medial border of the scapula. May provide a deep (or descending) branch that is also known as the dorsal scapular artery. However, this artery more often branches off the subclavian artery.
- Suprascapular artery - Mostly supplies supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles.

- Subclavian artery branches:

- Subscapular artery - Provides blood supply for subscapularis muscle as far as the inferior angle of the scapula

- Circumflex scapular artery - branch of the subscapular artery. Forms an anastomosis with the suprascapular artery and the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery.

Venous drainage of the scapula: Primarily via the axillary vein and suprascapular veins

Lymphatic drainage:

- Right scapula - Right lymphatic duct

- Left scapula - Thoracic duct

- The lymph nodes associated with the scapula include the axillary and the supraclavicular lymph nodes.
