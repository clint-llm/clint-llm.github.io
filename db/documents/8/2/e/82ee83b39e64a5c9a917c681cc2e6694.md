An interprofessional healthcare team strategy is required for the most effective treatment of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, which includes a hematologist-oncologist, oncology nurse practitioner, oncology pharmacist, infectious disease physician, emergency physician, primary care physician/internist, dermatologist, pathologist, blood bank specialist, case manager, psychiatrist/psychologist, occupational and physical therapist. The prompt referral of the patient to a specialist and open communication among the various specialists involved is essential to achieving the best possible outcomes for the patient.

All clinicians will need to contribute each from their specialty as part of a holistic approach to patient care. Given the first-in-class nature of tagraxofusp, a specialized oncology pharmacist will be a valuable adjunct consult, in addition to performing usual medication reconciliation and patient medication counseling. Nurses will administer the drug and be responsible for reporting to the clinical team on patient response and possible adverse events, as well as counseling the patient. The team should be mindful of cultural inclusion as it pertains to the patient and other team members. The interprofessional team approach will yield the best outcomes with the fewest adverse events.
