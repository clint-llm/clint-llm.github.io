Before initiating targeted temperature management, the patient must be hemodynamically stable and have a secure airway with optimal oxygenation and ventilation. Also, the baseline clinical status should be assessed, and hemodynamic monitoring should be in place. Ensure that the following are obtained prior to initiation of TTM

- Baseline labs including ABG, cardiac enzymes, electrolytes, CBC, BNP, INR, PT/PTT, CPK, troponin, and lactate

- Continuous EKG monitor

- Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation

- Pulse oximeter

- Non-invasive blood pressure monitoring

- Arterial catheter if invasive BP monitoring is needed

- Central venous catheter

- 2 large gauge peripheral IVs

- Continuous temperature measurement (esophageal, rectal, or bladder probe)

- Foley catheter

- Cooling equipment (varies based on hospital protocol)

- Warming system (to be used if the temperature is overshot)
