The treatment of adult acquired flatfoot is complex. There are multiple treatment options, and the treatment of adult-acquired flatfoot has been the focus of most recent research. However, first-line therapy for the condition remains nonoperative.

Treatment with orthotic devices, such as low-articulating ankle-foot orthosis, cast-boot walkers, and other ankle-foot orthoses in conjunction with NSAID therapy and physical therapy have a resolution of symptoms 87% of the time according to one study. Â Other studies have success rates of 67 to 90% with conservative measures.

Surgical treatment is indicated in patients who have attempted conservative therapy and are not satisfied with their results. Surgical treatment depends on the stage of the disease, as well as other factors including medical comorbidities, functional status, and use of tobacco.

Surgical management of stage I disease is uncommon, but if required patients should undergo posterior tibial tendon tenosynovectomy, debridement, or flexor digitorum longus tendon autograft. There is a concern that repair of the posterior tibial tendon may experience complications with long-term failure; therefore, surgical treatment should be carefully considered prior to any intervention.

Stage II disease treatment has been successful by medializing calcaneal osteotomy in addition to a flexor digitorum longus transfer. One study showed 87% of patient satisfaction with this treatment after a mean follow-up of 15 years.

Stage III disease becomes more challenging to treat due to the fixed nature of the defect. Arthrodesis is the standard of care, with double and triple arthrodesis being common. Double arthrodesis entails a fusion of the subtalar and talonavicular joints. Triple arthrodesis involves the calcaneocuboid joint in addition to the two joints mentioned above. Double arthrodesis has the advantage of reduced arthritic complications and reduced joint stiffness associated with calcaneocuboid fusion. Unfortunately, joint fusion has an inherent loss of mobility, and patients may struggle on uneven ground. Risk of nonunion, deltoid insufficiency, and ankle valgus is also present.

Stage IV disease management depends on whether there is a rigid flatfoot. Some patients progress to stage IV disease without rigid disease due to the failure of the deltoid ligament. In this setting, patients may have treatment with a deltoid ligament repair. Patients with rigid stage IV disease will require an ankle fusion, which is associated with significant morbidity. Ankle replacement is an alternative to arthrodesis.

A recent meta-analysis of surgical treatments for adult acquired flatfoot was conducted to study the efficacy of different therapies further. This study analyzed different radiographic angles to measure the effectiveness of each procedure, including medial calcaneal osteotomies, lateral column lengthening, and double and triple arthrodesis. The conclusions of the study suggested that all treatment types result in significant improvements for the patient.
