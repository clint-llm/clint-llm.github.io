Complications of mucoceles and ranulas include:

- Infection

- Rupture and reformation

- Dysphagia in case of large ranula

Possible surgical complications include the following:

**Intraoperative**

- Hemorrhage

- Wharton duct damage leading to stenosis, and obstructive sialadenitis

- Injury to the lingual nerve causing temporary or permanent paresthesia

- Facial nerve marginal mandibular branch damage-causing paresthesia

**Postoperative**

- Hematoma

- Infection

- Dehiscence of the wound

About half of the plunging or cervical ranulas arise as a result of the failure to excise oral ranulas completely. These plunging ranulas may enlarge and result in a respiratory compromise or acute mediastinitis, a life-threatening complication.
