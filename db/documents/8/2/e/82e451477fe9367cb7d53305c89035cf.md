Evaluation of a patient with porphyria includes:

Urine or plasma levels of total porphyrins: Elevated in both PCT and Hepatoerythropoietic porphyria. Uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyl porphyrin are usually elevated along with normal levels of urinary ALA and Porphobilinogen. Checking for porphyrin levels in feces is not needed for diagnosis but may be useful in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

Once the level of porphyrins has been found to be elevated, porphyrin fractionation and other tests are required to pinpoint PCT as the underlying cause of the skin lesions. Water-soluble carboxylated porphyrins are found in the urine point towards PCT and HEP, whereas increased levels of coproporphyrin do not. HEP shows a very high level of erythrocyte protoporphyrin and hence can be distinguished from PCT.

A patient’s urine, blood, and stool can be tested for increased porphyrin levels. Below is the pattern of porphyrin accumulation specific to PCT.

- **Urine**: ↑ Uroporphyrin, ↑ Coproporphyrin, normal Porphobilinogen, normal ALA

- **Stool**: ↑ Uroporphyrin, ↑ Isocoproporphyrin, ↑ Protoporphyrin

- **Red blood cells**: normal Uroporphyrin, Coproporphyrin, and Porphobilinogen

- **Plasma**: ↑ Uroporphyrin

Skin Biopsy: This is not needed for diagnosis and may only help in excluding some other skin conditions from the cutaneous porphyrias. Subepidermal blisters and depositions in vessel walls are some of the biopsy findings seen in porphyrias.
