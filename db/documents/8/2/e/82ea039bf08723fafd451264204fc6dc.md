Tufted hair folliculitis is an uncommon, progressive clinical manifestation associated with scarring (cicatricial) alopecia which affects the scalp. This condition derives its name from the presence of groups of five to 30 hairs emerging from a unique, dilated follicular opening. Tufted hair folliculitis is considered a clinicopathologic feature than a distinct entity rather, since it may be observed in association with several scarring conditions.
