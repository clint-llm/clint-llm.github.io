The nerves that supply the adductor magnus muscle have an embryologic origin from the anterior divisions of the lumbosacral plexus and include the obturator nerve, posterior division (L2-4), and the tibial portion of the sciatic nerve (L4). Studies by Takizawa et al. have challenged the long-held belief that the adductor portion is supplied by the posterior division of the obturator nerve, while the hamstring portion receives its supply from the tibial portion of the sciatic nerve.
