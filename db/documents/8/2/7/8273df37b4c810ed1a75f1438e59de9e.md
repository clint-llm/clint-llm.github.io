Patellofemoral syndrome (PFS) is one of the most common causes of anterior knee pain. It is commonly known as runner's knee, patellofemoral pain syndrome, retropatellar pain syndrome, lateral facet compression syndrome, or idiopathic anterior knee pain. It is a diagnosis of exclusion once another intra-articular and peripatellar pathology has been ruled out. Pain is often located behind or around the patella and aggravated by loading a flexed knee joint. It is one of the most common causes of knee pain seen by clinicians. Studies have shown that up to two-thirds of patients can be successfully treated with a proper rehabilitation protocol. This activity will highlight the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of patients with patellofemoral syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of patellofemoral syndrome medical conditions and emergencies.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of patellofemoral syndrome.
- Review the management options available for the patellofemoral syndrome.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance patellofemoral syndrome and improve outcomes.
