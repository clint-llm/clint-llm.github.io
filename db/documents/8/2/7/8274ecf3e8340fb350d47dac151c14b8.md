Wellens syndrome describes a pattern of electrocardiographic (ECG) changes discussed above that is highly specific for critical, proximal stenosis of the LAD coronary artery. Typically when patients with Wellens syndrome present to the emergency department they are pain-free, and usually cardiac enzymes are normal or only slightly elevated. However, it is important to recognize the ECG patterns as these patients are at high risk for impending large acute anterior wall acute myocardial infarction. Definitive treatment typically involves cardiac catheterization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to relieve the occlusion.
