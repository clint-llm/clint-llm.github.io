Hypopituitarism is defined as a deficiency of one or more of the hormones produced by the pituitary gland. Hypopituitarism is associated with increased mortality due to increased cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and early diagnosis is essential to prevent further morbidity due to the subtle presentation. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of hypopituitarism and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of hypopituitarism.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with hypopituitarism.
- Summarize the treatment options for hypopituitarism.
- Explain modalities to improve the care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for hypopituitarism patients.
