Light microscopy observation of Leydig cells reveals large polygonal cells with eosinophilic, non-granular cytoplasm, and large round nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The location of the nuclei is mostly at the center of the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm is filled with abundant lipid droplets that have a strong refractivity under light microscopes.
