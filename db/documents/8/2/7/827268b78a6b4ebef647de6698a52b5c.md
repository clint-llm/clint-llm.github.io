Simulation has become a significant method of education in both nursing and medical schools, as well as in graduate medical education and other training fields in healthcare. Trainers owe it to our learners to execute top-notch, gold-standard simulations following all available guidelines on best practice and simulation education theory. Educators must keep current on simulation education literature and continue to advance the field. Answers to questions raised in this publication regarding which is best (role-playing peers, VEPs, or SPs as ESPs) remain unanswered. The answer may, in fact, be: it depends on learning objectives, access to SPs, budget concerns, etc. Or answers may be obtained by conducting large-scale multi-institution randomized controlled trials of learners. Given that medical schools spend large amounts of both time and money on medical student OSCEs, perhaps there will be funding made available to drive this important research agenda.
