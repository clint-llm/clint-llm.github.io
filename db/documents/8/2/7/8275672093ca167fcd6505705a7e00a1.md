Anagen effluvium is a form of nonscarring alopecia commonly associated with chemotherapy. In this disorder, affected anagen hairs suffer a toxic or inflammatory insult, resulting in fracture of the hair shaft. The healthcare provider and nurse practitioner who encounter such patients should refer these patients to a dermatologist. Shedding usually takes place within 14 days of administration of the offending drug, however, in many instances it is reversible, with hair regrowth occurring upon discontinuation of the offending agent. In anagen effluvium, the hair shaft is commonly damaged, and tapered fractures of anagen hairs can be appreciated on trichoscopy. The prognosis for a patient with anagen effluvium is guarded. While some women may get hair restoration once the chemotherapy is completed, it often takes months or years before full recovery is possible. In a few women, hair thinning may persist without complete recovery.
