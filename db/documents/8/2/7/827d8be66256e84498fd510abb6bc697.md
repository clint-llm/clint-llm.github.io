Neuroendocrine tumors (68Ga-DOTA-TATE, DOTA-NOC, DOTA-TOC): 68Ga conjugates should be used as the preferred functional imaging modality for the evaluation of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) for all histological grades.

Prostate cancer: (68Ga-labeled inhibitors of prostate-specific membrane antigen (68Ga-PSMA), 68Ga-bombesin/68Ga-RM2, 68Ga-DOTATOC)

67Ga-citrate is mainly used for lymphomas (Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s) and fever of unknown origin. Although more effective agents exist, it can still be used for lung cancer, lung inflammatory diseases, bone infections, melanoma, germ cell tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma, neuroblastoma, multiple myeloma, sarcoma, head and neck tumors. 67Ga is currently only used for spinal infections when FDG cannot be performed.

Emerging indications for 68Ga:

- 68Ga-DOTATATE may play a role in other somatostatin receptor tumors such as renal cell cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, malignant lymphoma, hepatocellular cancer, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, sarcoma, and gastric cancer.

- Meningioma (68-DOTATATE)

- Osteomyelitis and discitis (68Ga-citrate)

- Breast cancer (68Ga-bombesin, 68Ga-ABY-002)

- Melanoma (68Ga-melanocortin)

- Tumor therapy response (68Ga binding to DOTA-related analogs such as P-glycoprotein, cholecystokinin, neurotensin, and substance P)

- Pathologic angiogenic processes (68Ga-RGB, arginine, glycine, aspartic acid peptides)

- Alzheimer’s disease (68Ga-DOTA-C3-BF)

- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy

- Pathology with activated macrophages (68Ga-deferoxamine-folate). Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes, vasculitis, sarcoidosis, atherosclerosis.

- Cardiac imaging (68Ga-NOTA/DOTA-RGD, 68Ga-DOTAVAP-PEG-P). Myocarditis, atherosclerotic plaques, and post-myocardial infarction inflammation

- Respiratory imaging (68Ga-DOTA-NOC) in pulmonary fibrosis and (68Ga-DOTATATE) in sarcoidosis

- Inflammatory bowel disease (68Ga-Citrate)

- Colorectal, esophagus, breast, lung, pancreatic, head and neck cancers (68Ga-fibroblast-activation-protein inhibitors) (68Ga-FAPI)

- Pulmonary embolism (68Ga-carbon nanoparticles and 68Ga-macro-aggregated albumin)
