Percutaneous mechanical support devices have been used widely in clinical practice. The first use of mechanical support was in the 1960s with the intra-aortic balloon pump.

The percutaneously inserted ventricular assist device (LVD) is a nonpulsatile axial flow pump that crosses the aortic valve and pumps blood from the left ventricle (LV) to the aorta.

The percutaneously inserted LVD has impactful effects on the hemodynamic by decreasing the load on the left ventricle and myocardial oxygen consumption, subsequently improving cardiac output and reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, leading to improvement in the coronary perfusion and systemic mean arterial pressure. Additionally, by improving forward output, percutaneously inserted LVD reduces left atrial pressures leading to right ventricle afterload reduction.

Other variations of the percutaneously implanted assist devices have since undergone development to aid in providing mechanical circulatory support. The percutaneously inserted right ventricle assist device (RVD) was designed to be used in right ventricular (RV) failure and is a 22 French nonpulsatile axial flow pump mounted on an 11 Fr catheter and positioned via femoral venous access. The inflow of percutaneously inserted right ventricle assist device (RVD) is placed in the inferior vena cava and the outflow in the pulmonary artery. It can provide up to 4 L/min flow to help support a failing RV.
