Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID)Â is characterized by an individual avoiding certain foods or types of food, having restricted intake in terms of overall amount eaten, or both. Avoiding or restricting food intake can be present for several reasons, including sensory-based avoidance, low interest in eating, and concern about the consequences of eating.

ARFID is quite different from anorexia nervosa due to a lack of distorted perception of body appearance. Moreover, weight is normal, decreased, or increased in ARFID, unlike pediatric feeding disorders, where poor weight gain is a hallmark.
