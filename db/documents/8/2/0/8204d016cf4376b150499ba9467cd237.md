Splenomegaly is accompanied by mild thrombocytopenia (with a platelet count of 30,000 to 120,000 cells per microliter) and reticulocytosis in many patients. The appearance of the rectal mucosa is usually abnormal and maybe the most reliable physical finding when the palatine and pharyngeal tonsils have been completely removed. Ocular abnormalities in Tangier disease include corneal opacity, ectropion, the mottled retinal pigment in the macula, and/or periphery.
