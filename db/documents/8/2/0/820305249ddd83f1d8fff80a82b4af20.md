The current recommendation to identify obesity is in terms of Body Mass Index (BMI). A person with a BMI of 30 kg/m^2 or more is defined as an obese individual. The rising prevalence of obesity is a significant health concern worldwide because excess weight is a risk factor for many diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, and certain cancers.

Poor dietary intake, decreased physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle contribute as the risk factors for obesity. The World Health Organization in 2005 maintained that about 1.6 billion adults of age 15 or greater were overweight, 400 million were obese, and more than 20 million children less than five years of age were overweight.

The heritability of obesity in various twin and family-based genetic studies is between 40 and 70%.

The opioid pathway has recently been implicated in obesity causation, and there is evidence of the association of mu-opioid receptor (MOR) OPRM1 with dietary fat intake. A prominent landmark study was done in 2015 through genome-wide association studies (GWASs), and meta-analysis identified 97 BMI-associated loci and other obesity-related traits.

The new approaches employed for modulating the central melanocortin system include AgRP (agouti-related protein) antagonists, MC4R PAMs (positive allosteric modulators), and MC4R or LepRb (leptin receptor) chaperones.
