The anatomy of the head and neck is complicated due to the sheer number of fine structures in that region and many of which have variable depth and course. From a clinical standpoint, the head and neck maintain several critical neurovascular structures that have essential functions and potential disastrous surgical consequences if violated.Â The neck subdivides into smaller regions, zones, and compartments to help with maintaining the organization of this highly complex area. The two primary regions of the neck are the anterior and posterior triangles whose borders are defined by readily identifiable anatomic structures. These triangles are found deep to the skin, subcutaneous tissue, superficial cervical fascia, and platysma muscle and span the entire length of the neck. Within these triangles, muscles, nerves, blood vessels, lymphatics, and adipose tissue are present. The focus of this activity will be to describe the anatomy of the posterior cervical region, including the posterior triangle of the neck, and to relate the anatomy to important clinical considerations.
