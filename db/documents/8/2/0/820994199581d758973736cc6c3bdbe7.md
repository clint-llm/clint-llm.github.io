X-ray image production procedures utilize a balance of image optimization, contrast, distortion, noise, and patient dose. However, these are only a few of many factors technicians and radiologists must consider optimizing when scanning patients and selecting appropriate protocols. Often these settings offer improvement of one imaging parameter at the cost of another. For example, devices (e.g., filters, grids) enhance image contrast at the cost of increased patient dose. Understanding these parameters is central to the understanding and use of X-ray imaging in diagnostic medicine. These understandings demonstrate further utility with interventionalists in radiology, surgery, and pain medicine who use X-ray imaging in real-time to guide therapeutic interventions.
