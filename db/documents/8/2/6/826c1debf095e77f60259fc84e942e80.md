The visualization of sclerostin confirms the presence of osteocytes in the bone pieces. On day 7, researchers fix bone samples in cold 4% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde. They dehydrate the samples in graded ethanol by repeating the incubation process in 100% ethanol at least twice; methylmethacrylate mixture emission follows the incubation procedure. They cut the samples with Leica/Reichert-Jung Polycut S (SM2500) microtome into 5 um pieces. The researchers rehydrate the sections and douse the endogenous peroxidase with about 3% H2O2 in 40% methanol in PBS. They proceed to incubate the samples with 1% trypsin for 15 min at 37 Â°C to retrieve antigen. They incubate the bones with a 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole reagent to develop a color visualization and counterstain the samples with hematoxylin. They visualize the sclerostin staining under preferred light microscopes, such as a Zeiss Apotome 2 microscope.
