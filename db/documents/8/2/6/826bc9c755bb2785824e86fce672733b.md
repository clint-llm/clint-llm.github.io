Pneumonia caused by chlamydial species presents atypically with non-specific signs and symptoms. It is usually asymptomatic or manifests with mild to moderate symptoms of respiratory tract infection. It can manifest in a severe form particularly in older adults, immunocompromised patients, or those with chronic health conditions. The incubation period is about 3-4 weeks.

**History**

Most infections are usually mild, with a characteristic subacute onset, may be difficult to distinguish from other forms of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or viral infections, and rarely can have a severe course leading to respiratory failure and death. Infection may take an acute or chronic course, maybe be recurrent (reinfection), or exist in a carrier state.

Pneumonia usually starts with nonspecific flu-like symptoms of pharyngitis, laryngitis, or sinusitis during which the patients have symptoms such as fever, hoarseness, sore throat, and headache. Mild pneumonia follows in the next 1–4 weeks, which is characterized by cough persisting for several weeks. Other symptoms are shortness of breath and muscle pain in the chest due to coughing. Nonspecific symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, gastrointestinal disturbance, and body aches are usually present as well. In severe cases, the patient may present with severe dyspnea, pleurisy, drowsiness, or altered sensorium. Occasionally, presentation mimics meningitis with the complaint of high fever, neck stiffness, and headache with other atypical symptoms.

In C. pneumoniae infections, the patient may have a history of contact with other patients but patients with C. psittaci pneumonia classically may provide a history of exposure to the birds or their feces, especially parrots. C. trachomatis pneumonia has a subacute onset usually lacking fever and is associated with wheezing and bronchitis in infants. There is usually a history of conjunctivitis associated with the same organism.

Extra-respiratory acute infections which are less common, include cardiovascular diseases (coronary artery disease, endocarditis, myocarditis, pericarditis) or neurological (encephalitis, meningitis, or Guillain-Barré syndrome). Association with thyroiditis, erythema nodosum, and importantly, with lower respiratory tract infection and reactive airways disease has also been reported.

**Physical Findings**

Physical findings are also nonspecific in chlamydial pneumonia. Tachypnea, raised body temperature and signs of upper respiratory tract infections such as pharyngeal congestion without exudate are common. Signs of chronic pharyngitis, middle ear infections (with effusion), and sinusitis may be seen. Pneumonia presents in atypical form as there is a lack of purulent sputum with coughing which is characteristically staccato type, particularly in infants. Auscultatory changes are mild in contrast to the significant changes seen on X-ray of the lungs.

Wheezing is common, however, coarse crepitations with rhonchi and rales can also be found on auscultation. Rarely signs of pleural rub and pleural effusions may be present. Signs of other systems involvement i.e. hepatomegaly and splenomegaly may be seen especially in the case of psittacosis. Patients with C. psittaci pneumonia may have relative bradycardia and somnolence as well.
