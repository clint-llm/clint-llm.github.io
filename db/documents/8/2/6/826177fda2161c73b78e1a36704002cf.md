Hypersensitivity reaction to atazanavir in the form of a mild rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic skin eruptions, or erythema multiforme may occur. Atazanavir should be discontinued in patients who develop serious hypersensitivity reactions.

Atazanavir metabolism occurs via CYP3A4 and inhibits CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2C9.
