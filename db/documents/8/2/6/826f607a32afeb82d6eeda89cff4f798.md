Psittacosis pneumonia, better known as parrot fever or ornithosis, is an infection caused by birds. Infection usually presents with sudden fever, headache, body aches, and a dry cough. People at increased risk are pet bird owners, pet shop workers, veterinarians, and poultry processing plant workers. In severe cases, C. psittaci can infect other organs including the kidneys, liver, and central nervous system. Given the potentially fatal nature of this disease, antibiotics should be started as soon as possible and continued for 7 to 10 days. Per the CDC, only buy pet birds from a well-known pet store. If you own pet birds or poultry, follow good hygiene precautions when handling and cleaning birds and cages.
