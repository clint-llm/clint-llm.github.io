Methocarbamol is a centrally-acting skeletal muscle relaxant (SMR) approved for the treatment of acute musculoskeletal pain. Specific FDA indications for use are vague and have not been recently reviewed. Methocarbamol has been approved for muscle spasms since 1957.

Methocarbamol was discovered in the early 1950s and was approved for use in 1957.

Despite its common use today, there are few high-quality studies and no meta-analyses comparing methocarbamol to placebo or alternative agents for muscle spasms.
