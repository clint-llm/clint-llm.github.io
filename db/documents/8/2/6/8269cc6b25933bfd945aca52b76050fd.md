Lenticonus is an ocular morphological pathology in which there is abnormal conical protrusion and bulge of the lens capsule due to thinning of the lens capsule.

Anterior lenticonus is associated with Alport syndrome, and posterior lenticonus occurs in Lowe syndrome, although most reports suggest it is not linked to any systemic disease.

Lenticonus patients present with myopia and astigmatism. The other common findings in Alport syndrome are arcus juvenilis, cataract, posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy, and dot and flecked retinopathy. There management options for a lenticonus can be spectacles, contact lenses, lens aspiration, IOL implantation along with anterior vitrectomy.
