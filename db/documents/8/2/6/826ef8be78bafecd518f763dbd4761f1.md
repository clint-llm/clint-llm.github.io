Due to the aggressive nature of the disease, prompt diagnosis is critical in determining appropriate treatment options. Management of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is complex and needs an interprofessional team approach involving a team that consists of an ENT surgeon, a surgical oncologist, a radiation oncologist, a pathologist, an endocrinologist, a radiologist, and a nuclear medicine specialist. The pharmacist reviews prescribed medications to provide patient education and monitors compliance. Oncology pharmacists assist in planning chemotherapy and provide feedback to the team. Specialty trained otolaryngology and oncology nurses help coordinate care, educate patients and their families, schedule follow up, and inform the team of status changes. Palliative care and hospice nurses and doctors are commonly involved in improving end-of-life care. [Level 5]
