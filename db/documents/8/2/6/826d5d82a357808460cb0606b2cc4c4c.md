Pellagra is a condition caused by low levels of niacin or its precursor, tryptophan. Niacin deficiency results in pellagra, which includes the triad or "three Ds," dermatitis, dementia, and diarrhea, and can result in death. Similar to a sunburn, brown discoloration and skin lesions on the skin typically exposed to the sun, such as hands, elbows, knees, and feet, are present. Initially, neurological changes such as anxiety, poor concentration, fatigue, and depression can manifest, but dementia and delirium may occur as pellagra advances.

Symptoms of niacin deficiency can be divided into the following categories:

**Gastrointestinal Findings**

- Poor appetite, nausea, epigastric discomfort, increased salivation, and abdominal pain

- Gastritis and achlorhydria

- Glossitis, soreness of the mouth, and dysphagia

- The tongue becomes beefy red and appears raw due to atrophy of the papillae

- Diarrhea is typically watery but is occasionally bloody and mucoid

**Skin Findings**

- Erythematous skin with a burning sensation

- The distribution is typically symmetrical and bilateral sun-exposed areas of the body. In addition, there can be bullae named wet pellagra.

- Malar rash, dorsum of the hands and feet, and neck area common areas

- The skin findings of niacin deficiency, which responded to niacin treatment, have been described as an initial manifestation of Crohn disease

**Neuropsychiatric Findings**

- Lethargy, apathy, depression, anxiety, poor concentration, and irritability

- Disorientation, confusion, and delirium

- Eventually, the patient may become stuporous and comatose

- Muscle weakness and paresthesias may be evident on clinical examination

**Death**

- Death occurs due to a deficiency of coenzymes necessary to generate adequate energy to support critical body functions
