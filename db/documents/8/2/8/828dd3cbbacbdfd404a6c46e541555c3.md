In a case series of 21 recipients with a confirmed acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), fifteen recipients improved clinically and survived to hospital discharge, but 6 died of refractory antibodies-mediated rejection. The median survival after the diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection was 593 days.

In one study, the development and progression of chronic allograft rejection after lung transplantation (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome Grades 2 and 3) is associated with a 3-fold increase in the risk of death at each stage.

Although less common, restrictive allograft syndrome has worse outcomes with survival estimates between 6- 18 months from diagnosis. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome can occasionally progress into restrictive allograft syndrome. It goes without saying that patients with such transformation portend the worst prognosis. Patients with AFOP also have a worse prognosis with a median survival of only 0.3 years.

Risk factors include BAL eosinophilia, sarcoidosis, orÂ interstitial lung disease (ILD) as an indication for transplant, CMV donor/receptor mismatch, younger age, and female sex.
