A dilated fundus exam should be performed on all infants born at ≤30 week GA and infants with BW ≤1500g.

In an effort to limit the number of unnecessary screenings while capturing every case of ROP, the Postnatal Growth and Retinopathy of Prematurity Screening Criteria (G-ROP) was developed. In a validation study of 3981 infants, these guidelines were 100% sensitive and reduced infants screened by 30%.

Classification is described in terms of zone and stage of the disease.

Stage 1 is a thin but clear demarcation or structure that separates avascular retina anteriorly from vascularized retina posteriorly. The demarcation line is typically flat and white, with abnormal branching of vessels leading up to it.

Threshold ROP is diagnosed when 5 contiguous or 8 cumulative clock hours of stage 3 ROP, in zone 1 or 2, with plus disease.
