Recovery normally occursÂ three to six months postpartum but has been described until 48 months after delivery.

**Good Prognosis Factors**

Several factors are associated with good prognosis, these include:

- Small LV diastolic dimension (less than 5.5cm)

- LVEF greater than 30% to 35% and fractioning of shortening greater than 20% at the time of diagnosis.

- The absence of troponin elevation.

- The absence of LV thrombus.

- Non-African American ethnicity

**Poor Prognosis Factors**

The following factors may indicate a poor prognosis:

- QRS greater than 120 milliseconds

- Delayed diagnosis

- High NYHA class

- Multiparity

- African descent

Recurrence of PPCM in subsequent pregnancies is elevated, and the patient should be advised against further pregnancies and monitored closely.
