Levodopa is the precursor to dopamine. Most commonly, clinicians use levodopa as a dopamine replacement agent for the treatment of Parkinson disease. It is most effectively used to control bradykinetic symptoms apparent in Parkinson disease. Levodopa is typically prescribed to a patient with Parkinson disease once symptoms become more difficult to control with other anti-parkinsonism drugs. The drug can also be used for postencephalitic parkinsonism and symptomatic parkinsonism due to carbon monoxide intoxication. This activity covers levodopa, including mechanism of action, pharmacology, adverse event profiles, eligible patient populations, and monitoring, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of conditions where levodopa therapy is helpful.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for initiating levodopa therapy.
- Describe the mechanism of levodopa as it pertains to parkinsonism and related conditions.
- Review the contraindications for levodopa.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance levodopa and improve outcomes.
