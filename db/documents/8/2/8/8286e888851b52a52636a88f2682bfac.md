Central venous access is a procedure commonly performed for hospitalized patients with inherent risks. Central venous catheters are placed for various reasons, such as inadequate peripheral venous access, hemodynamic monitoring, infusion of peripherally incompatible infusions, and extracorporeal therapies.

Many studies have been conducted to determine the best strategies to incorporate in routine catheter maintenance, but institutional practices vary based on available resources.
