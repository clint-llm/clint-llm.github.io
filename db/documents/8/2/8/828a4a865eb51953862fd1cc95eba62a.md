A seizure is a paroxysmal electrical discharge of neurons in the brain resulting in a change of function or behavior.Â It is important to understand that a seizure is a CNS event and may present as convulsive or non-convulsive. There are both excitatory neurotransmitters (glutamate, aspartate, and acetylcholine) and inhibitory neurotransmitters (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and mechanisms (calcium ion-dependent potassium ion current and magnesium blockade of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)) in the brain that play a role in the genesis and inhibition of isolated seizures. Excessive excitation and/or inadequate inhibition results in status epilepticus.

Status epilepticus is classified into different types based on the following axes:

- Semiology

- Etiology

- EEG correlates

- Age
