**Root Canal Sealers**

Several techniques are used to insert the sealer into the root canal and ensure that it evenly coats the prepared surface. One technique utilizes a screw-like file that attaches to a slow-speed handpiece called lentulo spiral.

**Core Obturation Materials**

Since there are numerous types of obturation materials, there are several ways to insert them into the root canal, and as a result, this section will focus primarily on the insertion technique of gutta-percha (GP). GP has two main obturation techniques, cold lateral condensation (CLC) and warm vertical compaction (WVC).

The cold lateral condensation technique involves the selection of a master GP cone, the use of spreaders, and the insertion of secondary GP cones.

The master cone is inserted into the canal to the working length, followed by the spreader, which, if properly selected, should reach 2 mm shorter. The spreader is then rotated and withdrawn from the canal, and the matching GP cone is inserted into the vacant space.

The warm vertical compaction technique also uses a master GP cone, Schilder pluggers, and a heat source.
