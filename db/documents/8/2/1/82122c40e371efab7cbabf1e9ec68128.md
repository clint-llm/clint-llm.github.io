Preventing maxillary fractures caused by road traffic accidents would be helped by increased use of public transport as opposed to private vehicles, mandatory use of motorcycle helmets, and improved regulation with regards to motor vehicles and motorcycles

For countries in which sporting injuries account for many of the maxillary fractures, encouraging players to well helmets and dentist-fabricated gum shields may help to reduce the incidence and severity of the injuries.

Maxillary fractures are linked to alcohol use and illicit drugs, which require higher alcohol tax, greater policing with regards to illicit drugs, and an effective public health message to change these behaviors.
