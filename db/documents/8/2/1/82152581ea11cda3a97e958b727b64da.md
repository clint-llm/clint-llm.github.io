ACLF is a serious disease with significant morbidity and mortality. It is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a specialty-trained nurse, internist, liver specialist, neurologist, transplant surgeon, radiologist, pathologist, infectious disease expert, and intensivist. To date, the treatment is symptomatic and geared towards the control of the primary disorder causing liver problems. The outlook for most patients is guarded. While liver transplant can help prolong life, the procedure is also associated with life-threatening complications.
