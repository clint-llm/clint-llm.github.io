Neostigmine is water-soluble, an ionized compound that reversibly inhibits the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Its FDA indication is for the reversal of the effects of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents after surgery. The use of neostigmine is primarily found in the context of the reversal of neuromuscular blockade during the administration of anesthesia to patients undergoing surgery that require muscle relaxation. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of neostigmine so that providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes in anesthesia reversal.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of neostigmine.
- Summarize the indications where neostigmine use is beneficial.
- Describe the possible adverse effects and contraindications of neostigmine.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients who can benefit from therapy with neostigmine.
