The clinical manifestations of hypoglycemia can be classified as either neuroglycopenic or neurogenic. Neuroglycopenic signs and symptoms are signs and symptoms that result from direct central nervous system (CNS) deprivation of glucose. These include behavioral changes, confusion, fatigue, seizure, coma, and potential death if not immediately corrected. Neurogenic signs and symptoms can either be adrenergic (including tremors, palpitations, anxiety) or cholinergic (including hunger, diaphoresis, paresthesias). Neurogenic symptoms and signs arise from sympathoadrenal involvement (either norepinephrine or acetylcholine release) in response to perceived hypoglycemia.

A detailed history is essential in evaluating hypoglycemia. Pertinent issues that should be addressed while taking a patient's history include:

- A detailed medication history

- History of alcohol and/or drug use

- History of psychiatric disorders

- Personal or family history of diabetes mellitus or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes (MEN)

- Unintentional weight changes

- Changes in medication

- Consideration of acute kidney injury or renal failure

- Symptoms of different hormone deficiencies.

- Timing of the hypoglycemic episode relative to meals or exercise.

There is no agreed-upon lab value that defines hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is said to be present when the patient has symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia in addition to a low serum glucose measurement (less than 70 mg/dL). This perspective reflects the idea that hypoglycemia is a clinical presentation coupled with a lab finding of low serum glucose rather than a pure chemistry finding. Typically neurogenic and neuroglycopenic symptoms of hypoglycemia occur at a glucose level of or below 50 to 55 mg/dL, but this threshold can vary from individual to individual.

Patients who have diabetes can present with symptoms of hypoglycemia at relatively higher serum glucose levels. The chronic hyperglycemia alters the "set point" in which neuroglycopenic/neurogenic symptoms become apparent. This phenomenon is referred to as "pseudohypoglycemia"
