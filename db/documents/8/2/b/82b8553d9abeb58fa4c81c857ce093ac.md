The dural mater originates from the somitic mesoderm, which condenses around the neural tube shortly after the neural tube closes at the embryonic day 9, while the pia and arachnoid (leptomeninges) originate from the neural crest.

The dura, forms between the arachnoid mater and the calvarial mesenchyme, which ultimately forms the calvarial bones.

The first of the dural processes to develop is the tentorium cerebelli.

Research has shown that fetal meninges play an essential role during brain development. The dura mater influences the proliferation and migration of neural progenitors cells and neurons in the prosencephalon (forebrain) and rhombencephalon (hindbrain).
