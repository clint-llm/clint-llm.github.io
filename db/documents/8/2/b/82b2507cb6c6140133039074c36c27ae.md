Age should not be the only deciding factor to discontinue or continue breast cancer screening. Combinations and a balanced overview of all risk factors and density of breasts should be considered while planning for breast screening age-wise.

A dense breast has a high probability of developing breast cancer. While mammography decreases the sensitivity of detecting breast cancer in women with dense breasts, other screening strategies like MRI and ultrasonography may be employed.

It has been observed that women have fast-growing breast cancers, and mammography cannot be of much help here from a screening perspective. It is advisable to discuss breast cancer screening with all women from age 40, and proper documentation should be done.

Early age of initiation and use of MRI and/or ultrasound, may be considered for women with the first-degree relative with breast cancer.
