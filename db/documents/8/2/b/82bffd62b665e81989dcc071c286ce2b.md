Anaerobic glycolysis serves as a means of energy production in cells that cannot produce adequate energy through oxidative phosphorylation. In poorly oxygenated tissue, glycolysis produces 2 ATP by shunting pyruvate away from mitochondria and through the lactate dehydrogenase reaction.

Mature erythrocytes do not contain mitochondria and thus rely exclusively on anaerobic glycolysis for ATP production.
