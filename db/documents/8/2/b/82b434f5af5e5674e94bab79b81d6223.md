Elderly patients have greater morbidity and mortality associated with falls versus their younger peers. Estimates are that greater than 30% of individuals over the age of 65 and approximately 50% of individuals over the age of 85 will fall each year. Approximately 12 to 42% of those who fall will have an injury.

Falls are often multi-factorial, considering there is usually a disturbance in gait and balance. Some causes include sarcopenia, muscle atrophy and imbalance, improper bio-mechanics, poor-blood pressure control, home environment, and polypharmacy. The pathologies on this list can be identified through screening modalities.

One screening modality that can be used in many different settings such as outpatient primary care, inpatient hospital ward, or physical therapy office is the Tinetti gait and balance assessment, also known as the performance-oriented mobility assessment (POMA).
