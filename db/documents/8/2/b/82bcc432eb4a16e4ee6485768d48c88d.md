Yersiniosis generallyÂ has a favorable outcome. A study from the United States reported only 1.2% (18 deaths out of 1373 patients) diagnosed with Yersiniosis. In another study from Norway, only 2 deaths were reported from 458 patient diagnosed with yersiniosis.

However, yersinia does have other morbidity that includes:

- Pseudoappendicitis

- Erythema nodosum

- Pharyngitis

- Mesenteric adenitis

- Glomerulonephritis

- Myocarditis

- Dermatitis

Conditions that cause hemolysis and release iron increase the risk of systemic infection. In addition, use of deferoxamine also enhances the risk of Yersinia enterocolitis.
