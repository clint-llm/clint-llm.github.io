The major artery that is the source of blood for the princeps pollicis artery is the radial artery. Since the radial artery descends toward the hand to form theÂ deep palmar arch. The princeps pollicis artery is a small muscular artery that branches from the deep palmar arch. This artery then ascends the thumb passing between two muscles. The princeps pollicis artery splits the oblique head of the adductor pollicis muscle and the first interosseous muscle. The princeps pollicis muscle ascends and terminates at the base of the proximal phalanx. At the proximal phalanx, the princeps pollicis artery terminates beneath the flexor pollicis longus muscle's tendon. Then the princeps pollicis artery will split into two smaller arteries that will further perfuse the thumb.

The function of the princeps pollicis artery is to perfuse the bones, muscles, nerves, and skin in the thumb.
