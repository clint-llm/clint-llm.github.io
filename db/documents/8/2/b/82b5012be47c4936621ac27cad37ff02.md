After surgery, patients should be kept NPO until all signs of the abscess have subsided. Close monitoring of the patient is required in an ICU setting initially for airway monitoring. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics are begun initially and placement of alternate enteral feeding means is required. Once the patient has stabilized, they may be transitioned to culture-directed enteral antibiotics.
