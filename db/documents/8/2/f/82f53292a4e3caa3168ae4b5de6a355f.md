**Benign**

The prognosis for benign granular cell tumors is excellent, as complete surgical resection is considered curative.

**Malignant**

By contrast, patients with malignant granular cell tumors have a substantially worse prognosis, with 74% and 65% survival rates at 5 years and 10 years, respectively. They see a 32% to 41% rate of recurrence and 11Â to 62% rate of metastasis between 3 to 37 months after diagnosis.
