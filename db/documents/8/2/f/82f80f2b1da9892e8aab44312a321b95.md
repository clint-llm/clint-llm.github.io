Differential diagnosis mainly depends on the location of the lesion.

**Pineal Region Germinoma**

For tumors involving the pineal gland, pineal parenchymal tumors like pineocytoma, pineoblastoma, and papillary tumor of the pineal region need to be ruled out.

**Suprasellar Germinoma**

For sellar/suprasellar germinoma, pituitary adenoma/carcinoma, craniopharyngioma, meningioma are important considerations.

Differentiation between germinoma and non-germinomatous GCT, particularly mixed GCT, is crucial because of the differences in treatment response and overall prognosis. The role of imaging is limited in making this distinction. Therefore, histological confirmation is mandatory. Both germinoma and mature teratoma can present with normal AFP and beta-HCG levels. Increased levels of serum or CSF AFP exclude the diagnosis of germinoma. Beta-HCG is elevated in a subset of germinoma, which has characteristic multinucleated syncytiotrophoblastic cells. Such tumors are more frequently associated with precocious puberty.
