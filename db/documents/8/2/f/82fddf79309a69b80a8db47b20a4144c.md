Patients typically have intermittent and localized low back pain for lumbar spondylolisthesis and localized neck pain for cervical spondylolisthesis. The pain is exacerbated by flexing and extending at the affected segment, as this can cause mechanic pain from motion. Pain may be exacerbated by direct palpation of the affected segment. Pain can also be radicular in nature as the exiting nerve roots become compressed due to the narrowing of nerve foramina as one vertebra slips on the adjacent vertebrae, the traversing nerve root (root to the level below) can also be impinged through associated lateral recess narrowing, disc protrusion, or central stenosis. Pain can sometimes improve in certain positions such as lying supine. This improvement is due to the instability of the spondylolisthesis that reduces with supine posture, thus relieving the pressure on the bony elements as well as opening the spinal canal or neural foramen. Other symptoms associated with lumbar spondylolisthesis include buttock pain, numbness, or weakness in the leg(s), difficulty walking, and rarely loss of bowel or bladder control.
