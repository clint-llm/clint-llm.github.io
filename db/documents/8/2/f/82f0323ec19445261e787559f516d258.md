Trihexyphenidyl is not strictly contraindicated for patients with liver, kidney, or cardiac disorders, but recommendations are to monitor these patients closely when using the drug. In addition, patients with hypertension should also have their blood pressure monitored for the duration of therapy.

Some patients may require the indefinite use of trihexyphenidyl, and since it has properties similar to atropine, constant and long-term supervision should be implemented to prevent allergic and other unwanted reactions. Because of the parasympathetic activity of trihexyphenidyl, it should be used precautiously and monitored closely in patients with obstructive genitourinary or gastrointestinal diseases, glaucoma, and in older males with prostatic hypertrophy.
