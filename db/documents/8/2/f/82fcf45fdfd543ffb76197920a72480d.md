The estimated prevalence of hereditary antithrombin deficiency is generally between 1 in 2000 and 1 in 5000.

Acquired antithrombin deficiency is generally associated with either decreased production as a part of impaired synthesis in the instance of acute liver failure, cirrhosis, malnutrition, a direct loss of antithrombin in conditions including nephrotic syndrome, or due to an increase in consumption.
