Low back pain remains a global concern in healthcare. Diagnosing the source of low back pain remains a clinical challenge for healthcare providers, and often treatment interventions have a wide level of efficacy given poor specificity in the diagnosis. Among the hypothesized sources of low back pain, vertebral pain resulting from damaged vertebral endplates has gained attention with specific and reliable diagnostic criteria and several clinical studies reporting robust effectiveness data using intraosseous basivertebral nerve ablation as a targeted intervention in this subset of patients with low back pain of vertebral etiology. This review describes the clinical evidence, indications, contraindications, equipment, preparation, technique, and complications of basivertebral nerve ablation. It highlights the important role of this procedure in the interprofessional team management of low back pain.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the relevant pathoanatomical structures involved in back pain and addressed via basivertebral nerve ablation.
- Review the indications and contraindications for basivertebral nerve ablation in vertebral pain.
- Outline the clinical efficacy of basivertebral nerve ablation in vertebral pain.
- Summarize how interprofessional team strategies can improve results when using basivertebral nerve ablation to improve the care of patients with low back pain.
