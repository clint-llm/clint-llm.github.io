Acinetobacter gained clinical significance in the 1960s with the increasing growth of Intensive care units at hospitals.

Acinetobacter has also been recognized in wounds sustained by combat injuries in returning soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan.

**Mortality/Morbidity**

The morbidity of this organism is related to the patient's underlying medical condition and immune status. The organism is not very virulent but due to various innate mechanisms it has the capacity to acquire resistance. Multidrug-resistant , extensively drug resistant and pan-drug resistant isolates of Acinetobacter have been described as non-susceptible to at least one agent in three or more antibiotic classes, non-susceptible to at least one agent in all but two or fewer antibiotic classes and non-susceptible to all antibiotic classes. Multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter was designated a threat category of ‘Serious’ Center of disease Control Antimicrobial resistance report published in 2013. Though not virulent by itself, the morbidity and mortality of Acinetobacter are high in sick patients with multiorgan disease. In the case of infections being caused by resistant strains of A.baumanii, mortality rates of upto 70% have been reported.****
