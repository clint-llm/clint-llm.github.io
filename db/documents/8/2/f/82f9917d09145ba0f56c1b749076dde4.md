**Cleavage Divisions**

The fusion of the male and female haploid pronuclei following fertilization produces a single diploid nucleus capable of beginning its first mitotic cycle almost immediately. However, cell division at this early stage does not also grow; rather, the embryo divides every 12 to 24 hours to create smaller individual cells known as blastomeres. These embryonic cell divisions not accompanied by growth are known as cleavage divisions.

At the 16 cell stage, otherwise known as a morula, the individual blastomeres are spherical and undifferentiated; however, as cell division proceeds, they undergo a process called compaction whereby the alteration in blastomere shape and alignment generates a small internal population of cells with no direct contact with the outside surface of the embryo. This arrangement of cells creates a central fluid-filled cavity called the blastocoel, with the embryo now referred to as a blastocyst. The blastocyst comprises of an outer layer of trophoblast cells which will form the placenta and the inner cell mass which will ultimately form the fetus, Heuser’s membrane, amniotic membrane, and the extraembryonic vasculature.

**Implantation**

The second week of development is predominately associated with implantation of the blastocyst into the uterine wall to establish a source of nutrition. As it migrates towards the uterus, the zona pellucida surrounding the blastocyst prevents direct contact with the epithelial lining of the fallopian tubes, ensuring implantation in approximately 99% of pregnancies will occur within the uterus.

Lacunae are cavities that form in the syncytiotrophoblast layer which soon extend to form a lacunar network. As the blastocyst implants, uterine capillaries nearby dilate to form sinusoids, which enables maternal blood to fill the lacunae as the blastocyst invades the uterine wall, thus establishing the beginning of the uteroplacental circulation.

**Human Chorionic Gonadotropin**

An additional consequence of implantation is the synthesis of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) by the syncytiotrophoblast layer. In early pregnancy, the corpus luteum requires hCG to sustain progesterone production and subsequently, the uterine endometrium. The placenta eventually assumes the role of producing progesterone later in the pregnancy. Other hormones produced by the trophoblast layer include:

- Chorionic somatomammotropin: maintains placental growth

- Chorionic thyrotropin: regulates maternal metabolism

- Chorionic corticotropin: the growth of mammary glands

**Bilaminar Disc Formation**

Similar to the outer trophoblast layer, the inner cell mass also differentiates to generate a bilaminar disc composed of the hypoblast and epiblast. The hypoblast spreads along the cytotrophoblast lining the blastocoel to form an extraembryonic coelom, the yolk sac, enclosed by a layer of extraembryonic endodermal cells known as Heuser’s membrane. The yolk sac is continuous the endodermal lining of the gastrointestinal tract and is essential in forming the vitelline circulation; branches of the dorsal aorta, the vitelline arteries, deliver blood to the wall of the yolk sac before it gets returned to the blastocyst via vitelline veins. The epiblast will later differentiate into embryonic germ layers, the amniotic membrane and extraembryonic mesoderm. The extraembryonic mesodermal cells migrate to line various parts of the embryo; extraembryonic somatic mesoderm covers the amnion and also forms the connecting stalk. The yolk sac covering is a layer of extraembryonic visceral mesodermal cells.

**Extraembryonic Coeloms Formation**

In addition to the yolk sac, two further extraembryonic coeloms form during the second week, the amniotic cavity and the chorionic cavity. Development of the amniotic membrane begins when a small space forms in the epiblast layer. The epiblast cells then differentiate into amnioblasts, which will form the amnion, a layer of flattened epithelial cells lining the cavity. Later on in development, amniotic fluid will fill this cavity to cushion the fetus and allow movement. The chorion is a membrane enclosing the chorionic cavity and forms from trophoblast cells and extraembryonic somatic mesoderm. The connecting stalk connects the embryo and yolk sac to the chorion and suspends them in the chorionic sac.

**Maternal-Fetal Circulation**

Small projections of cytotrophoblast surrounded by syncytiotrophoblast grow into the lacunae to form primary chorionic villi in the second week of development. As the second week progresses, the villi continue to grow and now contain a core of extraembryonic mesoderm; vascularisation occurs when branches of the umbilical artery and vein invade the mesoderm during the third week of development. Chorionic villi are essential maximizing the contact with maternal blood to facilitate the exchange of nutrients and waste with the fetus.

The cytotrophoblast containing tips of the chorionic villi can later further differentiate to form extravillous trophoblasts. These extend from the placenta to anchor it to the uterine wall. Moreover, extravillous trophoblasts play an essential role in ensuring that adequate perfusion to the fetus gets sustained throughout pregnancy by altering the vasculature in the uterus. Specialized extravillous trophoblasts can invade and remodel the uterine spiral arteries emptying into the lacunae to ensure they remain open, regardless of maternal vasoconstriction, thus maximizing the oxygen and blood supply to the fetus.

**Gastrulation**

Gastrulation is a complex process involving the embryo reorganizing itself to generate the three embryonic germ layers, endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. On day 14, mesenchymal cells appear along the midline of the caudal half of the epiblast layer to form the primitive streak; this marks the anteroposterior axis of the embryo and the beginning of gastrulation. At the rostrum of the primitive streak, a group of cells forms the primitive node which establishes the left/right axis of the embryo. Epiblast cells undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition whereby the cells enter the primitive streak and break away from the epithelium, thus enabling the migration of individual cells in a process known as ingression.

Mesoderm cells that migrate through the node form the prechordal plate and notochord, whereas those from the primitive streak will condense adjacent to the notochord to form paraxial, intermediate and lateral plate mesoderm. Paraxial mesoderm develops closest to the notochord and forms somites. Somites are masses of tissue flanking the notochord which develop into three cell populations: sclerotome, dermatome, and myotome. Cells situated ventrally in each somite de-epithelise to form sclerotome, which migrates around the notochord and neural tube to differentiate into the bones of the axial skeleton.

**Neurulation**

Although neurulation begins in the third week, the process does not complete until the fourth week of development. Signals from the notochord and prechordal plate in the mesoderm induces ectoderm cells rostral to the primitive node to form the neural plate. Neural plate cells are columnar and will later go on to form the CNS. In addition to the neural plate, the remaining ectoderm cells will differentiate to form the epidermis. Next, apical constriction of neural plate cells along the midline creates wedge-shaped cells; this fold is the medial hinge point.
