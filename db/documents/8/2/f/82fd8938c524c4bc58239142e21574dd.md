LCD type I is characterized histopathologically by multiple eosinophilic amyloid inclusions between the epithelium and the Bowman layer, as well as within the corneal stroma. The deposits stain well with Congo red, exhibiting birefringence and dichroism under polarized light. They also show metachromasia when stained with crystal violet, and fluorescence when stained with thioflavin T.

Confocal microscopy shows linear, branching structures in the corneal stroma with indistinct margins.

Optical computed tomography shows atrophic epithelium, disruption of the Bowman layer, and inclusions extending from the Bowman layer into the anterior stroma.

Electron microscopy shows deposits of extracellular, electron-dense fibrils that are 8-10 nm diameter, consistent with amyloid protein. Corneal fibroblasts are reduced in the number surrounding these deposits.

Type II LCD is characterized by thin lattice lines concentrated in the anterior and middle stroma. These are initially seen peripherally and spread centrally. There are fewer lines as compared to type I LCD, and epithelial erosions are not seen. Similar to type I, there is a disruption of Bowmanâ€™s layer by amyloid invading the subepithelial space.

In Avellino dystrophy, histology shows hyaline and amyloid deposits spanning from the basal epithelium to the deep stroma.

The location of these inclusions and their relative size varies between the different types and is described below.
