- Proper diagnosis and staging of the primary malignancy resulting in impending or pathologic fracture are essential for successful treatment.

- An interprofessional approach is required using a combination of medical specialties and treatment methods.

- Different principles of fixation apply for fractures based on anatomic location, healing potential, the patient's level of function, and prognosis.

- The goal of surgical fixation of pathologic fractures is early stabilization, mobilization, and return to function with a robust surgical construct that will outlast a patient's lifetime.
