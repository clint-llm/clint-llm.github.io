Cancer management during ongoing pregnancy poses a clinical challenge in itself, especially when administering radiotherapy; if indicated, it can severely affect fetal outcomes by hampering overall mental and physical growth and predisposing the growing fetus to malformations birth, low birth weight, and even spontaneous abortions. It comes at the expense of poor overall patient cancer management if aspects of current pregnancy are overlooked while planning treatment. This activity aims to outline the impact of radiotherapy on growing fetus and reviews available literature to highlight clinical aspects of such circumstances to deliver the best care to the mother and child by understanding the role of the interprofessional team's communication with each other and with the patient for evaluating, managing and improving care for pregnant patients who undergo radiotherapy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk factors to a fetus associated when administering radiotherapy to a pregnant patient.
- Review the appropriate radiotherapy management after assessing a pregnant woman.
- Outline the management options available for pregnant patients with cancer.
