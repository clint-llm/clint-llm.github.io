Using a combination of clinical diagnosis and intracompartmental pressure measurements increases both the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing the forearm compartment syndrome.

Measurements of the affected compartment can be done using a transducer connected to a catheter inserted 5 cm into the forearm's affected area. Normal intracompartmental pressures vary between 0 to 8 mmHg, and critical pressure is considered anything above 30 mmHg.

A pressure higher than 30 mmHg of the patient's diastolic blood pressure (delta p) is associated with compartment syndrome, and fasciotomy is indicated in that case. The delta p (delta pressure) is the difference between the patient's diastolic blood pressure and the compartment pressure. A delta p of less than 30 mmHg strongly suggests acute compartment syndrome.

Compartment pressure measurements are indicated in polytrauma patients, patients not alert or unreliable, or with inconclusive physical examination findings. Positive clinical findings should prompt urgent surgical intervention without the need for compartment measurements.

Other investigations to aid diagnosis include forearm radiographs or MRI scans of the forearm (mainly in chronic compartment syndrome rather than acute settings).
