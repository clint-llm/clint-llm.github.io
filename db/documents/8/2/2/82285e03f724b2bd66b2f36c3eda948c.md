Immediate consultation with surgery and gastroenterology is warranted in many cases. Severely ill-appearing patients that present with hemodynamic instability, multiple organ failure, or evidence of hepatic abscess will need immediate biliary decompression (e.g., ERCP or PTC). Even those individuals with mild cases and presentations may benefit from a consultation, including the use of additional imaging modalities such as EUS and MRCP.
