Breast ptosis is characterized by an inferior descent of the nipple relative to the breast fold and lower pole skin redundancy. The patient's initial evaluation is focused on determining the patientâ€™s expectations, identifying risk factors for surgical correction, and assessing breast anatomy. Subsequently, various surgical approaches can be used to correct breast ptosis. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of breast ptosis. It highlights the role of the healthcare team during the initial assessment, treatment, and postoperative recovery of the patient with this condition.
