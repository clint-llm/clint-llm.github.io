A detailed history and comprehensive family history are important in the evaluation of those with suspected MEN4. Assessing for hypercalcemia symptoms due to primary hyperparathyroidism and its associated clinical complications, e.g., renal calculi and osteoporosis. Furthermore, assessing for symptoms and signs of nonfunctional and functional pituitary tumors, e.g., visual changes and neuroendocrine gastropancreatic tumors, e.g., heartburn. The past medical history should be evaluated, specifically enquiring about peptic ulcers, cancer history (especially breast and reproductive organs), and surgical history. MEN4 has heterogeneous phenotypic expression leading to different manifestations of the syndrome in the same family.

Physical examination involves assessing for signs of hyperfunctioning pituitary disease, visual field defects, neck masses, previous surgical scars, and autoimmune diseases. To date, there have not been reports of skin manifestations in MEN4. Furthermore, physical examination can be normal in some patients, emphasizing the need for a detailed history and family history for diagnosis.
