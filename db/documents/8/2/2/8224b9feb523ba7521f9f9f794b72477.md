Zolmitriptan is a medication used in the management and treatment of acute migraines. It is in the triptan class of drugs. Migraines are due to local cranial vasodilatation and the release of neuropeptides (calcitonin gene-related peptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and substance P) in the trigeminal system. Zolmitriptan is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D receptor agonist with a weak affinity for the 5-HT 1A receptor subtypes. This activity describes the indications, action, and contraindications for zolmitriptan as a valuable agent in the treatment of acute migraines. In addition, this activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the healthcare team in the treatment of patients with migraine and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of zolmitriptan.
- Describe the contraindications of zolmitriptan.
- Review the common adverse effects of zolmitriptan.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance zolmitriptan and improve outcomes.
