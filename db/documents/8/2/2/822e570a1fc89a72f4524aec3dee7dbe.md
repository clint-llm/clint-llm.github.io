Postoperatively, patients should be taken to the neonatal intensive care unit for close monitoring. These neonates may require invasive central catheters, endotracheal tubes, and require vasopressors. These patients should have close follow-up with clinicians as esophageal strictures, dysphagia, and failure to thrive may occur.
