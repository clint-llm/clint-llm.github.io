Intravenous catheterization can be a lifesaving/sustaining procedure required for the administration of drugs and/or fluids. Scalp veins offer a safe, reliable, and comparable alternative site to establish peripheral IV access. In particular in patients without extremities, difficult extremity IV access, or moderate dehydration but stable enough appearance that more invasive access (such as femoral, internal jugular, saphenous cutdown, or intraosseous access) is not indicated.
