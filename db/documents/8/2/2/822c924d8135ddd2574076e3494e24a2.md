Management of clear cell carcinoma of the cervix needs an interprofessional approach involving a team that consists of a surgical oncologist, a medical oncologist, a radiation oncologist, a pathologist, a radiologist, and an oncology nurse. After treatment of clear cell carcinoma of the cervix, long-term follow-up is necessary to detect local and distant relapse. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner must refer patients with any abnormal uterine bleeding to a gynecologist for further workup.

Practitioners must be familiar with the new clinical developments needed in the diagnosis and treatment of clear cell carcinoma of the cervix to maximize clinical outcomes and reduce the risk of complications.

Healthcare providers should have an awareness of clear cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix in adolescents, and the need for prompt referral to a tertiary gynecological oncology center is necessary among general practitioners, gynecologists, and surgeons.

Clear cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis of bloodstained vaginal discharge without a history of DES exposure or sexual abuse.

The interprofessional clinical team should work together and communicate to obtain the best results. The oncology specialty nurse should assist with patient and family education and arrange coordination between the specialists. A pharmacist plays a crucial role throughout the management of oncology patients and should assist with pain management and provide guidance in regards to drug interactions before surgical intervention, as well as performing overall medication reconciliation and reporting to the healthcare team any concerns they encounter. The best possible outcomes for patients with clear cell carcinoma of the cervix are only obtainable without collaboration among the interprofessional team members. [Level 5]
