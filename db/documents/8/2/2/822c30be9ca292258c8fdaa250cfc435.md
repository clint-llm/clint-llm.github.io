Managing insomnia with lemborexant requires communication between interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians, pharmacists, nurses, and other healthcare assistants. Patients should be aware of the possible risks of using lemborexant, especially those with pre-existing conditions such as drug abuse disorder or hepatic impairment. While lemborexant appears to be a safe option for treating insomnia in adults, it is a schedule IV-controlled substance and should be treated by patients and healthcare providers as such. Additionally, further randomized controlled trials are warranted due to the novelty and apparent advantages of lemborexant compared to current treatments. Lemborexant utilizes a novel mechanism of action, potentially presenting a superior safety profile for adults receiving pharmaceutical treatment for insomnia.

Patient education and post-prescribing monitoring with lemborexant are best accomplished with an interprofessional healthcare team exercising collaborative activity and open information sharing to drive optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
