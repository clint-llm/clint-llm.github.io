To perform this procedure, an operative suite equipped with surgical instrumentation, surgical support personnel, and anesthesia is necessary. A handheld gamma probe is necessary for axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy if using radiotracer. Many models of gamma probe are available. Typical units will allow for a count as well as average radiation readings. The node is treated as radioactive, and managing the potential residual radiation in the operating room is done per hospital policy.
