In 1965, Liebow et al. first reported about this disease, and due to their interpretation of large cells within alveolar spaces as desquamated epithelial cells from lining walls, named it desquamative interstitial pneumonia.

The original authors also did not report the distinctive association with smoking which was first highlighted by Carrington et al. in 1978.
