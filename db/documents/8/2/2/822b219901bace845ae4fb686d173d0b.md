No disease-modifying treatment is available. Therapy is very similar to that of traditional chronic microvascular ischemic disease, targeting cardiovascular risk reduction with blood pressure control, smoking cessation, statins, and antiplatelet therapy. However, given that CADASIL is non-atherosclerotic, the role of thrombosis in causing strokes with CADASIL is in question. Thus, antiplatelet therapy may fall out of favor. Moreover, given that CADASIL patients have a higher incidence of microhemorrhages any anticoagulation therapy must be considered with caution. In addition, therapy for other disease manifestations such as migraines and depression are similar to the general population. Clinical symptoms progress from migraines to infarcts to vascular dementia over decades.
