The lumbar plexus provides innervation to several important muscles.  Notable muscles include the psoas muscle, quadratus lumborum, lumbar transverse muscles, quadriceps femoris, transversus abdominis, and internal oblique muscles.  Nerves that arise directly from the plexus are responsible for innervation to the psoas muscles, quadratus lumborum, and lumbar transverse muscles. The rest of the muscles receive innervation from nerves that form after exiting the lumbar plexus.

The innervation supplied to the quadriceps is necessary for the proprioception of the hip and knee. Innervation to the vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, and the vastus medialis help provide proprioceptive information about the knee to the central nervous system. Innervation of the rectus femoris helps provide proprioceptive information to the central nervous about the hip.
