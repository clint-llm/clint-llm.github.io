**Role of B-cells in COVID-19**

In a study involving seven patients with COVID-19 infection and underlying primary immunodeficiencies, it was found that patients with agammaglobulinemia had mild symptoms of COVID-19 as compared to patients with CVID who presented with severe symptoms needing antiretroviral drugs, IL-6 blocking drug therapy, and mechanical ventilation. There were significant changes in high-resolution chest CT noted in response to treatment in these two conditions.This was attributed to a possible role of B-cells in the inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2. Also, the reason why children contain the SARS-CoV-2 better in the early infection phase because of the ability of the B-lymphocytes to produce natural antibodies in a timely manner in children when compared to the adults.
