The gene coding for apo B is locatedÂ on the short arm of chromosome 2 and consists of 29 exons. This gene codes for both apo B-100, with 4536 amino acids (550 kDa), as well as for apo B-48 (265 kDa) - the latter is only about half the length of the native apo B-100 molecule. The formation of Apo B-48 occurs in the small intestine occurs through a unique mRNA editing process, a highly specific post-transcriptional cytidine deamination using an Apo B mRNA editing enzyme called apobec-1.
