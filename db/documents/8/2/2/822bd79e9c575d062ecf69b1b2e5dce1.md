The fungi enter the skin following trauma, evoking a granulomatous response. The epidermis shows pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia. In the dermis, a granuloma composed of epithelioid cells and Langhans giant cells is visible. The fungal elements ae visible as sclerotic bodies, which are brown septate cells. The sclerotic bodies (medlar bodies/ muriform bodies/copper pennies) are extruded transepidermally, and they appear asÂ black dots on the surface of the lesion; this is characteristic of chromoblastomycosis.
