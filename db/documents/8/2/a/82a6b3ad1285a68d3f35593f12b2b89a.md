Abnormal waveforms seen on an electroencephalogram (EEG) recording include epileptiform and non-epileptiform abnormalities. In order to identify abnormal waveforms indicative of disease on an EEG, the reader should have a basic understanding of the normal EEG pattern in various physiological states in children and adults. The electroencephalographer is expected to have the significant skills to recognize artifacts, and also have a thorough understanding of normal benign variants. This activity reviews the abnormal waveforms in EEG recordings to help review these abnormalities for the clinical provider and improve patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify various epileptiform abnormalities noted on EEG recordings.
- Outline the specific electrographic features of epileptiform abnormalities noted on EEG recordings.
- Describe non-epileptiform abnormalities noted on EEG recordings.
- Review the clinical significance of epileptiform abnormalities noted on EEG recordings.
