Conjunctivitis is a common cause of eye redness and, subsequently, a common complaint in the emergency department, urgent care, and primary care clinics. It can affect people of any age, demographic or socioeconomic status. Although usually self-limiting and rarely resulting in vision loss, it is essential to rule out other sight-threatening causes of red-eye when assessing for conjunctivitis.

The conjunctiva is the transparent, lubricating mucous membrane covering the outer surface of the eye.

Conjunctivitis refers to the inflammation or infection of the conjunctiva. It can be acute or chronic and infectious or non-infectious. Acute conjunctivitis refers to symptom duration of 3 to 4 weeks from presentation (usually only lasting 1 to 2 weeks), whereas chronic is defined as lasting more than four weeks.
