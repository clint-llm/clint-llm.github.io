It is important to first identify the trauma patient with blunt chest injury by the mechanism of force. For instance, patients involved in an MVC should be queriedÂ on whether there was a steering wheel impact. In one study, 54% of patients with a history of a fall greater than 20 feet had BCI.

The most common complaint is chest pain or shortness of breath

The physical exam should be thorough. Patients can present with cardiac tamponade, and suspicion should be high in the presence of jugular venous distention and hypotension. The focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST exam) will help in the assessment for pericardial fluid and cardiac tamponade. Tachypnea, irregular lung sounds, chest wall tenderness, chest abrasion or ecchymosis, rib or sternal fractures, and seatbelt sign across the chest are some of the physical findings that should raise suspicion for BCI
