Dextromethorphan toxicity is best managedÂ by an interprofessional healthcare team comprised of clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and mental health professionals. This drug can affect the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and musculoskeletal system. All patients should receive counsel about the dangers of dextromethorphan. Parents should be instructed to store dextromethorphan out of the reach of children. For patients who intentionally overdose, a behavioral health consult is a strong recommendation.
