Olecranon bursitis is relatively common. There is no mortality associated with this condition. Pain in the posterior elbow causes morbidity, with a limitation of activities. It typically affects men between the ages of 30 and 60 years.

- Two-thirds of cases are nonseptic and occur when repeated trauma or sports injuries lead to bleeding into the bursa or release of inflammatory mediators.

- There is no predisposition to sex or race.

- Olecranon bursitis occurs in both children and adults.

- Long-term hemodialysis treatment, uremia or a mechanical factor can be a cause of inflammation.

- Technicians who crawl on their knees in tight spaces and lean on their elbows are very susceptible.

Inflammation may also be due to a systematic inflammatory process, like rheumatoid arthritis, or a crystal deposition disease, like gout and pseudogout. This condition may be a side-effect of sunitinib, which is used to treat renal cell carcinoma.
