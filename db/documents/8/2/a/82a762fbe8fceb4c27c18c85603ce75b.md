The initial step for Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis may be interaction/binding of a drug-associated antigen or metabolite with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) type 1 or cellular peptide to form an immunogenic compound. The exact mechanism is speculative.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis is T–cell-mediated.

- CD8+ cells are present in blister fluid and may induce keratinocyte apoptosis.

- Other cells of the innate immune system play a role.

- CD40 ligand cells are also present and may induce the release of TNF–alpha, nitrous oxide, interleukin 8 (IL-8), and cell adhesion antibodies. TNF–alpha also induces apoptosis.

- Both Th1 and Th2 cytokines are present.

Other cells implicated in Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis include macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer (NK) cells.

The pharmacologic interaction of drugs with the immune system could result in binding of the responsible drug to MHC-1 and the T cell receptor. An alternative theory is a pro-hapten concept, in which drug metabolites become immunogenic and stimulate the immune system.
