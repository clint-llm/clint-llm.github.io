Generally speaking, lymphocyte types are best differentiated through histochemistry and flow cytometry; the light microscope cannot differentiate between lymphocytes types based on appearance. However, light microscopy shows lymphocytes as spherical or ovoid cells that have diameters from 6 to 15 μm when flattened on glass slides. Sample preparation of lymphocytes usually requires staining by Romanowsky polychromatic stains (e.g., Giemsa or Wright) of air-dried films.

Light microscopy shows two populations of lymphocytes: (1) large cells with diameters of 9 to 15 μm and (2) small lymphocytes with diameters of 6 to 9 μm. Under the microscope, lymphocytes appear as dark purple cells with a deep bluish nucleus and faint sky blue cytoplasm. Nuclei are taking a large proportion of the internal environment of the cell due to a large amount of condensed chromatin.
