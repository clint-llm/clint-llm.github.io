**Lab Investigations**

- Baseline investigations may include complete blood count, and renal and liver function tests can be obtained if there is a concern for metastasis or paraneoplastic syndrome.

- Epstein Barr virus serum IgA levels may carry diagnostic and prognostic significance, particularly in endemic populations.

**Imaging Studies**

- Computed tomography: CT scan with IV contrast is the modality of choice for bone invasion and extent of some soft tissues, as well as in assessing cervical nodal basins.

- Magnetic resonance imaging: MRI is the superior modality for assessing intracranial extension, cranial nerve involvement, and defining paranasal sinus involvement. MRI also provides excellent soft-tissue detail when assessing muscle involvement. There is also no radiation exposure with MRI as compared to CT.

- PET scan: It is the modality of choice for assessing remission and investigating recurrence. It is also routinely employed at initial staging to identify distant metastases.

**Endoscopic Evaluation and Histopathological Analysis**

- The nasopharynx is readily accessible for biopsy via endoscopic, trans-nasal routes. Cervical metastases can also be biopsied via fine-needle aspiration if they are easily palpable or visualized under ultrasound or CT guidance.
