Anabolic steroids such as testosterone are produced naturally and enhance protein synthesis at the cellular level. There are also synthetic analogs available that have been widely misused as performance-enhancing drugs. This activity outlines the mechanism of action, adverse effects, and toxicity of anabolic steroids and the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with anabolic steroid toxicity or patients that misuse these agents.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of anabolic steroids.
- Describe the epidemiology surrounding the misuse of anabolic steroids.
- Identify the clinical manifestations of anabolic steroid toxicity.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies to improve outcomes in patients with anabolic steroid toxicity or patients that misuse these agents.
