Millions of abdominal surgeries are done in the USA and globally. It is estimated that wound healing problemsÂ occur in at least 20% of cases, many of which eventually result in an incisional hernia. Initially, the hernia may not be obvious but in almost all cases, it progresses and the patient may complain of a bulge. The condition can occur in individuals of all ages, both genders, and all ethnicities.
