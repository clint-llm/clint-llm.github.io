The ocular surface is continuously moistened with tears produced by specialized lacrimal glands. After nourishing the ocular surface, tears drain into the nose. The lacrimal glands are part of the secretory lacrimal system.

There are four key anatomic parts that form the excretory system:

- The puncta (the orifices situated on the eyelid surface)

- The canaliculi (small channels that connect the puncta with the sac)

- The nasolacrimal sac (it serves as a reservoir for the overflow of tears)

- The nasolacrimal duct (it carries tears passage into the nasal cavity)

Anomalies of any part of the excretory system can lead to an overflow of tears, a condition known as epiphora. Dacryostenosis, from the Greek word dákryon (tear) and stenósis (narrowing), generally refers to an obstruction that can affect any part of the excretory system. Dacryostenosis may be congenital or acquired.
