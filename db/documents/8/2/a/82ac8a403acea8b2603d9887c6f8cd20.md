Literature does not lend support to the routine use of radiologic imaging in the diagnosis of facet-mediated pain. The gold standard for diagnosis of facet-mediated pain is anÂ anesthetic block of the facet joint.

Classic radiographic findings in facet joint arthrosis include both degenerative and proliferative features. Imaging may reveal narrowing of the facet joint space, subarticular bone erosions, subchondral cysts, osteophyte formation, and hypertrophy of the articular process.

The diagnostic block of the facet joint is the most reliable means for diagnosing facet-mediated pain, with level I or level II evidence based on the United States Preventive Services Task Force criteria.
