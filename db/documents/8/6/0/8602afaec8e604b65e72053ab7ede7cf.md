The liver is a common location for both primary and metastatic malignancies, which often result in significant morbidity and mortality. Traditional surgical resection provides excellent outcomes, but surgery is not an option for many patients due to extensive tumor burden, underlying hepatic disease, and other comorbidities. The evolution of image-guided technology has provided safe and effective alternatives for definitive and palliative treatment. This activity reviews the percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of liver tumors and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who undergo this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the indications for percutaneous radiofrequency ablation in patients with liver tumors. 
- Review the potential complications associated with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of liver tumors. 
- Describe the technique of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interdisciplinary team to improve outcomes for patients undergoing percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of liver tumors.
