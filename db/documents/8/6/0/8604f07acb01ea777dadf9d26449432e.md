Myocardial infarction (MI) is a common cause of chest pain that causes significant morbidity and mortality. Posterior wall myocardial infarction occurs when circulation becomes disrupted to the posterior heart. It commonly cooccurs with inferior or inferolateral MI, but when in isolation, posterior myocardial infarction represents a diagnostic challenge. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of posterior myocardial infarction and highlights the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify when to suspect and how to diagnose posterior myocardial infarction accurately.
- Describe the EKG findings associated with posterior myocardial infarction.

- Summarize the treatment and management options available for posterior myocardial infarction.
- Identify the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by posterior myocardial infarction.
