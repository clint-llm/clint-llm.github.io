Although COPD and sleep apnea are two of the most prevalent pulmonary diseases worldwide, there is heterogeneity in their prevalence of overlap syndrome of both COPD and OSA combined.

Currently, COPD is the third leading cause of death globally. In 2017 alone, 544.9 million people were estimated to be living with chronic respiratory disease, and 55% of these cases were attributed to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Obstructive sleep apnea represents a widespread respiratory disorder affecting sleep quality.

There continues to be emerging epidemiological data when evaluating COPD and OSA overlap syndrome prevalence. A systematic review analyzing the prevalence of overlap syndrome demonstrated a rate of about 1.0 to 3.6% in the general and hospital populations, a relatively uncommon presentation.

Based on a review of available literature on the prevalence of OS, there is significant variation in the rates of disease occurrence. This makes it difficult to calculate the true rate of overlap syndrome within populations of OSA and COPD patients. In patients with a primary diagnosis of COPD, overlap syndrome has been shown to range between 2.9 to 65.9%, and in patients with primarily OSA, the rates appear to fall between 7.6 to 55.7%.

Overlap syndrome is associated with increased rates of cardiovascular morbidity, worse quality of life, frequent episodes of COPD exacerbations, and higher medical costs than COPD or OSA alone. Bronchiectasis is seen more frequently in individuals with overlap syndrome and is associated with worse nocturnal oxygen desaturations and sleep time spent with SpO2 < 90% (T90), according to one research study.

Limitations to establishing concrete prevalence estimates include differing diagnostic criteria for COPD and OSA. Spirometry is the confirmatory diagnostic standard for COPD when forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) <0.7. The global initiative of chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) criterion is useful in staging disease severity and choosing therapy for patients with COPD. However, some studies used variations of this criterion that included FEV1/FVC <0.6, FEV1/FVC <0.65, and FEV1/FVC <0.75. Other research used a physician's diagnosis as the basis for COPD criteria.

The variability in the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea is related to multiple factors, including different definitions of respiratory events, various diagnostic methods (i.e., polysomnography, home sleep apnea testing [HSAT], nocturnal oximetry), different AHI cut-offs (e.g., AHI > 5, 10, or 15 per hour) or the scoring criteria used.

Specifically, studies using the ≥3% oxygen desaturation criteria for scoring hypopnea reported a higher prevalence of overlap syndrome compared to studies that used ≥4% oxygen desaturation, leading to a higher prevalence of overlap syndrome.
