It is important to rule out other possibleÂ disorders that may mimic many of the key clinical features of a Baker's cyst. These include deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cystic masses (e.g., synovial or ganglion cysts), solid masses, (e.g. sarcomas and lymphoma), and popliteal artery aneurysms. Given the potential complication of pseudothrombophlebitis (e.g., swelling, warmth, tenderness, and a positive Homan's sign) caused by a Baker's cyst when markedly enlarged, dissected, or ruptured), it is especially important to distinguish this finding from a true DVT that may present with similar symptoms.
