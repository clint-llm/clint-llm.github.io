Migrainous pathophysiology such as vasomotor changes in the middle cerebral artery may play a role in HaNDL syndrome, causing asymmetrical pulsations in the blood flow, which are evident on transcranial doppler ultrasound during and after an episode. Some studies demonstrate a reduction in cerebral blood flow to the brain at the contralateral side of neurological deficits.

On the other hand, few authors suggest antibodies formed after viral or autoimmune diseases may have led to aseptic inflammation affecting leptomeningeal vessels causing CSF pleocytosis and neurologic deficits. For example, a recent study has also shown high titers of antibodies against CACNA1H protein, which are subunits of T-type calcium channel in 2 out of 4 patients with HaNDL supporting the view of autoimmunity partially contributing to its pathogenesis.
