Astigmatism affects the quality of vision. As a result, uncorrected astigmatism also affects the quality of life of the subjects, especially in performing daily tasks that require viewing letters and objects with fine details.

The ophthalmologist or optometrist should provide a clear explanation of the procedure to the subject to get the right responses and obtain the correct results, considering that the JCC technique relies on the subject's response.

Allied health professionals must be equipped with the basic symptoms related to astigmatism and refractive errors to avoid sending patients for unwarranted tests such as magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography scans. Headaches or blurry vision can indicate serious underlying neurological or medical disorders; thus, it is important to consider the need to correct refractive errors and astigmatism before embarking on invasive diagnostic measures when managing these patients, especially if these symptoms do not have an acute onset.
