The definitive diagnosis of BCA from BCAC is challenging before surgical resection. Nevertheless, considering the management of these lesions is identical, the role of imaging is, therefore, to exclude other benign cystic lesions without malignant potential. Simple hepatic cysts are the most common hepatic cystic lesion. Reliable differentiation of BCAs from simple cysts can be based on the lack of internal septations and papillary projections. Differentiating hemorrhagic cysts can often prove to be challenging given their intricate appearance of US. However, given the decrease in spatial resolution on CT, these lesions tend to appear homogenous without internal complexity, unlike BCAs. Furthermore, the clot in hemorrhagic cysts typically appears T1 bright on MR imaging.

Additional diagnostic considerations include pyogenic hepatic abscesses, hydatid disease, mesenchymal hamartomas, and undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma. Unlike BCAs, pyogenic hepatic abscess and hydatid disease typically presents in patients with fever and lacks female predominance. Furthermore, associated imaging findings, including perilesional edema, segmental perfusion difference, and internal gas, are more suggestive of an infectious etiology. Mesenchymal hamartomas and embryonal sarcoma too lack the characteristic female predominance and are typically seen in children and young adults.
