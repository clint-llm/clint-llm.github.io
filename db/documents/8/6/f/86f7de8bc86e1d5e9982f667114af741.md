A delusion is a fixed false belief based on an inaccurate interpretation of an external reality despite evidence to the contrary. The belief is not congruent with one’s culture or subculture, and almost everyone else knows it to be false.

The diagnosis of a delusional disorder occurs when a person has one or more non-bizarre (situations that can take place in real life, although not real but are possible) delusional thought for one month or more, that has no explanation by another physiological, substance-induced, medical condition or any other mental health condition. An individual's cultural beliefs merit consideration before coming to the diagnosis. Cultural beliefs also impact the content of delusions.

Other than the delusions(s) the functionality is not impacted, and behavior is not obviously bizarre.

Some of the most frequently encountered types of delusions are:

- Delusional jealousy - That one’s sexual partner is unfaithful.

- Bizarre - A delusion involving a phenomenon that is impossible, not understandable, and unrelated to normal life.

- Erotomanic - A delusion that another person, more frequently someone of higher status is in love with the individual.

- Grandiose - A conviction of great talent, discovery, inflated self-worth, power, knowledge, or relationship with someone famous or deity.

- Persecutory - The central theme is being conspired against, attacked, harassed, obstructed in the pursuit of long-term goals.

- Somatic - These involve bodily functions and sensations.

- Mixed - No single theme is prevalent.

- Thought broadcasting - Delusion that one's thought is projected and perceived by others.

- Thought insertion - A delusion that one's thought is not one's own but inserted into their mind by an external source or entity.
