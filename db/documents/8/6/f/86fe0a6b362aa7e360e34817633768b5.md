Chest wall deformities are a set of congenital diseases that span a broad spectrum of disorders. These can manifest as isolated conditions or can correlate with extra-thoracic anomalies and genetic syndromes. Deleterious effects can occur from birth to adolescence, ranging from life-threatening conditions to psychosocial cosmetic concerns. The cornerstone of treatment lies with medical management, surgical repair, and genetic counseling. From a surgical standpoint, repair options are extensive and complex; therefore, a patientâ€™s age and gender, as well as surgical timing and choice of prosthetic materials and grafts, are some factors that play a role in the decision-making process. This activity aims to review the most common chest wall deformities from a general thoracic surgery standpoint. The disorders described below are pectus excavatum, pectus carinatum, sternal clefts, ectopia cordis, and the syndromes of Poland, Jeune, and Jarcho-Levin.
