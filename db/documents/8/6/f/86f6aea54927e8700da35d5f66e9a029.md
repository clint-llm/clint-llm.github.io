Adductor strain is a common injury among soccer and hockey players. Other common sports related to adductor strain include football, basketball, tennis, figure skating, baseball, horseback riding, karate, and softball. Risk factors include previous hip or groin injury, which is likely the greatest risk, as well as age, weak adductors, muscle fatigue, decreased range of motion, and inadequate stretching of the adductor muscle complex. Biomechanical abnormalities including excessive pronation or leg-length discrepancy can also contribute.

Suddenly changing direction causes rapid adduction of the hip against an abduction force, putting exaggerated stress on the tendon. Sudden acceleration in sprinting is the most common mechanism of injury. Jumping and overstretching the adductor tendon are less common causes.
