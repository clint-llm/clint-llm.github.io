Atypical antipsychotic use in psychiatric patients, particularly children and adolescents (C/A), has increased recently. Autism spectrum, bipolar, psychosis, and other psychiatric or emotional disorders are psychiatric conditions that need Antipsychotics today. There is limited data on the long-term safety of Antipsychotics on growth and development, specifically on bone metabolism. This activity outlines the clinical presentation, evaluation, and management by an interprofessional team of atypical antipsychotics induced bone changes in children and adults.

**Objectives:**
-  Provide the summary of the indications for antipsychotics agents.
- Describe the mechanism of atypical antipsychotics-induced bone changes.
- Review the clinical presentation and differential diagnosis of impaired bone mineral density.
- Emphasize the importance of early recognition and treatment options used by the interprofessional team for the atypical antipsychotics-induced bone changes.
