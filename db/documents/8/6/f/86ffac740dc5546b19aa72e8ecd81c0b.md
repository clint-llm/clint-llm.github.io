Carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers have been in use since the 1960s; they were initially used primarily for cutting and destruction of tissue, employing a continuous wave mode that ablates tissue to a depth of 400-500 μM. This modality was used across a broad range of clinical applications, such as the treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and upper eyelid blepharoplasty.
