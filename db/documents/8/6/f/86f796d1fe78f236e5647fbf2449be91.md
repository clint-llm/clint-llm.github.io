Sacroiliitis is inflammation of the sacroiliac joint (SI), the joint that connects the ilium to the sacrum. The SI joint is one of the largest joints in the body and is a common source of gluteal and lower back pain. Inflammation of the sacroiliac joint may occur secondary to osteoarthritis, pregnancy, spondyloarthropathies, and trauma. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of sacroiliitis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the presenting symptoms of sacroiliitis.
- Describe red flags that should prompt additional evaluations in patients with sacroiliitis. 
- Review the management considerations for patients with sacroiliitis. 
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional teams involved in the management of pain in patients with sacroiliitis and the use of physical therapy to strengthen the lumbopelvic musculature to improve outcomes for affected patients.
