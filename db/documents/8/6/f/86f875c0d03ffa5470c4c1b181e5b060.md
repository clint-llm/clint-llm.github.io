Any healthcare professional, including the nurse practitioner properly trained to complete the Bekhterev-Jacobsohn reflex, can perform the reflex. Physicians, medical students, physician assistants, medical assistants, and nurses are a few types of people who would be capable of performing the reflex. An inexperienced staff member should first observe the proper completion of the reflex or view an online tutorial of the proper technique of the Bekhterev-Jacobsohn reflex before performing the test. Practice and experience increase the likelihood of accurately obtaining and recognizing the response. However, the validity of this reflex remains questionable. The reflex technique has never been evaluated in randomized clinical settings, and it should not be relied upon as an indicator of upper motor neuron injury.
