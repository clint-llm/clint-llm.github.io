**Instability**: Damage to the pars interarticularis is a risk. Damage to more than fifty percent of facets on both sides or complete facets on one side intraoperatively mandates fusion surgery. Since L1-3 has a narrow surgical corridor for decompression, preservation of pars is of paramount importance at these levels.

**Bony Re-growth**

**Kyphosis**: due to disruption of posterior tension banding function of posterior Osseo-ligamentous complex.

**Spinal epidural hematoma**: maximum risk at the L2/3 level.

**Dural tear**: The incidence is 3.1% to 13% and 8.1% to 17.4% for primary and revision surgery, respectively. It increases the risk of surgical site infections, postoperative deficits, and delirium. The most location is the lower surgical field near the nerve root, followed by the dorsal sac.PMC4206814 Previous surgery and older age were found to be risk variables.

**Mortality:**incidence of 0.5 to 2.3%.
