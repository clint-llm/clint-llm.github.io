Ultrasound examination at the bedside and performed by an experienced provider should be considered in all pregnant patients present during the third trimester. Patients who have not received prenatal care benefit greatly from its use as undiagnosed pathology can be identified. The function of ultrasound during this period is to identify pathology that could have been missed as well as to determine factors that directly affect the delivery, e.g., fetal lie, fetal size, fetal presentation, placental location. The ultrasound examination must be thorough and yet focused. Its completion includes an examination of the fetus, placenta, amniotic fluid, umbilical cord, and cervix.
