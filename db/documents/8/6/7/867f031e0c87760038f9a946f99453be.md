Due to the hand's extensive musculature, tendon transfers are commonly performed to reduce the deficit from nerve damage.Â  Various muscles of the hand receive innervation from different upper extremity nerves including the median, ulnar, and radial nerves. Therefore, the distribution of innervation within the hand can be used advantageously to correct for nerve palsies. Tendon transfers have successfully been used to correct for function in both intrinsic and extrinsic hand muscles. During the transfer, the insertion point of the muscle is detached and mobilized to the desired location. A tendon transfer is typically considered three months after the injury if the muscle has failed to reinnervate.

Radial nerve palsy classically presents with an inability to extend the wrist, extend the fingers at the MCP joint, and abduct the thumb. Median nerve palsy presents with the loss of abduction and opposition of the thumb; sensory loss over the first three digits; and weak forearm pronation. Ulnar nerve palsy presents with sensory loss over the last two digits and weakness of the lumbrical and flexor digitorum profundus.

In radial nerve palsy, examples of potential donor tendons include the extensor digitorum and flexor carpi radialis. Both of these tendons take into account and advantage of different innervations of the muscles, the posterior interosseous nerve, and median nerve, respectfully.
