Consider a differential diagnosis of De Quervain tenosynovitis, intersection syndrome, lateral antebrachial cutaneous neuropathy, thumb carpometacarpal arthritis, C6 radiculopathy, lateral epicondylitis, or elbow bursitis.

Motor deficits indicate an entrapment or injury to the posterior interosseous nerve branch of the radial nerve. It does not carry any cutaneous sensory information, though. These clinical findings can help distinguish an entrapment of this branch versus a compression more proximal or even cervical radiculopathy.

The clinical presentation of posterior interosseous nerve entrapment is characterized by the loss of motor function due to variable degrees of weakness involving ulnar deviation.

If splinting is warranted, the splint will usually need to be worn for at least two to four weeks or until symptoms have dissipated. Consider the addition of protective padding if the patient is an athlete and involved with sports that cause repetitive forearm trauma.
