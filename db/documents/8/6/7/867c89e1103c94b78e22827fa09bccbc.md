Autologous breast reconstruction is an important addition to the reconstructive armamentarium.  Since there are more options for donor sites and patients can avoid an internal or external prosthesis, it may allow more patients to choose mastectomy, allowing them to have clinical screening and avoid mammograms.  There is a significant psychological impact of the loss of a breast, and performing reconstruction can help by enabling patients to have improved self-confidence and mental health.
