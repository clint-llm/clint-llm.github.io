A hypercoagulable state, prolonged immobilization, or vessel wall trauma may increase the risk of SVT. Superficial thrombophlebitis accounts for 5.4% of the adjusted population attributable risk for initial DVT or PE. SVT has been the presenting symptom in certain inheritable thrombophilias. According to several studies, it occurs in 11% to 15% of patients with protein C or S deficiency and approximately 40% of patients with factor V Leiden mutation.

In pregnancy, the risk of SVT is akin to that of DVT, most commonly in the postpartum period. Advanced age, exogenous estrogens, autoimmune or infectious diseases, obesity, recent trauma or surgery, active malignancy, history of venous thromboembolic disease, and respiratory or cardiac failure also increase the risk of SVT.
