Treatment for middle lobe syndrome, whether it is obstructive or non-obstructive, is directed at diagnosing and treating the underlying disease process. Agents directed towards optimizing pulmonary function (mucolytics, chest physiotherapy, bronchodilators, and antibiotics) are cornerstones of treatment and would most likely benefit all types of middle lobe syndrome irrespective of underlying etiologyPseudomonas species is a strong recommendation, as the underlying structural changes associated with middle lobe syndrome enable it to be a viable medium for pseudomonal infections.

In obstructive type middle lobe syndrome, fiberoptic or rigid bronchoscopy would help remove foreign bodies or evaluate intrabronchial tumors. Clinicians have occasionally used insufflation with fiberoptic bronchoscopy for lobar collapse. However, there is no robust data regarding this approach, and it should only receive consideration on a case-by-case basis.
