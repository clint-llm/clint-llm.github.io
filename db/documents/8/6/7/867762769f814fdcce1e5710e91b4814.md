Some patients diagnosed with Paget disease may not require treatment.

- Patients with no abnormal blood tests

- Patients who have no active signs of the disease and those who are asymptomatic

The most commonly treated patients diagnosed with Paget disease include:

- Those with abnormal bone defects

- When weight-bearing bones are involved

- Those with skull deformities

- When there’s evidence of a rapidly progressing bone change

- Those with complaints of diffuse pain

There are several treatment regimens that aid in prophylactically preventing bone breakdown and the subsequent formation.

- Bisphosphonates that have been approved as the first-line treatment option, secondary to its influence in bone remodeling.

- Calcitonin that is usually a second-line treatment. This drug is assisting in bone absorption

- Supplements such as calcium and vitamin D that have been known to provide some symptomatic benefit

- Pain management that is usually achieved by either NSAIDs or acetaminophen

Surgery is only offered as an option to patients diagnosed with Paget disease when there is a progression into osteosarcoma. The majority of patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma are often offered palliative options such as amputation of the affected limb. In many cases, clinicians are tasked with the job of making judgment calls about which treatment options to offer to the wide spectrum of patients that are diagnosed with Pagte disease. For example, younger patients are usually offered a surgical procedure where they could potentially salvage the limb by resecting the tumor with wide margins. This may not be a viable alternative for an elderly patient with multiple comorbidities and risk factors. Patients may also develop pathological fractures that may need radiation and internal fixation to relieve pain burden. Chemotherapy has been shown to be an ineffective option for patients diagnosed with a sarcoma. It is important to note that surgical failure rates are high in this group of patients. Often, revision surgery is indicated.

Patients with cauda equina and other nerve compression complications will frequently require laminectomy.
