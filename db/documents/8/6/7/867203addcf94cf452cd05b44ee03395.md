A bicornuate uterus is a uterine malformation that is produced due to impairment in the fusion of Mullerian ducts. The bicornuate uterus is a rare anomaly, but it is associated with worse reproductive outcomes; recurrent pregnancy loss and preterm labor are most common. To avoid the obstetric complications related to this anomaly, a high suspicion should be maintained for adolescents presenting with menstrual complaints. Diagnosis should be followed by aggressive prenatal monitoring or surgical unification depending on an individual basis. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of bicornuate uterus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of a bicornuate uterus.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with bicornuate uterus.
- Identify the different imaging options available for the diagnosis of a bicornuate uterus.
- Summarize the complications of a bicornuate uterus and explain the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving the care of patients with bicornuate uterus.
