There has been considerable confusion in characterizing and defining the origin of neurothekeomas. In 1980, Gallager and Helwig first classified neurothekeomas as dermal tumors of neural origin with characteristic clinical features and distinctive histology. Clinical features included a flesh-colored or slightly erythematous nodule of soft consistency, located on the head, upper extremities, or trunk, and arising more commonly in young females. Histologic features included spindled cells arranged in nests and cords with a mucinous, myxoid background containing dermal collagen bundles. Because the tumor cells appear similar to Schwann cells on electron microscopy (spindle-shaped and surrounded by a basement membrane without myofilament or melanosomes), the authors proposed the name “neurothekeoma” from the Greek word for sheath.
