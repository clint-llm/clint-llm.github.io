Reducing the workload of the failing heart is the primary goal of treating CHF. This goal is accomplished by increasing oxygenation through supplemental oxygen, increasing airway pressures, and decreasing pre-load.

Another important tool in monitoring the efficacy of CHF treatment is waveform capnography. In the case of determining CHF, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a cause of a patient’s respiratory distress, capnography is extremely useful. Both the pulmonary edema associated with CHF and the bronchospasm from asthma may produce wheezing in patients, the actual end-tidal carbon dioxide waveforms are different. A normal capnograph is rectangular in nature, indicating normal exhalation of carbon dioxide. As carbon dioxide is soluble in water, CHF patients will have a normal capnograph, even if they present to emergency medical services providers with wheezing. This is different from the shark fin appearance of a bronchospastic waveform.
