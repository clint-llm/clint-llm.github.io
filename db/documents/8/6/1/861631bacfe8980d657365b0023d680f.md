The presence of chronic bronchitis is known to cause worsening airflow obstruction and a deterioration in lung function. Large epidemiological studies have shown that chronic mucus hypersecretion was associated with a decline in FEV1. Patients with chronic bronchitis symptoms had a threefold increased risk of developing new COPD compared to the asymptomatic population. Chronic bronchitis increases mortality. Those suffering from chronic bronchitis were found to have higher levels of serum IL8 and C reactive protein, which indicates that systemic inflammatoryÂ response could increase the risk of cardiac disease and other comorbidities. Chronic bronchitis also leads to a lessened quality of life.
