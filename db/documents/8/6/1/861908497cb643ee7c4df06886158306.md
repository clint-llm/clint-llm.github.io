Ginkgo biloba has two primary active ingredients at varying concentrations: terpene lactones (which most notably include ginkgolides and diterpenes) and ginkgo flavone glycosides (which most notably contain ginkgetin, bilobetin, and sciadopitysin).Ginkgo biloba (EGb) 761.

Ginkgo biloba extract has been shown to affect several neurotransmitter pathways and brain structures, mostly in animal studies. EGb761 limits stress-induced corticosterone hypersecretion by reducing the number of adrenal peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in rats.

Several studies have suggested the neuroprotective effects of Ginkgo biloba extract. Long-term use of EGb761 appears to improve the short-term memory of middle-aged rats likely by reducing free radical production in the prefrontal cortex.

The effects of ginkgo on the cardiovascular system are widely studied and mostly observed as protective. Ginkgo's role includes a regulator of metabolism, membrane stabilizer, and vasodilator.
