Minoxidil is generally well tolerated. However, some adverse effects reported by patients include:

- Minoxidil-induced telogen effluvium: Minoxidil causes the shortening of the telogen phase, subsequently leading to marked shedding

- Skin irritation: Erythema, discomfort, and a burning sensation

- Scaly changes of the scalp: Irritation or exacerbation of seborrheic dermatitis

- Isolated pruritus

- Allergic contact dermatitis: Erythema, eczematous skin reaction, and pruritus. Minoxidil and propylene glycol are the two major allergens in allergic contact dermatitis. Patch testing may help reveal the causative agent. In the case of allergic contact dermatitis to propylene glycol, minoxidil foam (lacks propylene glycol) is an option.

- Localized or generalized hypertrichosis: This effect can occur with both oral and topical minoxidil. However, it is more commonly seen with the oral form and 5% versus 2% minoxidil. Research suggests that hypertrichosis is related to minoxidil's prolongation of the anagen phase.

**Drug Interaction**

- Systemic cyclosporine may enhance side effects like hypertrichosis when used with topical minoxidil. The hypertrichosis symptoms improved drastically after stopping topical minoxidil for two months.

- Coadministration of baby aspirin may also reduce the topical minoxidil efficacy. This reduction in efficacy is believed to be associated with the negative inhibition of sulfotransferase enzymes by baby aspirin in the human hair.
