The process of bile secretion is driven by two hormones, cholecystokinin (CCK) and secretin. CCK is secreted by the I cells of the small intestine in response to fats and proteins, causing the gallbladder to contract. This contraction causes bile to travel from the cystic duct into the common bile duct. Simultaneously, the sphincter of Oddi relaxes, and bile can enter the lumen of the duodenum. Secretin is secreted by the S cells in the duodenum in response to gastric acid in the duodenal lumen. Secretin stimulates the biliary and pancreatic ductal cells to secrete water and bicarbonate, effectively expanding the volume of bile entering the duodenum.

In the fasting state, the flow of hepatic bile is rerouted toward the gallbladder due to the resistance of the sphincter of Oddi. In the digestive phase, the gallbladder contracts, and the sphincter of Oddi relaxes, allowing bile to be delivered into the duodenum to digest and absorb fats.
