Actinic prurigo is a rare photodermatosis in the United States. However, actinic prurigo is more common in the American Indian populations of North, Central, and South America. The disease can affect both genders but is more commonly described in female patients. Actinic prurigo can manifest at any age, although the disease typically presents in prepubescent individuals with the mean onset before age 10. Some studies suggest an increased prevalence of actinic prurigo in certain geographic areas with dry, warm climates at an altitude of at least 1000 meters above sea level.
