Exercise-associated collapse (EAC), also known as exercise-associated postural hypotension (EAPH), is defined as the inability to stand or walk unaided during or after the completion of strenuous exercise. EAC is often used as an umbrella term for any exertional fall. However, the focus of this topic pertains to causes related to postural hypotension. Other means of exertional fall, including sudden cardiac arrest, exertional heat stroke, exercise-associated hyponatremia, and exercise collapse associated with sickle cell trait (ECAST), are outside of the scope of this topic and should be studied separately. Nevertheless, astute recognition of this differential diagnosis is critical for prompt treatment.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of exercise-associated collapse.
- Outline the significant risk factors and presenting signs/symptoms of exercise-associated collapse in athletes.
- Review the complications of exercise-associated collapse in athletes.
- Summarize the proper evaluation and prehospital management of exercise-associated collapse.
