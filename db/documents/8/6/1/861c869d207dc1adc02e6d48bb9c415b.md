The etiology of white matter lesions (WMLs) is heterogeneous. Based on etiology, WMLs can be divided into vascular and non-vascular causes.

Vascular causes of WMLs include:

- Microvascular ischemic disease or small vessel disease (SVD)

- Atherosclerosis

- Migraine

- Amyloid angiopathy

- Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)

- Vasculitis

- Susac syndrome

Non-vascular causes for WMLs include:

- Inflammatory: Multiple sclerosis (MS), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD)

- Infectious: HIV encephalopathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PMLE), neuroborreliosis, HSV and CMV encephalitis, neurosyphilis, CNS cryptococcal infection, Whipple disease, Lyme encephalopathy, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).

- Toxic: Chronic alcohol abuse, carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication, inhalation of toluene, heroin, and cocaine, methotrexate-related leukoencephalopathy.

- Metabolic: Vitamin B12 deficiency, copper deficiency, acute intermittent porphyria, hepatic encephalopathy, Hashimoto encephalopathy.

- Neoplastic: Glial tumors, CNS Lymphoma

- Traumatic: Radiotherapy, post-concussion (traumatic axonal injury, TAI)

- Genetic: 

- Lysosomal Storage Diseases: Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), Krabbe disease, Fabry disease, gangliosidosis, mucopolysaccharidosis
- Peroxisomal Disorders: X linked adrenoleukodystrophy, Zellweger syndrome, Refsum disease
- Mitochondrial Disorders: MERF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers), MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes), Leigh disease, Kearns-Sayre disease.
- Aminoacidopathies and Organic Acidopathies: Canavan disease, glutaric aciduria, urea cycle disorders
- Unknown Etiology: Alexander disease, Vander Knapp encephalopathy
- Others: Vanishing white matter disease, myotonic dystrophy

Another nosographic approach distinguishes primary WMLs, derived from an unknown etiology, from secondary ones; these latter due to a great variety of known etiologies.
