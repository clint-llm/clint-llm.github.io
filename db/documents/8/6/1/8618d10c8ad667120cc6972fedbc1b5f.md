Nitrogen dioxide and other oxides of nitrogen are found in a variety of occupational settings. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and management of nitrogen dioxide toxicity. This article also explains the role of healthcare professionals in evaluating and treating patients with exposure to oxides of nitrogen and its resultant toxicity in an emergency setting, as well as providing recommendations for patients with long-term sequelae of nitrogen dioxide toxicity.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of nitrogen dioxide toxicity and its potential sources of exposure.
- Identify patients that have suffered exposure to nitrogen dioxide and summarize potential symptoms and treatment patterns. 
- Review the appropriate observation time and rationale for patients with significant exposures to nitrogen dioxide.
- Summarize interprofessional management of patients with nitrogen dioxide toxicity to improve patient outcomes.
