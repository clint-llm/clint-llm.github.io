Aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia are major complications associated with anesthetic management. Indeed, aspiration pneumonia was identified as the largest contributor to deaths amongst all pneumonia etiologies investigated.

To avoid aspiration of gastric contents in preparation for intubation, Sellick proposed a method of esophageal compression. The eponymously named “Sellick Maneuver” is now commonly referred to as cricoid pressure. This method has been widely adopted and thoroughly investigated following its introduction in 1961. Arguably one of its most distinctive features is that it has become an integral part of rapid sequence intubation along with pre-oxygenation and short induction to intubation interval.

Cricoid pressure has been shown to attenuate the incidence of aspiration mostly through compression of the cricoid cartilage posteriorly. The cricoid cartilage is a hard, ring-like structure inferior to the cricothyroid cartilage at level C6. Sellick documented that this compression occludes the esophagus at C5, whereas other studies, aided by advanced imaging technologies, have specified the post-cricoid hypopharynx as the likely target. The post-cricoid hypopharynx includes the cricopharyngeus as a component of the upper esophageal sphincter.
