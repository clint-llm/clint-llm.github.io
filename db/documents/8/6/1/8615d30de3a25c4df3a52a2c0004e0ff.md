There are a number of potential barriers to providing effective experiential learning in the medical simulation environment. Some learners have no prior exposure to simulation, while others may have preconceived understandings of how to behave in the simulation environment based on their previous experiences. These participants may feel misled or humiliated if their expectations for the simulation session differ from those of the instructors and staff.

Learners may also find the realism of the simulation problematic, which can negatively impact their willingness and ability to immerse themselves in the fictional scenario and fully engage in the learning activity. Additionally, participants may have concerns about the logistical details of the simulation exercise, which can distract them from focusing on the learning objectives of the session. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, learners may feel exposed by the simulation experience in a manner that threatens their professional and social identity, which can lead to defensiveness and resentment.

Educators can directly address many of these potential threats to learner engagement by orienting participants to the medical simulation environment.

In such a setting, learners can fully engage in a challenging educational experience, venture beyond their intellectual and interpersonal comfort zones, and reflect on all aspects of their performance without worrying that they will be shamed or embarrassed.
