Infliximab is administered via an intravenous route. It has been shown to cause type I and type III hypersensitivity reactions in the studies conducted.

A variety of strategies are used to prevent infliximab-induced infusion reactions, including the following:

- Administering antihistamine and acetaminophen 90 minutes before the infusion

- Using a test dose of infliximab

- Patients with a prior history of an anaphylactic reaction to infliximab should receive prednisone, antihistamine, and acetaminophen before infusion.

**Dosage Adjustments**

- No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II), but caution and monitoring are essential.

- In patients with severe heart failure (NYHA Class III/IV), dosage adjustment is necessary, such that the dose is kept less than or equal to 5 mg/kg.

- As of this writing, no dosage adjustments have been recommended in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
