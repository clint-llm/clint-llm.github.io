Refractive errors are common in children.

Refractive errors result from the inability of the ocular refractive apparatus to sufficiently and accurately bend rays of light to a point focused on the retina. The prevalence of blurred vision precipitated by refractive errors amongst school-age children may reduce attention to detail, create a lack of interest in classwork and result in poor academic performance.

In some cases, significant refractive errors and spectacle use in parents may increase the likelihood of refractive errors in children being picked up earlier.

Children possess an active and malleable accommodation, which is attributable to the elasticity of the crystalline lens, intact extrinsic properties of the crystalline lens fibers, and degree of aggregated lens fibers. Consequently, children are more prone to vergence and accommodative dysfunctions, giving rise to binocular vision anomalies. The amplitude of accommodation tends to gradually and progressively recede in flexibility and magnitude with age.

The higher amounts of the amplitude of accommodation in children provided by the crystalline lens elasticity can mask a refractive error and bring parallel rays of light traveling from a distant object into focus on the retinal. This may grant the eye a pseudo-emmetropic status. This compensatory mechanism may break down with time resulting in fatigue and expressed symptoms. Children may have difficulty understanding their experience and relating their visual complaints and associated ocular discomfort to their parents and guardians.

This necessitates visual screening. A thorough evaluation can identify potential vision problems and eye disorders. Visual screening of children and teenagers, which can be done formally and informally, can help identify refractive errors, thus, enabling prompt medical attention.

In regions with limited resources, teachers can be trained to conduct vision screening.

Vision is commonly measured and recorded as visual acuity. Visual acuity is a measure of the resolving power of the human eye.
