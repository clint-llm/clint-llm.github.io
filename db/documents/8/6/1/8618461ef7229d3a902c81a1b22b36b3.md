The emergent cricothyroidotomy is not a complicated procedure from a technical standpoint. However, from a cognitive perspective, it may be prohibitive to the unprepared team. To perform this procedure successfully, it must involve an interprofessional team that includes physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists. BeforeÂ attempting intubation in a presumed difficult airway, the physician should announce to everyone involved in patient care that there is a potential need for emergent cricothyroidotomy. Often, this may include marking landmarks on the patient's neck. Announcing the potential for cricothyroidotomy eliminates the cognitive barriers before the procedure becomes required. All interprofessional team members must utilize open communication with the rest of the team as the patient's status changes. Interprofessional coordination will enhance patient outcomes. [Level 5]

The American College of Surgeons recommends the emergent cricothyroidotomy as the airway of choice in the can't intubate, can't ventilate situation. As per the Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines, the "...surgical cricothyroidotomy is preferable to a tracheostomy for most patients who require the establishment of an emergency surgical airway, because it is easier to perform, associated with less bleeding, and requires less time to perform than an emergency tracheostomy."
