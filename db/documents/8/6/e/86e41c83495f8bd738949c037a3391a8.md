Appendicitis is one of the most common causes of acute abdominal surgery in the United States, with more than 200,000 cases occurring annually and typically occurs between ages 5 and 45, but can occur at any age, with men having a slightly higher risk. Family history of appendicitis seems to slightly increase risk, as well as a personal history of cystic fibrosis.
