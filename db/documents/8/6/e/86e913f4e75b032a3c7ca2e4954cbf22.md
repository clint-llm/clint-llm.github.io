The heart musclesâ€™ blood supply comes directly from the system of coronary arteries that runs within the epicardial layer. Two main coronary arteries, the left coronary artery (LCA) and the right coronary artery (RCA), branch directly off the aorta via the coronary Ostia. These arteries and their branches supply tributary arteries that run perpendicular to the heart surface and transverse from the epicardium, through the myocardium, and down to the endocardium.

The venous system of the heart muscles runs parallel to the coronary arteries. Venous drainage of the left ventricular myocardium is completed by the interventricular vein and the great cardiac vein, which drains into the coronary sinus, found in the posterior right atrioventricular groove, which then drains into the right atrium.

The cardiac lymphatic drainage system is comprised of lymphatic capillaries and pre-collector vessels organized in plexuses within each of the heart wall layers.
