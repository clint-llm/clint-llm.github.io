Metachromatic leukodystrophy is a lysosomal storage disease characterized by the inability to degrade sulfated glycolipids, mainly the galactosyl-3-sulfate ceramides. It is caused by deficient activity of lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A, most commonly due to mutations in the arylsulfatase A (ARSA gene). During the process, the sulfated glycolipids are degraded into galactocerebroside by the enzyme Arylsulfatase A.
