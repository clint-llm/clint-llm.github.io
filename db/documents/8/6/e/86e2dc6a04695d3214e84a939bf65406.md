Indomethacin is the most effective treatment for chronic paroxysmal hemicrania. Indomethacin can exacerbate renal insufficiency and peptic ulcer disease. Indomethacin can cause cardiovascular thrombotic effects and should be used with caution in patients with prior stroke or myocardial infarction. Patients should be screened for renal impairment with a basic metabolic profile before initiating indomethacin treatment. Indomethacin should be avoided in patients who have a history of peptic ulcer disease. For patients with a risk of peptic ulcer disease who would benefit from indomethacin treatment, gastrointestinal prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor can be given concurrently with indomethacin to minimize the risk of gastrointestinal irritation. Bleeding risk is increased when antithrombotic medications are taken with indomethacin.
