An epidermoid tumor has a thin outer layer of epithelial cells encasing a large area of keratin. The tumor is made up of normal skin cells (stratified squamous epithelium) on the outside, while fatty acids and keratin are on the inside. It does not have adnexal structures.

Malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma has been reported.
