As Segond fractures have such a strong correlation with ACL ruptures, it is of no surprise that their history and mechanism of injury are also the same. Patients commonly describe a ‘pop’ following a twisting mechanism. They generally have an associated discomfort, swelling, decreased range of motion at the knee, and difficulty mobilizing.

There is no specific physical test for a Segond fracture, as they are generally noted on radiographs of the knee. However, as Segond fractures are often pathognomonic of ACL ruptures, testing for an intact ACL is imperative. Lachmann's test is the most sensitive physical examination maneuver in assessing for ACL tears, but there is also utility in the anterior drawer test. Integrity of all other ligaments of the knee should be assessed as well, including posterior drawer, varus/valgus stress testing, and pivot shift testing.
