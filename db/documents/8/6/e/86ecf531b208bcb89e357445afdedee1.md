Here are some important points:

- Paget disease of the breast is an unusual and different form of presentation of underlying breast cancer. The skin rash may actually indicate the underlying neoplasm in the breast that might need extensive work up as soon as possible.

- Most nipple rashes are simply a minor skin infection or a reaction to some irritant. A nipple rash that does not get better with topical steroid treatments requires further evaluation with advanced imaging and biopsy to rule out serious conditions like Malignant melanoma or mammary Paget disease, etc.

- The treatment depends on the stage of the condition, presence or absence of an underlying tumor, lymph nodes are involvement, hormone receptors & HER2 receptor status, and overall general condition of the patient.

- Surgical therapy, followed by whole breast radiation, is the treatment of choice for the best survival and prognosis.
