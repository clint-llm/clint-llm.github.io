When evaluating a patient with AKI, clinicians must pay attention to the temporal relationship between the timing of onset of AKI and exposure to a potential culprit drug. The classic triad of low-grade fever, skin rash and eosinophilia is present in only 10% of drug-induced AIN cases.

The most common urinary findings include sterile pyuria (82%) and subnephrotic range proteinuria (93%). White blood cell (WBC) casts can be present on sediment examination. Nephrotic range proteinuria can be seen with NSAIDs if there is a concomitant presence of minimal change disease or membranous nephropathy. Microscopic hematuria is reported in 67% of cases. Peripheral eosinophilia is seen in approximately 35% of drug-induced AIN cases and is less common with NSAIDs. Urine eosinophils, once considered a diagnostic marker, have proven to lack sensitivity and specificity, making it an unreliable test for making the diagnosis. A kidney biopsy is necessary for a definitive diagnosis.
