The clinical presentation may vary based on the severity of pulmonary contusion and other concurrent injuries. It may present with difficulty breathing and coughing, whereas mild cases may be asymptomatic. The affected area of the chest may be tender. Breath sounds may be decreased on auscultation. In severe cases, hemoptysis may be the presenting symptom. In extreme cases, alveolar gas exchange is disrupted, resulting in hypoxemia and hypercarbia, which leads to tachypnea and dyspnea.

In severe contusion, symptoms appear within hours, whereas in mild injury, symptoms may develop gradually over 24Â to 48 hrs.
