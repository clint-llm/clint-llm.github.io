Contraindications include patients with hypersensitivity to tobramycin or any other aminoglycoside antibiotics. In addition, caution is necessary for elderly patients, those prone to dehydration, and those with preexisting conditions, including renal failure, neuromuscular conditions like myasthenia gravis, and Parkinson disease.

Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea (CDAD) is reported with tobramycin injection and may range from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Careful consideration of the patient's medical history is essential, as cases of CDAD have been reported to occur more than 2 months after antibiotic administration. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, it may be necessary to discontinue ongoing tobramycin use. Close monitoring and appropriate management should be initiated in such cases.

Tobramycin injection contains sodium bisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Avoid tobramycin formulations containing sodium metabisulfite in patients with documented hypersensitivity.
