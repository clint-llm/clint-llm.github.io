Patients taking amoxicillin-clavulanate require monitoring at the beginning of therapy for signs of hypersensitivity and throughout the course for signs of secondary infection, such as C. difficile colitis or candidiasis.

Prolonged therapy, or use greater than 10 to 14 days, will require intermittent hepatic, renal, and hematologic function monitoring.

Patients with hepatic impairment should receive regular monitoring of liver enzymes up to several weeks after discontinuation of the antimicrobial.
