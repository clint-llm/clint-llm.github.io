A stricture is either benign or malignant. Appropriate management depends on identifying the correct etiology for stricture. The majority of esophageal strictures result from benign **peptic strictures**from long-standing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which accounts for 70 to 80% of adult cases.

**Benign Strictures**

- **Corrosive substance ingestion**: Accidental ingestion of, or suicidal poisoning with, household cleaning products are not uncommon occurrences. Exposure to these corrosive substances is one of the top five most common causes of poisoning in adults and children below five years of age, according to data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC).

- **Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)**: It represents a distinct chronic, local immune-mediated esophageal disease clinically characterized by dysphagia and histologically by eosinophilic-predominant inflammation.

- **Drug-induced esophagitis**: Many medications can cause pill-induced esophagitis. Common culprits include NSAIDs, potassium chloride tablets, and tetracycline antibiotics, among other medications. Frequently the initial symptoms are self-limiting, and therefore the patient continues with medication usage and is exposed persistently to the drug, causing esophagitis.

- **Radiation injury**: Radiation therapy, when offered alone or combined with surgery, can cause esophageal stricture as a side effect. Radiation is an integral part of head and neck cancer and lung cancer treatment. Radiation targeting the cervical or thoracic regions can cause damage to the surrounding normal soft tissue and result in one of the most common late complications (median duration of 6 months) called radiation-induced esophageal stricture (RIES).

- **Iatrogenic stricture****post-endoscopic therapy**: Upper GI endoscopy is commonly an option for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions involving the esophagus. A routine biopsy may be performed in cases of suspected Barrett esophagus or malignancy. Therapeutically, the endoscopic mucosal and submucosal resections of superficial esophageal malignancy are other possibilities. A side effect of these interventions includes damage to the underlying regenerative cell layer, leading to fibrosis and stricture formation. The risk of stricture increases with extensive circumferential resection.

- **Anastomotic Stricture**: Certain early-stage esophageal cancers and head & neck cancers are managed with an esophagectomy with a high end-esophagogastrostomy or bowel loop interposition. Such procedures have a postoperative risk of anastomotic stricture formation at the anastomosis; this can occur in 22 to 50% of cases and often require repeat endoscopic interventions to dilate the stricture due to high recurrence rates.

- **Chemotherapy-induced esophageal stricture**: Stricture occurrence related to chemotherapy is rare, and there are few case reports.

- **Thermal Injury**: This is a rare cause of stricture formation in patients who accidentally drink hot edible foods and fluids, especially coffee or tea. The majority of these cases respond to conservative management successfully. A small number of published case reports, where esophageal strictures developed after accidental ingestion of hot substances, described the need for endoscopic dilation or surgical correction to manage the strictures.

- **Infectious Esophagitis**: Viral infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex (HSV), human immune deficiency virus (HIV) and fungal infections with Candida can cause esophageal mucosal inflammation and stricture formation. They tend to occur in immunocompromised patients, and odynophagia is usually present.

**Other Rare Etiologies:**

- 
              
- Prolonged use of nasogastric tube
              
              
- Collagen vascular diseases such as scleroderma or SLE.
              
              
- Benign mucosal pemphigoid
              
              
- Graft versus host disease
              
              
- Esophageal web in Plummer-Vinson syndrome.
              
              
- Crohn disease
              
              
- Tuberculosis

**Malignant Stricture**

- Esophageal adenocarcinoma

- Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma

- Metastatic esophageal neoplasm - usually from lung cancer
