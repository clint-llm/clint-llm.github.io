Patients undergoing treatment with mirtazapine require monitoring for the following:

**Psychiatric Assessment**

- Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) - Stratifies severity of depression

- PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) - Objectifies the degree of depression severity.

- Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale - Suicide ideation (especially at the initiation of therapy or when doses are decreased or increased)

- GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7)- Measures severity of anxiety.

**Medical Assessment**

- Agranulocytosis or severe neutropenia (such as stomatitis, sore throat, other possible signs of infection, or a low WBC)

- Signs/symptoms of serotonin syndrome

- Lipid profile and weight gain.

- In elderly patients and patients with significant renal and hepatic impairment, clearance of mirtazapine is reduced. Therefore, clinicians should monitor renal and liver function and the drug levels in the blood.
