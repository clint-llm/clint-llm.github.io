One of the biggest concerns with epithelial cells is the potential for malignancy development as adenocarcinoma or papillary carcinoma. Some of the common adenocarcinomas that have high morbidity and mortality rates are lung, prostate, colon, and breast cancer.

Another clinical concern that relates to epithelial cells is metaplasia. Metaplasia is when one type of cell converts to another due to environmental stressors or changes. This process can occur in physiological or pathological conditions. For instance, a study on the cervical epithelium from postpartum women has shown the replacement of columnar epithelial tissue with squamous epithelial cells in the physiologic healing process of the postpartum period.

In addition to cancer and metaplasia, another important aspect of epithelial cell biology is the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a functional transition of fully differentiated polarized epithelial cells to mobile mesenchymal cells. Like metaplasia, EMT occurs in physiological and pathological circumstances, including embryonic gastrulation, tissue regeneration, inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer metastasis.

Furthermore, other forms of epithelial cell disorder apply to various human diseases, particularly immune-related conditions. Celiac disease and certain bacterial infections in the intestines can damage the microvilli of epithelial cells lining the intestines. In the lungs of premature infants, the cuboidal cells in the alveoli (type II pneumocytes) have not fully developed, and the surfactant production is impaired, causing respiratory distress syndrome in premature babies. In the skin, bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune subepidermal skin blistering disease, essentially renders hemidesmosomes ineffective. Human papillomavirus strains 1-4 can cause warts on the squamous cells of the epidermis.Â This virus causes an overgrowth of epithelial tissue on a connective tissue papilla. This vast array of diseases makes understanding epithelial cells clinically significant.
