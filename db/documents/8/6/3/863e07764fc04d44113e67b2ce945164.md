Avulsion injury of the levator ani muscle, specifically of the pubococcygeal segment, is common in postpartum women who have undergone a vaginal delivery.

Coccydynia refers to pain localized to the coccygeal region, without associated lower back pain or radiation/referral of pain. The condition affects individuals in all age groups; however, onset has typically been shown to be in the fourth decade, with a greater prevalence in women.

Treatment of coccydynia relies on the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), decreased time spent sitting, sitting modifications (such as "donut" shaped gel pads), as well as physical therapy. Local injections may also be options. Surgical management is typically for patients who have persistent pain despite non-operative management. Excision of any mobile coccygeal segments, coccygectomy, may be utilized; however, post-operative complications such as infection as well as continued pain and neurovascular complications are not uncommon.
