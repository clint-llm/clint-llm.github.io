Any pathologic elevation of the cellular components (erythrocytes, leukocytes, or platelets) or acellular components (protein) of blood can cause hyperviscosity. Conditions responsible for HVS that involve cellular components of blood include polycythemia vera, leukemia, and thrombocytosis. Sickle cell disease and spherocytosis can also contribute to HVS due to deformed red blood cells. The pathologic rise of acellular components can either be monoclonal or polyclonal. Monoclonal diseases include myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), and cryoglobulinemia. Rheumatic conditions such as seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjogren syndrome compromise polyclonal causes of HVS as well as Castleman disease and HIV infection.
