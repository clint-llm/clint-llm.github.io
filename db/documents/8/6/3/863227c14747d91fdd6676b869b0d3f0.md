The sympathetic tone provided by the greater splanchnic nerve has an overall inhibitory effect on the foregut. One major exception is the sympathetic excitation of the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla.

- Alimentary canal: Inhibition of motility and secretions of the distal esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to the level of the major duodenal papilla

- Liver: Stimulation of gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and glucose release. Glucagon from the endocrine pancreas enhances this effect

- Gallbladder: Inhibition of smooth muscle contraction and bile emptying

- Exocrine pancreas: Inhibition of pancreatic enzyme secretion

- Endocrine pancreas: Inhibition of insulin release, stimulation of glucagon release

- Adrenal medulla: Stimulation of chromaffin cells to secrete catecholamines

- Spleen: Sympathetic fibers contribute to the splenic plexus that innervates the splenic capsule and transduces the sensation of splenic pain
