Evaluation of brow ptosis outside of a thorough history and physical examination is rarely necessary. However, there are some cases in which imaging and laboratory studies are beneficial or even diagnostic. Myogenic causes of brow ptosis may be elucidated with certain assays; for example, myasthenia gravis may be diagnosed via serologic testing for acetylcholine receptor antibodies.
