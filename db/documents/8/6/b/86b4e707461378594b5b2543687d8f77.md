The Moyamoya disease (MMD) was first described in Japanese literature in 1957. Suzuki and Takaku first named it as “moyamoya disease” in 1969. MMD is an isolated chronic, usually bilateral, vasculopathy of undetermined etiology characterized by progressive narrowing of the terminal intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and circle of Willis. Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) corresponds to the same moyamoya phenomenon, but in the background of either neurological or extra-neurological, whether inherited or acquired conditions. A fragile network of abundant collateral vessels as a reaction to chronic brain ischemia develops predominantly at the base of the brain known as moyamoya vessels- meaning “something hazy like a puff of smoke drifting in the air” in Japanese
