The diagnosis of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is usually made with ultrasound (US). Still, a CT scan is needed to determine the exact location, size, and involvement of other vessels and the imaging of choice in symptomatic patients. The US can be used for screening purposes but is less accurate for aneurysms above the renal arteries because of the overlying air-containing lung and viscera. CTA requires the use of ionizing radiation and intravenous contrast. Magnetic resonance angiography can be used as well to delineate the anatomy and does not require ionizing radiation.

Most of these aneurysms are located below the origin of the renal arteries. They may be classified as saccular (localized) or fusiform (circumferential). More than 90% of abdominal aortic aneurysms are fusiform. Some people may develop an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm characterized by intense inflammation, a thickened peel, and adhesions to adjacent structures. Angiography is now rarely done to make the diagnosis because of the superior images obtained with CT scans.

For those patients with allergies to contrast media, MRA is an option. An echocardiogram is recommended as many patients also tend to have associated heart disease.

All patients need routine blood work, including a cross-match if surgery is necessary. Patients with comorbidity like diabetes, COPD, or heart disease should be seen by the relevant specialist and cleared for surgery.
