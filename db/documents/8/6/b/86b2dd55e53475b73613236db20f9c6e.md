Effective therapy with doxazosin for its various indications requires titration based upon response and tolerability. Open communication between patients and providers is crucial for successful treatment. Patients should receive education on the different common side effects of doxazosin, and the provider should conduct a thorough review of other medications for possible interactions, paying particular attention to other antihypertensives, nitrates, and PDE-5 inhibitors.
