Compartment syndrome of the forearm is a surgical emergency that can be clinically challenging to diagnose. Patients who present with signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome have to be informed of the complications associated with this condition. Where clinical signs and symptoms are not conclusive, compartment measurements should be taken early to diagnose the condition. In patients who do not have the capacity, are sedated or unconscious, the best interest decision should be made involving their families where possible (and if time allows).
