The controversy of cricoid pressure results from low-level evidence for its effectiveness and its often incorrect use. Numerous studies have been conducted to assess the knowledge base of various interprofessional team members, including clinicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, medical students, paramedics, nurse anesthetists, and anesthesia assistants. Results from these studies often demonstrate a lapse in knowledge regarding effective technique. The most prominent issues include the misidentification of anatomy and improperly applied pressure. One meta-analysis identifies that staff members who may lack training in rapid sequence intubations could be asked to assist during emergent intubations. The low evidence for cricoid pressure's prevention of aspiration may be attributed to undertraining and inconsistent application.

Tools for improving consistency include regular training and the use of assistive devices. In emergent settings, anesthesia staff who would be expected to have familiarity with cricoid pressure may not be available. Preparation for such scenarios involves regular training of anesthesia staff along with training of support staff commonly present during emergent intubations, such as nurses, respiratory therapists, surgical technicians, and others.
