Chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis (CNH) is a benign inflammatory condition that affects the skin and cartilage of the pinna. CNH is also known as Winkler disease, named for the dermatologist who first described the condition in 1915. It was later defined in 1918 by Foerster, who also outlined the microscopic, clinical, and treatment details of the disease.

This condition commonly affects the helix of the pinna, though in certain cases, the antihelix also may be affected. For this reason, some have suggested renaming the condition chondrodermatitis nodularis auricularis. Other synonyms for the condition are chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis, ear pressure sores, and chondrodermatitis nodularis antihelicis.
