Portal vein thrombosis is asymptomatic in a majority of patients. Clinically PVT may be acute or chronic, although no time frame exists to distinguish acute from chronic PVT. Portal hypertension develops as a result of chronic obstruction to flow within the portal venous system. Portal hypertension can present with left upper quadrant abdominal fullness due to splenomegaly or upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices.

Non-cirrhotic non-malignant acute PVT usually presents with abdominal pain (91%), fever (53%) and ascites (38%).

If new portal vein thrombosis develops in people with cirrhosis, they present with hepatic decompensation in the form of ascites, jaundice or variceal bleeding. In patients with underlying cirrhosis, ascites usually develop when large amounts of fluids are given intravenously to treat massive bleeding from ruptured esophageal or gastric varices.

Patients with EHPVO present with only portal hypertension-related complications like a well-tolerated upper GI bleed, splenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia or may be asymptomatic with incidental detection following an imaging procedure.
