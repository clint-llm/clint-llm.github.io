Given the length of the pretrichial incision, primary contraindications to employing this approach involve the potential for an unsightly scar. Patients who have receding hairlines or whose hairlines are expected to recede should avoid the pretrichial approach. Similarly, patients with a history of poor scarring - or anyone focused on minimizing visible scars -Â  may prefer a different approach that uses shorter incisions or hides them in the hair-bearing portion of the scalp.

Because coronal approaches involve elevating the forehead as a unit, it is difficult to apply substantially more tension on one side relative to the other; for this reason, patients with significant brow asymmetry may be better served by a brow lift technique that addresses each brow separately, such as direct, temporal, or transblepharoplasty lifts. Finally, patients with low-lying hairlines may not be the best candidates for pretrichial brow lifting due to the potential to advance the hairline slightly during closure.
