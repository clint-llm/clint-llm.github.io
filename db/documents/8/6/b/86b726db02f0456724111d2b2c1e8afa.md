Generally, treatment is only required for the extracutaneous manifestations of epidermal nevus syndromes, such as the treatment of seizures and orthotics for limb length discrepancies.

- Surgical excision can be utilized to address symptomatic epidermal nevi or for improved cosmesis. Routine full-thickness excision of nevus sebaceous is not considered the standard of care in the pediatric population and, if desired for cosmetic purposes can be done at an older age when challenges of administering local anesthesia are reduced. The malignant potential of nevus sebaceous is low, particularly in the pediatric age population.

- Other non-invasive treatments, including photodynamic therapy, laser ablation, and dermabrasion, can be considered on a case-by-case basis. However, these treatments may mitigate but not completely eliminate the malignant potential.

- The treatment for CHILD nevus is particularly interesting in that the affected pathway is critical in the synthesis of cholesterol. Treatment with combination topical lovastatin and cholesterol has been reported to result in clearance.
