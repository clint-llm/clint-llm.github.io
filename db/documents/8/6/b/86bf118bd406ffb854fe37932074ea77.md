Struvite stones are known to demonstrate "coffin-lid" crystals on urine microscopy. An in vitro experiment with urease-producing bacteria revealed that crystallization of struvite evolves from an initial arrow-head morphology to an X-shaped structure before finally exhibiting the "coffin-lid" crystalline morphology at the end of the third day.
