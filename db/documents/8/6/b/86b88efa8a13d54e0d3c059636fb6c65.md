Some commonly documented variations in basilar artery distribution exist. One of these variations includes persistent carotid-basilar artery anastomosis. Several cadaveric studies put the incidence of this variation at less than 0.5%. A persistent trigeminal artery is the most commonly documented persistent carotid-basilar artery anastomosis, followed by the persistent hypoglossal artery. Other persistent carotid-basilar artery anastomoses are a persistent primitive optic artery and a persistent primitive pro-atlantal intersegmental artery. Another documented variation is a fenestrated basilar artery, wherein there are duplications of portions of the basilar artery. There is documentation of perforation of the basilar artery from autopsies, with a prevalence rate as high as 5%. This perforated variation predisposes to basilar artery aneurysm. The labyrinthine artery, also called the internal auditory artery, typically arises from the AICA but may arise from the basilar artery in about 15% of cases. A hypoplastic basilar artery is a very rare condition often seen alongside a persistent carotid-basilar artery anastomosis. The posterior inferior cerebellar artery, which is typically a branch of the vertebral artery, may arise from the basilar artery in about 10% of cases.
