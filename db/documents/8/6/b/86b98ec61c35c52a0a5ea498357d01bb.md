**Nonoperative Management**

Isolated nondisplaced medial epicondyle fractures are best managed by nonoperative management. This approach includes a brief period of immobilization in a long arm cast in the first week with the elbow flexed to 90 degrees.

**Operative Management**

Indications for surgical referral and operative management of medial epicondyle fractures include open fractures, incarcerated intra-articular fragments, and valgus instability. In these cases, surgical intervention for fracture is necessary. Intra-articular fragment entrapment occurs in 5 to 18% of cases of medial epicondylar fractures.
