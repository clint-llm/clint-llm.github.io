**Vincristine**

Neurotoxicity is the most common side effect of vincristine.

The prevalence of vincristine-induced neuropathy is known to be 1.36 percent in the pediatric population.

The presence of pre-existent diabetic neuropathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type I correlate with a higher risk of developing sensorimotor polyneuropathy.

Commoner in African Americans, dose-dependant.

The Incidence of peripheral neuropathy with the use of vincristine approaches 30 percent.

CYP 3A5 is involved in the metabolism of Vincristine. Lower expression of the CYP 3A5 gene slows down the metabolism of vincristine

**Vinblastine**

Although paralytic ileus is known to be more common with the use of vincristine, research shows it to occur with a frequency of 2 to 4 percent in patients receiving vinblastine.

Transient elevation of transaminases occurs in 5 to 10 percent of cases.

**Vinorelbine**

Mild-moderate neuropathy and constipation.

Mild to moderate nausea and vomiting has been shown to occur in a third of patients on vinorelbine, whereas diarrhea and stomatitis are less frequent.

Dose and duration dependant myelosuppression generally occurs 5 to 10 days after the administration of the drug and is known to subside after 1 to 2 weeks of cessation of use.
