Infantile spasms are spasms that occur in infancy or early childhood. They are classically characterized by symmetric, brief jerking spells that involve the head, neck, arms, legs, and abdomen and may consist of flexion, extension, or a combination of both. Infantile spasms often are associated with hypsarrhythmia, a pattern seen on electroencephalogram. When the triad of infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia, and developmental regression occur together, this triad is termed West Syndrome. This activity describes the pathophysiology, etiology, presentation and management of infantile spasm and West syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients affected by this disease process.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiologies of infantile spasm and West syndrome. 
- Review the presentation of infantile spasm and West syndrome. 
- Summarize the treatment and management options for infantile spasm and West syndrome. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of infantile spasm and West syndrome. and improve outcomes.
