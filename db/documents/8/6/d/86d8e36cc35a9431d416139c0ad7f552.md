The etiology of LMDF is uncertain. The earliest reports presumed that lesions of LMDF were related to tuberculosis based on similar clinicopathologic findings to other tuberculids. The term tuberculid was historically used for reactive conditions associated with tuberculosis, in which the actual infectious agent is present elsewhere and is not found in the skin lesions. However, nowadays, LMDF does not arise in association with pulmonary tuberculosis and does not generally respond to anti-tuberculous medications.Â Tuberculin skin testing is often negative in these patients.M. tuberculosis organisms within the LMDF granulomas.

Similar to other facial granulomatous eruptions, it is often postulated that initial immune-mediated damage to the hair follicle leads to subsequent rupture of the follicle and an allergic or foreign body granulomatous response to keratin, sebum, or microbial components in the dermis.
