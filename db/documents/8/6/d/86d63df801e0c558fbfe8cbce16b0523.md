There are many complications of PPV. Some of these can cause serious morbidity to the patient, including blindness. Just as with any surgical procedure, infection or hemorrhage can occur anywhere. There can also be technical difficulties that need a re-operation. However,Â it is important to review the specific subsets of these complications and how they can affect outcomes. Due to these reasons, careful post-op monitoring is necessary. Standard timeframes are at one day, one week, four weeks, and three months after the operation. Patients may need additional follow up if some of the following complications occur.

In the early post-op period, there can be a sudden rise in intraocular pressure. The increase in intraocular pressure can cause irreversible damage to the optic nerve and thus cause blindness. This complication typically receives treatment with pressure-lowering drops and/or anterior chamber or vitreous tap in certain circumstances. PPV can also cause corneal epithelial defects in the early post-op period, which can result in tearing, blurry vision, and photophobia. Sometimes they are planned when the cornea is scraped intraoperatively to visualize the fundus better. They are more likely to be persistent in patients with diabetes mellitus. Depending on the extent of the epithelial defects, conservative and operative interventions are available. A vitreous or choroidal hemorrhage may occur that needs further operative intervention. Additional early vascular complications include central retinal artery occlusion or cystoid macular edema. Care is necessary to avoid iatrogenic injury to blood vessels during the surgery. During surgery, iatrogenic retinal breaks or tears can occur that predispose to retinal detachment. Any retinal detachment will need a repeat PPV. Any retinal breaks or tears may need laser therapy and/or repeat PPV.

Patients can develop endophthalmitis on the scale of days to weeks after PPV. Patients can develop ocular pain, reduced vision, red-eye, and hypopyon. This condition is considered an ophthalmic emergency and needs urgent intervention to prevent permanent blindness. Options include intravitreal antibiotics, intravenous antibiotics, and repeat PPV. A repeat PPV is very likely in these circumstances. Patients can also develop iris neovascularization and neovascular glaucoma, which is more likely in disease states like diabetic retinopathy, which is believed to occur through the spread of angiogenic agents to the anterior chamber. The rise in intraocular pressure from this disease state can cause irreversible vision loss and is treated fairly similarly to early post-op rises in IOP. The only additional interventions focus on control of diabetes and diabetic retinopathy.

In the late post-op period, patients can develop cataracts. Cataracts can affect vision and may need operative intervention. PPV is associated with narrowing of the anterior chamber and secondary glaucoma if gas and silicone oil are used without appropriate positioning or in the absence of a peripheral iridectomy. A peripheral iridectomy is needed in some instances to prevent pupillary block but can also be used prophylactically for secondary glaucoma. This disease can be managed with intraocular lowering drops and/or surgical interventions.
