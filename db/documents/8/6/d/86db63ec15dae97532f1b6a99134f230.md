Differential diagnosis includes conditions considered as members of the family of marginal and acral keratodermas, and other distinctive disorders involving the acral parts with similar appearing lesions. It is important to know that involvement of the borders or palmoplantar transition areas typifies 'marginal keratodermas'; involvement of the dorsum of the hands and feet qualifies the marginal keratoderma to be called 'inverse.'

- **Focal acral hyperkeratosis**- differentiable on histopathology due to changes limited to the epidermis, with the absence of elastorrhexis

- **Keratoelastoidosis marginalis**(also known as Ramos and Silva marginal keratoderma) - associated with intense sun exposure and shows prominent actinic damage

- **Other acral keratoderma variants**- hereditary papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma, acrokeratoderma hereditarium punctatum, punctate palmoplantar keratoderma

- **Miscellaneous conditions**- acrokeratosis verruciformis of Hopf, degenerative collagenous plaques (of the hands), digital papular calcinosis, verruca plana, primary cutaneous amyloidosis, and mosaic acral keratosis
