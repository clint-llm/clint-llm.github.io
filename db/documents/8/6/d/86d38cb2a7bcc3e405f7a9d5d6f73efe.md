Although pearly penile papules are usually asymptomatic, they are often mistaken by males who carry them for genital warts, thus causing concerns of having a sexually transmitted infection. This fear of infection may cause tense couple relationships, as it raises questions about fidelity within the couple. One study from Singapore showed that approximately one in seven men, who were examined in a sexually transmitted infection clinic, had only pearly penile papules and no infection.

The level of patient concern appears to be related to the size of the papules. According to a study, two-thirds of males with moderate-to-large pearly penile papules have concerns about their lesions, while one-third of those with less-noticeable papules are worried.
