A traumatic event will almost invariably precede the presentation of calcaneal injury.

- Patients will present with diffuse pain, edema, and ecchymosis at the affected fracture site.

- The patient is not likely able to bear weight.

- Plantar ecchymosis extending through the plantar arch of the foot should raise suspicion significantly.

- There may be associated disability of the Achilles tendon, also raising the suspicion of a calcaneus injury.

- Skin quality around the heel must be evaluated for tenting and/or threatened skin.  This is especially important in the setting of Tongue-type calcaneus fractures.
