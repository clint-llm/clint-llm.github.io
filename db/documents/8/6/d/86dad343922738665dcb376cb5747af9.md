The diagnosis of amphetamine-related psychiatric disorders requires a high index of suspicion for patients presenting with a sympathomimetic toxidrome. These include tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis, hyperthermia, and agitation. Many overdoses and toxidromes have similar presentations to those associated with amphetamines, but there are several key points to remember. With anticholinergic toxicity, patients have anhidrosis, not diaphoresis. Also, the duration of action is an important consideration. Other psychostimulants like cocaine have shorter half-lives than amphetamines (one hour versus roughly 10 hours). Other intoxications, such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), and serotonin syndrome, are much harder to distinguish but typically do not produce as much agitation and/or psychosis as seen with amphetamines. Hyperthermia versus heatstroke can often be distinguished from history, but patients may have varying degrees of confusion and either anhidrosis or diaphoresis. Thyrotoxicosis and pheochromocytomas can be present with hyperadrenergic symptoms and further delineated with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free T3, T4, and plasma metanephrine or 24-hour urine catecholamines, respectively. Co-ingestion is common, possibly delaying diagnosis because of mixed toxidromes.
