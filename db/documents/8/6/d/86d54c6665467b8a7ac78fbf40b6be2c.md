Laboratory testing can help to determine the existence and extent of alcohol and substance abuse. These include urine, blood, saliva, hair, and breath tests to detect substance use. Similarly, physicians can order serum alcohol levels, ethyl glucuronide in the urine, and phosphatidyl ethanol levels in the blood. There is also a myriad of testing options that can help suggest a history of drug or alcohol use.

Chronic alcohol use can cause an increase in liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), with a 2:1 characteristic pattern, respectively. Macrocytic anemia, elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase levels (GGT), and increased prothrombin time are other commonly associated findings associated with alcohol abuse. Health care professionals can use theÂ  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria to evaluate whether an individual meets the criteria for alcohol and substance use disorders.
