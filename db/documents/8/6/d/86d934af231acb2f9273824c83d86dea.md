Most cases of PCS occur in patients with mild TBI but can occur with TBI of any severity. TBI results from blunt force, nonpenetrating head trauma, trauma, concussion, assault, or sports-related injuries. Mild TBI is defined as a Glasgow coma score (GCS) of 13 to 15 and is further sub-grouped as complicated versus uncomplicated. Complicated mild TBI comprises symptoms of a concussion with associated head computerized tomography scan (CT) abnormalities, including hematoma, subarachnoid or subdural bleed, midline shift, or fractures. Uncomplicated mild TBI presents with a normal head CT scan. Patients with uncomplicated mild TBI are more likely to have a resolution of symptoms in less than 3 months. Patients with complicated TBI or more than one TBI are more likely to suffer from PCS or persistent PCS. Other risk factors include female gender, age, psychiatric history, or a history of chronic pain syndromes.
