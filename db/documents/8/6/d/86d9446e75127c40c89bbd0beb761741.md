Contraindications to the use of terbinafine include:

- Chronic or active liver disease

- History of an allergic reaction to oral terbinafine

As terbinafine inhibits the hepatic CYP2D6 enzyme, drug interactions can occur.

Terbinafine, although a pregnancy safety category B medication, is not recommended for use during pregnancy. Similarly, as terbinafine is known to be excreted in breast milk, its use should be limited to after breastfeeding; this is due to the usually indolent nature of nail dermatophyte infections, lack of embryotoxicity data with terbinafine, and the litigious culture of the United States.
