Pyocystis is a severe condition that can result in prolonged hospital stays, significant additional surgery, and death. Patients at risk of it should be informed of this and the common symptoms. These symptoms include suprapubic pain, malodorous discharge, and fevers. Patients at risk of pyocystis include those who have had surgical defunctioning of the bladder or have anuria because of renal failure.

High-risk patients of these groups include those who are also on dialysis, immunosuppressed, or have a previous culture for proteus mirabilis. Management of other medical conditions and lifestyle factors such as smoking and diabetes may also be of benefit.

Rapid identification and treatment of pyocystis are crucial to the successful medical management of pyocystis. Delayed intervention may result in the need for surgical intervention and a poorer prognosis.
