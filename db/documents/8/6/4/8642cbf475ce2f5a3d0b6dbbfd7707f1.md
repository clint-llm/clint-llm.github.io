- Infection: A low proportion of patients get Ommaya reservoir-related infections, varying from 5.5% to 8%.

- Suboptimal Position: Misplacement of a ventricular catheter is common. This can lead to direct injury or hemorrhage, though it is rarely clinically relevant. Direct injury can occur to basal ganglia, internal capsule, fornix, thalamus, choroid plexus, and vessels such as the superior thalamostriate vein. Periprocedural hemorrhage can occur in up to 7% of placements, but only 0.8% are deemed clinically relevant.

- Subdural Hematoma or Subdural Hygroma: May occur acutely during the implantation or later due to the recurrent aspirations.

- Mechanical Failure of Device: In the original case series by Ommaya and Ratcheson, catheter malfunction was the most common complication, involving 23.5% of cases.

- Leucoencephalopathy and encephaloclastic cyst due to the use of intrathecal chemotherapeutic agents
