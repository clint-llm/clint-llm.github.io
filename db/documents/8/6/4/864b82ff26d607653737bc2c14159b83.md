Extubation is contraindicated in patients who are not candidates for initiating ventilator liberation strategy and in those who have failed the spontaneous breathing trial.

Generally, the following groups of patients are not candidates for liberation; however, individual cases vary.

- Acute respiratory failure needing active management: The cause of respiratory failure should be resolved or significantly improved even to consider placing patients on liberation pathways.

- 
              
- Any patient with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 150, needing FiO2 over 0.40 or PEEP greater than 10, minute ventilation requirement greater than 15 L per minute, rapid shallow breathing index over 105 (shallow rapid breaths with higher respiratory rate and lower tidal volumes), excessive secretions, worsening chest imaging, are not ready for considering extubation.
              
              
- Patients should be able to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation with low-level respiratory support, which patients can manage spontaneously or be provided with non-invasive modalities.

- The patient should be able to protect the airway, maintain airway patency, have a strong cough, and have minimal secretions.

- The four most important things to remember are mental status, oxygenation, ventilation, and expectoration (acronym, MOVE).

- Any cardiovascular instability is a contraindication:

- 
              
- Tachycardia (higher than 140) of any sort needs active management.
              
              
- Shock state of any etiology requiring higher doses of vasopressor support - patients can be safely extubated sometimes if they are on small doses of one vasopressor and no other contraindication.
              
              
- The patient should not have any active ischemia or pulmonary edema.

- A Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of less than 8 is a contraindication. In rare situations, patients with low GCS can be extubated if they have a good gag and cough and the absence of any other contraindications.

- 
              
- For most patients considered for extubation, mental status should be alert, awake, and able to follow commands. There should be no other neurologic abnormality impairing the patient's ability to breathe spontaneously.

- Any acute brain injury (including an invasive intracranial pressure measuring device for raised intracranial pressure) where such an injury was the primary reason for intubation.

- Plans to return to the operating room needing general anesthesia in the next 24 hours. Extubation should not be attempted as the patient will be re-intubated for surgery and may remain on the ventilator for a few more days, depending on the outcomes of the surgery.

- Current use of paralytic agents for any reason.

- The presence of an open abdomen is generally a contraindication - if the patient is subject to rigorous SBT, it can jeopardize surgical management.

- Ongoing therapeutic hypothermia is also a contraindication.
