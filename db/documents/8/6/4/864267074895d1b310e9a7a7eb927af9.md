Most newborns with primary ciliary dysfunction (PCD), formerly known as immotile cilia syndrome, develop neonatal respiratory distress with atelectasis visible on chest radiographs. Unlike other causes of respiratory distress in newborns, which occur in the first few hours after birth, the respiratory distress associated with primary ciliary dysfunction patients occurs 12 to 24 hours after delivery in term infants. The four main clinical features described in primary ciliary dysfunction are unexplained neonatal respiratory distress in term infants, early-onset year-round wet cough, early-onset year-round nasal congestion, and laterality defects. If three or more of these features are met, the specificity for primary ciliary dysfunction diagnosis is more than 96%. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with primary ciliary dysfunction.

**Objectives:**
- Review presenting features of primary ciliary dysfunction.
- Explain how to evaluate primary ciliary dysfunction.
- Summarize how to diagnose primary ciliary dysfunction.
- Outline the need for a well-integrated interprofessional team approach to improve care for patients with primary ciliary dysfunction.
