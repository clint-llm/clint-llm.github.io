Patient education will be specific to the underlying cause of the supraglottic airway obstruction. For example, parents of a child with laryngomalacia may be coached on sleeping and feeding positions to facilitate respiration until the child grows out of the problem. Any patient who does have a supraglottic tumor will be counseled regarding symptoms of increased work of breaqthing or voice changes, and to present for re-evaluation immediately in order to minimize the risk of an emergent airway. Patients who undergo tracheostomy will be extensively educated on caring for the stoma, suctioning and preventing mucus plugs, and what to do if the tracheostomy tube becomes occluded (immediately remove it and proceed to the nearest Emergency Room).
