Generally, primary infection with HHV-6 is self-limiting, and those who are immunocompetent survive without sequelae. In immunosuppressed individuals, reports have described more severe illness. Documentation exists of pneumonitis, hepatitis, and organ rejection in transplant patients, with death reported in patients with encephalitis and meningoencephalitis.
