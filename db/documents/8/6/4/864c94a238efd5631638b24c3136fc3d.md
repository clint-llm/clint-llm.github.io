The overwhelming majority of clotting factors are manufactured principally in hepatocytes. Hepatocytes are responsible for providing the body with clotting factors XIII, XII, XI, X, IX, VII, V, II, and I. Clotting factors VIII (antihemophilic factor A) and III (tissue factor) originate from endothelial cells, whereas clotting factor IV (calcium ion) is freely available in plasma. Megakaryocytes produce the body’s platelets and also contribute to the production of factor V.
