**External ear:**

The gene expression markers involved in external ear growth include sox2, nestin, BST-1, and OCT4. Individuals with microtia demonstrate a reduction in these gene markers.

**Middle ear:**

FGFR2 is a regulator of middle ear growth and controls the proliferation of cells. If there is a mutation in this growth factor, malformations may occur.

**Inner ear:**

Septin7 regulates the formation of the sensory epithelial area in the inner ear, but not the differentiation of the hair and supporting cells.
