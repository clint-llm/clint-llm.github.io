Fluconazole interacts with 14-demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme responsible for catalyzing the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol.

Mammalian demethylation is less sensitive to fluconazole inhibition; therefore, using fluconazole helps the body counteract the causative agents of fungal infection. However, triazoles are considered fungistatic against Candida species despite this mechanism of action.

Microbiologically, fluconazole has activity limited to yeasts and some clinical activity against the endemic fungi, Histoplasma, Blastomyces, and Coccidioides. In addition, fluconazole has excellent activity against Candida and Cryptococcus species but has less activity against C. glabrata and no activity against C. krusei.

**Mechanism of Resistance**

Mutation in the ERG11 gene decreases the binding of the drug target enzyme, lanosterol C14-alpha demethylase, to fluconazole leading to drug resistance. Efflux pumps coded by two carrier gene families include CDR-1 and CDR-2 genes belonging to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily (ABC) and MDR-1 genes. Efflux pumps encoded by CDR-1 can cause resistance to all azole drugs, while efflux pumps encoded by MDR are selective for fluconazole. Resistance in C. glabrata usually includes upregulation of CDR genes.
