Fosphenytoin is a medication used to manage seizures (treatment of generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus, focal [partial] onset seizures, or generalized onset seizures, and for the prevention and treatment of seizures occurring during neurosurgery). It is a water-soluble phenytoin prodrug that can be employed in situations where phenytoin use is not advisable. It is in the hydantoin anticonvulsant class of medications. This activity outlines the indications, action, and contraindications for fosphenytoin as a valuable agent for neurosurgery prophylaxis, short-term oral phenytoin substitute, and treatment for status epilepticus. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, off-label use, and monitoring pertinent for healthcare team members in managing patients with seizures and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of fosphenytoin.
- Describe the adverse effects of fosphenytoin.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for a patient taking fosphenytoin.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance fosphenytoin and improve outcomes.
