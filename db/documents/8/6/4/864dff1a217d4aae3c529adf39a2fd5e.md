Gastroschisis is a paraumbilical abdominal wall defect associated with protrusion of the bowel through the defect. A membrane does not cover the bowel exposed in utero and, as a result, may be matted, dilated, and covered with a fibrinous inflammatory rind. Infants have a high proportion of intrauterine growth restriction. This activity will review the diagnosis, classification, delivery, and repair and highlight the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with gastroschisis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of gastroschisis.
- Review the appropriate neonatal management of exposed bowel and surgical options for gastroschisis closure.
- Outline the long-term complications of gastroschisis.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance care of neonates with gastroschisis and improve outcomes.
