It is important to recognize the complications that may arise not only from performing wrist splinting but those which may occur due to the underlying injury as well. Compartment syndrome is a major complication resulting from increased pressure within fascial planes, which leads to impaired venous and lymphatic flow, which may be due to increased internal swelling or an excessively tight cast/splint. This is an emergency, and it is, therefore, crucial that patients be educated regarding the six signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome â€“ pain out of proportion (early), paresthesia, poikilothermia, paresis, pallor, and pulselessness (late). If caused by internal pressure, treatment is an emergent surgical fasciotomy, whereas increased pressure due to a cast/splint is relieved by cutting the cast or loosening splint or elastic wrap. Improper positioning, splint fabrication, or lack of padding can cause pressure ulcers, lacerations, increased pain/swelling, and tendon rupture.
