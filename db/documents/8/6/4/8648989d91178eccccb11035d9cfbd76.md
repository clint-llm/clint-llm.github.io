The mental status examination is essential for use by psychiatrists in evaluating a patient on initial and subsequent encounters. The mental status examination can aid in the diagnosis of a patient when combined with a thorough psychiatric interview including the history of present illness, past psychiatric history, substance use history, medical history, review of systems, family history, social history, physical examination, and objective laboratory data such as toxicology screening, thyroid function, blood counts, and metabolic levels, neuroimaging.

The example mental status examination note shown previously was that of a patient with bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features in an inpatient psychiatric unit. The diagnostic criteria for bipolar I disorder would have been determined by combining the information gathered from a thorough psychiatric interview with those seen in the mental status examination that indicates current mania.

In subsequent encounters, comparing the mental status examination to previous ones will help the clinician to determine if a patientâ€™s symptoms are improving or worsening.
