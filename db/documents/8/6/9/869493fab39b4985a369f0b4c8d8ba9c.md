Venous sinus thromboses (VST) are venous blood clots of the major veins of the brain. They can be provoked or unprovoked, and the signs and symptoms thereof will depend on the location and extent of the clot. Common locations for sinus thrombosis include the dural sinuses, the cavernous sinus, and deep sinuses of the cortex.
