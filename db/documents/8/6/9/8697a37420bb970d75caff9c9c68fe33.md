**TNM Staging (AJCC, 8th Edition)**

**Primary Tumor (T)**

Tx: Primary tumor cannot be assessed or tumor proven by the presence of malignant cells in sputum or bronchial washings but not visualized by imaging or bronchoscopy

T0: No evidence of a primary tumor

Tis: Carcinoma in situ - tumor measuring 3 cm or less, no invasive component

T1: Tumor measuring 3 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus  (i.e.  not in the main bronchus)

T1mi: Minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, tumor has an invasive component measuring 5 mm or less

T1a: Tumor ≤1 cm in greatest dimension, superficial spreading tumor in central airways (spreading tumor of any size but confined to the tracheal or bronchial wall)

T1b: Tumor >1 cm but ≤2 cm in greatest dimension

T1c: Tumor >2 cm but ≤3 cm in greatest dimension

T2: Tumor >3 cm but ≤5 cm or tumor with any of the following features: involves the main bronchus regardless of distance from the carina but without the involvement of the carina,      invades visceral pleura, associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region, involving part or all of the lung

T2a: Tumor >3 cm but ≤4 cm in greatest dimension

T2b: Tumor >4 cm but ≤5 cm in greatest dimension

T3: Tumor >5 cm but ≤7 cm in greatest dimension or associated with separate tumor nodule(s) in the same lobe as the primary tumor or directly invades any of the following:        parietal pleura, chest wall (including superior sulcus tumors), phrenic nerve, parietal pericardium, or separate tumor nodule(s) in the same lobe as the primary

T4: Tumor >7 cm in greatest dimension or any tumor invading one or more of the following: diaphragm, mediastinum, heart, great vessels, trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, esophagus, vertebral body, or carina; separate tumor nodule(s) in a different ipsilateral lobe than that of the primary tumor

**Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**

Nx: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed

N0: No regional lymph node metastasis

N1: Ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension

N2: Ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal nodes

N3: Supraclavicular/scalene nodes and/or contralateral mediastinal/hilar nodes

**Distant Metastases (M)**

M0: No distant metastasis

M1: Distant metastasis present

M1a: Separate tumor nodule(s) in a contralateral lobe; tumor with pleural or pericardial nodule(s) or malignant pleural or pericardial effusions

M1b: Single extrathoracic metastasis, involving a single organ or a single distant (nonregional) node a single extrathoracic metastasis has a better survival and different treatment choices, reason why it has now been staged separately

M1c: Multiple extrathoracic metastases in one or more organs****
