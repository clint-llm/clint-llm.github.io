Most food poisoning and non-foodborne diarrheal diseases from C. perfringensÂ are due to undercooked meat or poultry. Therefore, patient education regarding food safety protocols is essential for preventing and limiting the spread of disease. Patients with risk factors such as diabetes or vascular disease must not delay seeking medical attention in the event of cellulitis or trauma due to an increased risk of severe infection and rapid progression.
