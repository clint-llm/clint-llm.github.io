Iodine is crucial for the normal functioning of the thyroid. Without iodine, the body would not be able to synthesize the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, which are essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Excess iodide, such as that occurs with ICM administration, may impact thyroid functioning.

Some patients, however, exhibit the opposite response. Instead of transitory hypothyroidism, they develop hyperthyroidism by escaping the physiologic negative feedback mechanism of the Wolf-Chaikoff effect. This pathologic response to the exogenously administered iodine load is referred to as the Jod-Basedow syndrome, and it is thought to occur as a result of impaired autoregulation. This does not happen in patients with normal thyroid glands but only in patients with background thyroid abnormalities with some kind of thyroid problems, like autoimmune diseases or nodular goiters.
