Although phagocytosis is a potent defense mechanism, certain common pathogenic species can evade the process, including E. coli and S. aureus. For example, S. aureus secretes a protein termed extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein (Efb), which binds fibrinogen in the blood, generating a shield-like capsule around the bacterium to evade phagocytosis. The Efb protein also binds complement protein C3, resulting in impaired opsonin recognition and reduced phagocytosis.

Impaired phagocytosis can also lead to the development of autoimmune disorders. Post-apoptotic cells contain uniquely identifiable surface markers, such as phosphatidylserine. Like PAMPs, such molecules can be recognized by specialized receptors on phagocytic cells, triggering phagocytosis and subsequent clearance of dead-cell debris. In efferocytosis, macrophages surround apoptotic cells and phagocytose them to clear the tissue region containing them. However, if phagocytosis is non-functional in macrophages, post-apoptotic molecules remain trapped in the tissue and may trigger the development of autoantibodies. Moreover, phagocytosis itself could be detrimental to cellular components. For example, macrophages phagocytose neuronal myelin in peripheral demyelinating disorders.
