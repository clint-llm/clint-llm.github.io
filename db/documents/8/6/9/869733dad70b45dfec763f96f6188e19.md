Hydatiform mole (also known as molar pregnancy) is a subcategory of diseases under gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD), which originates from the placenta and can metastasize. It is unique because the tumor originates from gestational tissue rather than from maternal tissue. Other forms of gestational trophoblastic disease include gestational choriocarcinoma (which can be extremely malignant and invasive) and placental site trophoblastic tumors. Hydatiform mole (HM) is categorized as a complete and partial mole and is usually considered the noninvasive form of gestational trophoblastic disease. Although hydatiform moles are usually considered benign, they are premalignant and do have the potential to become malignant and invasive.
