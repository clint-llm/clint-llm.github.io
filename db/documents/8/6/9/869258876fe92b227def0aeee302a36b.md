The single most important test required to make the diagnosis is an abdominal plain film series including anterior-posterior and left lateral decubitus views. Findings of dilated loops of bowel, pneumatosis intestinalis, and portal venous air is diagnostic for necrotizing enterocolitis. Pneumatosis intestinalis is the visualization of small amounts of air within the bowel wall and is pathognomonic for necrotizing enterocolitis. Portal venous air is not universally present but is a poor prognostic sign when found. Free air in the abdomen may be seen when perforation has occurred.

An abdominal radiograph is a valuable tool for tracking the progression of the disease as well. In most cases, this should be repeated serially every 6 hours until definitive treatment has occurred.

Laboratory studies have limited utility and are non-specific. Leukopenia with a white blood cell count below 1500 per microliter is a strong indicator of established sepsis. A comprehensive metabolic panel may show hyponatremia and low serum bicarbonate. Blood cultures are usually negative. A breath hydrogen test may be positive but is rarely performed.
