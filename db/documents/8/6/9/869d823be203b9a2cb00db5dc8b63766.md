No specific monitoring is necessary for nitrous oxide use. An in-line oxygen analyzer with an alarm should be used to prevent the delivery of a hypoxic gas mixture. Modern anesthetic machines have fail-safe mechanisms to prevent this (nitrous oxide-oxygen proportioning systems). Standard ASA monitoring is necessary when administering nitrous oxide for any indication.

The rooms where NO is utilized should be monitored for proper ventilation, waste gas scavenging, and hazard communication. In addition, a pin-index safety system should be monitored to prevent the random attachment of a nonoxygen tank to the oxygen portal.

According to the American Society of Anesthesiology, periodic assessment of airway patency, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate should be done during emergence and recovery, with particular attention to monitoring oxygenation and ventilation. Hemodynamic parameters should be monitored during emergence and recovery.
