Approximately 1 million cases of cryptococcal meningitis are reported annually. The incidence have markedly increased since 1950s because of corticosteroid use and improvement of survival in cancer patients. However, most of the cryptococcal reports come from the 1980s and are predominantly AIDS-related cases. Approximately 6% of patients with AIDS develop cryptococcal infections, and patients with AIDS-associated cryptococcosis account for 85% of all patients diagnosed with cryptococcosis.
