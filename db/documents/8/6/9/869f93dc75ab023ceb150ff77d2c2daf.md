Anorectal malformations occur during the 8 to 12 weeks of fetal gestation due to the failure to complete the development of the hindgut. There is impaired septation, and the cloacal membrane is usually found to be short in its dorsal part; thus, the hindgut retains its attachment to the sinus urogenitalis.
