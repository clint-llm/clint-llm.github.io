Complications of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism include thyroid storm, permanent hyperthyroidism, and atrial fibrillation.

Caution is necessary when ordering ICM in pregnant patients due to the ability of iodine to cross the placenta. Exposure to iodine in utero correlates with fetal hypothyroidism and goiter development. Fetal hypothyroidism is thought to be due to the failure of the fetus to escape the physiologic Wolff-Chaikoff effect. Although fetal hypothyroidism after maternal ICM is usually transitory, it can still have detrimental effects on fetal development. Continued exposure of the neonate to iodine in the first few weeks of life may lead to permanent hypothyroidism.

Recent case reports reported patients who suffered either from hypokalemic periodic paralysis after the use of iodinated substances inducing hyperthyroidism or pericardial tamponade, which is very unusual in thyrotoxic states as it is mostly seen in hypothyroid states.
