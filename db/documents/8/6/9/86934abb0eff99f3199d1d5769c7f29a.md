MRI shoulder arthrography is typically ordered to assess anatomical structures poorly visualized without the use of intra-articular contrast. These structures include the biceps-labral complex, glenohumeral ligaments, labrum, rotator interval, and the joint capsule.

Injury to one or more of these structures can result in shoulder instability. Patients with shoulder instability complain of pain and a feeling of looseness of the joint. They often experience repeated dislocations. In a patient with shoulder instability, MRI arthrography allows for the accurate assessment of the glenoid labrum, glenohumeral articular cartilage/glenoid bone stock, capsular tears, glenohumeral ligament tears, and rotator cuff tears, particularly following prior rotator cuff repair.

Again, plain radiographs of the glenohumeral joint should be performed before an arthrogram, as discussed above. Arthrography can also be utilized for suspected adhesive capsulitis of the glenohumeral joint or in patients with persistent symptoms postoperatively from orthopedic shoulder surgery.
