**Temporary Transcutaneous Pacing (TTCP)**

- Depending on the clinical scenario, consider analgesia and/or sedation before or immediately after, initiating transcutaneous pacing as the electrical current needed for capture is painful.

- Place the pacing pads in an anterior-posterior (preferred) or anterior-lateral configuration.

- Attach the pads to the pulse generator, most often a defibrillator with pacing capabilities. Some pulse generators require the attachment of cardiac monitoring leads for proper functioning.

- Select the pacing function on the defibrillator.

- Select the desired rate per indication, typically 60 to 80 BPM or 10 to 30 BPM greater than the intrinsic rate.

- Starting at 70 milliamps (mA), increase the output by 5 to 10 mA until the initiation of capture, indicated by a wide-complex QRS following every pacer spike (electrical capture) and signs of improved perfusion (mechanical capture).

- It is critically important to confirm ventricular contraction (mechanical capture), as it is not difficult to be misled by electrical activity representing a QRS complex, which is possible by confirming a pulse that matches the set pacemaker rate by palpation echocardiogram, pulse oximetry, or arterial waveform.

- The current at which capture is obtained is called the threshold current.

- Once capture is confirmed, set the current at 5 to 10 mA higher than the threshold current to prevent loss of capture.

- If the pacing rate does not get captured at greater than 120 mA, reposition the pads and repeat the above steps.

**Temporary Transvenous Pacing (TTVP)**

- Ensure that the pulse generator is in good working condition and all equipment is at the bedside.

- Obtain central venous access using an appropriately sized percutaneous venous introducer sheath, typically 6 Fr. Inappropriately sized sheaths may be unable to pass the pacing catheter or may leak around it. The right internal jugular vein and left subclavian veins are the preferred vessels because of a more direct path to the right ventricle (RV). Ultrasound guidance for placement is highly recommended. Detailed instruction on obtaining central venous access is beyond the scope of this article.

**Placement without ECG Guidance**

- Connect the pacing electrodes to the pulse generator.

- Insert the catheter into the introducer sheath so that the balloon and electrodes are past the distal end of the introducer sheath (approximately at the 20 cm mark on the catheter). Note: do not inflate the balloon while it is within the introducer sheath.

- Turn on the pulse generator. Set the pacing generator to the desired rate depending on the indication, typically 60 to 80 BMP or at least 10 BMP greater than the native rate. The initial output requires setting to 2 to 5 mA. Decrease the sensitivity to the lowest level.

- Inflate the balloon and advance the catheter slowly. The cardiac monitor will typically show pacer spikes. When the catheter passes the right ventricle and contacts the endocardium, a wide QRS complex with an LBBB pattern will follow every pacer spike (electrical capture). It is also reasonable to intermittently deflate the balloon to check for capture.

- Deflate the balloon, secure the catheter in place, and make a note of catheter depth.

- Ensure mechanical capture by evaluating: signs of perfusion, peripheral/central pulse rate equals pulse generator set rate, pulse oximetry waveform, arterial line waveform.

- Decrease the output slowly until capture is lost. Increase the output to regain capture; this is the threshold current, typically less than 1 mA. Increase the output to approximately 2.5 times the threshold current, typically 2 to 3 mA.

- If demand pacing is the goal, adjust the sensitivity such that native cardiac electrical impulses inhibit the pacemaker. See the section on epicardial pacing below for a more in-depth discussion of demand pacing.

**Placement with ECG Guidance**

- Connect the negative (distal) electrode to ECG lead V1 using an alligator clip.

- Insert the catheter into the introducer sheath so that the balloon and electrodes are past the distal end of the introducer sheath (approximately at the 20 cm mark on the catheter). Note: do not inflate the balloon while it is within the introducer sheath.

- Inflate the balloon and slowly advance the catheter. Closely monitor the ECG. ECG morphology should change predictably with electrode location.

- In the high right atrium (RA), there will be a large negative p-wave, typically greater than the QRS complex, followed by a negative QRS complex.
- As the catheter passes through the RA, the p-wave becomes biphasic and then positive.
- When the catheter passes into the RV, the p-wave becomes smaller and negative, followed by a deeply negative QRS complex.
- Note: the duration of the QRS complex will depend on the native cardiac activity. For example, an AV nodal escape rhythm will have a narrow QRS complex, while a ventricular escape rhythm will have a wide QRS complex.
- When the catheter makes contact with the right ventricular endocardium, an injury pattern will result, with a deep, negative QRS complex followed by marked ST elevation.

- Advance the catheter until observing the RV pattern or RV endocardial pattern.

- Deflate the balloon, secure the catheter in place, and make a note of catheter depth.

- Ensure mechanical capture by evaluating: signs of perfusion, peripheral/central pulse rate equals pulse generator set rate, pulse oximetry waveform, arterial line waveform.

- Decrease the output slowly until capture is lost. Increase the output to regain capture; this is the threshold current, typically less than 1 mA. Increase the output to approximately 2.5 times the threshold current, typically 2 to 3 mA.

- If demand pacing is the desired goal, adjust the sensitivity such that native cardiac electrical impulses inhibit the pacemaker. See the section on epicardial pacing for a more in-depth discussion of demand pacing.

**Epicardial Pacing**

- Select the desired parameters on the pulse generator, depending on the clinical scenario. For the prevention or treatment of tachyarrhythmias, this may be asynchronous. For the prevention or treatment of bradydysrhythmias, this may be asynchronous or synchronous (demand) pacing.

- If demand pacing is the objective, adjust the sensitivity such that native cardiac electrical impulses inhibit the pacemaker. Then set the pacemaker rate. In demand pacing, this represents the backup rate, and the pacemaker will deliver an impulse if it does not sense a native electrical impulse at a rate greater than the backup rate.

- Adjust the pacemaker output and evaluate for signs of mechanical capture as described above.
