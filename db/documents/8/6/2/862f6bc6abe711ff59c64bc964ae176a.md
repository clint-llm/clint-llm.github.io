Anatomically the TFCC includes the triangular fibrocartilage disc, extensor carpi ulnaris tendon subsheath, ulnotriquetral and ulnolunate ligaments, dorsal and volar distal radioulnar ligaments, meniscal homolog, and the ulnocarpal collateral ligament. The triangular fibrocartilage disc attachment on the radial side is to hyaline cartilage, making this weaker than the ulnar sideâ€™s bony attachment.

Positive ulnar variation can leave the TFCC vulnerable to injury. Ulnar variation will decrease with supination and increase with pronation. Small changes in ulnar length have been shown to have substantial effects on the amount of load to the ulna.
