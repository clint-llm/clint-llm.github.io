The circle of Willis is of great clinical significance due to its structure, function, and location. As the connection between the anterior and posterior cerebral circulations, the CoW perfuses the brain and protects against ischemia (at least in those with a complete or mostly-complete ring of vessels). It is, however, one of the most common locations for intracranial aneurysms. An estimated 85% of intracranial aneurysms occur in the anterior circulation, either at the ICA-PCom junction, within the ACom, or the MCA.

A phenomenon called subclavian steal occurs when there is significant stenosis or occlusion of the subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the VA. In such cases, blood is carried from the contralateral VA to the BA and then retrogradely through the ipsilateral VA to the subclavian artery, distal to the blockage. This arrangement provides collateral flow to the affected arm.

Moyamoya disease is a chronic vascular disease characterized by bilateral stenosis of the terminal portion of the ICA. As a consequence, there are extensive fine collaterals developed with time trying to compensate for the distal ICA territory ischemia and hypoperfusion. The fine collaterals appear in angiography like a "puff of smoke," which gives rise to the Japanese meaning of moyamoya. It is most prevalent in Japan and is more common in females compared to males. The etiology of the disease is unknown; however, research suggests a possible genetic association.
