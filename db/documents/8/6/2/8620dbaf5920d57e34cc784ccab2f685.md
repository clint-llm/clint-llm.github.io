The most important factors for quality are its definition, creation, and control. The errors can be permanent or variable, as well as internal or external.

It is necessary to use reference standards and control materials in each analysis undertaken and, in some cases, to use duplicate analysis to demonstrate precision. Control materials can be prepared in-house or obtained commercially. All laboratories should confirm the normal range for their particular methods, and the normal range obtained should not differ significantly from the published data.

To check on laboratory tests for any errors or deviation from the normal requires monitoring; one such method of monitoring is the use of the Levey Jennings chart. This uses controls or averages of the results presented graphically. A single-day error or trend can be identified over time, and corrective action can be taken. Additionally, laboratories should also participate in appropriate proficiency testing programs to achieve lab quality assurance.
