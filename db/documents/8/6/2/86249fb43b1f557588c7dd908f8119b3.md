A comprehensiveÂ history helps to delineate possible etiologies. For example, the following information could be obtained from the patient's chart, the patient, or the family:

- Any history of hepatic disease or hepatic decompensation

- Any concomitant relevant chronic health conditions

- The timeline of symptoms with which the patient has presented. This is particularly important in patients with acetaminophen toxicity.

- Toxic habits or high-risk behavior

- Any recent medications or recent ingestion of hepatotoxins, including herbal products

- Family history: always ask for Wilson disease and thrombotic disorders.

- Any recent surgeries where anesthetic agents could be implicated as the possible etiology of the ALF.

Physical exam findings of hypotension, altered mental status, fever (with infectious etiology), right upper quadrant discomfort, pain, and tenderness with nausea and features of jaundice and fluid overload may be included.
