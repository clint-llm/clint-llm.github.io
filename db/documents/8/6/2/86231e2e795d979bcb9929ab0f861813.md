While the overall diagnostic sensitivity of the physical exam is reportedly as high as 90%, imaging studies are often performed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathologies.

Plain radiograph standard shoulder films include 2 views (AP and lateral/scapular Y) The AP view of the shoulder can be used to determine the critical shoulder angle (CSA), which involves the extent of lateral coverage by the acromion and the inclination of the glenoid. At CSAs greater than 35 degrees, there is an increased likelihood that a rotator cuff is contributing to impingement syndrome. Similarly, measurements such as the acromiohumeral distance (AHD) can help to detect rotator cuff pathologies and defects. The AHD is measured from the inferior edge of the acromion to the humeral head. The normal range is approximately 7 to 14 mm in men and 7 to 12 mm in women. A lower AHD suggests rotator cuff pathology. The scapular Y view allows for the assessment of the humeral head on the glenoid. Additional plain radiographs featuring the outlet view will best visualize and evaluate the shape of the acromion.

Other imaging modalities to consider include ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Consideration for advanced imaging with MRI is recommended after 6 weeks of therapy without clinical improvement.
