Toxic and nutritional optic neuropathy both present with symmetric and progressive bilateral vision loss, decreased color vision, central or cecocentral scotomas on formal visual field testing, and the absence of a relative afferent pupillary defect. In most cases, vision loss progresses over months rather than days to weeks, and visual acuity worsens slowly. A thorough history is crucial to making a diagnosis. Specifically, any patient presenting with slow, bilateral symmetric vision loss should be asked about exposure to drugs, alcohol use, tobacco use, dietary intake, and occupational background. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of toxic and nutritional optic neuropathy and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the typical presentation of toxic and nutritional optic neuropathy. 
- Explain how to evaluate for toxic and nutritional optic neuropathy.
- Outline the management of toxic and nutritional optic neuropathy.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving coordination and communication to advance the management of toxic and nutritional optic neuropathy and improve outcomes.
