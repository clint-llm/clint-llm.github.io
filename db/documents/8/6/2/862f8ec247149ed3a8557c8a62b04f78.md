Medical personnel, especially those working in child and maternal health, may be required to intervene in cases of short stature. Adequate knowledge on the underlying conditions, their treatment, and the need for counseling can greatly improve patient outcomes and prevent the development of short stature and assist in improving the quality of life of individuals who have already attained full maturation. These efforts require an interprofessional healthcare team that includes the family clinician/mid-level practitioner, specialists, nurses, and pharmacists. This team must coordinate their efforts and have open communication so that all team members are on the same page and can lend their individual expertise to guide optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
