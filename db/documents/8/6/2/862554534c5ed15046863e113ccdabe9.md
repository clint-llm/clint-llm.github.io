Evaluation of intravascular volume and clinical assessment are critical because fluid compartment volumes cannot easily be measured. Intravascular volume may undergo assessment by using laboratory/physical exams, and hemodynamic monitoring means.  Frequent evaluations are necessary despite the method used to confirm the initial impression to best manage fluid replacement. The physical examination is most reliable when assessing a patient’s baseline fluid status**.**

Insensible fluid loss is routinely a cause of concern when evaluating patients. Patients may exhibit nonspecific and specific signs on exams such as dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, poor capillary refill, tachycardia, and dyspnea. The cause of insensible fluid loss may be due to many diagnoses, including surgery, respiratory loss, dehydration, burns, metabolic, and vascular etiologies. While the physical exam findings may point to hypovolemia, the cause is difficult to know without proper laboratory and imaging studies.
