The falx cerebri is a significant surgical landmark for neurosurgeons accessing the lateral ventricles via an interhemispheric transcallosal approach. Agenesis or partial agenesis of the falx cerebri allows the cerebral hemispheres to adhere and prevent midline transcallosal surgical access to the ventricles.
