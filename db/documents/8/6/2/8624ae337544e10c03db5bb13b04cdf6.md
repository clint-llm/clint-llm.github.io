The treatment modality for Foster Kennedy syndrome tumors include:

- Surgical resection

- Chemotherapy

- Radiotherapy

- Medical therapy

The management of FKS is usually by surgical resection, although chemotherapy and radiotherapy are also employed, especially in old geriatric patients who are more prone to mortality.

Regarding medical therapy, the first line of action is to give systemic corticosteroids, although it is usually an asymptomatic treatment for the reduction of edema around the tumor and intracranial pressure.

In older patients, it is preferable to go for a non-neurosurgical procedure such as stereotactic radiotherapy and radiosurgery. The use of hydroxyurea has been anecdotally found to be useful, especially for unresectable tumors and large residual tumors.
