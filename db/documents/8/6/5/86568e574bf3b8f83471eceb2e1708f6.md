The etiology for the concomitant divergent exodeviations varies for each type.

**Congenital (Infantile) Exotropia**

Congenital (infantile) exotropia is a rare condition compared to congenital esotropia.

**Primary Exotropia**

This can be associated with mechanical or innervational factors. The mechanical factors which can lead to exotropia include shape and axes of orbit, interpupillary distance, the mechanical property of the conjunctiva or tenon's capsule, extraocular muscle characteristics. The innervational factors include an imbalance between the convergence and divergence mechanisms. Thus an excessive divergence or insufficient convergence can lead to an exodeviation.

**Sensory Exotropia**

This often results from poor visual acuity in one eye. Sensory exotropia is more common when unilateral vision loss occurs in infancy or adulthood. It may appear secondary to anisometropia, unilateral medial opacity secondary to corneal opacity or lenticular changes, unilateral aphakia, optic atrophy, or macular pathology.

**Consecutive Exotropia**

Consecutive exotropia may result from a surgical overcorrection of esotropia or a spontaneous change of esotropia to exotropia.
