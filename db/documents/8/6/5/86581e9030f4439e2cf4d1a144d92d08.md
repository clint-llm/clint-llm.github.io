The first sign of nephrotic syndrome in the pediatric population is usually swelling on the face. This is followed by edema of the entire body. Adult patients can present with dependent edema. Frothy urine may be a presenting symptom.

Additional features in a patient's history are related to the cause of the nephrotic syndrome. For instance, a recent commencement of NSAIDs suggests such drugs as the cause. Similarly, a more than 10-year history of diabetes mellitus with symptomatic neuropathy suggests diabetic nephropathy.

**Physical Examination**

Edema is the most prominent feature of nephrotic syndrome, and in the beginning, it develops around the eyes and legs. Over time, the edema becomes generalized and leads to increasing weight and the development of ascites or pleural effusions. Hematuria and hypertension may be present less frequently, although these are more prominently seen in nephritic syndrome.

Additional features on examination vary according to the cause of the nephrotic syndrome. Also, it depends on whether or not renal function impairment is present. For instance, in the case of longstanding diabetes mellitus, the patient could have diabetic retinopathy, which is closely associated with diabetic nephropathy. If the kidney function is impaired, the patient may have anemia, hypertension, or both.
