Symptoms of bacterial meningitis, including Streptococcal, can develop either suddenly or over a few days. Typically they are present 3 to 7 days after exposure. There are no specific symptoms that allow recognition of causative agents of bacterial meningitis based solely on history taking and examination.

**Adults**

The classic triad of diagnostic symptoms of meningitis in adults includes fever, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status; however, only 44% of adult patients with bacterial meningitis present with all three symptoms.

On physical examination, signs of meningeal irritation can be present - nuchal rigidity, Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs. Those signs have high specificity in patients with meningitis. However, their sensitivity is low. In a study conducted by Thomas et al. that analyzed adults with meningitis suspicion, researchers reported the specificity of 95% and sensitivity of 5% for both Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs and a sensitivity of 30% and specificity of 68% for nuchal rigidity.

**Children**

Clinical signs of neonatal and infant meningitis are usually non-specific, including irritability or lethargy, fever or hypothermia, poor feeding, and vomiting with diarrhea. More specific signs on the physical examination like bulging fontanel, nuchal rigidity, and seizures in neonates are usually late findings.
