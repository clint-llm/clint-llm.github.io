The spread of the disease is thought to have been facilitated by the military troops' movement during World War I across Europe. Although the exact amount of affected individuals was never recorded, it is estimated more than one million were affected.

The condition was more prevalent in individuals between the ages of 10 and 45 without gender predominance. In the somnolent-ophthalmoplegic form, the mortality exceeded 50%.
