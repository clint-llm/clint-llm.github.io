**Small Cylinders**

In patients with very small cylinders, it may be difficult to differentiate which lines are blacker or duller, especially with the astigmatic dials. It is, however, safe to assume that if the final subjective endpoint is very good (i.e., equal to or better than 6/6), small cylinders may not have a significant effect on visual acuity and visual comfort. If the endpoint is poorer than 6/6, especially when the pinhole shows that a better VA can still be achieved, the clinician may switch to using the Jackson-crossed-cylinder technique (see image).

In summary, different authorities have differing views regarding small cylinders obtained in the refraction process. Generally, cylinders should be prescribed as long as their introduction improves visual acuity.

**Irregular Astigmatism**

In irregular astigmatism, the principal axes are not perpendicular to each other. Such a patient may report that two distinct lines are black.

**Secondary Changes in Astigmatism**

As with any refractive error, astigmatism can change naturally or secondary to variousÂ factors, including infection (see image), trauma and surgery.
