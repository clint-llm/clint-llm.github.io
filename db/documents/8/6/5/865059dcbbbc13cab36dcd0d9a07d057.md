The autonomic nervous system (ANS) includes all regions implicated in controlling autonomic, unconscious, and involuntary functions in total body homeostasis. In general, the full range of physiologic functions are ultimately necessary for human survival and allow us to interact with the external environment in a wide range of conditions. Together with the slow-acting, long-lasting effects of the endocrine system, the ANS exerts its fast-acting, short-lived effects on the most diverse functions of the body, controlling visceral smooth muscle activation in vascular beds and other tubular organs and secretion of glands. In this activity, we will share a general overview of these different functions in health and how their malfunction affects daily life.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the most common etiologic and risk factors for developing autonomic dysfunction.
- Outline the most common presentation and management considerations for patients with autonomic diseases.
- Identify how to evaluate the levels of ANS dysfunction.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients with autonomic sphere symptoms and disorders.
