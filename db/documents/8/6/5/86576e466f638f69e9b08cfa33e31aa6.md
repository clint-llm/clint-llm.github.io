Due to the rarity of the disease, there are no there is no standardized treatment approach, and the treatment is guided by the clinical presentation and the severity of the disease.

For patients presenting with auricular, nasal or articular involvement without systemic involvement, treatment includes anti-inflammatory medications, colchicine, or dapsone. Low-dose glucocorticoid therapy is often required.

For patients with more severe presentation such as large airway involvement such as laryngeal or tracheobronchial chondritis, abrupt onset of sensorineural hearing loss, or ocular involvement, glucocorticoid therapy with  IV methylprednisolone 1 gram for three days followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg along with immunosuppressive therapy is indicated. The most commonly used immunosuppressive agents include cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, azathioprine, and cyclosporine. Cyclophosphamide is commonly used as the initial medication (1-2 mg/kg); after remission is achieved, cyclophosphamide is switched to other less toxic immunosuppressive agents like azathioprine or methotrexate.

Biologics have been used in the treatment of relapsing polychondritis. The most commonly used biologic is the TNF-alpha inhibitor infliximab. Other biologics which have been tried with variable results include adalimumab, etanercept, abatacept, tocilizumab. Data on rituximab has not shown success, and this agent is not recommended as the first-line biologic agent.

Surgical interventions such as stenting, airway dilation, tracheostomy, and laryngotracheal reconstruction are needed in cases of airway collapse.
