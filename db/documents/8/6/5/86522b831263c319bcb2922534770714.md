Differential diagnosis of gray-blue lesions includes other dermal melanocytoses and non-accidental trauma. **Nevus of Ota**(oculodermal melanocytosis) will typically involve the face & orbits in a unilateral trigeminal nerve distribution. Nevus of Ota does not regress and can be associated with orbital melanocytoma, which requires resection.**Nevus of Ito**, where the melanocytic pigment involves the neck, supraclavicular & scapular regions. There have been rare cases of malignant transformations noted, particularly if there are fast-growing nodules.**Non-accidental trauma**should be particularly considered if there are lesions in atypical areas, tenderness to palpation of the lesion, or multiple lesions in various stages of healing.
