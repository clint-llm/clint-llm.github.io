Steroids are widely prescribed by clinicians, including MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs, as part of an interprofessional team that also includes nurses and pharmacists. One of the most dangerous side effects of these drugs is elevated IOP. Thus, it is essential for the entire interprofessional healthcare team to monitor the patient for eye symptoms and refer them to an ophthalmic clinician or optometrist for the screening of glaucoma.
