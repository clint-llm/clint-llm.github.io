The cervical rib typically consists of a head, neck, and tubercle. It is attached posteriorly to the first rib by a fibrous band near in the insertion of the anterior scalene muscle. Cervical ribs must articulate with the transverse process to be considered a rib.  Unilateral cervical ribs are found more frequently on the left side than the right side. Unilateral cervical ribs occur more frequently than bilateral cervical ribs.

There are four types of cervical ribs:

- Type 1: Complete rib that articulates with the first rib or manubrium

- Type 2: Incomplete rib with a free distal tip

- Type 3: Incomplete rib with a distal fibrous band attachment

- Type 4: Short piece of bone extending beyond the C7 transverse process

There is no physiological function of a cervical rib.
