The majority of individuals who suffer inferior shoulder dislocation are young. A significant number of them will suffer a recurrent dislocation in the future. Rotator cuff tear is often the key pathology. Minor trauma accounts for the majority of recurrent dislocations. Some patients with pain may not be able to return to sporting activities and others may have restricted arm and shoulder use for 2-6 weeks. Recurrence rates among athletes vary from 30-90%.
