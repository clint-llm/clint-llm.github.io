Absolute contraindications to corticosteroid injections include local infection and bacteremia. If the injection is intraarticular, absolute contraindications would also include septic arthrosis and intraarticular fracture. In the setting of biceps tendon sheath injection, it should be noted that the biceps tendon sheath communicates with the glenohumeral joint.Â  Therefore, medication injected into the biceps tendon sheath will also extend to the joint. If the clinical indication is to assess for septic arthrosis or tenosynovitis, one must carefully evaluate the overlying soft tissues for signs of cellulitis. It is crucial to avoid any potential contamination of the joint or tendon sheath, which could occur by placing the needle through infected soft tissue before accessing the joint. Relative contraindications include local or juxta-articular osteoporosis, coagulopathy, or recent injection or multiple frequent injections, defined as three times over the last year or within the prior six weeks.
