Risk factors for cerebral ischemia include heart disease, including heart conditions such as atrial fibrillation, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, atherosclerosis/hyperlipidemia, and history of strokes. Behavioral risk factors include physical inactivity, poor sleep, obesity, excessive alcohol intake, and tobacco use. Sickle cell disease and other hematologic disorders, especially hypercoagulable conditions, can also increase the risk of ischemic stroke. Minimizing risk for stroke involves treating these conditions with a healthy diet, exercise, and medication adherence. In particular, statins and blood thinners have been proven to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke.
