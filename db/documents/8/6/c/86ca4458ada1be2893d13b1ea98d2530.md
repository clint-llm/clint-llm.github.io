Cutis laxa (CL) is a group of rare diseases of connective tissue characterized by redundant skin with loss of elasticity and premature aging. Heritable forms have variable transmissions and clinical expressions. Three major groups are individualized based on the mode of inheritance: autosomal dominant CL, autosomal recessive CL, and X-linked recessive CL. Acquired forms are more frequent and characterized by a later onset. This activity reviews the workup of cutis laxa and describes the role of health professionals working together to manage this condition.
