Despite its ability to cause life-threatening diseases, strongyloidiasis is one of the most neglected tropical diseases. Moreover, Strongyloides infection can last the host's lifetime due to its ability to cause autoinfection of the host. The helminth S. stercoralis mainly infects humans but also occurs naturally in domestic dogs, cats, and primates. Manifestations of infection can range from asymptomatic to life-threatening complications and require a high degree of suspicion to make the diagnosis. This activity examines the pathogenesis, disease manifestations, and management of strongyloidiasis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients affected by this disease.

**Objectives:**
- Review the life cycle and mechanism of infection of Strongyloides stercoralis.
- Describe the clinical presentation of a patient infected with Strongyloides stercoralis.
- Summarize the medical management of a patient infected with Strongyloides stercoralis.
- Outline the importance of the interprofessional team in advancing care for patients infected by Strongyloides stercoralis.
