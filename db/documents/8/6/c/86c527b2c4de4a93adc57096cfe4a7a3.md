All patients with multiple myeloma will eventually relapse or become resistant to treatment at some point in their lives. The etiology of RRMM is not well understood. Identifying risk factors enables clinicians to implement targeted intervention strategies and preventive measures, reducing the disease burden and minimizing the risk of relapse.

Multiple risk factors have been identified as contributing to relapse or resistance to therapy, including short duration of previous remission, aggressive progression or relapse, high-risk genetic mutations, inadequate response to previous therapies, plasma cell leukemia, and dysregulation in the immune system.

Almost 20% of the patients have an aggressive relapse with high-risk cytogenetics like del17p, add 1q/del1p, t(4;14), t(14;16). Involvement of any 2 high-risk abnormalities is considered a "double-hit myeloma," whereas having 3 or more high-risk abnormalities is deemed a "triple-hit myeloma." On the other hand, patients having trisomies, t(11;14) or t(6;14), are considered to have standard risk myeloma.

Poor performance status and toxicities due to combination therapies may indirectly delay or interrupt treatments, resulting in early relapse.
