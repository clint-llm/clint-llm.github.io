Knowledge of the anatomy of the temporal bone is a critical and necessary qualification for performing mastoid surgery safely. The temporal bone connects to the parietal, occipital, zygomatic, and sphenoid bones. It can be described as a pyramidal bone with the apex pointing in the anteromedial direction.

There are three main subdivisions of the temporal bone: petrous, squamous, and mastoid. Intuitively, mastoidectomy involves creating an open cavity within the mastoid portion of the temporal bone. The anterior border of the mastoid cavity is demarked by the posterior bony ear canal. The spine of Henle is an important landmark found at the posterior superior lateral edge of the ear canal, which marks the level of the antrum of the mastoid. The superior border of the mastoid cavity is marked by the temporal line. The temporal line is found at the inferior limit of the temporalis muscle, and it approximates the level of the middle fossa floor. The posterior border of the mastoid cavity is limited by the sigmoid sinus. Medially, the Koerner septum is a flat shelf of bone, deep to the superficial mastoid cells, which marks the boundary between the petrous and squamous parts of the temporal bone. Further medially, the lateral semicircular canal, as well as the mastoid antrum, are reliable landmarks that can help surgeons assess the depth of dissection relative to the middle ear space.
