Alloantibody formation can occur in 10 to 15% of patients with type 3 disease. This means that the potential for this complication requires appropriate management as these patients have an increased risk for life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to vWF-FVIII preparations. During pregnancy, vWF levels increase in most women with types 1 and 2 vWD; labor and delivery are typically normal. However, patients with type 2B disease may experience hemorrhagic problems. Women with vWD whose vWF does not rise to normal levels during pregnancy require assessment with a specialist and interprofessional team management.

Some of the less common but more serious include GI bleeding, hematomas, and hemarthrosis, potentially leading to progressive joint damage and degeneration. In these cases, VWD limit the range of motion of an affected joint.
