The lymphatic drainage of the head and neck is unique. Its remarkably well-delineated and characterized anatomic subgroups are closely associated with draining anatomic structure. These, in turn, are related to malignant neoplasms arising from specific anatomic structures. Intimate knowledge of this network allows the surgeon to complete an oncologically-appropriate dissection. It also helps the radiation oncologist appropriately treat elective nodal levels to reduce recurrence, and the primary care physician to guide the path to the necessary work up.
