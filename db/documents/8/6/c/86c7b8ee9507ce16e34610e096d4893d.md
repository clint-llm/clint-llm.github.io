Volar splinting is a valuable technique for managing traumatic and non-traumatic conditions of the hand and wrist. The splint immobilizes and supports the metacarpals and carpals while allowing room for swelling. The splint can be removed to examine wounds that may accompany the injury.

Instruct the patient to keep the splint clean and dry. The extremity should be elevated, and an ice pack applied to the splint for 20 minutes every few hours. If the fingers become cold, blue, numb, or painful, seek medical attention. The patient should have close follow up within a few days. The simple removal of the splint allows for wound care in some cases. Inform the patient of the potential complications of splinting and encourage the patient to return should a concern develop.
