The clinician should discuss the risks, benefits, and alternative treatment options to OMT with the patient before performing OMT and obtain consent from the patient to proceed with OMT.

After obtaining informed consent, the physician should establish the pain scale, assess theÂ range of motion and strength of the affected muscle, and perform any appropriate neurologic testing. Also, an osteopathic structural exam of the lumbar spine, pelvis, and hip should be performed. Special considerations for the iliopsoas include the Thomas test to assess the flexibility of the iliopsoas muscle.
