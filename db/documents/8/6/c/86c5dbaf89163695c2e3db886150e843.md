Imaging with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scans can provide information about the disease's new baseline, the anatomic regions involved, and their metabolic activity. Biopsy should target the lymph node with the highest metabolic activity.

Bone marrow biopsy is reserved for individuals with unexplained cytopenias. Follicular lymphoma may evolve into a more aggressive and higher grade of lymphoma, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Hence biopsy is essential to diagnose this transformation at relapse.
