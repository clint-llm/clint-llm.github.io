The management of Sturge-Weber syndrome is best accomplished with an interprofessional team approach. The team may include a geneticist, pediatricians, pediatric ophthalmologists, pediatric radiologists, pediatric neurologists, nurse practitioners, and pediatric neurosurgeons. There is no cure for the syndrome and all treatments are symptom-based. In addition to preventing seizures, patients need ophthalmology follow-up due to the risk of developing glaucoma. The skin lesions can be managed by a dermatologist. Nurses play an important role in patient and parent education.
