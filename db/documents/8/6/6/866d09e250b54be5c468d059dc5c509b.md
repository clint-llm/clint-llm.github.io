- Early diagnosis is key in decreasing morbidity and mortality of patients with XLA

- Characterized by mutation of Btk, which prevents maturation of B-lymphocytes and subsequently the production of circulating immunoglobulin, resulting in severely impaired humoral immunity

- Look for a male infant or toddler (who no longer has protection from maternal IgG) with recurrent encapsulated organism infections requiring frequent hospitalizations and intravenous antibiotics

- Recurrent sinusitis, otitis, pneumonia, gastroenteritis

- Laboratory investigation reveals absent or very low levels of mature B-lymphocytes and circulating immunoglobulin

- The current mainstay of treatment is withÂ intravenous immunoglobulin

- Avoid live vaccines
