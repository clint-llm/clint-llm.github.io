Neuroretinitis (NR) is defined as inflammation of the anterior optic nerve and peripapillary retina.  It presents as a triad of vision loss, optic disc swelling, and macular exudates in the formation of a star. It is a term given to the appearance but does not indicate a specific etiology.

Theodor Leber first described neuroretinitis in 1916, and the name 'stellate maculopathy' was coined.  As this term denotes, the original site of pathology was thought to be in the macula.  However, a subsequent study showed that the fluid leakage at the optic disc precedes the macular star, affecting the macula secondarily.

The associated infectious and inflammatory etiologies now associated with neuroretinitis have been widely documented, and although the majority of cases self-resolve, it is important to understand where resolution may be minimal or where the disease may be recurrent and therefore require early treatment.

Neuroretinitis is broadly categorized as idiopathic, idiopathic-recurrent, and cat scratch-disease neuroretinitis (CSD-NR). Neuroretinitis may also be categorized based upon the etiology: infectious vs. non-infectious. Idiopathic and idiopathic-recurrent neuroretinitis are usually non-infectious. It is usually unilateral, but bilateral cases have been described, though they should lead the physician to consider other causes.
