The procedure of intestinal stomas formation is usually undertaken by general surgeons. Colon and rectal surgeons have extensive stoma formation experience and might consider precious procedures. Intestinal stoma in children is performed by pediatric surgeons. However, when the stoma becomes functional, its management is done by nursing staff or entero-stomal therapists.
