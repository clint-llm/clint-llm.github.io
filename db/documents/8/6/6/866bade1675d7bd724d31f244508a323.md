Microcytic, hypochromic anemia, as the name suggests, is the type of anemia in which the circulating RBCs are smaller than the usual size of RBCs (microcytic) and have decreased red color (hypochromic). The most common cause of this type of anemia is decreased iron reserves of the body which may be due to multiple reasons. This may be due to decreased iron in the diet, poor absorption of iron from the gut, acute and chronic blood loss, increased demand for iron in certain situations like pregnancy or recovering from major trauma or surgery. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Microcytic, hypochromic anemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the recommended management of microcytic, hypochromic anemia.
- Outline the typical presentation for a patient with microcytic, hypochromic anemia.
- Review the pathophysiology of microcytic, hypochromic anemia.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with microcytic, hypochromic anemia.
