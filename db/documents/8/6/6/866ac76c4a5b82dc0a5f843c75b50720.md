The family Scorpaenidae produce heat-labile, nondialyzable venoms that differ in potency but are very similar in composition. The toxins are composed of the following high molecular weight (50 to 800 kDa) proteins: hyaluronidase, pain-producing factor, capillary permeability factor, and species-specific toxic factors. The stonefish possesses the most potent venom, while the lionfish venom is the least potent. The venom of the fish remains potent for up to 48 hours after the death of the fish.
