Given that imposter syndrome does not have a formal DSM-V definition or another formal set of consensus criteria, the differential diagnoses, which are also likely to be comorbidities in those with IS, include both formal and informal 'diagnoses':

- Anxiety: generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, anxiety disorder due to another medical condition, unspecified anxiety disorder, phobia, OCD, PTSD

- Depression

- Other mood disorders

- Burnout

- Low self-esteem

- Personality disorders
