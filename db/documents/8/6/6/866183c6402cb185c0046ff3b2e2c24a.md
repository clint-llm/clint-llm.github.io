Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS) is a congenital disorder of craniofacial morphogenesis. It was first described by an ophthalmologist named Maurice Goldenhar as an association between ophthalmic, auricular, and facial features in 1952. After that, Gorlin et al. added vertebral anomalies to the list in 1963.

Typical phenotypes include microtia, facial asymmetry, and epibulbar dermoid or lipodermoid. Tasse et al. suggested minimum diagnostic criteria to be 'either isolated microtia or preauricular tags associated with hemifacial microsomia.'

The spectrum of OAVS can have varied clinical presentations ranging from mild or minimal facial asymmetry to severe form with marked facial defects and internal organs involvement.

The management of patients with OAVS is challenging due to a large variety of abnormalities and differences in the severity of presentation. It requires an interprofessinoal approach and a team of specialists to plan the treatment, which should be individualized according to the presentation of each patient. This review highlights the etiology, pathogenesis, varied clinical presentations, and management options of patients with OAVS, with particular emphasis on ocular features.
