Dental caries is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases, affecting nearly 60 to 90% of the world's population.

Fluorides play a central role in the prevention of dental caries and are also used therapeutically for the inactivation of incipient carious lesions.Â The effect of fluoride is mainly achieved when applied topically, which is further enhanced when accompanied by good oral hygiene.****

Since the implementation of water fluoridation, there has been a decrease in the prevalence of dental caries. The risk of dental fluorosis is mainly related to the systemic consumption of fluorides during the first six years of age.
