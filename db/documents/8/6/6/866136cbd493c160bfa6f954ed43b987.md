There are 3 phases of a cough: an inhalation phase which generates enough volume for an effective cough, a compression phase with pressure against a closed larynx by the contraction of the chest wall, diaphragm, and abdominal muscles, and an expiratory phase when the glottis opens resulting in high air flow. A cough could be a voluntary or involuntary act. A voluntary cough is manifested by cough inhibition or initiation. An involuntary cough is regulated by the vagal afferent nerves. By stimulating cough receptors that present in the airways and other areas in the upper body, impulses travel through the vagus nerve to the cough center in the medulla, which is controlled by the higher cortical centers. Afferent signals move down via the phrenic and spinal motor nerves to the expiratory muscles producing the cough. A chronic cough may also be brought about by abnormalities of the cough reflex and sensitization of its afferent and central components with exaggerated cough reflex sensitivity to stimuli that normally do not cause a cough (cough hypersensitivity syndrome).
