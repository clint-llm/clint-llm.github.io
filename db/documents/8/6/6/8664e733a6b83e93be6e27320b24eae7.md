Organophosphate pesticide exposure may occur through inhalation, ingestion, or dermal contact. Crops that farmworkers come into contact with that also may include organophosphates such as apples, celery, bell peppers, peaches, strawberries, nectarines, grapes, spinach, lettuce, cucumbers, domestic blueberries, and potatoes.

The severity of the symptoms depends on the amount ingested, route of absorption, and rate of metabolic breakdown of the insecticide.
