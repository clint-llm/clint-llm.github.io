Support and advocacy groups help patients and families find valuable services. To establish the best professional and social resources, it is imperative to seek help from experts and receive an early diagnosis. Rare diseases are challenging to diagnose and require genetic testing and a multidisciplinary approach. For families with limited health literacy or resources, this may be a challenging undertaking. Dermatologists and pediatricians are uniquely positioned to help patients find the right support network as they are often a patient's first point of contact.
