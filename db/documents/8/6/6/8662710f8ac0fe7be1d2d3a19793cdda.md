This type of dislocation is commonly referred to as luxatio erecta which means "erect dislocation" in Latin. This name derives from the typical way in which the arm is usually fully abducted and held above the head on presentation.

The majority are traumatic such as when the rider falls and tumbles off a motorbike. The humerus neck is pushed against the acromion and there is usually inferior capsule tears. Soft tissue injury or fractures are common with inferior shoulder dislocation. In addition, neurovascular injury, including axillary nerve damage are not uncommon with these dislocations.
