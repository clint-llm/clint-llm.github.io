There are four main functions of the skin: sensation, thermoregulation, protection, and metabolism

- **Sensation:**The skin contains many types of different receptors that sense pain, temperature, pressure, and touch.

- **Thermoregulation:**Hair and sweat glands aid in the regulation of body temperature to maintain homeostasis

- **Protection:**The skin serves as the barrier between the inside and outside of the body against infection, chemical stress, thermal stress, and UV light

- **Metabolism:**Adipose tissue in the hypodermis is vital in the production of Vitamin D and lipid storage.
