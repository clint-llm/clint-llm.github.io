Asphyxiation is difficult to identify and treat. Patients may not present with the "classic signs" of toxic gas exposure; therefore, proper triage may be difficult. Carbon monoxide and cyanide are colorless, odorless gases. Characteristic signs for carbon monoxide and cyanide toxicity such as "cherry red skin" and "bitter almond breath" respectively, are poorly sensitive and therefore unreliable for guiding therapy. Depending on the concentration levels and time of carbon monoxide and cyanide exposure, patients may present with a broad spectrum of signs and symptoms. Patients may complain of headaches, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lethargy, confusion, chest pain, shortness of breath, loss of consciousness, or even cardiac arrest. While initially well-appearing, patients exposed to toxic fumes in closed spaces are at a higher risk of rapidly decompensating.

Therefore, it is prudent for EMS responders to identify risk factors for carbon monoxide and cyanide exposure early on. Although smoke inhalation is an obvious risk factor, other subtle environmental findings must be considered. Patients are at increased asphyxiation risk in cold weather, indoor grill use, gas-powered electrical generator exposure, industrial accidents, natural catastrophes, suicide/murder attempts, and exposure to various combustible items such as wood floorboards, PVC pipes, furniture, paper, plastics, textiles, and other synthetic materials.

Further data shows that most fire victims killed by smoke inhalation alone had no direct flame exposure and were located in separate, nearby rooms. This makes it difficult for providers to anticipate who is vulnerable to inhalation injury. Although EMS providers are capable of measuring ambient carbon monoxide levels on the scene, these measurements have relatively low sensitivity. Furthermore, there is no device for detecting cyanide exposure in ambient air. Standard pulse oximetry monitors are unreliable in detecting carbon monoxide and cyanide in the blood. As a result, normal pulse-ox values may provide false reassurance regarding patient stability. Thus, providers must have a low threshold for initiating treatment for these toxic gases.

Lastly, EMS providers are not immune to asphyxiation. Irritant gases released in fires may cause mucosal injury to the eyes, ears, nose, and throat, making it difficult for providers to maintain care. Regardless of using proper personal protective equipment, providers are still vulnerable to developing neurocognitive sequelae from carbon monoxide and cyanide exposure. Providers should be assessed during a follow-up medical exam in less than 48 hours to evaluate for complications of asphyxiant gas exposure. Providers should be especially conservative in seeking a medical evaluation in the subsequent 4 to 6 weeks if they develop evolving complaints such as memory disturbances, depression, anxiety, problems with calculations, and vestibular and motor symptoms.
