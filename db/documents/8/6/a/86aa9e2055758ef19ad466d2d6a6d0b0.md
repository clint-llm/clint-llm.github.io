Ipratropium administration is via a metered-dose inhaler (MDI). The recommended dose is two puffs up to four times per day. Each puff of MDI provides 17 micrograms of ipratropium. Also available is a 0.02% nebulized solution of ipratropium. The dose of the nebulized solution can start as low as 50 to 125 micrograms (mcg).

Clinicians routinely administer glycopyrrolate with neostigmine for the reversal of non-depolarizing NMBA. The recommended reversal dose of glycopyrrolate is 0.2 mg of IV for every 1 mg of IV neostigmine. These medications are administered simultaneously since they both have a similar onset of action. To manage severe bronchospasm, 3.2 mcg/kg of glycopyrrolate and 6 to 10 mcg/kg of atropine can facilitate bronchodilation.

For organophosphate toxicity, the clinicians should administer 2 to 5 mg of IV atropine for adults and 0.05 mg/kg of IV atropine for children.

The administration of the various antimuscarinic agents will vary significantly based on the particular agent in question.
