A widely accepted contraindication to ankle arthrocentesis is the presence of overlying skin or soft tissue infection. Other contraindications are relative and commonly related to concurrent therapeutic injection of intraarticular corticosteroids. These include septic arthritis that is suspected or proven, multiple previous short-term corticosteroid injections, intraarticular fracture, juxta-articular osteopenia, instability of the joint, and inability to rest the joint following the procedure.
