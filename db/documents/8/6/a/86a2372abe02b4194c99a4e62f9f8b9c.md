Electromyographic studies have reported that the impulses for this synkinetic movement in Marcus Gunn jaw-winking syndrome originate from the proprioceptive receptors of the external pterygoid muscle.

There exists a lack of explanation in the literature regarding the rationale of the jaw-winking phenomenon. Various theories have been presumed to explain this synkinetic jaw winking movement. The most acceptable theory of MGP is the concept of aberrant connection.

- Cortical or the subcortical connections

- Internuclear connections or faulty distribution in the posterior longitudinal bundle

- Infranuclear misconnection between the trigeminal nerve (CN V3) and the oculomotor nerve (CN III).

- Peripherally - some trigeminal nerve fibers may reach the LPS muscle through the auriculotemporal nerve.
