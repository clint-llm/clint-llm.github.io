A complete history and exam must be performed to capture associated occult trauma and especially prior to closed reduction maneuvers and associated procedural sedation. Shoulder joint evaluation should be systematic in nature. The shoulder complex is composed of three joints, the sternoclavicular (SC), acromioclavicular (AC), and GH joint, and the surface anatomy of each joint should be inspected and palpated to confirm integrity. The humeral head of the GH joint can be seen and palpated in a pathologically anterior position. A thorough neurovascular examination must be performed and additionally documented before any reduction maneuvers. The axillary nerve is particularly predisposed to injury due to its anatomic course along the proximal aspect of the humeral neck and quadrilateral space before innervating the deltoid muscle. The function of the axillary nerve is confirmed by intact sensation at the proximal brachium ("sentinel patch") and firing of deltoid muscle abduction. Axillary artery integrity should be confirmed with signs of distal perfusion and intact pulses, and the absence of axillary swelling or expanding hematoma.
