Medical management of new-onset primary canaliculitis is said to be effective in patients who present early. Conservative medical management includes topical and systemic antibiotics, warm compresses, local massage, syringing, and irrigation.

The different surgical options include punctual dilatation or punctoplasty with curettage, canaliculotomy, canaliculoplasty with intubation, and punctum-sparing canaliculotomy with monocanalicular intubation.

Secondary canaliculitis is found to have a very poor response to medical management. Canaliculotomy with the removal of the plug is considered the treatment of choice for plug-related canaliculitis. Recurrent or complicated cases may require dacryocystorhinostomy, removal of any intracanalicular foreign bodies or debris, and stent placement.
