**Oral:**usually available in combination with carbidopa or benserazide.

Treatment should begin with small doses, and the recommended dose is 300 to 1200 mg (higher if tolerated) per day, divided into 3 to 12 doses.

**Oral Inhalation:**Inhaled formulation of levodopa was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2018 to treat Parkinson disease as adjunctive therapy to levodopa/carbidopa. Inhaled levodopa bypasses the intestinal absorption and hepatic metabolism of oral levodopa, and it is available in the form of dry powder.

**Infusion:**another form of administration is a 16-hour infusion through a nasojejunal tube. Research has shown that levodopa infusion is associated with low plasma trough levels seen with oral drug administration. Recent studies of such infusion have been shown to decrease the adverse effects of motor complications. Some studies have even shown that the pulsatile administration of levodopa can cause more motor complications than the continuous administration of the drug. Administration of levodopa in the pediatric population does not have much research, and as a result, it is not recommended to be administered to patients under the age of 18.
