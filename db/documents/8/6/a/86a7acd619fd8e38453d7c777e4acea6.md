Clinical presentations for all tumors of the pineal region are secondary to obstructive hydrocephalus and compression of the tectum. Thus, regardless of the pathology, the physical exam findings will similar for all the tumors.

- 
**Hydrocephalus:**

- 
              
- History: Headache, nausea, failure to thrive, macrocephaly, blurry vision, sleepiness, drowsiness, or coma.
              
              
- Exam:
              
              
- 
                  
- Cushing’s triad; hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respirations 
                  
                  
- Bilateral optic nerve swelling
                  
                  
- Bilateral sixth nerve palsy

- 
**Compression of tectum (Parinaud syndrome):**

- 
              
- History: Difficulty walking upstairs, diplopia
              
              
- Exam:
              
              
- 
                  
- Paralysis of upwards gaze and conjugate downward gaze
                  
                  
- 
                      
- Compression of the vertical gaze center at the rostral interstitial nucleus of medial longitudinal fasciculus
                      
                    

                  
                  
- Light-near dissociation
                  
                  
- 
                      
- Compression of the pretectal nucleus in the superior colliculus
                      
                    

                  
                  
- Convergence-retraction nystagmus and eye-lid retraction (Collier sign)
                  
                  
- 
                      
- Damage to the supranuclear fibers of the third nerve at the posterior midbrain.
