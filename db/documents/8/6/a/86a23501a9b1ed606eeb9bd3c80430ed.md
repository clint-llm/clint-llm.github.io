The ASA recommends standard monitoring for all anesthetics, including oxygenation, circulation, ventilation, and temperature. Trained anesthesia personnel must be continually present during all anesthetic cases requiring general anesthesia, monitored anesthesia care, or regional anesthesia.

**Cardiovascular Effects**

Etomidate has minimal effects on the cardiovascular system and is the major reason for choosing this drug as an induction agent. It causes a mild reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, which is responsible for a decline in arterial blood pressure. Myocardial contractility and cardiac output are usually unchanged. Etomidate does not release histamine. However, etomidate by itself, even in large doses, produces relatively light anesthesia for laryngoscopy, and marked increases in heart rate and blood pressure may be recorded when etomidate is solely used for induction.

**Respiratory Effects**

Ventilation is not significantly affected. Induction doses do not result in apnea unless opioids have also been administered. The most distinctive effect on the respiratory system is a slight rise in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2).

**Central Nervous System Effects**

Etomidate decreases cerebral metabolic rate, cerebral blood flow, and intracranial pressure. Because of minimal cardiovascular effects, cerebral perfusion pressure is well maintained. Etomidate increases the amplitude of somatosensory evoked potentials, making it beneficial for ECT. Postoperative nausea and vomiting are more common with etomidate than propofol or barbiturate induction but appear to have the same frequency as general anesthesia. Etomidate lacks analgesic properties.
