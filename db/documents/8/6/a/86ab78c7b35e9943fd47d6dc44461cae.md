A rectus sheath hematoma is often difficult to diagnose, and its management can be difficult. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, radiologist, and surgeon. Once diagnosed, the majority of patients are treated conservatively with supportive care. A few patients may require surgery or arterial embolization to stop active bleeding.

The outlook for most patients is excellent.
