Isolated tricuspid valve repair is uncommon in spite of the fact that tricuspid valve abnormalities can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Most of the tricuspid valve procedures are performed secondarily with other primary cardiac surgical procedures. The current most common indication is to perform tricuspid valve surgery in patients who have symptomatic severe primary tricuspid regurgitation.

- Symptomatic severe tricuspid stenosis

- Severe tricuspid stenosis without symptoms when the patient is undergoing left-sided valve surgery

- Symptomatic severe primary or secondary tricuspid regurgitation

- Severe primary or secondary tricuspid regurgitation (symptomatic or asymptomatic) when the patient is undergoing left-sided valve surgery

- Moderate to severe primary tricuspid regurgitation when the patient is undergoing left-sided valve surgery

- Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic primary tricuspid regurgitation with evidence of progressive right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction

- Mild or moderate progressive functional (secondary) tricuspid regurgitation with a dilated annulus (more than 40 mm or more than 21 mm/m2) when the patient is undergoing left-sided valve surgery

- Tricuspid valve endocarditis

- Carcinoid involvement of the tricuspid valve

- Congenital malformations e.g., Ebstein anomaly

- Traumatic or iatrogenic injuries to the valve when taking biopsies or from pacemaker leads
