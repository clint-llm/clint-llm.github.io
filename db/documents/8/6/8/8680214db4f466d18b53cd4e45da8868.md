Conization of the cervix or cold knife cone (CKC) is a surgical procedure used to diagnose and treat cervical dysplasia or very early cervical cancer. It involves the excision of a cone-shaped portion of the cervix to remove a cervical lesion, along with the entire transformation zone. There are many indications for this procedure. It can be used when there are conflicting pap smear and biopsy findings, when histological results are significantly less severe than cytology results, when there is evidence of severe dysplasia, and even when there is stage 1A1 squamous cell cervical cancer. Conization can be done with a scalpel, a laser, or via a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). This activity predominantly focuses on conization of the cervix with the cold knife cone procedure, reviews the indications and contraindications, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of the patient undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for conization of the cervix.
- Explain how conization of the cervix is performed.
- List the complications of conization of the cervix.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to optimize outcomes for patients with cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer.
