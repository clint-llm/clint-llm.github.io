Allergic rhinitis (AR)Â is an atopic disease characterized by symptoms of nasal congestion, clear rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal pruritis. It can affect one in every six individuals and has associations with significant morbidity, loss of productivity, and health-care costs. Historically, the belief was that AR was a condition of the nasal passages only. Still, the treatment of AR is now a systemic disease due to its close association with asthma and atopic dermatitis.
