Several clinical states may mimic limb swelling seen in upper extremity DVT. For instance, localized infection with cellulitis may result in venous congestion, which may appear similar to a DVT. Â Patients with cellulitis may have a nidus for infection (i.e., cut or insect bite) along with surrounding erythema and pain. Necrotizing fasciitis may have overlying bullae along with systemic signs of infection such as fever, leukocytosis, elevated sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein with hyponatremia. Necrotizing fasciitis requires prompt diagnosis and early surgical debridement to prevent mortality and limb loss. Superficial thrombophlebitis involves an inflamed superficial vein in the upper extremity. This often resolves with limb elevation, warm compresses, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Suppurative or septic superficial thrombophlebitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality requiring prompt and aggressive intervention that includes excision of the infected vein. This occurs more commonly in patients with significant burns or intravenous drug abuse. Lymphedema can present with limb swelling but most commonly in the upper extremity occurs after a procedure such as axillary lymph node dissection.
