The World Health Organization categorizes neonatal sepsis into early and late based on the age of onset. Early neonatal sepsis affects infants less than 72 hours of age ( some experts will advocate using 7 days as a limit for early-onset sepsis); whereas, we see late-onset infections in infants older than 72 hours to 28 days of age. Early recognition and treatment are necessary to decrease the significant morbidity and mortality in this age group.
