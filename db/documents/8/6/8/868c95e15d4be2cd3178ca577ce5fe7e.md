There are no pathognomonic history cues for the diagnosis of viral pneumonia as opposed to bacterial pneumonia. However, cues are suggestive in the differential diagnosis of viral pneumonia:

- Gradual onset as opposed to the sudden onset of symptoms.

- Lower temperature

- Lack of purulent sputum

- History of immunosuppression

- Prodromal viral upper respiratory tract illness

- History of HIV

- History of solid organ transplantation or hematopoietic transplantation

- History of neoplasm

- Concomitant flu symptoms

- Concomitant gastrointestinal symptoms

There are no pathognomonic physical examination findings for the diagnosis of viral pneumonia as opposed to bacterial pneumonia. However, physical findings are suggestive in the differential diagnosis of viral pneumonia:

- Tachycardia or tachypnea out of proportion to the temperature

- Temperature elevation disproportionately low to the level of debility

- Concomitant upper respiratory tract infection

- Rash

- The paucity of physical findings on pulmonary exam disproportionate to the level of debility

- Bilateral positive lung findings
