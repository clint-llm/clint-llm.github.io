Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been the mainstay for the treatment of coronary artery disease for several decades. Various vessels have been studied as conduits for CABG to optimize surgical outcomes. This activity details the use of the gastroepiploic artery as a conduit for coronary artery bypass grafting and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients undergoing this procedure, both before and after the surgery.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the technique involved in using the gastroepiploic artery as a conduit for coronary artery bypass grafting.
- List the contraindications to the use of the gastroepiploic artery for coronary artery bypass grafting.
- Describe the potential complications of using the gastroepiploic artery as a conduit for coronary artery bypass grafting.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft using the gastroepiploic artery.
