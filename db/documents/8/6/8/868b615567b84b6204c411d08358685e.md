There are numerous possible etiologies of hypoparathyroidism.

- Postoperative complications of thyroidectomy and other types of head and neck surgery - may be transient or permanent

- Abnormal development of parathyroid tissue, for example, DiGeorge syndrome

- Autoimmune destruction of parathyroid tissue, for example, polyglandular autoimmune syndrome, Type 1

- Activating mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor - autosomal dominant hypocalcemia

- Activating antibodies of the calcium-sensing receptor

- Hypomagnesemia

- Infiltration of parathyroid tissue, for example, granulomatous disease, hemochromatosis, metastatic disease

- Radiation injury

- Parathyroid hormone resistance, pseudohypoparathyroidism; some patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism (Type 1a) have an unusual phenotype known as Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy, characterized by short stature, round face, and shortened fourth metacarpal bones. The etiology is an inactivating mutation of the G-alpha subunit of the parathyroid hormone receptor. Due to the resistance to parathyroid hormone, patients have hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia but increased serum levels of parathyroid hormone.
