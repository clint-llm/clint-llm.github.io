The differential diagnosis of acute kidney injury, as evidenced by worsening creatinine, is fairly complex. The urine sediment is often used to distinguish intrinsic renal causes of acute kidney injury from hemodynamic or obstructive causes. Patients with proteinuria and WBCs in their urine should be evaluated for AIN while alsoÂ considering glomerular etiologies, such as glomerulonephritis, in the differential diagnosis. In addition to a thorough history and physical exam and routine laboratory evaluations, laboratory evaluation may be expanded to include an antinuclear antibody test, antistreptolysin O titer, Anti-DNase antibody, C3 complement, C4 complement, hepatitis B Surface Ag, hepatitis C antibodies, and other serologies evaluating underlying glomerular disease.
