- Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a common form of autonomic dysregulation predominantly affecting young White females characterized by excessive tachycardia upon standing in the presence of orthostatic intolerance.

- Adult diagnostic criteria require a heart rate increaseÂ of greater than or equal to 30 bpm within the first 10 minutes of standing or head-up tilt (HUT) in the absence of orthostatic hypotension.

- The complex heterogeneous etiologies of POTS generally classify as neuropathic, hyperadrenergic, hypovolemic, autoimmune, and physical deconditioning with significant overlap between the various etiologies.

- Symptoms are often chronic and non-specific and may include chronic fatigue, dizziness, sleep disturbance, headache, tremors, tachycardia, anxiety, depression, gastrointestinal disturbances, syncope, and vision changes.

- Management and treatment require an emphasis on patient education, and a progressive monitored exercise regimen with second-line pharmacologic approaches aimed at increasing fluid volume and controlling excessive sympathetic drive (fludrocortisone, midodrine, clonidine, propranolol).

- Prognosis is favorable especially with younger age at onset, with more than half of patients no longer meeting POTS criteria within 5 years.
