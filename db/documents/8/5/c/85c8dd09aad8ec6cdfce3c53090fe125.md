Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition precipitated by the use of serotonergic drugs. It may be a consequence of therapeutic medication use, interactions between medications or recreational drugs, or intentional overdose. Symptoms can range from mild to fatal and classically include altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction, and neuromuscular excitation. Several criteria exist for making this clinical diagnosis, but the Hunter criteria are generally accepted as the most accurate. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of serotonin syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical presentation of serotonin syndrome.
- Summarize the Hunter criteria and how they are used to diagnose serotonin syndrome. 
- Outline the treatment and management options available for serotonin syndrome.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving coordination and communication to advance the prevention and management of serotonin syndrome and improve patient outcomes.
