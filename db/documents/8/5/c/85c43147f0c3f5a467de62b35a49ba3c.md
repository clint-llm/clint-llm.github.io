Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a commonly encountered problem in the neonatal period. It is estimated that about 60% of term and 80% of preterm newborns will present with clinical jaundice with TSB >5 mg/dl.

Only a minority of infants with neonatal jaundice have a pathological cause of jaundice. The incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia, defined as TSB>25 mg/dl, is about 1 in 2500 live birth. Among these, ABO incompatibility followed by G6PD deficiency is the most frequently identified cause identified.

The incidence of acute bilirubin encephalopathy is seen at a rate of approximately 1 in 10,000 live births, whereas the incidence of chronic bilirubin encephalopathy is lower, with an estimated incidence of 1 in  50,000 to 100,000 live births.

Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is much less common compared to UCH, with a frequency of around 1 in  2500 term infants.
