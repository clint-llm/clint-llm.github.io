Measuring elevated intraocular pressure is diagnostic. There is no need for any imaging studies. A basic metabolic panel should be checked if osmotic agents are used in the treatment regime. A gonioscopic examination by an ophthalmologist to verify angle-closure makes the definitive diagnosis. Gonioscopy of the unaffected eye will reveal a narrow occludable angle given the anatomic predisposing factors to acute angle-closure glaucoma (See other issues for further discussion). Glaucomflecken (grey-white opacities on the anterior lens capsule) may be visible if previous attacks of angle-closure glaucoma have occurred.
