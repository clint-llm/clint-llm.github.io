Nurses are responsible for the placement of peripheral intravenous lines, setup of PCA pumps, insertion of medication into the pumps, and monitoring of the patientâ€™s pain, sedation, and respiration. They ensure that the pump is functioning correctly, and the medications are achieving their intended purpose while avoiding complications and reducing side effects.

While PCA can reduce the need to round and respond to patient calls to administer analgesics, it does not diminish their workload; this is because of the time and effort needed to educate the patient, set up the machine, and monitor its effectiveness and side effects. However, it has been shown to be a preferred method because nurses and patients have more control over their work and pain, respectively.
