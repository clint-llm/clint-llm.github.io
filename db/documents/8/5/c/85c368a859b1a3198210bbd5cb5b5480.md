Adequate pain medication is necessary, as patients often report mild peri-incisional pain for about 3 to 5 days postoperatively. To promote wound healing and ease of suture removal, the patient should receive instruction apply antibiotic ointment to the wounds for three days, and then transition to petroleum jelly for the next several days after that. To minimize edema and ecchymosis, the patient may sleep with the head elevated for 1 week, and avoid rigorous activity for 2 weeks. The patient may be given a low-dose corticosteroid taper and/or instructions for optimizing nutrition status to help lessen bruising and swelling.
