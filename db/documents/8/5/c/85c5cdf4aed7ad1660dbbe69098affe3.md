The development of TKI represents one of the most significant medical breakthroughs of the 21st century; however, one of the drawbacks of this drug class, endemic to small molecule therapies for cancer treatment in general, is the financial burden to the patient.

Given the non-specific nature of this drug class, it is imperative that therapy is ordered and subsequently followed through the collaborative efforts of an interprofessional team. This interprofessional team includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), specialists, nursing staff, and pharmacists. Each team member needs to be knowledgeable about the indications, dosing, and potential adverse effects of these drugs so they can counsel the patient regarding expectations and monitoring for adverse events, which will allow any needed changes in therapy to be made promptly, thereby driving optimal patient therapeutic outcomes.
