Although the DNA helical diameter is only 2 nm, the entire DNA strand in a single cell will stretch roughly 2 meters when completely unwound.

The nucleosome structure was first described in 1974 by RogerÂ Kornberg who, with evidence from biochemical experiments, X-ray diffraction studies, and electron microscopy images, proposed the nucleosome was comprised of repeating units of eight histone proteins and about 200 DNA base pairs.

The tight structure of chromatin brings about the problem of accessibility to the DNA by enzymes involved in DNA replication and transcription. Chromatin exists in one of two states: heterochromatin, which is condensed and allows little access by transcription enzymes, and euchromatin, which is loose to allow for interaction with transcription enzymes. The transition between these two states is determined by interactions between the DNA and histone proteins via post-translational modifications to the histone proteins like methylation and acetylation.

The ability for DNA packaging to be modified at various stages of the cell cycle is important in both DNA replication and cell division as well as transcription. Replication occurs at many origins of replication throughout the DNA strand to accelerate the replication of the entire genome, with each origin separated by approximately 100,000 base pairs.
