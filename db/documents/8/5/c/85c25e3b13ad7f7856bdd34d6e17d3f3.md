An interprofessional team approach is indicated for best outcomes in patients with inflammatory arthritis. In patients with septic arthritis, multi-specialty evaluation with internal medicine, orthopedics, rheumatology, and infectiousÂ diseases may be needed. For patients with other autoimmune inflammatory arthropathies, close communication between the rheumatologist and primary care provider is of utmost importance. Further, pharmacists can assist in patient education about medications, and the nursing team can assist in ensuring patient compliance. Physical therapy and occupational therapy frequently play a key role in helping the patients maintain the full range of the function of the joints and encouraging them to exercise and lose weight.
