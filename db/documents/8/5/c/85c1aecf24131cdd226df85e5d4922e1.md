Newborn screening is a state-run healthcare initiative that encompasses the process of parental education, infant screening, appropriate follow-up, diagnostic testing, disease management, and continued evaluation.

The disorders targeted by newborn screening are generally those that, without intervention, would cause significant morbidity, mortality, or intellectual disability.

**Program Structure**

Newborn screening in the United States is organized on a state-by-state basis with guidance from the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP).

**Brief History**

Newborn screening was first envisioned in the 1960s with the disease phenylketonuria, which achieved nearly universal screening in the United States by the 1970s.

**Blood Sample**

The largest component of newborn screening involves obtaining a blood sample to screen for metabolic, hematologic, endocrine, and other inheritable disorders. A sample of the infant’s blood is obtained ideally within 24-48 hours of birth, though premature or ill infants may require alterations to this screening timeline.

**Hearing Screen**

An infant’s hearing may be screened by two different non-invasive methods; otoacoustic emissions (OAE) or auditory brainstem response (ABR).

**Pulse Oximetry**

An infant is screened for critical congenital heart defects with peripheral pulse oximetry, which uses light to calculate the percentage of hemoglobin that is bound to oxygen.

Below is a list of the critical congenital heart defects that are the target of pulse oximetry screening.

- Pulmonary atresia

- Tricuspid atresia

- Truncus arteriosus

- Total anomalous pulmonary venous return

- Hypoplastic left heart syndrome

- D-Transposition of the great vessels

- Double outlet right ventricle

- Ebstein anomaly

- Interrupted aortic arch

- Single ventricle complex

- Coarctation of the aorta

- Tetralogy of Fallot
