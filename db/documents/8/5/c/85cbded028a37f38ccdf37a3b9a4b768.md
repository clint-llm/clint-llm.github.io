The etiology and pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis are not fully understood, but it involves a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors resulting in immune-mediated inflammation involving the skin and joints, and other organs. Approximately 33 to 50% of psoriatic arthritis patients have at least one first-degree relative who also has psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis.

Genetic associations in psoriatic arthritis include HLA-B*08:01, HLA-B*27:05, HLA-B*38:01, HLA-B*39:01, HLA-B*44:02HLA-B*57:01, and HLA-C*06:02.HLA-B38 and HLA-B39 genes are associated with polyarthritis.HLA-DR4 (this gene is associated with RA).

Non-HLA genes associated with psoriatic arthritis include IL-23R.TNFAIP3, TNF3IP2, REL, FBX19, and PTPN22.

Psoriasis has a stronger association than psoriatic arthritis with HLA-B*57:01 and HLA-C*06:02 (referred to as the psoriasis susceptibility region 1 or PSORS1). IL-12B gene is associated with psoriasis but not psoriatic arthritis.

Axial disease on PsA is more complicated. HLA-B27 gene is present in only 20% of patients with axial PsA (AxPsA) compared to 80 to 90% in patients with axial SpA (AxSpA), including AS (higher in White race.)

The role of environmental factors is suspected but has been difficult to confirm. Epidemiological studies have shown an association between streptococcal infection and recent antibiotic exposure.
