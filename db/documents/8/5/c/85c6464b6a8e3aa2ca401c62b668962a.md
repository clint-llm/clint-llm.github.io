Human albumin acts as the most significant modulator of plasma oncotic pressure and functions to transport a variety of substances called ligands.

Those ligands transported by serum albumin include endogenous ligands such as bilirubin, ions, fatty acids, and exogenous ligands such as drugs. The list of drugs transported by albumin includes methadone, propranolol, thiopental, furosemide, warfarin, methotrexate, alfentanil, and many others. Severe liver disease can result in hypoalbuminemia, which leads to fewer available binding sites for exogenous drugs. This results in larger amounts of unbound exogenous drugs, which can lead to increased drug sensitivity. This sensitivity manifests when patients have serum albumin concentrations lower than 2.5 g/dL.

Once albumin enters the circulation, about 30% to 40% stays in the bloodstream, and the remainder enters the interstitial space. The majority of protein that leaves the circulation then returns to circulation via the lymphatic system. The circulatory half-life of albumin is 16 hours. The majority of albumin’s osmotic effect is attributed to its large molecular weight, while the rest is thought to stem from its negative charge. The latter allows albumin to attract positively charged molecules and, ultimately, water into the intravascular compartment. By influencing oncotic pressure, albumin has a major influence on capillary membrane pressure, which is represented by the equation:

- CP = (HP - HP) - r(OP - OP)

Where CP is capillary membrane pressure, HP is capillary hydrostatic pressure, HP is interstitial hydrostatic pressure, r is the reflection coefficient, OP is the capillary oncotic pressure, and OP is the interstitial oncotic pressure.
