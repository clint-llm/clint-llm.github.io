Excess caloric consumption and the associated increase in adipose tissue have become one of the most profound risk factors for developing chronic diseases in our generation. Caloric excess has long been considered the primary mechanism for developing obesity; however, current understanding has laid the framework for a likely multi-factorial set of etiologies. The development of obesity likely has several contributory factors, including dietary considerations, behaviors, metabolic/physical activity, and genetics. These mutually inclusive factors produce the ideal metabolic environment for developing obesity. This activity highlights clinical concerns associated with excess caloric consumption.

**Objectives:**
- Review the physiological processes, including at the molecular level, associated with obesity.
- Identify the risk factors and etiologies in the development of obesity.
- Outline the socio-economic and lifestyle factors and their relation to obesity incidence/prevalence.
- Summarize the epidemiology of obesity.
