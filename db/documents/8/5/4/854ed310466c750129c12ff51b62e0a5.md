A hemiplegic migraine is a very rare migraine headache accompanied by unilateral weakness. It can be very upsetting to the patient and their family. Typically an interprofessional approach involving the family clinician (MD, DO, NP, or PA), a pharmacist, and a clinical headache specialist working with a nurse experienced in headache education to educate the patient and family will result in the best outcome. All team members must document their observations, interactions, and interventions in the patient's medical record and, when necessary, be able to communicate with other team members about the case.
