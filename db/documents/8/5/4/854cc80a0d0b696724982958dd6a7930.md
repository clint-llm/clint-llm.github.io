Children with hearing loss should undergo a complete clinical history, including perinatal details to help identify any environmental influences such as intrauterine infections, trauma, medications, and other medical conditions during pregnancy. A thorough family history should be obtained to assess for any genetic history of hearing loss. The results of newborn hearing screening testing should be ascertained.

A physical exam for childhood hearing loss should include a complete head-to-toe exam to assess for any syndromic features. Key organ systems commonly associated with hearing loss include ophthalmologic, endocrine, renal, and cardiac systems.
