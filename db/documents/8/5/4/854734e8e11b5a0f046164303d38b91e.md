Ventricular tachycardia is a potentially life-threatening condition. Although palpitation is the most common presentation of ventricular tachycardia, patients may present with syncope, cardiac arrest, and even sudden cardiac death. All patients with broad complex tachycardia should undergo detailed evaluation, including three-generation family history, transthoracic echocardiogram, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (if required). Patients with a family history of sudden cardiac death at a young age are recommended to consult a cardiologist to evaluate cardiac channelopathies and other inherited cardiac conditions. Asymptomatic relatives of patients with inherited channelopathies and other inherited causes of ventricular tachycardia should consult a cardiac electrophysiologic and/or a geneticist for screening and genetic counseling.
