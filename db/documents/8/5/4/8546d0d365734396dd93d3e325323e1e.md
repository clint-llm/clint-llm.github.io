Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)Â is a hereditary disorder of the kidneys characterized by markedly enlarged kidneys with extensive cyst formation throughout.

Screening family members for ADPKD has been controversial in the past. Prior to 2017, due to the lack of therapy to prevent progression to ESRD, screening of asymptomatic family members has not been routinely performed. With the addition of tolvaptan as a treatment option, early screening of young adults at risk for the disease would provide the opportunity for early treatment.
