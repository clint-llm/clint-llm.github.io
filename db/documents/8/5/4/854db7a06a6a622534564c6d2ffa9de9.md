Patients with pre-existing co-morbidities (elderly, polypharmacy, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, renal artery stenosis, single kidney, etc.) should be educated by their primary care provider or nephrologist on the impacts of dehydration, nausea, and vomiting. When starting new medications, physicians should counsel patients on the risks of AKI, and should have a plan to follow up the patient, and recheck renal functionÂ as needed. Similarly, patients who have already have an AKI should be counseled on avoiding nephrotoxins and increased hydration as tolerated.
