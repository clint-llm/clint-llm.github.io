Some patients may experience pain and swelling after endodontic treatment. This is commonly known as a flare-up.

A principal cause of microbial flare-ups is the apical extrusion of pulpal debris.

Mechanical flare-ups occur due to over-instrumentation and extrusion of filling materials during obturation.

Odontogenic infections are the leading cause of abscesses of the deep fascial planes in the head and neck.
