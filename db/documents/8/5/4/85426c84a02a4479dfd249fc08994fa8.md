The Triple Arthrodesis is a versatile procedure useful in many pedal conditions. The term "triple" arthrodesis refers to a fusion procedure of three joints of the hindfoot and midfoot, the subtalar joint (talus and calcaneus), the talonavicular joint, and the calcaneocuboid joint. Due to the procedure's predictability, it is often used as a definitive treatment for many pedal deformities and offers patients the ability for pain-free, propulsive gait. It is not without its disadvantages; however, the loss of range of motion afterward may make other procedures a more prudent choice. In this activity, we will discuss the indications, anatomy, and the procedure itself.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of the triple arthrodesis.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to the triple arthrodesis.
- Review the potential complications and clinical significance of the triple arthrodesis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the triple arthrodesis and improve outcomes.
