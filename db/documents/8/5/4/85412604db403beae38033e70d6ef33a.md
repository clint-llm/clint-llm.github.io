Bacterial tracheitis is a life-threatening but very treatable disease process If evaluated and treated early enough in its course. In one review of 36 patients from 2018 in a tertiary care center, 69% of pediatric patients diagnosed with bacterial tracheitis were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), 43% required intubation, and one patient died from airway obstruction.
