Amylase is a digestive enzyme predominantly secreted by the pancreas and salivary glands and found in other tissues at very small levels.diastaste but was later renamed amylase in the early 20th century.

Amylases' main function is to hydrolyze the glycosidic bonds in starch molecules, converting complex carbohydrates to simple sugars. There are three main classes of amylase enzymes; Alpha-, beta-, and gamma-amylase, and each act on different parts of the carbohydrate molecule.

In 1908, a study by Wohlgemuth identified the presence of amylase in urine, and this subsequently led to the use of amylase as a diagnostic laboratory test. Amylase is a commonly ordered test along with lipase, especially in suspected acute pancreatitis.
