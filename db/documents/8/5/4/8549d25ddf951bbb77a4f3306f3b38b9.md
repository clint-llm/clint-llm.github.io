The number of elderly patients will increase by 21% in the next 50 years. The prevalence of cognitive decline, especially dementia, increases exponentially with age. In adults greater than 60 years of age, the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment is roughly between 7 to 25%. MCI is 3 to 4 times more prevalent than dementia.

Cognitive decline is seen greater in aging women than men partly due to the difference in life expectancy between the sexes. The incidence of dementia exponentially rises to the age of 85 and continues to increase thereafter.
