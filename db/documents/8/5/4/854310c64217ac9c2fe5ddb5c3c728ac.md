This activity reviews the anesthetic implications associated with patients undergoing eye surgeries. This article will highlight major anesthetic topics related to common eye procedures and will include a brief discussion regarding the various anesthetic approaches and intraoperative management of common eye surgeries. Understanding the basic principles of intravenous and volatile anesthetics concerning intraocular pressure and preparing for potential complications is essential to providing excellent patient care. This activity is intended to guide the multidisciplinary and interprofessional operative team consisting of nurses, surgical technicians, and specialty physicians in working together to provide a safe and uneventful perioperative experience.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomy of the orbit and describe changes in intraocular pressure that result from intravenous and volatile agents.
- Explain the oculocardiac reflex and review the hemodynamic changes that can result.
- Describe complications that may result from regional anesthesia for eye blocks.
- Outline the anesthetic techniques used by the interprofessional team and indications for providing regional anesthesia for patients undergoing eye surgery.
