Not many clinical entities produce both a facial rash and paralysis, but other common causes of localized facial rashes include herpes simplex virus outbreaks, Staphylococcal impetigo, and contact dermatitis that may arise from topical agents like neomycin or exposure to an irritant such as poison ivy. Acute facial paralysis is most commonly caused by Bell's palsy, which presents similarly to zoster sine herpete, but other non-traumatic etiologies include Lyme disease, benign skull base tumors, extratemporal malignancies, autoimmune conditions, otologic disease, other viral infections, neurosyphilis, and stroke.
