Hypoglycemia is the most common metabolic disturbance occurring in the neonatal period. Screening at-risk infants and the management of low blood glucose levels in the first hours to days of life is a frequent issue in the care of the newborn infant. Yet, a clear definition of neonatal hypoglycemia is lacking.

Despite a better understanding of early glucose homeostasis and transitional hypoglycemia in the first 48 hours of life, gaps in our knowledge persist. Observations have shown that healthy infants experience transient hypoglycemia as a part of the normal adaption to extrauterine life, with a decline in blood glucose concentrations to values as low as 20 to 25 mg/dL in the first two hours of life.

A 1988 multicenter nutritional study by Lucas et al. suggested a blood glucose concentration <47 mg/dL as the critical threshold associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.

It is clear that extremely low blood glucose concentrations in neonates can cause apnea, irritability, lethargy, seizures,
