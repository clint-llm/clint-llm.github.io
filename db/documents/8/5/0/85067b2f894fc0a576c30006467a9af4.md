Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare but potentially fatal complication of connective tissue disorders, particularly systemic sclerosis. Therefore, all patients diagnosed with SSc should undergo initial screening for PAH at the time of diagnosis for SSc, with annual screenings thereafter. Right heart catheterization is required to confirm a diagnosis of PAH. Patients diagnosed with PAH are then stratified by risk to derive appropriate treatment selection. While there is no pharmacological cure for PAH, treatment aims to slow or prevent disease progression, reduce morbidity and mortality (including all nine clinical parameters associated with PAH), and improve quality of life.

Current PAH therapies include prostacyclin derivatives, a prostacyclin receptor agonist, endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, and a soluble cGMP stimulator. Clinicians must have a sufficient understanding of the benefits and risks of each class and agent, as some require REMS strategies. In addition, patients with higher functional class ratings may benefit from initial combination therapies. Ultimately, early screening can lead to early diagnosis and prompt management, improving long-term prognosis.
