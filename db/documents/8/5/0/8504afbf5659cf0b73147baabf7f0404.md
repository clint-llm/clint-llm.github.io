The safety of flight begins on the ground in the preparation and planning stages of the mission. Just as the aircraft gets inspected during preflight for wear and tear and anticipated maintenance is conducted before the mission, the aircrew conducts a mandatory risk assessment of themselves individually and as a crew, to ensure the risk of the human factor does not outweigh the necessity of the mission. Human error is the number one factor in the majority of aviation accidents and becomes worse with illness, inappropriate medication use, stress, alcohol, fatigue, immediate physiological or emotional need. Providers should be aware of the IMSAFE (**I**llness,**M**edication,**S**tress,**A**lcohol,**F**atigue,**E**motion/**E**nergy) preflight check of the crew.  As a medical provider, it is essential to be aware of the known risks contributing to the human factor in-flight safety decisions to “Go or No-Go” and how to counsel aircrew on ways to mitigate the risks through the therapeutic alliance, behavioral guidance, and pharmacologic means if necessary.
