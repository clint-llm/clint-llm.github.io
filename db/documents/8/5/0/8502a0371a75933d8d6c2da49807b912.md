Patients undergoing stoma formation require an inter-professional team approach. General surgeons and other specialized surgeons such as colon and rectal surgeons and pediatric surgeons are responsible for performing the operation. However, in the postoperative period management of intestinal stoma is done by nursing staff or entero-stomal therapists. Preoperative stoma education, which is provided by nurse specialists, enables shorter hospital stays for ostomates after the surgery.
