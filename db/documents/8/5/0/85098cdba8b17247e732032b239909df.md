- Atrial fibrillation: mostly irregular, no evidence of organized atrial activity in the electrocardiogram, absence of P waves

- Multifocal atrial tachycardia: multiple P waves morphology due to the presence of several atrial pacers

- Atrial tachycardia with variable conduction: the isoelectricÂ line between QRS complexes
