Because the drug has no indications for any medical use, there is no established monitoring for the use of LSD. A study showed improvement of 52 patients with independent diagnoses when using it to treat mental disorders, but 48 patients worsened acutely with LSD.  However, in most patients, the long-term outcome was poor in those who received treatments with LSD.
