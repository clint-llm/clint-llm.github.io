Ventilator management is a multidisciplinary effort. When you put a patient onÂ adaptive support ventilation (ASV) mode on a ventilator, it requires the clinical staff to be trained and familiar with this mode of ventilation. At the same time, this is an extremely safe mode of ventilation and weaning. A point to consider is, there is no backup mode while you wean a patient on this mode. There is a risk of hypoventilation and hypercapnia if you have set the patient on the lower percent of minute ventilation support. Familiarity and training regarding this mode of the ventilator are essential among the staff when they are managing the patient on the adaptive mode of the ventilator.
