Adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth has been reported to have a 15% to 20% incidence among all NSCLC. Pure AIS and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) are rare and have a 3% to 6% prevalence among all lung cancers.

Younger age, women, and nonsmokers were reported as more predominant in the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma subgroup than adenocarcinoma in general. Women represented more than 50%, while nonsmokers comprised one-third of the overall prevalence of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma.
