HAPE's clinical diagnosis would include at least two of the following symptoms or complaints: chest tightness or pain, cough, dyspnea at rest, and decreased exercise tolerance. It also would have two of the following exam findings: central cyanosis, rales/wheezes, tachycardia, and tachypnea.Â  If available, CXR may show patchy alveolar infiltrates with normal-sized mediastinum/heart, and ultrasound may show B-lines consistent with pulmonary edema. ECG may show signs of right axis deviation and/or ischemia. In a patient with infiltrates on CXR, rapid correction of clinical status and SpO2 with supplemental oxygen is pathognomonic of HAPE. Even if available, labs are of limited utility, and the clinician should always consider concomitant AMS and/or HACE.
