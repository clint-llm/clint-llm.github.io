The sorbitol or polyol pathway is a two-step metabolic pathway that converts glucose into fructose. This pathway is thought to play a prominent role in explaining the pathogenesis of complications in patients with end-stage diabetes. In light of this, this activity presents the biochemistry behind this pathway, summarizes the individual reactions and their importance, reviews the prevailing hypothesis explaining why this pathway plays a role in end-stage diabetes, and explores the clinical significance of the polyol pathway with potential for treatment in diabetic patients.
