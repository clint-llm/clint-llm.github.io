The pediatric mortality rate following cardiac arrest and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) remains greater than 90%.

These factors include determining the etiology of the arrest and managing it appropriately, minimizing neurologic injury, and preventing further clinical decompensation.

The treatment recommendations regarding post-resuscitation management for providers are ever-evolving due to certain barriers in the pediatric population limiting research. The outcome of pediatric CPR is often poor, and can, theoretically, leave care after CPR unnecessary. Additionally, reliable reporting mechanisms and national information archives have historically been inconsistent, if available at all, limiting any meaningful data collection. The recent development of the National Register of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, sponsored by the American Heart Association, has facilitated more data collection on this subject, and updates in treatment recommendations.

The foundation of the 2015 published guidelines by the American Heart Association (AHA) on pediatric post-ROSC management is the prevalence of “post–cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS)”.
