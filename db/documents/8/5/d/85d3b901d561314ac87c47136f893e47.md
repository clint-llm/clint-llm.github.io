- FMF is a hereditary (autosomal recessive pattern) autoinflammatory disorder that usually occurs in people of Mediterranean origin (Arabs, Armenians, Jews, and Turks).

- It is the most common of the periodic fever syndromes.

- Most patients manifest their first attack before they are 18 years old.

- The earlier the onset, the more severe the phenotype is.

- It is characterized by the presence of fever and serosal inflammation attacks, which develop over 2 to 4 hours, last 1 to 4 days, and resolve spontaneously.

- The length of time between attacks is variable and can range from days to years.

- The diagnosis is generally clinical (Tel-Hashomer criteria set).

- FMF should be differentiated from other familial periodic fever syndromes since the conditions are treated differently.

- Antenatal diagnosis is possible, but not recommended.

- Effective treatment is not available, although colchicine improves patients' quality of life.

- Colchicine (orally or intravenously) reduces or eliminates attacks and prevents type AA amyloidosis.

- Colchicine should not be taken together with macrolides, diltiazem, grapefruit, and cyclosporine.

- Patients who are on colchicine therapy with a good response have a very low likelihood of developing amyloidosis.

- The prognosis is less favorable without treatment or with renal amyloidosis.
