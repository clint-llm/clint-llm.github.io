CLinicians make a diagnosis when there are 2 or more cardinal manifestations confirmed by histology, biochemical testing, or imaging. If the patient has a demonstrated germline PRKAR1A mutation and/or a first-degree relative affected by Carney complex, a single manifestation is sufficient for the diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is demonstrated, the patient will require life-long surveillance. Clinical work-up for all the manifestations of Carney complex should be done at a minimum of once a year in all patients. These work-ups should start in infancy for some manifestations.

- Adrenal: Urinary cortisol is usually increased in but can be variable in most patients. Dexamethasone suppression test fails to suppress cortisol secretion even after high doses. Most patients respond to dexamethasone with a contradictory rise of cortisol production. Dexamethasone suppression test may be used diagnostically for the identification of PPNAD, even in patients that have normal baseline cortisol levels and do not have clinical stigmata of Cushing syndrome. Plasma ACTH levels are usually low, and adrenals appear normal on CT-scan in 1 out of 3 of the patients whereas the other patients present with micro-nodules (usually less than 6 mm) or more rarely macro-nodules larger than 10 mm. Path reports usually show that the adrenal glands are being normal in size and weight and are peppered with black or brown nodules set in a cortex which is often atrophic.

- Pituitary: Biochemical abnormalities of the GH axis as alterations in the rhythm of GH secretion may be higher if carefully screened, up to 80% of the patients. These biochemical abnormalities develop before radiological evidence of a frank pituitary tumor and might be secondary to hyperplasia of GH cells, characterized by the pathological examination by poorly delineated regions with increased cellularity. Most remaining patients have abnormal responses to oral glucose tolerant test but normal IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) and normal pituitary imaging. Follow-up on these patients can with magnetic resonance imaging and oral glucose tolerance test. If a tumor develops, it is treated surgically, whereas if IGF-1 levels increase without a visible tumor, somatostatin analogs or GH receptor antagonist treatment can be discussed.

- Thyroid: Usually around 75% of patients are found to have a cystic or multinodular disease. In post-pubertal pediatric and adult patients, an annual clinical examination is recommended with a thyroid ultrasound. Fine needle investigation of the thyroid nodule helps with the diagnosis.

- Gonadal: Sonographic evaluation of testis and ovaries shows micro-calcifications and hypo-echogenic lesions.

- Cardiac myxoma: Early diagnosis of these tumors is important and should start within the first 6-months of life. Annual screening with cardiac ultrasound should follow. Patients with cardiac myxoma should be screened every 6 months. In difficult cases, transesophageal ultrasound and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful.

- Breast lesions: Regular mammograms showed no clear evidence, but breast magnetic resonance imaging was performed in patients who had previous lesions diagnosed. Treatment and follow-up are not well standardized.
