The MHC genes that act as transplantation antigens are the classical HLA genes. The classical HLA class I genes (HLA-A, -B and -C) express on most of the somatic cells in the body. Classical HLA Class II genes (HLA-DR,-DQ, -DP) express on antigen presenting cells such as B- cells, activated T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells of thymic gland. If interferon is present, other types of cells can also express class II HLA molecules. The primary function is the distinction of self from non-self. Both class I and class II molecules present short peptides derived from pathogens to T cells to initiate the adaptive immune response. The HLA class I molecules display peptides that result from the degradation of cytosolic proteins to the cell surface where they can is recognizable by the CD8+T cells. HLA class II molecules present peptides that result from the degradation of endocytosed proteins to the cell surface where they are recognizable by the CD4+ T cells.
