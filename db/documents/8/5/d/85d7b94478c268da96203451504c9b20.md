Patient education and emphasis of conservative approach canÂ help patient outcomes:

- Activity restriction and modification is a significant initial step in non-operative management.

- Evidence supports conservative therapy in the early stages of the disease, such as the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

- Providing prescriptions for medial arch support insoles or custom orthotics is necessary in many cases.

- Moreover, surgery is usually the last resort if recovery is prolonged.

- When performing surgery, temper patient expectations, as reconstruction options commonly have residual symptoms.
