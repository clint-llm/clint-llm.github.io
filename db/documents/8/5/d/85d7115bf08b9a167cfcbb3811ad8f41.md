Inhalation anesthetics (nitrous oxide, halothane, isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, most commonly used agents in practice today) are used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia in the operating room. This review is a general overview of inhalation anesthetic agents. Inhalation anesthetic agents are medications primarily used in the operating room to provide general anesthesia for surgery. This activity describes the indications, action, and contraindications for the use of inhalational anesthetic agents. This activity will also highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional healthcare team in providing general anesthesia.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of inhalation anesthetics.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of inhalational anesthetics.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for inhalational anesthetics.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance inhalational anesthetics and improve outcomes.
