In physiological phimosis, attempted retraction of the foreskin results in an apparent constriction ring a few millimeters proximal to the preputial orifice. The orifice on retraction has been described as akin to a flower, with a moist supple and unscarred appearance with pouting of the inner mucosa.

In contrast, BXO has a sclerotic constricting band 1 to 2 cm proximal to the distal end, and there may be glans involvement in a diffuse pattern with whitish discoloration of the peri-meatal area and an erythematous area being pathognomonic.
