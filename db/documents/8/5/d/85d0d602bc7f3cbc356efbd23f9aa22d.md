All patients who are on mechanical ventilation for any reason require liberation as soon as possible. Clinicians shouldÂ consider the cause of the patient's respiratory failure, prognosis, expected course of the disease, and the absence of any reasons to stay on mechanical ventilation for a longer time.

Providers should start planning extubation as early as day one of intubation.

Any patient who successfully passes the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) should be extubated unless there is a change in management plans.
