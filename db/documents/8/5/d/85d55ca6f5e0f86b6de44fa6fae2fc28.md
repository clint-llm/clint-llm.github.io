**Laboratory Diagnosis:**The laboratory testing must be correlated with physical examination findings for the prompt and definitive diagnosis.

**Bacteriologic Testing:**A smear of the throat sample is stained with Gram stain and methylene blue. Although the Gram staining does not confirm the diagnosis, it is the initial test that is done in suspected cases. The Gram stain shows club-shaped, nonencapsulated, nonmotile bacilli found in clusters. The methylene blue stain reveals the typical metachromatic granules.

**Culture:**Culture from the throat swab is done either on Loffler medium or Tindale media, a telluride plate, and blood agar. A black colony with halos on Tindale media, metachromatic granules seen on a Loffler medium, the typical gray-black color of tellurium shows the presence of the organism in these media.

**Toxin Testing:**Toxin detection in the case of C. diphtheria helps to differentiate toxigenic strain from non-toxigenic variant. This can be achieved via the Elek test, PCR testing, and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) test.

**Other Laboratory Studies:**

- Complete blood count: It may show moderate leukocytosis.

- Troponin I: This helps in finding out the extent of the myocardial injury.

**Imaging Studies:**Chest and neck x-ray may reveal swelling of the soft tissue structure in and around the pharynx, epiglottis, and chest.
