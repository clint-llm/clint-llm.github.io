**Cardiac Toxicity**

Flecainide has a proarrhythmic effect with an increased incidence of mortality and non-fatal cardiac arrest in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and asymptomatic premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)/non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). Flecainide prolongs depolarization and can slow conduction in the AV node, the His-Purkinje system. These changes can result in prolonged PR intervals, first-degree heart block, and second-degree heart block. Preexisting sinus node disease can result in profound bradycardia. It does not affect repolarization, so it exerts a mild effect on QT interval.

Flecainide has a negative inotropic effect on cardiac muscles. Therefore, its use in heart failure patients is contraindicated. Flecainide has the potential to convert atrial fibrillation into atrial flutter with 1 to 1 conduction and also ventricular tachyarrhythmias, so beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers should be used concurrently.

Common reactions to flecainide include dizziness, arrhythmias, dyspnea, visual disturbances, palpitations, chest pain, tremor, asthenia, abdominal pain, and constipation.

**Black Box Warning**

Flecainide has an FDA Black Box Warning recommending restricting its use to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, as data show no surn=vival benefits without such arrhythmias. Proarrythmic effects may occur in atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation; the drug is not recommended for chronic atrial fibrillation.

The warning also includes the finding that there is increased mortality or non-fatal cardiac arrest rates in asymptomatic cases of non-life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias with a prior history of myocardial infarction from 6 days to 2 years previously.
