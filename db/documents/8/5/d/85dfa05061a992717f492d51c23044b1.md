Preparation of a long arm cast involves several steps. The practitioner may decide on the width of plaster or fiberglass to use that best fits the patient's anatomy. For adults, this often translates to 3-inch diameter sugar tong and 3 to 4-inch posterior mold material.  For pediatrics, 2-inch sugar tong and posterior mold often work well. For plaster and fiberglass, the length of the sugar tong and posterior splint should be pre-measured. With plaster, eight to 10 layers are often used. For fiberglass, most splinting materials come pre-fabricated. Synthetic or cotton web roll should be obtained for padding. Optionally, stockinette can be used for patient comfort as a base layer before splinting. The final overwrap is typically performed with an elastic bandage.
