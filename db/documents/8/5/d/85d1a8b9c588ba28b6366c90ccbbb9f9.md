The various dosing units and conversion factors of calcium gluconate are potential sources of medication errors. Dose information is given as calcium gluconate salt or compounds unless provided otherwise; 10% means there are 10 grams of calcium gluconate in 100 mL of the solvent, water. In 10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate, there is 1 g calcium gluconate salt or compound containing 93 mg elemental calcium, which is 4.65 mEq, which is 2.33 mmol. Because calcium has a valence of +2, the milliequivalents are twice the millimoles. 1 mL of 10% calcium gluconate contains 9.3 mg of elemental calcium.

**Hypocalcemia**

The emergency treatment of hypocalcemia focuses mainly on reversing symptoms rather than correcting serum calcium levels. Repeat serum calcium measurements 4 to 6 hours after calcium treatment. Furthermore, the patient should undergo an assessment for hypomagnesemia as low magnesium levels can cause decreased serum calcium levels.

Treatment of hypocalcemia using calcium gluconate includes the following:

Severe symptomatic hypocalcemia (seizure, laryngospasm, tetany): 1 to 2 grams of calcium gluconate should be administered in 10 minutes and repeated in 10 to 60 minutes until symptoms resolve. Approximately 100 to 200 mg of elemental calcium (in case of calcium gluconate: 93 mg elemental calcium in 1 gram of calcium gluconate) should be infused over 10 minutes to treat symptomatic hypocalcemia. Rhythm monitoring with an EKG is recommended during intravenous calcium bolus (IV push over 10 minutes) administration. 10 to 20 mL of 10% calcium gluconate diluted in 50 to 100 mL dextrose or normal saline intravenously over 10 minutes is recommended.

Moderate to severe hypocalcemia (ionized calcium <4 mg/dL) without seizure or tetany: An infusion of approximately 100 mg/hr of elemental calcium can be given to adults over several hours. 4 g calcium gluconate IV over 4 hours corresponds to 1 gram of calcium gluconate (one ampoule, 10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate) for each hour. Patients with persistent hypocalcemia can receive a continuous infusion of 5 to 20 mg/kg/hour of calcium gluconate. For example, one ampoule of 10% calcium gluconate in 90 mL of normal saline or 5% dextrose at 100 mL per hour will deliver 10 mg/kg/hr in a 100 kg individual. Ten ampoules of 10% calcium gluconate in 900 mL of normal saline or 5% dextrose will also deliver 10 mg/kg/hr in a 100 kg individual. The clinician can alter the infusion parameters based on the patient’s weight, intended fluid delivery, and desired IV rate.

Mild hypocalcemia (ionized calcium above 4 to 5 mg/dL): 1 to 2 g calcium gluconate IV over 2 hours. Oral calcium is an option for asymptomatic patients.

**Hyperkalemia**

Calcium gluconate is given as a 10% solution, 15 to 30 mL IV, over 2 to 5 minutes to stabilize cardiac cell membranes in treating hyperkalemia.

**Hypermagnesemia**

Cardiac toxicity due to hypermagnesemia should receive treatment with the equivalent regimen as hyperkalemia: 10% solution, 15 to 30 mL IV over 2 to 5 minutes during cardiac arrest due to hypermagnesemia. Otherwise, the typical dosage of calcium gluconate is 1 to 2 g, elemental calcium approximately 100 to 200 mg (about 10 to 20 mL) over 5 to 10 minutes in symptomatic hypermagnesemia in those with renal impairment awaiting dialysis.

**Hydrofluoric Acid Burns**

Calcium gluconate can be used as a 2.5% gel to treat hydrofluoric burns. This gel can be made with 25 mL of 10% calcium gluconate with 75 mL of glycerol (glycerine) and hydroxyethylcellulose gel. The gel is applied liberally and massaged into the burn area for 30 to 60 minutes with reapplication as necessary. For persistent pain in burns, 5% calcium gluconate solution can be injected subcutaneously with a 27-gauge needle 0.5 cm away from the burn border into the surrounding unaffected area beneath and into the burn area (0.5mL/cm^2 of burn surface area). This injection is not to be used on the digits. For severe hydrofluoric acid burns and unrelenting pain despite aggressive treatment, intraarterial use of calcium gluconate can be utilized. In this case, 10 to 15 mL of 10% calcium gluconate can be added to 40 mL of Ringer’s lactate and delivered over 3 hours into the artery that supplies the burned area. Inhalation injury can have treatment with 2.5% calcium gluconate administered via nebulizer.

**Beta-blocker and Calcium Channel Blocker Toxicity**

Calcium gluconate is a viable option in cases of beta-blocker overdose with shock refractory to other measures. A 10% calcium gluconate solution should be administered as 0.6 to 1.2 mL/kg (60 to 120 mg/kg) IV over 5 to 10 minutes, repeated as needed every 10 to 20 minutes for 3 to 4 times, and followed by a continuous infusion of 0.65 mL/kg/hr.

When treating calcium channel blocker toxicity, a dose of calcium gluconate can be given as a bolus or continuous infusion. Bolus dosing is 0.6 mL/kg (60 mg/kg) of 10% calcium gluconate solution,repeated as needed every 10-20 minutes for 3 to 4 times and followed by a continuous infusion of 0.6 to 1.5 mL/kg/hr (60 to 150 mg/kg/hr). Throughout the process, ionized calcium levels require monitoring to achieve a calcium level two times the normal. It is worth noting that calcium supplementation is an adjunct to other therapies such as glucagon, atropine, and hyperinsulinemia/euglycemia therapy to treat CCB toxicity.
