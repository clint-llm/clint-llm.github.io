Meconium Ileus (MI) is one of the earliest manifestations of cystic fibrosis (CF) and presents in up to 20 percent of infants with CF. The inspissated meconium obstructs the small intestine at the level of the terminal ileum. If left untreated, the prognosis is poor. This activity illustrates the evaluation, treatment, and complications of meconium ileus and the importance of an interprofessional team approach to the management of neonates with cystic fibrosis.

**Objectives:**
- Describe meconium ileus.
- Outline the factors with associated increase risk of developing cystic fibrosis. 
- Review the immediate and long-term management that should be undertaken upon the detection of meconium ileus.
- Summarize the need for a an interprofessional team approach to caring for a patient with cystic fibrosis.
