The autonomic nervous system regulates various body processes and comprises the sympathetic (adrenergic) and parasympathetic (cholinergic) nervous system. These systems work in balance to respond to changes throughout the body. When the body assumes an upright position, there is an immediate gravitational pooling of about 500 to 1000ml of blood to the lower extremities, splanchnic and pulmonary circulations.
