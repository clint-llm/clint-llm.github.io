The incidence of primary orbital tumors is low, affecting approximately 1 in 100,000 people.

A large retrospective series of 2,480 orbital lesions referred to a specialized center for tissue diagnosis identified benign masses in 68% of cases.

Most tumors were located in the upper outer orbital quadrant, and the authors noted that tumors in the lower inner quadrant have a higher likelihood of malignant disease. Additional patterns were identified, with different lesions presenting most commonly in different anatomic locations. In the upper outer quadrant, dermoid cysts were the most common tumors identified. Most masses in the upper inner quadrant were mucoceles.

Cavernous hemangiomas were the most common masses found in the lower outer quadrant, and basal cell epitheliomas made up the highest number in the lower inner quadrant. The most common central orbital masses were meningiomas.
