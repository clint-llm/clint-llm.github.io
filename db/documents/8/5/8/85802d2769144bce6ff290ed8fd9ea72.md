Tuberculosis: During active TB, bleeding is usually a result of ulcerations with subsequent necrosis of adjacent vessels.

Bronchiectasis: Rupture of the tortuous vessels and hypertrophy due to chronic inflammation in the bronchial arterial system as well as blood vessels in the peribronchial and submucosal plexus.

Mycetomas: Most common organism is Aspergillus (50 to 90%) which is known to cause vascular and parenchymal changes in infection.

Cryptogenic bleeding tends to occur in smokers.

Carcinoma: Squamous cell carcinoma and other centrally located malignancies are eitherÂ vascular sources themselves or erode into nearby vessels.

Pneumonia: Invasive Fungal and bacterial pneumonias such as caused by Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) producing form of MRSA. Pathogenicity of the PVL exotoxin is thought to be due to binding via a G-protein-coupled membrane-bound receptor that causes neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, and vascular necrosis.
