Complications of ataxia are related to the type of ataxia. Commonly, patients have rigidity, dyspnea, breathing difficulty, and choking, which may also lead to death in severe cases. Patients may require assistance in ventilation, feeding tubes, and airway management. Patients who are unable to walk or require wheelchair assistance may develop pressure ulcers, infections, and thrombosis.

Psychological and psychiatric illnesses, such as dementia and depression, are common and require therapy. Other complications include lightheadedness, spasticity, tremors, lethargy, generalized pain, blood pressure changes, bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction.
