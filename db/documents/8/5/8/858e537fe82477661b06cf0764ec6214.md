Initial diagnosis and management of small bowel cancer require interprofessional efforts to help coordinate diagnostic studies and treatment plans. Diagnosis is often delayed due to a low index of suspicion by the initial evaluating clinician. Once the diagnosis is made, the patient's outcomes will significantly improve if the care is well-coordinated between the primary team, general surgeon, gastroenterologist, and medical oncologist. If the patient has evidence of advanced disease, early involvement of the palliative care team may significantly help the patient's quality of life long term and help provide early support for further goals of care discussions. Specialized oncology nursing staff and pharmacists will also play a significant role in caring for these tumors, providing expertise out of their patient care specialties. This interprofessional team approach to patient care will drive improved outcomes for patients with small bowel cancer with fewer adverse events. [Level 5]
