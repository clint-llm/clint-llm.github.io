**Medical**

The most commonly used drugs are levetiracetam, trihexyphenidyl, levodopa, dopamine agonists, anticholinergics, and topiramate.

**Surgical**

Stereotactic lesions (radiofrequency, thermal), principally at the thalamus, have produced partial improvement.

Gamma knife thalamotomy at Vim nucleus with a 130 Gy dose at the 100% isodose line; the 30% isodose line was kept lateral to the medial margin of the internal capsule with partial results.

Classical targets for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the VIM produced a good clinical response with partial results in only 31% of patients with Holmes tremor.

Other areas of DBS have provided good single case improvement, including the prelemniscal radiations (inferior to the caudal zona incerta)

Focused ultrasound in deep brain targets for movement disorders and some types of tremors have been used and are now under clinical trials for Holmes tremor.
