To further study the necrotic effects of the brown recluse spider bite, there was a study done with rabbits injectedÂ with the venom. Although a small sample size, findings showed inflammatory infiltrates, coagulative necrosis and vasculitis. With all samples, there was a zone of eosinophils referred to as "mummified" coagulative necrosis seen between the epidermal and dermal layers.
