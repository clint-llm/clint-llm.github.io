Although usually discussed in the context of neuronal cells, action potentials also occur in many excitable cells such as cardiac muscle and some endocrine cells.

Within the heart, pacemaker cells located in the SA node initiate action potentials intrinsically and rhythmically. Unlike in neurons, the majority of current in pacemaker cells gets mediated through calcium flux. A transient current of calcium ions, mediated by T-type calcium channels, slowly depolarizes the pacemaker cell until reaching the threshold potential for L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, inducing an action potential.
