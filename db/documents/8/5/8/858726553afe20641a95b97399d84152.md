There are multiple conditions and disorders that can cause or contribute to male infertility. A list of some of the more common causes follows:

- Adult growth hormone deficiency

- 5-Alpha reductase deficiency

- Androgen receptor gene polymorphisms

- Brain damage from tumors or trauma

- Bilateral testicular torsion

- Celiac disease (associated with androgen resistance)

- Chemotherapy (especially alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide)

- Chromosomal abnormalities (Y chromosome microdeletions in azoospermic regions AZFa, AZFb, and AZFc)

- Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (32-hydroxylase deficiency)

- Cryptorchidism

- Cushing disease

- Cystic fibrosis

- Down syndrome

- Drug use (even commonly prescribed medications such as cimetidine, spironolactone, tetracycline, nitrofurantoin, sulfasalazine, and calcium channel blockers)

- Ejaculatory duct obstruction

- Estrogen excess

- Follicle-stimulating hormonal (FSH) abnormalities

- FSH receptor gene mutation

- Hemochromatosis

- Hodgkin lymphoma (due to need for extensive chemotherapy)

- HIV infections (causes low sperm motility)

- Human beta-defensin abnormalities

- Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism

- Hypogonadism

- Hypopituitarism

- Immotile cilia syndrome

- Kallmann syndrome

- Kartagener syndrome

- Klinefelter syndrome

- Lead exposure

- Leprosy

- Liver failure

- Luteinizing hormone (LH) deficiency

- Marijuana associated disorders

- Mixed gonadal dysgenesis

- Mumps

- Myotonic dystrophy

- Noonan syndrome (male Turner syndrome)

- Obesity

- Opioid abuse

- Pesticide, fungicide, and chemical exposure

- Pituitary adenomas, prolactinomas

- Primary hypogonadism

- Prostate and pelvic surgery

- Radiation exposure (Sertoli and sperm cells are much more sensitive than Leydig cells)

- Recurrent urinary tract infections

- Renal failure

- Reifenstien syndrome (partial androgen insensitivity)

- Sarcoidosis

- Seminomatous and non-seminomatous germ cell testicular tumors

- Sex reversal syndrome

- Sertoli cell-only syndrome (azoospermia with high FSH levels. Testis biopsy needed for diagnosis.)

- Sickle cell anemia (due to intratesticular ischemia)

- Smoking

- Spinal cord injury

- Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)

- Testicular cancers

- Testicular torsion

- Testicular trauma

- Testosterone supplementation

- Thalassemia

- Tuberculosis

- Thyroid disorders

- Tuberculosis

- Urethral infection, stricture, or trauma

- Varicoceles

- Young syndrome
