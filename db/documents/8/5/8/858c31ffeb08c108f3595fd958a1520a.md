Given the high incidence of corticosteroid-induced myopathy in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy for a wide range of clinical indications, an interprofessional team should implement systematic clinical screening for corticosteroid-induced myopathy in the appropriate patient populations. Since primary care clinicians are the most frequently and consistently involved specialty in taking care of such patients, they should maintain a high degree of suspicion for this diagnosis. Additionally, providers and team members should systematically recommend and prescribe physical therapy to prevent and treat corticosteroid-induced myopathy.
