It should be kept in mind that since the spinal trigeminal tract extends inferiorly down to the level of C3, this tract can be involved clinically in patients with craniovertebral junction pathologies. For the same reason, surgical intervention at this level, for example, posterior fossa decompression, could affect this area and related brainstem structures.****

The caudal end of the spinal trigeminal nucleus terminates at the obex of the fourth ventricle in a raised tubercle, termed the trigeminal tubercle. This is a valuable landmark for neurosurgeons operating in this region.
