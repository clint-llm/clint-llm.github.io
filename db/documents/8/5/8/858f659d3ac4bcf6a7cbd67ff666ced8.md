Rotor syndrome is a benign disorder with no morbidity and is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), pharmacists, and nurses. The efforts of these interprofessional team members revolve around the differential diagnosis, as described above, as the syndrome requires no therapeutic interventions. Meticulous record-keeping and open communication among team members will lead to an accurate diagnosis and the best outcomes.

A liver biopsy is not required to diagnose Rotor syndrome, but if done, a liver biopsy in patients with the disease reveals normal histology. In addition, a liver biopsy may help distinguish Rotor syndrome from other, more severe liver diseases. Since Rotor syndrome is clinically similar to Dubin-Johnson syndrome (DJS), it is imperative to differentiate between these two conditions; the absence of dark melanin-like pigments on liver biopsy distinguishes Rotor syndrome from DJS.

The outcomes for patients with Rotor syndrome are excellent.
