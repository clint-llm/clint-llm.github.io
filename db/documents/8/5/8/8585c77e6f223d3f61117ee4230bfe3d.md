Skin grafting is a closure technique used in dermatology most commonly to close wounds created by the removal of skin cancer. Although currently less favored than flap closures, grafting can produce a good cosmetic result. Skin grafts, in contrast to flaps, are completely removed from their blood supply, whereas flaps remain attached to a blood supply via a pedicle. Skin grafts are less technically difficult but can be more time-consuming as the procedure creates a second surgical site. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications of skin grafts and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing these patients before and after surgery.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the differences between split thickness and full thickness skin grafts.
- Describe the indications for skin grafts.
- Recall the preparation of the donor and recipient sites for skin grafts.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients undergoing skin grafts.
