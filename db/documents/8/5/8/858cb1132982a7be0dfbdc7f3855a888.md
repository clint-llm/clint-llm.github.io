Viscoelastic are substances with dual properties having a viscosity of a fluid and elasticity of a gel or a solid. They are commonly employed in all kinds of ophthalmic surgical interventions. The nurses, mid-level ophthalmic personnel, pharmacist, allied health, and OT store staff have a crucial role in arranging the viscoelastics during the surgical intervention.

The ophthalmic surgeon should make judicious and timely use of viscoelastics during surgical intervention with no trauma to the ocular structures. It is the responsibility of the operating surgeon to ensure that the viscoelastic is washed thoroughly from the eye at the end of the surgical procedure. In case of any ocular complication of viscoelastic the surgeon and the paramedical staff also has to play an essential role in prompt and meticulous treatment.
