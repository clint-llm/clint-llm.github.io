OMT is typically only done by the physician. Since no other healthcare providers are required, but there needs to be increased communication between MDs and DOs because a large number of patient complaints could find relief with OMT as opposed to conventional treatments. It is essential to educate healthcare professionals of all levels to direct patients to the most cost-effective and safe treatments. This approach is especially crucial for patients who are not candidates for medications or surgery. OMT provides a non-invasive treatment method that can be very beneficial for patients.
