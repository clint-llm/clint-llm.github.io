The following are the clinical indications that could require a percutaneous coronary intervention.

- Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)

- Primary PCI is the recommended method of reperfusion when it can be performed in a timely fashion by experienced operators.
- STEMI and ischemic symptoms of less than 12 hours' duration.
- STEMI and ischemic symptoms of less than 12 hours' duration and contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy
- PCI improves survival in patients with significant (>50%) stenosis

- Non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) 

- Early invasive therapy (within 2 hours of symptoms) recommended with refractory angina, recurrent angina, symptoms of heart failure, new or worsening mitral regurgitation, hemodynamic instability, or sustained ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation.
- A worsening of troponin levels should trigger an early therapy (within 24 hours)

- Unstable angina

- Stable angina

- Anginal equivalent (e.g., dyspnea, arrhythmia, or dizziness or syncope)

- High-risk stress test findings

- PCI is indicated for critical coronary artery stenosis, which does not qualify for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).
