Although it has been reported in over 450 instances, the neurological and behavioral complications may affect numerous individuals. This disorder may remain un- or underdiagnosed. This activity reviews the biochemical and clinical evaluation of SSADH deficiency and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this disease.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.
- Review the typical clinical presentations of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.
- Explain the treatment and management options available for succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients affected with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.
