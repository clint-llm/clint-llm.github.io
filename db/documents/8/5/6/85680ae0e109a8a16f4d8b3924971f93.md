The most important differential diagnosis includes the following: X-linked agammaglobulinemia characterizes by recurrent bacterial infections in boys, and genetic studies may reveal the presence of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) mutations. Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of newborns presents in newborns above the age of 4 months and characterizes by recurrent pneumonia, meningitis, otitis media, and other problems that resemble Bruton disease. It is a physiological defect in the immune system caused by maternal IgG disappearance and corrected soon but requires treatment. In super-IgM syndrome, recurrent bacterial infections occur, but the cause of this illness is a mutation in the gene encoding for CD40 on T lymphocytes that causes a failure in T and B lymphocyte cooperation. Common variable immunodeficiency presents with recurrent bacterial infections, including sinopulmonary problems but later in life (second-fourth decade), and the diagnosis is made once all causes of immunodeficiency have been ruled out.

Antibody deficiency may present in other diseases, including:

- Immunodeficiency with ataxia-telangiectasia

- DiGeorge syndrome

- Lymphomas

- Acute leukemia and other lymphoproliferative disorders

- Malnutrition

- Interleukin-12 receptor deficiency

- HIV/AIDS

- Use of immunosuppressors

- Systemic lupus erythematosus

- Bare leukocyte syndrome

- Organ transplantation recipient

- Sarcoidosis

- Amyloidosis

- Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) receptor deficiency

- Chronic granulomatous disease

- Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome

- Obesity

- Chronic renal failure

- C3 deficiency

- Toll-like receptor deficiency and other innate immune system-related deficiencies

- X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) syndrome
