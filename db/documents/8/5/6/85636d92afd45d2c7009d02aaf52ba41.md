Prepackaged paracentesis kits with plastic sheath cannulas attached to a syringe and a stopcock are available. Alternatively, traditional large-bore intravenous (IV) catheters or 18 gauge to 20 gauge standard or spinal needles can be used. These can be attached to a syringe for aspiration and then to IV tubing for fluid drainage. If you do not have a pre-packaged kit, you will need the following:

- sterile gloves

- sterile drapes/towels

- chlorhexidine or betadine

- 1% lidocaine, a needle to inject anesthetic (25 gauge for the skin and a slightly smaller gauge needle for the soft tissue)

- a 14 or 16 gauge needle or IV catheter for fluid aspiration (spinal needle for obese patients)

- a 20 cc or 60 cc syringe to collect a sample of fluid

- IV tubing

- vacuum bottles or plastic canisters (if performing large volume paracentesis)

- 4x4 gauze or bandage

- hematology, chemistry and microbiology sample tubes and blood culture bottles
