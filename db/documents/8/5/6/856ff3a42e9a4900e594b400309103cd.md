Tympanic membrane rupture is a clinical diagnosis. In the absence of obvious TM rupture on exam, pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry can be used to assess for occult perforation. However, these devices are not always readily available. Additionally, if perforation is suspected, pneumatic otoscopy should generally be avoided for the risk of damage to the middle ear. Otoscope fogging may also be used as an indicator for perforation, as warm humidified air is connecting from the nasopharynx into the middle ear and communicating to the EAC via the perforation, leading to condensation on the otoscope.
