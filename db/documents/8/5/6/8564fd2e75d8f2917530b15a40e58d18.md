The rosette test is a qualitative screening test performed on a maternal blood sample to determine if FMH has occurred between an Rh-positive fetus and an Rh-negative mother and serves as a useful screening test. Qualitative testing may be utilized before quantitative testing, i.e., if the rosette test is positive, a KB test should be performed to confirm and then subsequently quantify the amount of FMH. In massive trauma, the KB test may be utilized primarily, without the preliminary use of the screening rosette test. The Kleihauer Betke test is utilized to determine if there is fetal blood in maternal circulation, with a threshold of 5 mL.

The rosette test is performed by incubating the Rh-negative maternal venous whole blood sample with anti-Rho(D) immune globulin. The maternal cells are left unbound to the anti-Rho(D) as they are Rho(D) negative. During this incubation period, any Rh-positive fetal cells in the maternal sample are sensitized to the anti-Rho(D) immune globulin and bound. Enzyme treated indicator cells are added, only binding to the fetal cells that were present and sensitized, resulting in a process called erythrocyte rosetting or E-rosetting. The indicator cells will be at the center of the rosette, while the fetal RBCs will be clustered around the edges, like petals on a flower. This rosetting pattern may then be viewed under microscopy.
