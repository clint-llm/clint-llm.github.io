The latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap or myofascial flap is a useful technique with many head, neck, and torso reconstruction applications. When there is a large soft-tissue defect of the head and neck or torso that requires pliable soft tissue for reconstruction, the latissimus flap is an excellent option. This activity reviews the latissimus dorsi muscle's anatomy, indications, and contraindications for flap transfer, and the surgical technique with its potential complications and also highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and improving care for patients who undergo this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures important to latissimus dorsi flap transfer in both a pedicled and free fashion.
- Describe the technique of latissimus dorsi flap harvest, transfer, and inset.
- Outline the potential complications of latissimus dorsi flap transfer and their clinical significance.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes after latissimus dorsi flap transfer.
