The mainstay of treatment for Whipple disease is antibiotic therapy. Because of the possibility of CNS involvement, even in the absence of symptoms, the use of antibiotics that penetrate the blood-brain barrier is desirable. One recommended regimen for the initial phase is Ceftriaxone two grams daily or Penicillin G two million units every four hours. The usual duration for the initial phase is two weeks, followed by the maintenance phase with Trimethoprim 160 mg- Sulfamethoxazole 800 mg twice daily for twelve months. Meropenem can also be used for the initial phase in patients with penicillin allergy. Long courses are usually necessary to prevent relapse. Unfortunately, relapse can occur even years after treatment. Often, CNS symptoms may be the first sign of relapse.

It is important to note that after the initial parenteral treatment, at least 12 months of treatment is required with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Body fluids must be evaluated for the organism to ensure a complete cure, which can take 1 to 2 years.
