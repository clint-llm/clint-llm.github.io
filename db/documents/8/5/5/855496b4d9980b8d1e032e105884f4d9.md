As humans age, and their thymus regresses, they have an increased susceptibility for disease. This decrease in thymus size and function leads to decreased circulating T cells and alteration of their role. ThisÂ change in function can increase autoimmune diseases, bacterial and viral infections, and neoplasms. Restoring thymic function or intervening before involution could maintain the immune system throughout adult life.
