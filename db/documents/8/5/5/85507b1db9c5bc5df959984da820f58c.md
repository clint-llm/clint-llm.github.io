Prevalence of spider angiomas is highest among patients with cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and hepatopulmonary syndrome. Spider nevi correspond with a higher risk of mortality among patients with the alcoholic liver disease. They also suggest a high likelihood of esophageal varices and are indicative of the extent of hepatic fibrosis. The reported prevalence of spider angiomas in cirrhosis is 33%. In one study, 38% of healthy children had at least single spider telangiectasia. They are also visible in about 60% of pregnant women. Physiological spider angiomas in younger adults usually disappear as the age advances, although in few, it may take several years to disappear completely. In women who take oral contraceptives and present with lesions, they may resolve after the patient discontinues the hormonal preparations. If spider angiomas are associated with pregnancy, they will disappear after delivery of the baby. There is no racial predilection for spider angiomas, but lesions are more apparent in light-skinned patients. Spider angiomas are more common in women than in men, and this is thought to be due to the role of steroid hormones in their formation.
