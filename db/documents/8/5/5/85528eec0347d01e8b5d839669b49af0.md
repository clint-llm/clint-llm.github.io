Four features commonly seen in patients with velocardial facial syndrome that significantly impact the quality of life and require medical management are developmental delays, cardiac anomalies, palatal anomalies, and immune deficiency.

The cardiac anomalies most commonly seenÂ with velocardial facial syndrome are tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia, truncus arteriosus, interrupted aortic arch, and ventricular septal defect. Early intervention by an experienced pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon is ideal for possible repair and or monitoring. Cardiac abnormalities have the most significant impact on morbidity and mortality.

Palatal defects can cause difficulties in feeding due to muscle weakness in the nasopharyngeal area.

Patients with hypocalcemia should be supplemented with calcium and vitamin D, and their levels monitored. Hypercalcemia can be very damaging and should be avoided.

As a patient with velocardial facial syndrome ages, his medical needs will change, and things like early education of parents are key. Additionally, growth should be evaluated using specialized growth charts.
