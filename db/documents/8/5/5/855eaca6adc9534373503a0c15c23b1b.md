As DMD is inherited as an X-linked recessive manner, boys are more frequently affected than girls. The estimated incidence is 1 in 3600 male live-born infants. Some studies have estimated the prevalence of DMD as 2 per 10,000 in the United States. It is one of the most common and most severe congenital myopathies.
