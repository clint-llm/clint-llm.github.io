The incidence of pacemaker syndrome varies widely, but has been reported as high as 80%

With single-chamber and ventricular-paced devices in VVI mode, the incidence approaches 20% as has been reported in the MOST trial.

In large trials as MOST, PASE and CTTOP, it was observed the pacing mode change or device revision to dual chamber pacing (DDD) helped the most and was often what was required to alleviate the symptoms in the majority of patients.
