Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) is histologically characterized by segmental scarring that involves a part of the glomerulus and only affects some but not all glomeruli sampled. Patients with this condition can present with the clinical manifestations of nephrotic and nephritic syndrome or renal insufficiency. The most common clinical manifestation of FSGS (in over 70% of patients) is nephrotic syndrome, presenting as generalized or dependent edema, fatigue, and appetite loss. Hypertension is another common feature and could be severe, with diastolic blood pressure over 120 mmHg. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis.
- Describe the role of podocytes, epithelial cells, and basement membrane in the pathophysiology of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis.
- Outline the use of steroids and immunosuppressive therapies in managing focal segmental glomerular sclerosis.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to enhance care delivery for patients affected by focal segmental glomerular sclerosis.
