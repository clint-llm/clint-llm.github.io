Glycogen exists from precursors of glucose, derived from recently ingested carbohydrates or gluconeogenic precursors, including lactate and alanine. Glycogenolysis is simply the process involved in the degradation of glycogen for utilization as an energy source mainly in skeletal muscle and liver. Glycogen degradation occurs in two distinct pathways depending on location. Concerning skeletal muscle, glycogen degradation leads to glucose-1-phosphate, and muscle uses it, per se, as fuel for contraction. Glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle occurs under conditions of physical activity. On the other hand, liver glycogenolysis generates glucose for export to the bloodstream. The stimulus for liver glycogenolysis is nutritional deprivation, with a corresponding increase in hormones such as glucagon.
