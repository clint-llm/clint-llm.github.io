One study discussed the recurring sustained posturing reflecting the strength of reflex activity (not only the presence or absence of ATNR) in preterm infants predicted subsequent abnormal development. This research emphasized the value of comprehensive neurological assessments being beneficial, especially if done longitudinally across the development of high-risk preterm and term infants, even while in the intensive and/or special care nursery, in predicting their susceptibility to developmental disorders. Starting therapeutic goals early, such as in infant handling and positioning and supportive parental instructions, are crucial for holistic management and rehabilitation to these patients. Another study mentioned an ATNR rating scale that can be used as a clinical quantitative tool to assess patients with suspected or known sensory integration deficits, maturational, learning, or behavioral delays. Several works of literature also proposed the conduction of routine neurological examinations of the degree of reflexes integration in children. The results should correlate to factors such as trunk rotation, psychomotor skills, and neurodevelopment for early and more effective management. All these assessments may prevent the progression of psychomotor, social, and educational delays on a personal level and lessen the high cost of healthcare at the societal level.
