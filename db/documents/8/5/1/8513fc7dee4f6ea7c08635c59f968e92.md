Having a sunburn is a benign condition that usually heals without further medical intervention. However, an increase in sunburn is directly related to an increase in skin cancer. Medical professionals that include nurses and pharmacists should take the time to educate patients on proper sun protection to help decrease the incidence of sunburn, and therefore decrease the risk of skin cancer. Patients who have acquired many blistering sunburns in the past would benefit from a referral to a dermatologist for yearly skin exams.

Occasionally, a sunburn is severe enough to warrant an inpatient admission to a hospital. This includes blistering sunburns that lead to fluid losses and electrolyte imbalances. These patients will require intravenous rehydration with lactated Ringer's and may benefit from a transfer to a burn center.
