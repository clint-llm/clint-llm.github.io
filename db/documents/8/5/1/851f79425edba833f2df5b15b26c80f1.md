Several significant differences between the central and peripheral cornea make it susceptible to inflammation, ulceration, and furrowing. The peripheral cornea is the transition zone between cornea, conjunctiva, episclera, and sclera with a combination of histologic features.

The reservoir of corneal epithelial stem cells and mitogenic activity of corneal endothelial cells are also highest in the peripheral cornea.

The central cornea is avascular and derives most of its nutrition through tear film and aqueous humor. In contrast, the peripheral cornea has a well-developed vascular and lymphatics supply, with perilimbal vessels extending 0.5mm into the cornea.

A combination of humoral and cellular immune mechanisms is involved in PUK. Autoantibodies and self-antigens combine to form immune complexes that activate B cells and complement proteins in PUK secondary to rheumatoid arthritis. B cells can further stimulate T cells to secrete cytokines associated with rheumatoid arthritis. The combination of angiogenesis and immune cell clusters contribute to pannus formation in PUK.
