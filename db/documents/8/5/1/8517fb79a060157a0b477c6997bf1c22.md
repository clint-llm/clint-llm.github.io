A significant challenge facing the pathologist interpreting the TAB is the potential for false-negative results, which may occur in 5% to 10% of cases. Therefore, the surgeon must perform the TAB employing appropriate biopsy site selection, meticulous tissue handling, and adequate specimen length to maximize diagnostic yield. Unfortunately, despite the correct technique, false-negative results remain common. In some cases, bilateral TAB may increase the yield and decrease the false-negative rates.

The most dreaded complication of TAB is temporary or permanent damage to the temporal branch of the facial nerve.

Other than common surgical complications such as bleeding, infection, hematoma, and wound dehiscence, possible, albeit rare, complications of TAB include ischemic stroke and scalp or tongue necrosis, which have been reported.
