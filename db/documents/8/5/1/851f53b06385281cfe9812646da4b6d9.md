Granular parakeratosis clinically may be confused with several other conditions such as Hailey-Hailey disease, verruca, contact dermatitis, acanthosis nigricans, erythrasma, confluent and reticulated papillomatosis, extramammary Paget disease, amongst others. Granular parakeratosis has also been found to be present concomitantly with other conditions such as tinea corporis. Thus, a punch or shave biopsy should be completed for histopathologic evaluation. The confirmation of granular parakeratosis on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is adequate to confirm the diagnosis. On biopsy, a thickened stratum corneum is noted with abnormal retention of keratohyalin granules as well as an intact stratum granulosum.
