Chronic infections can be complicated by ascending cholangitis which requires IV antibiotics and usually surgery. Biliary obstruction by parasites in the setting of ascending cholangitis requires emergency endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for the direct removal of the worms from the common bile duct if possible. Chronic infections lead to chronic biliary inflammation and destruction giving rise to sclerosing cholangitis, biliary cirrhosis, and cholangiocarcinoma.
