Patient therapeutic response, worsening of depressive symptoms, and risk of suicidal ideation should be monitored initially and at follow-up visits.

It carries a possible risk of causing leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis; therefore, patients with a history of low white blood cells (WBC) or drug-induced neutropenia/leukopenia should have their complete blood count monitored in the first two months of therapy. If patients have a neutrophil count of less than 1000/mm^3, the clinician must discontinue the drug until the WBC count has been fully recovered.

As ziprasidone may cause QT-prolongation, baseline ECG is recommended, especially in patients with preexisting cardiac conditions, and monitored periodically. Continuous ECG monitoring should start in case an arrhythmia occurs.

Orthostatic hypertension can also occur in patients. Patients may experience tachycardia, syncope, dizziness during the first dose titration period due to a1-antagonism. Clinicians should exercise caution in giving ziprasidone to patients with cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease. Monitor blood pressure at baseline and periodically thereafter.

Monitor patient weight, lipid profile, blood glucose levels at baseline and three months after starting the medicine. Additionally, electrolyte levels (potassium, magnesium) could be monitored annually and as clinically indicated.
