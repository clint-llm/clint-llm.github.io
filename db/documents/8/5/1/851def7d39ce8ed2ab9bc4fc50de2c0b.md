Blood pressure requires monitoring in patients receiving nimodipine as it can cause hypotension. The risk of hypotension is higher in the following scenario.

- Nimodipine plasma concentration would increase in the presence of moderate and weak CYP3A4 inhibitors. Therefore, if nimodipine is used concomitantly with CYP3A4 inhibitors, blood pressure should be monitored, and reducing the nimodipine dose may be necessary.

- Nimodipine may increase the blood pressure-lowering effect of concomitantly administered anti-hypertensives (diuretics, β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, A1-antagonists, other calcium antagonists, α-adrenergic blocking agents, PDE5 inhibitors, α-methyldopa). Therefore, closely monitoring BP and reduction in nimodipine dose may be required.

- Monitor for hyponatremia and seizures in patients with SAH.Monitor for vasospasm, especially during the 4-14 days period. (vasospasm window).

- Monitor for elevated intracranial pressure and rebleeding.

- Neurological status should always be monitored by comprehensive neurological examination and scales such as the modified fisher grading scale for subarachnoid hemorrhage.

- Monitor and assess global disability and recovery using Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE).
