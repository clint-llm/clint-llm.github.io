The vestibular nuclei are located in the medulla and pons of the hindbrain. It is a complex composed of four major nuclei that integrate information from the primary vestibular afferents, contralateral nuclei, somatosensory organs, and the cerebellum. The vestibular complex projects fibers to the contralateral vestibular nuclei, spinal cord, cerebellum, thalamus, and the motor nuclei of the extraocular muscles. The major vestibular nuclei are highly interconnected with many overlapping functions. It plays an essential role in maintaining equilibrium, posture, head position, and clear vision with movement. This article discusses the main structural, functional, and nervous connections of the four major nuclei.
