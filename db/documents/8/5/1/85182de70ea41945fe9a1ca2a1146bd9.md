Autoimmune neutropenia is divided into primary and secondary forms according to the origin, age distribution, and etiopathology.

The primary form is most prevalent in children and ranges from sole hematological disorders to severe life-threatening infections.

- Kostman syndrome (Severe infantile agranulocytosis)

- Chediak - Higashi syndrome

- Cyclic neutropenia

- Shwachman-Diamond-Oski syndrome

- Reticular dysgenesis

- Dyskeratosis congenita

- Leukocyte adhesion deficiency

- Chronic granulomatous disease

- Hyper IgM syndrome

- Common variable immunodeficiency

- Sever combiner immunodeficiency

The secondary form is more prevalent in adults and divided into the following categories according to etiologies;

**1. Systemic autoimmune disorders**

-  Chronic autoimmune hepatitis (Primary biliary cirrhosis)

-  Granulomatosis with polyangiitis

-  Inflammatory bowel disease

-  Rheumatoid arthritis (Felty syndrome)

-  Sjogren syndrome

-  Systemic sclerosis

-  Systemic lupus erythematosus

**2. Infectious disorders**

- Helicobacter pylori

- HIV

- Parvovirus B19

**3. Malignancies**

- Wilm tumor

- Hodgkin lymphoma

**4. Neurological disorders**

- Multiple sclerosis

**5. Posttransplant**

- Stem cell

- Bone marrow

- Kidney

**6. Medications**

- Aminopyrine

- Cephalosporin

- Fludarabine

- Hydralazine

- Heavy metals

- Procainamide

- Propylthiouracil

- Quinidine

- Rituximab

- Sulfonamides

Along with these disorders, certain congenital immunological diseases, bone marrow failure syndromes, and metabolic diseases in the pediatric population can also lead to chronic neutropenia and recurring infections through different mechanisms. Usually, in the pediatric population, autoimmune neutropenia presents with a minor hematological abnormality in the majority, but it presents, but in a few patients, it leads to life-threatening and recurrent infections. One of the causes of the secondary form of AIN is antineutrophil antibodies, which lead to neutropenia by peripheral destruction, bonemarrow inhibition, or apoptosis of cells.
