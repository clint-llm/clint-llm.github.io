When the blood supply to the brain is reduced, oxygen and glucose delivery will be impaired. This stimulates an anaerobic type of respiration and reduces the production of adenosine triphosphate. The sodium-potassium pump will fail, and there will be an increased production of lactate. An influx of sodium into the cell results in massive depolarization, which in turn leads to an increased concentration of intracellular calcium.

- Mitochondrial injury leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species

- Activation of nitric oxide, caspases, and calpains

- Disruption of protein synthesis
