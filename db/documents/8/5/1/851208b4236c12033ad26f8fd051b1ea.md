Rickettsialpox was initially described in New York City and has been reported in other US towns and states. Cases have been reported from all continents including Europe (Croatia), Asia (Korea), Africa (South Africa), and South America. Rickettsialpox has been described in intravenous drug users and the homeless population. A high seroprevalence of R. akari has been reported in intravenous drug users in Baltimore and Los Angeles County. In a review of the literature on the seroprevalence of vector-borne diseases amongst the urban homeless, R. akari was the second most common infection after Bartonella quintana.

At present, rickettsialpox is not a notifiable disease. Rodents are the reservoir. The colorless, bloodsucking mouse mite transmits infection from rodents to humans. In laboratory settings, infection due to inhalation has occurred. The usual annual incidence of rickettsialpox in New York City is about five cases.

Interestingly, the mouse mite does not bite humans when there are many mice. Any attempt to lower a mouse population increases bites to the humans, thereby increasing the transmission back to baseline. The incubation period is about seven to 14 days.
