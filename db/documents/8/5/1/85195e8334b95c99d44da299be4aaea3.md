Dental plaque is an example of a biofilm, which occurs naturally on the teeth structures. Dental biofilm has a diverse composition that stays in microbial homeostasis when there are healthy oral conditions. When this microbial homeostasis breaks down, acid-producing and acid-tolerating bacteria prevail. The microorganisms cause a decrease in pH, thanks to the breakdown of monosaccharides and disaccharides obtained from sugar-rich foods, leading to enamel demineralization. The most associated pathogens are mutans streptococci and lactobacilli

Infection can then invade the pulp, causing pulpitis and bacterial flora transition from mainly aerobic to anaerobic. Most dental infections are polymicrobial infections, and they can spread towards the alveolar bone, causing a periapical abscess.

On the other hand, biofilms can penetrate gingival epithelium, causing an inflammatory response with neutrophil infiltration and subsequent destruction of periodontal tissues, leading to periodontal disease. Infection can directly spread to adjacent osseous and deep neck structures causing fascial space infections
