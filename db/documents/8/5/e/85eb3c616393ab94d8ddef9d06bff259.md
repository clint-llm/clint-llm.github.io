Differential diagnosis includes posterior fossa abnormalities that may be associated with hydrocephalus sometimes which commonly may present in a similar way to DWM; these include retrocerebellar arachnoid cysts, cystic hygroma, Blake’s pouch cyst, mega cisterna magna, and vermian hypoplasia. Additionally, several syndromes correlate with DWM, such as Aase-Smith, cerebro-oculo-muscular syndrome, Coffin-Siris, Cornelia de Lange and Aicardi.

Retrocerebellar arachnoid cysts may be large enough to cause compression of cerebellar hemispheres and fourth ventricle.

Blake’s cyst presents as a retrocerebellar fluid collection, with a medial line communication to the fourth ventricle.

Mega cisterna magna. However, the fluid collection is located posteroinferior to a normally developed cerebellum.

Several comorbidities may also correlate with DWM, including syndromic and non-syndromic, CNS and non-CNS anomalies, chromosomal abnormalities, cardiovascular conditions, mental illness, and severe intellectual disability.
