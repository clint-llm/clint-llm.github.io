Intrapleural pressure is the term for pressure within the intrapleural space; alveolar pressure is pressure within the alveoli. As both the intrapleural and alveolar pressures become increasingly negative due to the expansion of the chest cavity during inspiration, air from the atmosphere flows into the lungs, which allows the lung volume to increase and participate in gas exchange.
