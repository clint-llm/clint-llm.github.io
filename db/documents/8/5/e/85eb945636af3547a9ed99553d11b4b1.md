The diagnosis and management of a cerebellar hemorrhage are with an interprofessional team that includes a combination of the following: emergency clinician, neurosurgeon, neurologist, primary care provider, intensivist, and acute practice provider. The nurses who usually monitor these patients have specialty training in neuroscience and know what signs and symptoms to watch for the progression of the disorder. They must discuss abnormal findings with the clinicians as quickly as possible. The interprofessional team also includes providers and pharmacists, which is considered the best approach to the management of these cases for optimal care and outcomes. The presentation of cerebellar hemorrhage may be subtle to a patient in extremis and is often not easy, requiring intensive management and treatment. The majority of patients are managed in a critical care setting with frequent neurologic assessments, blood pressure control, electrolyte, and intravenous fluid management, and supportive care. Management requires treatment with multiple pharmacologic agents. The pharmacist should manage medication reconciliation and consider potential drug interactions reporting to the team concerning drug interactions. [Level 5]

The outcome depends on the severity of the bleeding, the presence of neurological deficit, the age of the patient, and other associated co-morbidity. An interprofessional team approach to the evaluation and education of the patient and family will lead to the best outcomes.
