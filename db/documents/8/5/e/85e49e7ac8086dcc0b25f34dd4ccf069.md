The first step in the evaluation of a patient in atrial tachycardia is to obtain a 12 lead EKG. Ideally, the patient should also have a baseline EKG to compare against the abnormal. By reading the EKG, you should be able to determine the type of atrial tachycardia. Additionally, the morphology and the pattern of the P waves in the EKG could help you spot the location or locations of the origin of the arrhythmia. With a positive or biphasic P wave in aVL, one can infer right atrial origin (88% sensitivity, 79% specificity). With a positive P wave in lead V1, one can assume left atrial origin (93% sensitivity, 88% sensitivity).

Once the EKG is obtained, and the arrhythmia is determined, basic labs should be drawn to work up any underlying pathology that could be causing this arrhythmia. Additionally, an echocardiogram should be performed to look for any structural heart defects that could be causing this problem.

If the atrial tachycardia is found to be primary in nature, electrophysiology mapping should be done to precisely determine the origin and pattern to the arrhythmia. Mapping is crucial if the patient wants to undergo an ablation procedure to resolve their arrhythmia.

Another option, typically for patients with paroxysmal events, is home telemetry. This process would be useful in patients who are symptomatic but have a normal EKG, lab workup and echocardiogram. 24-hour monitoring can catch the arrhythmia and provide valuable information to its etiology.
