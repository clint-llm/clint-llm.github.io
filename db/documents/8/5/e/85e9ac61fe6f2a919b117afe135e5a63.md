Actinic keratoses (AKs) are premalignant cutaneous lesions that may progress to squamous cell carcinoma. They are a common skin condition and develop in sun-exposed skin of individuals with cumulative sun exposure. To avoid the risk of malignant transformation associated with this condition, AKs should be diagnosed, treated, and preventive strategies implemented. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of AKs and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk factors associated with the development of actinic keratoses.
- Describe the common physical exam findings associated with actinic keratoses.
- Summarize the lesion-directed and field-directed treatment options available for actinic keratoses.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to optimize accurate diagnosis and institute prompt treatment for patients affected by actinic keratoses.
