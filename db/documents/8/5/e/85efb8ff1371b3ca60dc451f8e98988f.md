With a wide variety of drugs available to treat heart rhythm abnormalities and substantial information regarding them, a newly graduated physician or junior doctor can become overwhelmed regarding which agent to use, especially among the older agents. This is why antiarrhythmic therapy should utilize the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team. With help from a pharmacist, a doctor can choose whether disopyramide is indicated or contraindicated to use based on the patient's unique characteristics. When disopyramide has already been administered, a coordinative effort between the clinician and a nurse is necessary. A nurse can notify the ordering clinician regarding the patient's response to the drug, whether other agents are needed or not, and when side effects/adverse events prevent its use. These are just a few examples of why a collaborative approach of the interprofessional healthcare team is needed. The use of disopyramide is already approved by several guidelines (HRA/AHA/ACC/EHRS), and its indicated as a third-line agent for the treatment of life-threatening arrhythmia (VT/VF) and atrial fibrillation, especially sleep-induced or vagal induced.
