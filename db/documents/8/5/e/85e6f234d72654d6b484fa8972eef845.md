NVG is often refractory to treatment and carries a poor prognosis in terms of IOP control and maintenance of vision. A delay in the presentation to the ophthalmic clinic is associated with worse outcomes for the patient. The patients with NVG need to seek prompt treatment from the ophthalmic caregiver.

Vulnerable patients with risk factors like DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, carotid vascular diseases, and ocular tumors should be counseled regarding the symptoms of NVG. The ophthalmologists giving the primary care to the patients with NVG must not hesitate to refer to a referral center with treatment such as GDD surgeries and intravitreal anti-VEGF injections. The patients must follow the strict follow-up protocol, as multiple visits are often required. The patients must be counseled about the guarded prognosis related to the control of IOP and visual gain.
