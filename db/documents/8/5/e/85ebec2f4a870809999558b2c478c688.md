Laboratory studies are not indicated in the diagnosis of cervical discogenic pain syndrome. Radiograph imaging is usually indicated in patients with a history of trauma or if there is any concern for a possible fracture or instability on clinical examinations. In cervical discogenic pain syndrome, radiographic findings may be normal. It may show degenerative changes, but there is little correlation with symptomatic vs. asymptomatic individuals based solely on these findings. Although MRI may identify degenerative cervical discs and offer more clarity and physiological information, it still cannot differentiate a disc that is pathologically painful from an asymptomatic degenerative disc.

The most important adjunct in the evaluation ofÂ CDPS is cervical provocation discography. It is an image-guided procedure where a contrast agent is injected into the nucleus pulposus of the suspected intervertebral disc. This test not only identifies the level but can also depict internal derangements as well.
