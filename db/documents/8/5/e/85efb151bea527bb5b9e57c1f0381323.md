The distribution of fluid throughout the body can be broken down into two general categories: intracellular fluid and extracellular fluid. Intracellular fluid is approximately 40% of the total body weight. It is the total space within cells primarily defined as the cytoplasm of cells. In general, intracellular fluids are stable and do not readily adjust to rapid changes. This space is where many chemical reactions occur. As such, it is important to maintain an appropriate osmolality. The extracellular fluid comprises approximately 20% of total body weight and further subcategorizes as plasma at approximately 5% of body weight and interstitial space, which is approximately 12% of body weight. Additional fluid spaces are possible in pathological scenarios and are categorized as a transudate or exudate based on location and etiology.

The exact chemical composition of body fluid is highly variable. This is dependent on which portion of the body, as well as which organ of the body, contains the fluid. Extracellular fluid and interstitial fluid are similar in composition. Extracellular spaces contain high concentrations of sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and proteins but are relatively lower in potassium, magnesium, and phosphate. Interstitial fluids physiologically tend to have a low concentration of proteins. Intracellular fluids tend to be inversed with high levels of phosphate, magnesium, potassium, and proteins but lower sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate.
