CHARGE syndrome is a pleiotropic disorder, including coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, retarded growth, genital abnormalities, ear anomalies, and deafness. A constant feature in CHARGE syndrome is semicircular canal hypoplasia ensuing in vestibular areflexia.

A detailed history and a consideration of prenatal, neonatal, and childhood presentations are required. The prenatal performance needs to be assessed when poor fetal development, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), cleft lip or cleft palate, or a congenital heart defect is found in utero.

Neonates with CHARGE syndrome have multiple life-threatening medical conditions like small for gestational age, unable to pass nasogastric tube due to choanal atresia, dysmorphic features, and respiratory distress. Feeding difficulties are a significant cause of morbidity in all age groups.
