Yersinia. enterocolitica is serotyped into around 60 serogroups by their O lipopolysaccharide surface antigens. Most subtypes are nonpathogenic to humans. Serogroups harmful to humans are O:3 and O:9, which are most common in Europe, and serogroup O:8, which is most prominent in the United States. Animals and humans infected with this bacteria and who never develop symptoms or convalesce from a symptomatic episode may become carriers. They will harbor the Y. enterocolitica bacteria in their GI tract.
