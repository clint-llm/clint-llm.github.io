Various factors merit consideration to match the donor kidney with the recipient, as the donor kidney acts as an alloantigen. In general, when transplanting tissue or cells from a genetically different donor to the graft recipient, the alloantigen of the donor induces an immune response in the recipient against the graft. This response can destroy the graft if not controlled. The whole process is called allograft rejection. This activity describes and defines the types of rejections and the evaluation and management of this condition and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with renal transplant rejection.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of renal transplant rejection.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of renal transplant rejection.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for renal transplant rejection.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the care of renal transplant rejection and improve outcomes.
