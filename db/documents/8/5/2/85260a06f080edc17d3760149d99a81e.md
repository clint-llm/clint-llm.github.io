The treated fracture usually have a good prognosis. Some patients may demonstrate loss of terminal extension about 10 to 15 degrees, but this is not clinically significant. Dislocation can cause compression of nerve or vascular, and early management of this condition will minimize the complication. Bursitis patients also have a good prognosis. For infectious bursitis, a systemic infection may happen but at very low risk.
