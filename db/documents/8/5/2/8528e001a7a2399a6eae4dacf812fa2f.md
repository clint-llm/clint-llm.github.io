Pulmonary complications and malignancy mainly determine the prognosis. Antibiotics usage and IVIG therapy have decreased the mortality from bacterial infections.

Patients with THI with low IgM and IgA levels were found to have a slow recovery, whereas those who breastfed for longer duration had an early recovery. In patients with Hyper-IgM syndrome, mortality is secondary to opportunistic infections, malignancies, and liver/biliary tract disease.
