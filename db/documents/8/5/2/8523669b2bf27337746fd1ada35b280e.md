The technique of volar splinting of the upper extremity can be used to immobilize hard and soft tissue injuries as well as painful non-traumatic conditions. Examples of hard tissue skeletal injuries include distal radius fracture, Colles fractures, and metacarpal and carpal fractures (except the first metacarpal and trapezius). The basic guideline regarding splinting of skeletal lesions is that it must immobilize a joint above and a joint below the lesion. The exceptions to this rule are metaphyseal, such as Colles or Smith fractures which effectively act like injuries within the joint. This activity describes the technique, indications, contraindications of colar splinting and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with hand and wrist injuires.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the technique of volar splinting.
- Describe the indications for volar splinting.
- Reviewthe clinical benefits of volar splinting.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care by use of volar splinting for hand injuries.
