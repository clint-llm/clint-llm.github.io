Lithium can cause several adverse effects. Typically the side effects are dose-related. Notable side effects include:

- Cardiac: Bradycardia, flattened or inverted T waves, heart block, and sick sinus syndrome.

- CNS: Confusion, memory problems, new or worsening tremor, hyperreflexia, clonus, slurred speech, ataxia, stupor, delirium, coma, and seizures (rarely). These effects are theoretically due to excess action on the same sites that mediate therapeuticÂ action.

- Renal: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with polyuria and polydipsia. These side effects are due to lithium's action on ion transport.

- Hematologic: Leukocytosis and aplastic anemia

- Gastroenterologic: Diarrhea and nausea

- Endocrinal: Euthyroid goiter or hypothyroid goiter

- Other: Acne, rash, and weight gain. Lithium-induced weight gain is more common in women than in men.

Some patients on haloperidol and lithium may develop an encephalopathic syndrome similar to neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
