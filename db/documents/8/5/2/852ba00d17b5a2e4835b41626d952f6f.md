Most cases of pneumomediastinum are spontaneous. Therefore, abstinence from smoking or recreational drug use are a few measures that can appreciably lower the risk of developing this condition. Avoid strenuous exercises like weight lifting. Avoid activities like flying, parachuting, scuba diving, playing woodwind instruments. Maintain good asthma control. There is a paucity of literature regarding when those with pneumomediastinum may fly or return to contact sports. However, it is generally advisable that patients refrain from flying or contact sports until asymptomatic.
