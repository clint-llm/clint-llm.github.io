There are various clinical conditions that can lead to the development of LVH. The most common of these include the following:

- Essential hypertension

- Renal artery stenosis

- Athletic heart with physiological LVH

- Aortic valvar stenosis

- Coarctation of the aorta

- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without or with outflow tract obstruction (HOCM)

- Subaortic stenosis (left ventricular outflow tract obstruction by muscle or membrane)

- Aortic regurgitation

- Mitral regurgitation

- Dilated cardiomyopathy

- Ventricular septal defect

- Infiltrative cardiac processes (e.g., Amyloidosis, Fabry disease, Danon disease)

Hypertension and aortic valve stenosis are the most common causes of LVH. In both of these conditions, the heart is contracting against an elevated afterload. Another cause is increased filling of the left ventricle inducing diastolic overload, which is the underlying mechanism for eccentric LVH in patients with regurgitant valvular lesions such as aortic regurgitation or mitral regurgitation and also seen in dilated cardiomyopathy. Coronary artery disease has been demonstrated to play a role in the pathogenesis of LVH, as the normal myocardium tries to compensate for tissue that has become ischemic or infarcted. Athletic heart with physiological LVH is a relatively benign condition. Intensive training results in increased left ventricular muscle mass, wall thickness, and chamber size, but the systolic function and diastolic function remain normal.
