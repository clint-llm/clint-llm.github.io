The presentation can vary depending on the location and subtype of scleritis and can be unilateral or bilateral.

**Anterior**

- Anterior from the rectus muscle's limbus-insertion

- Occurs in 98% of cases

- Mild to moderate pain and tenderness; worse at night

- Pain with eye movement

- A blue-violet hue of deep vessels; best seen in daylight or natural illumination

- Photophobia, tearing, and possibly decreased vision

- No vessel blanching with the installation of 2.5% topical phenylephrine

**Diffuse**

- Most common (45% to 61%)

- Extensive scleral edema; congestion of deep and superficial vessels

- Can be localized or encompass the entire anterior sclera

**Nodular**

- Multiple, well-defined, and non-moveable nodules

- Scleral edema and congestion of vessels

- Usually more localized

**Necrotizing**

- With inflammation – intense congestion of vessels

- Severe pain

- Most severe form with the worst prognosis

- Highest association with a systemic disease

- Scleral thinning and exposure of choroid possible

- Inflammation can spread to other ocular tissues such as the cornea, ciliary body, or trabecular meshwork

**Necrotizing Without inflammation (Scleromalacia perforans)**

- Severe scleral thinning- with visible choroid

- Can be asymptomatic or can have reduced acuity resulting from corneal astigmatism caused by the scleral thinning

**Posterior**

- Behind the insertion of the rectus muscles

- Occurs in 2% of cases

- Can occur in conjunction with anterior scleritis

- May present with decreased vision, with or without ocular pain

- Retinal detachments, optic nerve swelling, and cotton wools spots can be seen on dilated examination

- Diffuse or nodular subtypes can be differentiated with B-scan, CT), or MRI

- B-scan ultrasound displays thickening of the posterior sclera (greater than 2millimeters); retrobulbar thickening and fluid surrounding the optic nerve create a characteristic “T” sign

- Diffuse - Diffuse thickening of sclera and choroid

- Nodular- Scleral nodules seen on B-scan
