Building a curriculum that utilizes simulation can be a daunting task. Several factors must be taken into account; using a framework that takes into consideration instructional design, learning theories, and methods of feedback and assessment are crucial.

Instructional design is the process of developing the actual curriculum and includes a step-wise approach once the simulation has been determined to be the instructional medium. The simulation modality is the next item chosen. Modalities include computer-generated simulation, procedural skills (i.e., suturing, chest tube thoracostomy, thoracentesis), the environment in which the simulation will actually occur, either a designated simulation space or in the actual clinical environment, and lastly, the use of standardized patients, individuals who are trained to portray patients/family members/colleagues. Following modality, the curriculum builder decides on the instructional method. This method can either be self-directed or instructor-led. It is important to note that the simulation literature demonstrates mixed results on the effectiveness of self-directed learner assessment. Finally, the presentation phase incorporates decisions about fidelity (i.e., realism) during the simulation.
