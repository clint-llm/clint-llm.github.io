Radiological evaluation appears to be the most useful evaluation tool. The most commonly used techniques include ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Sonographic features include a lobulated mass with varied echotexture. These findings are non-specific and may not help to differentiate from other hepatic neoplasms. The central scar is not easily discernible and if present can be seen as an area of increased echogenicity.

Computed Tomography usually shows a single tumor with well-demarcated margins, with the majority of these tumors showing decreased attenuation. Greater than 70% of the patients demonstrate a calcified central scar. Liver mass CT protocol commonly involves different acquisitions performed at different time points following contrast administration intravenously to highlight features in the arterial, portal venous, and delayed phases. Greater than 80% of the patients demonstrate masses that have increased contrast avidity in the arterial phase reflecting the high blood supply of these tumors. Almost half of these masses enhance similar to the background liver in the venous phase and about one-third of the tumors have higher contrast avidity. Almost two-thirds of these masses enhance similar to the background liver on the delayed phase and can be difficult to differentiate. The central fibrous scar that can be seen in these masses can show contrast avidity in this later phase.

Magnetic resonance imaging shows a decreased signal on T1 weighted sequences in about two-thirds of the patients. The fibrous nature of the scar often demonstrates decreased signals on both T1 and T2 weighted sequences.  The enhancement characteristics of the tumor and the central scar are similar to the characteristics described above on CT imaging.

In addition to the above findings, radiological evaluation plays an important role in detecting additional distant disease that is not apparent otherwise.
