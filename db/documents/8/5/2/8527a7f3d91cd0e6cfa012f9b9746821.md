In patients with this disease process, who receive adequate and appropriate treatment including timely operative intervention, mortality remains exceedingly high. Bowel necrosis without appropriate intervention and surgical management carries mortality approaching 100%. The pooled, operative mortality rate for acute mesenteric ischemia has been reported at 47%, and patients who survive the initial event have a high probability of post-operative complication.
