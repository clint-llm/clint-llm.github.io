Before anchoring on the diagnosis of CHS, it is important to rule in or rule out other important diseases against the patient’s age and other risk factors, many of which may require urgent surgical and medical management. Certainly, when discussing abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting, gastrointestinal pathologies often leap to the forefront of one’s mind, including:

- Gastritis

- Gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD)

- Peptic ulcer disease (PUD)

- Appendicitis

- Diverticulitis

- Sigmoid volvulus

- Biliary colic

- Pancreatitis

- Nephrolithiasis

- Urinary tract infection

In female patients of reproductive age additional diagnoses in the differential include:

- Ectopic pregnancy

- Ovarian torsion

In older patients, especially those with hypertension, cardiovascular illnesses such as aortic pathology and atypical coronary artery syndromes may present as vague abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

A variety of toxidromes and infectious etiologies, as well as non-penetrating traumatic injuries, will have this presentation. Neurologic syndromes such as strokes to the area postrema may result in nausea and vomiting, compounded by abdominal pain from forceful vomiting, which a patient may report as abdominal cramping. Psychiatric causes, likewise, may cause vomiting syndromes, as well as a variety of self, reported aggravating and relieving factors which the astute clinician must dissect.
