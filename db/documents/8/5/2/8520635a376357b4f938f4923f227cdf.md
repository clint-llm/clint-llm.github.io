Key points for multi-disciplinary care of pediatric patients with UDT:

- The patient's pediatricianÂ should perform regular testicular exams to ensure the testes are in the scrotum.

- The pediatrician should refer the patient to a pediatric surgeon by six months of age if testicles have not descended yet.

- Patients with a history of UDT must learn how to perform regular self-exams as they have a significantly higher risk of developing testicular cancer.
