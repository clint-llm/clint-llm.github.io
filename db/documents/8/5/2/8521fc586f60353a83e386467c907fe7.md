Lidocaine is a local anesthetic drug that produces transient loss of sensory, motor, and autonomic function when the drug is injected or applied in proximity to neural tissue. It is the most common local anesthetic and is used in almost all medical specialties.

Applied either by injection, inhalation, or as a topical agent to provide anesthesia, lidocaine has a good safety margin before reaching toxic blood levels. Since it can be applied in various forms to the same patients, however, care must be taken to keep track of the total dose given to minimize its systemic toxicity. In addition, clinicians should take into account the dose of any other local anesthetics that may have been administered to the same patient, as toxic doses appear to be additive. Lidocaine toxicity is not only determined by the total dose (usually 4.5 mg/kg) but also by the rate of absorption, which is dependent on the blood flow of that tissue. To reduce blood flow to the injection site and, therefore, the rate of absorption, vasoconstrictors such as epinephrine 1:200000 are frequently used and may increase the toxic dose to 7 mg/kg.

Lidocaine toxicity to muscles and peripheral or neuraxial nerves can occur locally at the site of injection. Transient neurologic symptoms (TNS) after high-concentration lidocaine spinal anesthetics have been described multiple times and have led to either reducing the concentration of the dose or switching to a different agent.

In addition to direct nerve toxicity, systemic toxicity affecting the brain and/or cardiac muscle can lead to sudden and dramatic changes in the patient’s vital signs.

Finally, there are the side effects of a relative overdose at the site of injection, which can be quite dramatic. Examples include total spinal anesthesia or subdural injection of the drug that can cause severe hemodynamic compromise such as hypotension or bradycardia up to a cardiac and respiratory arrest.
