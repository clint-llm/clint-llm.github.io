This activity reviews the FDA-class 1 drug 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also known as MDMA, ecstasy, or molly. The drug is known to promote a sense of euphoria and facilitate empathy and communication. Unfortunately, it can have dangerous effects on the cardiovascular, neurologic, renal, and hepatic systems and can lead to devastating consequences, including death. This activity reviews the potential for 3,4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine toxicity, treatment approaches to patients who have overdosed on it, and the role of the interprofessional care team in improving outcomes for patients that use 3,4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the signs and symptoms that a patient with 3,4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine toxicity might exhibit.
- Outline the treatment strategy for a patient with 3,4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine toxicity. 
- Identify rapid sequence intubation agents that should be avoided if a patient with 3,4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine toxicity presents in a hyper-adrenergic state or if rhabdomyolysis is a consideration. 
- Explain why 3,4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine toxicity requires an interprofessional team approach.
