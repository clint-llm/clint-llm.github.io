The Gd gene codes for the G6PD enzyme. This gene is located on the long arm of the X chromosome and therefore follows X-linked inheritance. Deficiency of G6PD may be due to mutations that change the protein structure and therefore reduce its activity, or the amount of enzyme produced. There are currently 186 known human G6PD mutations, and most are point mutations affecting a single nucleotide. None of the mutation patterns seen in humans cause complete inactivation of G6PD since this would be lethal to a developing embryo.
