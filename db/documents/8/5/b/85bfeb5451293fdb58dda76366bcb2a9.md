The rhomboid major and minor are a group of deep intrinsic shoulder muscles that, together with the sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, pectoralis muscles, latissimus dorsi, and serratus anterior, form the shoulder girdle. Furthermore, the serratus anterior, trapezius, and rhomboid major and minor work with the rhomboids to anchor the scapula and prevent winging. Additionally, the serratus anterior is the antagonist muscle group to the rhomboids.
