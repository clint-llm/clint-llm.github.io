Contraindications to rosiglitazone include patients with active liver disease, hypersensitivity, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, diabetic ketoacidosis, and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

Strict contraindications to the administration of rosiglitazone include patients with congestive heart failure with New York Heart Association functional class III or IV. Thiazolidinediones, including rosiglitazone, can exacerbate congestive heart failure. After starting this drug, and adjusting the dose, observe patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure (weight gain, edema, dyspnea), which would indicate discontinuation of therapy. Combination with insulin in patients with congestive heart failure functional class I and II may increase the risk of other cardiovascular effects. Peroxisome proliferator-activated (PPAR) gamma agonists can cause fluid retention when used in combination with insulin.

It has been reported not sufficient data in pregnant women to determine the associated risk for congenital defects and miscarriage.
