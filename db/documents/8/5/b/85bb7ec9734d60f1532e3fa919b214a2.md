- Peanuts are the most commonly aspirated foods, followed most often by items like marbles, and small rubber balls

- Hotdogs and hard candies are the most common food items, and latex balloons are the most common non-food items to cause fatal aspiration

- Rapid diagnosis and retrieval lead to the best outcomes in these patients

- Less likely to have upper airway (laryngeal or tracheal) obstruction than lower, however, emergent airway control is required with upper obstruction due to the potential for complete ventilatory compromise

- Lower airway obstruction necessitates a good history and physical especially in children and developmentally delayed individuals, and suspicion for foreign body aspiration - inspiratory-expiratory chest x-ray, pre-op lab work, otolaryngology consultation, and antibiotics based on clinical picture and timeframe

- Definitive management of known radiopaque or suspected radiolucent foreign body is rigid bronchoscopy under anesthesia. 

- If the object has acutely been aspirated then retrieval and normal post-op recommendations are sufficient
- If there have been clinical signs of infection, then antibiotic treatment for post-obstructive infection can be initiated
