**General Considerations**

- As described earlier, post-acute COVID-19 syndrome can be considered a multi-system disorder manifesting commonly with respiratory, cardiovascular, hematologic, and neuropsychiatry symptoms either alone or in combination. As such, the therapy should be individualized and should incorporate an interprofessional approach directed towards addressing both the clinical and psychological aspects of this disorder.

- Given the increased clinical awareness of this syndrome, Post-COVID care clinics providing multidisciplinary assessment and resources for patients recovering from COVID-19 are opening at major medical centers across the United States.

- Treatment for coexisting conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension should be optimized.

- Patients should be educated about self-monitoring at home with FDA-approved devices that include a pulse oximeter, blood pressure, and blood glucose monitors.

- Patients should be encouraged to consume a healthy balanced diet, maintain proper sleep hygiene, limit alcohol use and quit smoking.

- Simple analgesia with acetaminophen as needed should be considered

- If tolerated, a structured exercise program consisting of aerobic and resistance components must be advised, provided they are no other contraindications.

**Pulmonary**

- Post COVID-19 patients with persistent/residual pulmonary symptoms after recovery should be seen by a pulmonologist as early as possible for evaluation and close follow-up.

- Patients with persistent symptoms may benefit from enrollment into a pulmonary rehabilitation program which is key for faster clinical recovery and vaccination against influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

- Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and 6MWT should be considered if clinically indicated.

- The role of steroids in post-acute COVID-19 is unknown, and data evaluating its effectiveness in post-COVID-19 patients is limited. A small study evaluating COVID-19 patients four weeks after discharge demonstratedÂ rapid and significant improvement with early initiation of steroids.

**Cardiovascular**

- Post COVID-19 patients with persistent cardiac symptoms after recovery should be followed closely by a cardiologist.

- Cardiac function tests such as EKG, echocardiography must be considered to rule out arrhythmias, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease.

- Additionally, given the increased incidence of myocarditis in patients with COVID-19, an MRI of the heart can be considered to evaluate for myocardial fibrosis or scarring if clinically indicated.

**Hematologic**

- Although COVID-19 is associated with a prothrombotic state, there is currently no consensus regarding the benefit of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in the outpatient setting. However, current CHEST guidelines recommend anticoagulation therapy for a minimum duration of 3 months in COVID-19 patients who develop proximal DVT or PE.

**Neuropsychiatric**

- Patients should be screened for common psychological issues such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, PTSD and should be referred to behavioral health specialists if indicated.

- Given the vast neurological symptoms associated with this syndrome, neurology evaluation should be considered early.

- In addition to routine laboratory workup as described above, additional laboratory tests such as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), TSH, thiamine, folate, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin B12 must be checked to evaluate for other contributing metabolic conditions.

- EEG and EMG be considered if there are concerns for seizures and paresthesias, respectively.
