Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign salivary gland neoplasm. In most studies, it represents 45-75% of all salivary gland tumors; the annual incidence is approximately two to three and a half cases per 100,000 population. Pleomorphic adenoma occurs in individuals of all ages; however, it is most common in the third to sixth decades. Pleomorphic adenoma incidence is slightly more in females than in males (2:1 ratio). Pleomorphic adenomas account for 70-80% of benign salivary gland tumors and are especially common in the parotid gland.

- Parotid gland: 84%

- Submandibular gland: 8%

- Minor salivary glands: 6.5%
