Only a minority of patients with Salzmann nodular degeneration (SND) have symptoms, which, when present, are foreign body sensation (FBS), irritation, tearing, or photophobia.

Nodule location influences patients' primary complaint, whereby more central nodules are associated with decreased or distorted vision and more peripheral nodules with FBS. Visual distortions are caused by the involvement of visual axis by the nodules, irregular astigmatism, hyperopia, or mechanical tear film disturbances.
