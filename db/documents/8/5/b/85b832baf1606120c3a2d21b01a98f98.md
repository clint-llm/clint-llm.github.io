The management of VSD is best accomplished by an interprofessional team that includes a pediatrician, cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, ICU nurse, physical therapist, and social worker. Parents and patients need to be educated about the need to follow up. Some children with perimembranous VSD may develop aortic valve prolapse and require surgery. Finally, all unrepaired VSDs have the potential to increase pulmonary vascular resistance leading to Eisenmenger syndrome. At this stage, except for a heart and lung transplant, there is no other viable therapy. With a marked shortage in organs for transplantation, the majority of these patients succumb to progressive right heart failure and cyanosis. [Level 5]

**Outcomes**

Young children who remain asymptomatic and have a small VSD have a good outcome. However, the presence of anemia, infection, or endocarditis may trigger symptoms in these children. Outcomes in people with a large VSD are poor if the defect is not repaired. The continued left to right shunt eventually leads to the development of pulmonary hypertension and Eisenmenger syndrome. Today, in North America most infants have the VSD repaired electively within the first two years of life. The mortality is less than 1%, and most patients have a normal lifespan.
