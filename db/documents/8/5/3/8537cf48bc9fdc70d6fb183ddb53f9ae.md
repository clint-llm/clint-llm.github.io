Management of patients with incomplete abortion requires a full interprofessional healthcare team as soon as the patient presents. She will need nursing, laboratory technicians, radiology, pharmacists, and other specialists such as obstetrics and psychiatry. IV lines need to be placed, and blood work such as beta-hCG, blood type with Rh, complete blood count, and complete metabolic panel. In addition, she will likely need IV fluids and medicine for pain or nausea.

A pelvic ultrasound determines fetal viability versus the presence or absence of fetal tissues. Consultation to obstetrics will be done while the patient is in the emergency department, and this will help with the patient disposition and follow-up. Consultation should be placed to psychiatry after the abortion is completed to manage feelings of guilt, depression, anxiety, grief, and post-traumatic stress disorder that can be common.
