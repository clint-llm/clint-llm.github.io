Given the broad clinical presentation of tethered cord syndrome involving multiple systemic manifestations, including neurologic, orthopedic, dermatologic, and urologic, the differential diagnosis for the presenting signs/symptoms of tethered cord syndrome is vast and beyond the scope of this review article.

Radiographically, the differential diagnosis for the underlying etiology contributing to the tethered cord syndrome can be thought of similarly to the underlying etiologies of tethered cord syndrome, which include congenital and acquired etiologies. The differential diagnosis for the congenital etiologies of tethered cord syndrome includes dermal sinus tract, myelomeningocele, lipomyelomeningocele, fibrous or fibro-adipose filum terminale, and diastematomyelia.

The differential diagnosis for the acquired etiologies of tethered cord syndrome includes spinal cord tumors and scar formation from prior surgical intervention, infection, or hemorrhage.
