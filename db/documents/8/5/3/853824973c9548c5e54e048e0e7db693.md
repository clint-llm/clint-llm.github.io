# Continuing Education Activity

Bacterial vaginosis is a condition caused by an overgrowth of normal vaginal flora. Most commonly, this presents clinically with increased vaginal discharge that has a fish-like odor. The discharge itself is typically thin and either gray or white. After being diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis, women have an increased risk of acquiring other sexually transmitted infections (STI), and pregnant women have an increased risk of early delivery. This activity reviews the cause, presentation, and diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of bacterial vaginosis.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with vaginosis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for bacterial vaginosis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with bacterial vaginosis.

# Introduction

Bacterial vaginosis is a condition caused by an overgrowth of normal vaginal flora.

# Etiology

Although bacterial vaginosis is not considered a sexually transmitted infection, the role of transmissibility is yet to be completely understood. The spread of bacteria among individuals through sexual intercourse may alter the natural balance of bacterial flora within the vagina, and this imbalance appears to lead to the development of bacterial vaginosis.Lactobacilli with an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria.Gardnerella vaginalis between women who have sex with women, either via direct contact of mucus membranes or via shared sex toys.

Historically, bacterial vaginosis was called Gardnerella vaginitis because it was believed that this bacterium was the cause of this condition.

# Epidemiology

Bacterial vaginosis is the most common vaginal infection found in women of reproductive age and is estimated to occur in anywhere from 5 to 70% of women.

Epidemiological data showed that women are more likely to report bacterial vaginosis if they have had multiple sexual partners, are unmarried, began to engage in intercourse at a young age, if they are commercial sex workers, or practice regularly douching.

# Pathophysiology

Bacterial vaginosis is caused by an imbalance of the naturally occurring vaginal flora, characterized by both a change in the most common type of bacteria present as well as an increase in the total number of bacteria present.Lactobacilli species dominate normal vaginal microbiota.Gardnerella
vaginalis, creating a biofilm that then allows other opportunistic bacteria to grow within the vagina.

The association between BV and an increased risk for future STIs stems from the fact that BV allows the potential for other vaginal pathogens to gain access to the upper genital tract.

# Histopathology

The hallmark of this diagnosis relies on the examination of vaginal fluid on a wet mount under a microscope.

# History and Physical

Most women with bacterial vaginosis present with a complaint of malodorous vaginal discharge.

The clinician should elicit pertinent history regarding the risk factors for this disease, as well as a previous history of bacterial vaginosis infections.

A proper physical exam must include a pelvic exam to examine the characteristics of the vaginal discharge and to help exclude other similarly presenting diseases, including candidiasis, cervicitis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes simplex virus, and trichomoniasis.

It is important to assess for fever, pelvic pain, and a history of sexually transmitted infections to rule out the more serious conditions that remain on the differential diagnosis.

Since clue cells are thought to be the most reliable diagnostic sign of bacterial vaginosis, it will be necessary to examine the vaginal fluid under a microscope.

# Evaluation

Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is typically suggested clinically and confirmed by obtaining a vaginal swab of the cervical region or discharge and creating a wet mount slide to review under a microscope.

In clinical practice, bacterial vaginosis is often diagnosed by the Amsel criteria.

Alternatively, a gram-stain of the vaginal fluid can be done to examine the predominant strain of bacteria. This technique is referred to as the Nugent process.

# Treatment / Management

Although up to 30% of bacterial vaginosis cases may resolve without treatment, this condition can also be treated with either clindamycin or metronidazole.

Some studies have suggested that pregnant women who are symptomatic from bacterial vaginosis should be treated with clindamycin before 22 weeks of gestation to reduce the risk of labor before 37 weeks of gestation.

Unfortunately, it has been shown that recurrence may occur in up to 80% of women after treatment.

# Differential Diagnosis

A proper physical exam can help to narrow down the differential diagnosis and help to exclude other similarly presenting diseases, such as herpes simplex virus.

# Pearls and Other Issues

Untreated BV can lead to increased risk of STIs, including HIV and pregnancy complications.

During pregnancy, BV has been associated with a two-fold increased risk of preterm delivery (particularly if BV is diagnosed in the early second trimester) and a three to five-fold increased risk of spontaneous abortion in women diagnosed with BV in the first trimester.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

BV is a common presentation in clinical medicine. Healthcare workers and nurse practitioners who see patients with BV should always assess for the presence of other STIs. In addition, BV during pregnancy is associated with a high rate of preterm delivery and spontaneous abortions.
