The female body goes through immense changes during a pregnancy that involve all organ systems in the body. These changes result in physiology that differs from that of a non-pregnant female. Additionally, abnormalities in the development of pregnancy can lead to further complications for both mother and fetus. With the maternal mortality rate in the United States reaching almost 18 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2009, a drastic increase from the 7.2 deaths per 100,000 in 1987, it has become more critical for all healthcare providers to understand the typical changes that accompany pregnancy, as well as recognize changes that go beyond typical pregnancy symptoms.
