Pseudoaneurysms are false aneurysms that occur at the site of arterial injury. They are unlike true aneurysms as a layer of the arterial wall does not contain them. Prompt recognition and treatment are required. This activity will cover the epidemiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of the most commonly encountered types of pseudoaneurysms, including femoral, visceral, and aortic pseudoaneurysms. These are separate disease entities which occur in a myriad of situations and require specific workup and treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of pseudoaneurysms and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for developing pseudoaneurysms, specifically femoral, visceral, and aortic pseudoaneurysms.

- Describe the evaluation of pseudoaneurysms.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for pseudoaneurysms.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication and improve outcomes with regard to pseudoaneurysms.
