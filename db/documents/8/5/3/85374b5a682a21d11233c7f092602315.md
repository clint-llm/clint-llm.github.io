**PAPVC**

Untreated PAPVC, in the long term, can lead to pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure.

**TAPVC**

Postoperative complications can include pulmonary hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, PVO, and failure to wean from the bypass.

**Postoperative PVO**

- Pulmonary venous obstruction is an important cause of late mortality in patients with TAPVC and is the most common reason for reoperation. PVO after repair remains difficult to treat with mortality of around 40% by three years. Preoperative risk factors include hypoplastic pulmonary veins and mixed connection. It is, therefore, important to serially monitor these patients.
