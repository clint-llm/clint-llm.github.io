The risk of limb loss in ALI secondary to popliteal artery thrombosis is approximately 14 to 17%.  These patients are also at risk for the development of compartment syndrome. The ischemic insults can mask the symptoms of compartment syndrome to the limb. Thus practitioners must have a high degree of suspicion for the risk of compartment syndrome and take the necessary steps to preclude any further insults to the limb.  Additionally, the use of thrombolytics has associations with major risks including bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and stroke.
