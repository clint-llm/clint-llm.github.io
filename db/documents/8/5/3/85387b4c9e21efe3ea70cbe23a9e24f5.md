Do not administer tPA for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke in the following scenarios:

- If the risk of bleeding and serious complications are greater than the potential benefit of tPA therapy. These include patients with current intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage, and those who have active internal bleeding.

- If the patient underwent recent (less than three months ago) intracranial or intraspinal surgery or suffered a serious head trauma

- Evidence of intracranial conditions that may increase the risk of bleeding

- Bleeding diathesis (hemorrhagic diathesis)

- Patients with severe uncontrolled hypertension

Do not administer tPA in the management of acute myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism inÂ the following:

- If the risk of bleeding is greater than any potential benefit. This risk includes active internal bleeding or patients with a recent history of stroke.

- Recent (within three months) intracranial or intraspinal surgery or serious head trauma

- Presence of intracranial pathologies that may increase the risk of bleeding

- Bleeding diathesis (hemorrhagic diathesis)

- Current severe uncontrolled hypertension

Do not administer tPA in any patient who had a hypersensitivity reaction to a previous dose of tPA (urticarial or anaphylactic reactions)
