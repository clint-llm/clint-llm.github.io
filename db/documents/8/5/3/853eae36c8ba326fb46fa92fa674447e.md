Patients who may develop abnormal sleep patterns, such as those seen in Kleine–Levin syndrome, should speak to their clinician regarding the need for further evaluation by a sleep specialist. Clinicians should educate and prepare patients with Kleine–Levin syndrome regarding their clinical course and anticipated symptoms that may arise. Nurses can provide additional counseling and monitor therapeutic results. The pharmacist can check for drug interactions and verify dosing, and also counsel the patient regarding administration and potential adverse effects. Patients should be reassured regarding the benign nature of the disease without any known long-term complications. An interprofessional team approach will yield the best patient outcomes. [Level 5]
