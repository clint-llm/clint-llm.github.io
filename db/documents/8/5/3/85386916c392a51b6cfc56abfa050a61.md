Each intercostal nerve enters the correlated intercostal space between the posterior intercostal membrane and the parietal pleura. The intercostal nerve at this point is directly external to the parietal pleura and then dives into the subcostal groove of its associated rib, which lies directly inferior to the rib. As it runs its course through the subcostal groove, the nerve is bounded by the innermost intercostal muscle and the internal intercostal muscle. The first six intercostal nerves give off branches and then end within the corresponding intercostal space just below the corresponding rib. The seventh through eleventh intercostal nerves exit the intercostal spaces and travel into the abdominal wall. These last five intercostal nerves are termed thoracoabdominal nerves due to this pathway.
