Secretory IgA (SIgA) is released into the lumen and is the first-line barrier to pathogens and other irritants. It binds to antigens and prevents their access to the submucosa and circulation.

In addition to immune protection from antigens, IgA also has essential anti-inflammatory functions primarily mediated through Fc-alpha-RI, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), and specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin-related 1 (SIGNR1) receptors. Secretory IgA has a sugar-dependent interaction with SIGNR1, which induces immune tolerance via regulatory T cells on dendritic cells. DC-SIGN also interacts with sub-epithelial dendritic cells to take up secretory IgA immune complexes in the lamina propria. Furthermore, monomeric IgA interacts with Fc-alpha-RI to phosphorylate Fc receptor gamma-identical activatory motifs (FcRy-ITAM), which results in the recruitment of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, causing cellular inhibition through the formation of inhibisomes.
