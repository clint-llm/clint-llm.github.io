Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME) is a characteristic skin rash most often associated with glucagonoma, an alpha-cell tumor of the pancreatic islets.

The skin rash is characteristically extremelyÂ erythematous, shows superficial epidermal necrosis, and often spreads in a centrifugal pattern. The condition is frequently misdiagnosed due in part to its rarity. It is the presenting symptom of the pancreatic islet neoplasm. Thus, timely recognition and treatment can help prevent morbidity from the epidermal dysfunction and mortality from the tumor burden itself if the neoplasm is identified before metastasis.
