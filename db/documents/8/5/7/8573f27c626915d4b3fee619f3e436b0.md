Eosinophilic pneumonia represents a heterogeneous group of lung disorders characterized by the presence of peripheral blood eosinophilia (defined as an eosinophilic count > 500 × 10 cells/L) with either increased eosinophils in BAL fluid or eosinophilic infiltration of lung parenchyma demonstrated on lung biopsy. Eosinophilic lung diseases are further classified into Primary or Secondary based on the absence or presence of underlying identifiable etiology.

Eosinophilic pneumonia refers to a primary eosinophilic disorder, which is further classified into acute eosinophilic pneumonia and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia

Acute eosinophilic pneumonia presents as an acute febrile illness characterized by the presence of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on imaging and can cause acute respiratory failure.
