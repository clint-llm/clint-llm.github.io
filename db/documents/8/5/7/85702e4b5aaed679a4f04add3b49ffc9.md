**Pineocytoma**

Comprised of small cells similar in appearance to normal pinealocytes, arranged in sheets; pineocytomatous pseudorosettes are characteristic and not seen in healthy pineal gland tissue.

**Pineal Parenchymal Tumors with Intermediate Differentiation**

Characteristically show two distinct microscopic patterns.

**Papillary Tumor of the Pineal Region**

Demonstrate variable morphology, from solid to predominantly papillary, reminiscent of ependymomas, including evidence of ependymal rosettes.

**Pineoblastoma**

Tightly packed small round blue cells (high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio). Homer Wright rosettes and Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes are occasionally seen.

**Germinoma**

Germinomas originate from primordial germ cells, similar to those in gonadal germinomas. Cells haveÂ large nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Lymphocytic infiltration is common. On immunohistochemistry, they stain for placental alkaline phosphatase.
