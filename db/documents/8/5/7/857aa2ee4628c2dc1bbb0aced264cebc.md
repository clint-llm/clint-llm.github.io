Due to the fibrous-like nature of the tissue, the coronal suture lacks significant blood supply, deriving its needs from microvasculature in surrounding tissues. However, the coronal suture protects an important blood supply to other tissues: the middle meningeal artery. While there is minor anatomical variation, the anterior division of the middle meningeal artery crosses the squamous suture as it intersects the coronal suture at the pterion. Trauma to this location is worrisome for an injury to the middle meningeal artery or one of its branches, which can secondarily result in an epidural hematoma.
