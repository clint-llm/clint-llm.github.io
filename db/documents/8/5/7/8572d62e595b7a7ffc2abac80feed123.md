There exist a few conditions that may be on the differential diagnosis list with Treacher Collins syndrome. The hearing loss in Treacher Collins syndrome is often symmetric and bilateral, which can help differentiate it from some other syndromes, again emphasizing the importance of comprehensive audiological evaluation in any patient undergoing a syndromic workup.

Goldenhar syndrome (vertebral oculo-auricular dysplasia) shares some craniofacial abnormalities with Treacher Collins syndrome.

Nager syndrome (acrofacial dysostosis) also shares facial features with Treacher Collins syndrome.

Miller syndrome again shares similar facial features with Treacher Collins syndrome, but in Miller syndrome, the limb defects are postaxial, whereas Treacher Collins syndrome has no associated limb anomalies.

Nonsyndromic congenital mandibular hypoplasia is a rare subgroup of allÂ patients with mandibular hypoplasia at large.
