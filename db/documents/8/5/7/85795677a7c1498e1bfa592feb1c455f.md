Patients need to be monitored carefully as unsupervised use of these medications can result in local and systemic adverse effects. The duration of treatment should not be greater than 2 to 4 weeks, regardless of potency. High-potency steroids should not be administered for a longer than 2 weeks, and after this period, should be tapered to avoid adverse effects.
