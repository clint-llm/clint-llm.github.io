Of primary significance is the individual endometrial cancer patient’s status, specifically, their age, reproductive status and plans, habitus, health and other chronic and/or acute diseases, understanding and psychology, socio-economic factors, risks, among others, well beyond the scope of this article. Next, histotype, grade, tumor size, uterine, local/regional invasion, nodal status, and presence of intraperitoneal, and/or extra-abdominal metastases, must be determined. With this information, a management strategy can be developed.

**Prevention**

Because of the association of endometrial cancer with overweight status and obesity, maintaining wholesome body form through a healthful diet and exercise is the most important measure most women can implement to reduce their risks for endometrial cancer.

Once regular cyclic ovulatory menstruation has been established in the teens, women who develop oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea and signs of defeminization, such as excessive facial, presternal and pubo-perineal hair growth and/or usual cephalic hair loss, particularly in the temporal regions, even before obvious hirsutism and balding, should be evaluated for PCO and other androgen or estrogen-secreting tumors considered in the workup. Diagnosed pathology, such as PCO, thyroidopathy, pituitary and hypothalamic disease, and hormone-secreting tumors or hyperplasia, should be appropriately treated medically and/or surgically as indicated to achieve regular ovulation and fertility, if possible.

Documented family histories are an essential part of good medical care and should be periodically updated.****Patients with personal and/or family histories suggestive for a hereditary cancer syndrome should have focused genetic counseling for cancer pedigree analysis, risk assessment, education, possible molecular testing for cancer-associated mutations, and management planning. Excessive numbers of endometrial, colon, ovarian, and other characteristic Lynch syndrome cancers and multiple cancers occurring at younger ages over several generations with apparent Mendelian dominant transmission are strongly associated withMMR gene and PTEN mutations.****Evidence, so far, is inconclusive whether or not COC, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective for chemoprevention of endometrial cancer in LS mutation carriers.

Although transvaginal ultrasound scanning and endometrial sampling can be useful techniques for evaluating abnormal gynecologic findings and abnormal uterine bleeding, these methods have not been proven effective as screening tests for endometrial cancer in asymptomatic low-risk women.

**Treatment**

Generally, type 1, grades 1 and 2 endometrioid carcinomas, the most common endometrial cancers, are confined to the uterine corpus and are associated with an excellent prognosis.****Conversely, type 2, serous, clear cell and grade 3 endometrioid carcinomas are aggressive cancers, which often present with lymphatic invasion and metastases, even when the primary lesion is confined to the uterine corpus. These are also are associated with advanced disease and poor survival. As such, approaches to management will be quite different in these dissimilar cases.

**Endometrial Cancers Confined to the Uterine Body 
**

Unless otherwise determined by the history and physical examination, patients diagnosed with EIN or type 1, low-grade endometrioid carcinomas grossly confined to the uterine corpus, once fitness to undergo surgery is determined, usually will be successfully treated with a total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy by open or minimally invasive approaches.****When a large tumor, myometrial invasion greater than 50%, cervical invasion, the involvement of capillary-like spaces, unexpected aggressive histology, adnexal mass, intra-peritoneal metastases, or enlarged lymph nodes are found, retroperitoneal pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy should be done for correct staging and assignment for possible adjuvant treatment.

An early Gynecologic Oncology Group study of endometrial cancers clinically confined to the uterus by preoperative evaluation found no cancer positive nodes in grade 1 carcinomas involving only the endometrium. Pelvic node metastases were reported in 6.4% of 468 grade 1 and grade 2 endometrial carcinomas, and 3.6% had para-aortic node involvement**.**Grade 3 endometrial carcinomas were associated with 18.3% pelvic and 11.1% para-aortic node involvement.

Lymph node metastases are present in approximately 10% to 20% of unselected endometrial carcinomas and over half of the cases with positive pelvic nodes also have metastases to para-aortic nodes, but the presence of positive para-aortic nodes is uncommon in patients with negative pelvic nodes (2% to 6%).****Two large multicenter prospective studies of stage I endometrial cancer, including both low and high risk cases, found no significant difference in overall and disease-free survival between patients randomized to pelvic lymphadenectomy in one study and pelvic plus para-aortic lymphadenectomy in the other study versus no lymphadenectomy in the first study and selective lymphadenectomy in the second study.

Metastases to para-aortic nodes, particularly isolated para-aortic nodes, are usually associated with poorly differentiated endometrioid and type 2 carcinoma histotypes, deep myometrial invasion, large tumors and other high-risk factors.

Due to the time and expense of lymphadenectomy, the increase in adverse effects, and the absence of prospective evidence that lymphadenectomy provides benefit to patients with endometrial cancer clinically confined to the uterine corpus, there is a growing consensus that patients with grade 1 or 2 endometrioid carcinomas less than 2 cm diameter and confined to the uterine corpus with less than 50% myometrium invasion do not require surgical lymphadenectomy.****Sentinel node mapping (SNM) has been advocated to select cases that are most likely to benefit from lymphadenectomy and avoid these extensive dissections in patients with low-risk stage I endometrial cancers and negative nodes.

Presently, omentectomy is not standard in the primary surgical management of endometrial cancer. Meta-analysis of 13 relevant studies concluded that the prevalence of metastases to the omentum in clinical stage I endometrioid carcinoma is only 4.4%, but the prevalence of omental metastases associated with stage I, non-endometrioid endometrial cancer rose to 9.8% of which 26.7% were microscopic.****The high rate of disseminated carcinomatosis with early non-endometrioid carcinoma, even when apparently confined to the uterine corpus, may be a case for omentectomy along with lymphadenectomy for adequate staging and intent to maximize survival.

Another controversial issue is whether ovarian conservation should to be considered when hysterectomy is done for endometrial cancer clinically confined to the uterus. Coexisting ovarian malignancies have been described in 26/102 (25%) of young women (aged 24 to 45 years) who underwent a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (86), or hysterectomy with ovarian preservation (16) or subsequent salpingo-oophorectomy (3) for endometrial cancer.****Preoperative endometrial biopsies found grade 1 endometrioid carcinoma in 46% of the cases; on final pathology, 69% of the ovarian malignancies were associated with grade 1 endometrial carcinoma, and 58% of all cases involved only the inner myometrium. Four of the patients (15%) appeared to have normal ovaries during the intraoperative assessment.

Outcomes utilizing primary radiotherapy for clinically diagnosed stage I endometrial carcinoma of all histologic grades in women with comorbid medically inoperable conditions are comparable to those reported with primary surgery and adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy when indicated.****Survival rates reported with low-dose intracavitary brachytherapy in patients with heightened surgical risks, some with high-risk carcinomas, were in the same order as those obtained in other series of stage I endometrial cancers treated with external radiotherapy and later high dose rate brachytherapy.****A large database study of patients with inoperable stage I endometrial cancers, grades 1 to 3, found significant survival benefits in the group treated with brachytherapy alone or together with external radiation compared with the group treated with external therapy alone.

While hysterectomy alone will prevent endometrial cancer in women with EIN and this provides 95% probability of relapse-free, 5 year survival in the treatment of stage I, low-risk endometrial cancer, postsurgical adjuvant therapy may have a place in the treatment of endometrial carcinomas with high-risk factors.

**Endometrial Cancers Involving the Uterine Body and Cervix     
**

Five-year survival rates for endometrial cancer involving the uterine body, and cervix, that is, stage II, are poorer for all histotypes and grades than survival rates for surgical stage I endometrial cancer.

Preoperative radiotherapy with or without cytotoxic antineoplastic chemotherapy planned to reduce the size of the stage II tumorous cervix and early parametrial invasion, followed by extrafascial hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy to extirpate residual endometrial cancer that may be harbored in the myometrium or adnexa has been advanced as a tolerable option that may be considered in elderly patients and those with precarious co-morbidities. To date reported series are too small and follow-ups are too limited to recommend this as the standard approach for managing stage II endometrial cancers.****In patients who have not had preoperative radiotherapy, the results from surgical treatment of endometrial cancers found to invade the cervical stroma may be improved with postoperative adjuvant therapy.

For medically inoperable patients with clinical stage II endometrial cancer, radiation therapy alone achieved 5-year survival rates that approached those of operable patients who had standard surgical management.

**Advanced and Recurrent Endometrial Cancers 
**

The prognosis for stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancers may be improved with maximum surgical debulking.****This was true for both type 1 endometrioid and non-endometrioid type 2 endometrial carcinomas.

Although recurrent endometrial cancer after initial treatment results in notably diminished long-term survival rates**,**local recurrences confined to the vagina and pelvis are associated with better overall survival than non-local recurrences.**.**Larger vaginal recurrences can be treated with external radiotherapy followed by brachytherapy or interstitial implantation (if the tumor remains greater than 0.5 cm).****There may be a place for total or segmental pelvic exenteration of centrally located recurrent endometrial cancers in highly selected patients who have failed previous surgery and radiotherapy. Though these procedures are associated with very high operative morbidity, 20% long-term (greater than 5-year) survival has been reported.

**Postsurgical Adjuvant Therapy for Cancers Confined to the Uterus
**

Studies of postsurgical adjuvant therapy versus observation in patients with high-risk stage I and stage II endometrial cancers have demonstrated that radiotherapy is associated with significant reduction in vaginal and pelvic recurrences.****Trials comparing adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy with external beam radiation found nearly equivalent results, reducing vaginal-pelvic recurrences to less than or equal to 5%, but there was significantly more toxicity with external radiation. Though there is insufficient evidence to recommend both external radiation and brachytherapy for standard postoperative treatment of stage I endometrial cancer, some authorities have suggested that pelvic recurrences might be further diminished by this approach in patients found to have poorly differentiated endometrial carcinomas and greater than 50% myometrial invasion or cervical involvement.****

A multicenter database study focusing on 250 cases of stage II endometrial cancers found that, following primary hysterectomy, the 5-year, disease-free survival rate but not the overall survival rate was significantly higher for patients treated with postsurgical external pelvic radiotherapy with or without vaginal brachytherapy. In that study, 20% of the endometrial cancers were non-endometrioid, and 20% of the primary surgeries were radical hysterectomies, but there were no significant differences in disease-free or overall survival between groups with non-endometrioid compared to endometrioid carcinomas or according to the type of hysterectomy.

Many pelvic recurrences after surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy for stage I and stage II endometrial cancers are associated with distant metastases.**.**However, a large database study, just published, confirmed better overall survival for patients receiving adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy for stage II endometrioid endometrial cancer but not with adjuvant chemotherapy, and there was no survival advantage to adding chemotherapy to adjuvant radiotherapy.

Because of the propensity for surgical stages I and II endometrial serous carcinomas to recur in the vagina and disseminate throughout the peritoneal cavity, several retrospective studies and clinical trials have explored the results of postsurgical radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The most promising regimens, providing reductions in vaginal recurrences and improved progression-free survival for patients with endometrial serous carcinomas, clinically and surgically confined to the uterus, were those that combined vaginal brachytherapy and systemic platinum-taxane chemotherapy.

**Postsurgical Adjuvant Therapy for Advanced and Recurrent Endometrial Cancers
**

Adjuvant therapy for stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancers usually follows maximum surgical effort.

Large series reports, database studies, and authoritative reviews generally conclude that postoperative external radiotherapy to the pelvis with the addition of vaginal brachytherapy for stage III endometrial cancers reduces local-regional recurrences and may improve the lengths and rates of progression-free and overall survivals. External radiation confined to the pelvis in cases with surgically proven pelvic and/or para-aortic node metastases (stage IIIC) is associated with fewer recurrences and higher survival rates, which might be further improved by extended fields to encompass para-aortic nodes.

Many multi-institutional and registry-based studies of postsurgical treatment for stage III endometrial cancers indicate that protocols including both adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy were associated with superior cancer control and survival benefits than does either method alone. A recently reported database study of 12,988 stage III endometrial cancer cases concluded that adding vaginal brachytherapy to external beam postsurgical radiotherapy improved survival in cases with cervical involvement but not in other cases. While fewer stage IV cases were reported comparing the effects of adjuvant chemotherapy to radiotherapy or combining these modalities, the improved progression-free and overall survival rates associated with the addition of pelvic radiotherapy to systemic chemotherapy were attributed to reduction in the number of pelvic recurrences, as there were no substantial differences in the rate of extrapelvic relapse with combined treatment compared to chemotherapy alone.

Presently, systemic chemotherapy is the mainstay for postsurgical adjuvant therapy of advanced primary and recurrent endometrioid and serous carcinomas.

Options for adjuvant chemotherapy for advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer include hormonal, cytotoxic and emerging targeted treatments.****Although objective responses have been reported with progestogen treatment of metastatic endometrial cancers, particularly in those with high estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression, these medications should be reserved as first-line systemic therapy only for slow growing, grade 1 or grade 2 endometrioid carcinomas and in controlled prospective trials. Regimens using the combination of tamoxifen and a progestogen show promise and are on trial. While a comprehensive review of cytotoxic and molecularly targeted chemotherapy far exceeds the scope of this presentation, suffice it to note that the currently favored first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy is paclitaxel and carboplatin (TC), associated with 51% response rate, median 13 months progression-free survival and relatively low toxicity. After prolonged treatment-free and progression-free survival, generally at least 6 to 12 months, platinum alone, other platinum-containing regimens. and unrelated cytotoxic single drugs or regimens have been offered for second-line chemotherapy, but the results with no more than 20% to 30% response rates have been disappointing. These patients may be best served by counseling and enrollment on a legitimate, prospective trial when this is available.

So far, options for molecularly targeted treatment of endometrial cancer also are limited to trials. The [poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase] PARP inhibitor olaparib was approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) in 2014 for the treatment of progressive ovarian cancer in BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutation carriers who have failed at least three previous anti-cancer drug regimens. Prospective trials of olaparib effectiveness against endometrial cancer are ongoing based on published improvements of overall response rates and mean progression-free survival, though not overall survival, in previously treated patients with ovarian cancers associated with germline or somatic BRCA mutations. The greatest benefit of PARP thus far has been prolonging progression-free survivals in ovarian HGSC with BRCA mutations. Olaparib was FDA approved in 2017 for maintenance therapy of patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer in complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Another PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, was approved by the FDA in 2016 for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancers associated with germline or somatic BRCA mutations after 2 or more previous chemotherapies. Because PARP inhibition has been demonstrated in PTEN deficient endometrial cancer cell lines, it is thought that these agents may be effective in MMR defective endometrial cancers with MSI (microsatellite instability). It has been considered that mTOR inhibitors and antiangiogenic agents also might have molecularly targeted cancericidal and/or tumor suppressive effects against endometrial cancer, but single and combined drug trials are limited and toxicities are significant, and neither has been FDA approved for the treatment of endometrial cancer. Finally, immunotherapy to block the Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) pathway, which if left unchecked represses cytotoxic immune responses, was associated with responses in patients with MMR deficient endometrial cancers that are characterized by marked tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, which are hallmarks of Lynch syndrome-linked cancers. There is speculation that patients harboring recurrent endometrial cancers showing MIS with large numbers of TIF and/or demonstrated MMR deficiency or high levels of PD-1 neoantigen expression may be better candidates for immunotherapy rather than for second-line chemotherapy trials.
