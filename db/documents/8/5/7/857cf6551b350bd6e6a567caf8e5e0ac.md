Sunburn is caused by too much exposure to the ultraviolet radiation from the sun or similar artificial sources such as tanning beds. Many factors contribute to facility and severity of sunburn:

- Medications: Sunburn risk is increased by tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), thiazide diuretics, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, retinoids, and St. John's wort amongst other photosensitizing medication

- 
Increased UV index:

- 
              
- The time between 10 am and 4 pm is when the sun's rays are at their strongest.
              
              
- Decreased cloud coverage corresponds with increased exposure to stronger UV rays.
              
              
- Higher altitudes are correlated with an increased risk of sunburn due to a smaller layer of the earth's atmospheric protection. 
              
              
- Proximity to the equator is correlated with more direct UV ray exposure.

- Ozone depletion: Certain areas of the world have decreased ozone or holes in the ozone layer. This equates to increased penetrance of the sun's UV rays.

- Fitzpatrick skin phototype: Please see epidemiology for more information.  The lighter the skin color, the easier it is to sunburn.

- Tanning: Tanning or spending increased amounts of time in the sun to acquire darker skin, has been a popular American pastime for decades. Tanning increases the risk of skin cancers and accelerated skin aging. Rapid tanning may cause sunburn.
