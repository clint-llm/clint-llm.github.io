# Continuing Education Activity

Overdoses and accidental ingestions or exposures are common throughout the world. With more than 2.4 million toxic exposures each year, poisoning is the second most common cause of injury-related morbidity and mortality in the United States. In the United States in 2015 antidotes for various overdoses were used 184,742 times. While for many overdoses and intoxications the treatment involves supportive care and treatment of the sequelae there are specific antidotes available for a variety of substances. Identifying the ingestion and prompt administration of the correct antidote can prevent significant morbidity and mortality for many patients. This activity will focus on updating the health team on sixteen of the most common overdose presentations and their corresponding antidotes. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of common overdoses, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients that have experienced an overdose.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with hydrofluoric acid exposure.
- Identify the presentation of a patient with organophosphate exposure.
- Review the clinical manifestations of iron overdose.
- Outline the importance of how collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team can enhance patient care when a patient presents with an overdose.

# Introduction

Overdoses and accidental ingestions or exposures are common throughout the world.  With more than 2.4 million toxic exposures each year, poisoning is the second most common cause of injury-related morbidity and mortality in the United States.

# Issues of Concern

**Background and Presentation**

**Acetaminophen**: Acetaminophen overdose is the most commonly reported overdose in both the UK and in the United States. It is also the most common cause of acute liver failure (ALF) in the United States, accounting for 50% of all ALF cases.

**Organophosphates**: Acute poisoning from organophosphates, usually in the form of insecticides, is possibly responsible for more drug-related deaths worldwide than any other drug class.

**Warfarin**: Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is a widely used anticoagulant that remains popular despite the introduction of new anticoagulants. With more than 30 million prescriptions annually, it is the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant in North America.

**Digoxin**: Digoxin is one of the oldest cardiac medications with the use of cardiac glycosides dating back to ancient Egypt.

**Ethylene glycol and methanol**: Poisoning with ethylene glycol or methanol may occur through attempted self-harm, unintentional ingestion, or a misguided attempt at inebriation. In 2007, United States poison centers received a combined 8014 calls related to possible ethylene glycol or methanol exposure.

**Hydrofluoric acid**: Hydrofluoric acid, a commonly used chemical in many industries and an ingredient in many household cleaning products, can cause life-threatening burns as well as systemic toxicity. It can enter the body via the skin, mucosa, gastrointestinal, or respiratory tract. Severity determination is by the concentration of the acid, the type and the duration of contact, and type of tissue involved.

**Isoniazid**: Isoniazid has been used to treat tuberculosis since the 1950s. It leads to a pyridoxine deficiency by inhibiting pyridoxine kinase, the enzyme responsible for the production of the active form of pyridoxine (pyridoxal phosphate), and by increasing excretion of pyridoxine by the kidneys.

**Tricyclic antidepressants**: Tricyclic antidepressants were first introduced in the 1950s and were used extensively in the treatment of depression. Reports of toxicity appeared just a few years after the introduction of TCAs to the market.

**Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers**: Beta blockers competitively antagonize beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the myocardium, reducing calcium entry into the cardiomyocytes with resulting negative inotropic and chronotropic effects.

**Heavy metals**: Patients may become exposed to heavy metals from contaminated food, industrial processes, commercial products, or natural sources such as groundwater or metal ores.

**Iron**: Acute iron toxicity may be due to unintentional ingestion (most common in children) or intentional overdose with the intent of self-harm. Intentional overdoses carry a higher mortality rate; 10% compared to the 1% for unintentional ingestions.

**Cyanide**: Cyanide reversibly binds to mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, leading to intracellular hypoxia. Symptoms usually begin within one minute of inhalation and several minutes of ingestion and include dyspnea, headache, dizziness, nausea, gastrointestinal distress, seizures.

# Clinical Significance

**Treatment and Antidotes**

**Acetaminophen**: Approximately 4% of acetaminophen gets metabolized to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), a toxic metabolite that causes hepatic necrosis. NAPQI combines with glutathione to form nontoxic metabolites. In the setting of acetaminophen overdose glutathione gets depleted leading to an accumulation of NAPQI and subsequent hepatic injury.

**Organophosphates**: There are three important medications to remember for treatment of organophosphate poisoning. The first is atropine which blocks the build-up of excess acetylcholine.

**Warfarin**: There are currently three options available for the reversal of warfarin - vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and three or four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). Oral vitamin K can be used to reverse warfarin if immediate treatment is not necessary. In the event of more life-threatening bleeding 10mg of IV vitamin K should be given over 20 to 60 minutes. However, it may take several hours to see the full reversal effect after infusion of IV vitamin K. Serious bleeding, therefore, requires administration of clotting factors with either FFP or 4FPCC. FFP is created from whole blood and includes both pro and anticoagulant properties.

**Digoxin**: Anti-digoxin Fab should be given to patients presenting with digoxin toxicity and life-threatening arrhythmias or hyperkalemia. The dose (in number of vials) for both commercially available preparations of anti-digoxin Fab can be estimated by dividing the total amount ingested (in mg) by 0.5 (mg of digoxin bound per vial of Fab).

**Ethylene glycol and methanol**: Both ethylene glycol and methanol are not themselves toxic but are metabolized to toxic intermediates by alcohol dehydrogenase. Ethylene glycol is metabolized to glycolic acid, causing metabolic acidosis, and then to oxalic acid which combines with ionized calcium in the plasma to form calcium oxalate. Calcium oxalate then deposits in the renal tubules leading to acute kidney injury. Methanol is metabolized to formic acid, leading to metabolic acidosis and damage to the retina and optic nerve. Ethanol or fomepizole can be used to as they compete with the active site of alcohol dehydrogenases, decreasing the formation of the toxic metabolites of ethylene glycol and methanol. Treatment is recommended for the following

- Serum ethylene glycol concentration  greater than or equal to 62 mg/dL

- Methanol concentration greater than or equal to 32mg/dL

- Recent ingestion with an osmolal gap higher than 25

- Suspected ingestion plus two or more of the following: 

- arterial pH less than 7.3
- serum bicarb less than 20
- an osmolol gap greater than 25
- presence of urinary oxalate crystals or visual disturbance

While both ethanol and fomepizole can are viable options in toxic alcohol poisoning, fomepizole has become the treatment of choice in the United States since its approval in 1997. It is a potent competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, has few side effects, is easy to use, and may preclude the need for hemodialysis in many patients.

****Hydrofluoric**acid**: Treatment of hydrofluoric acid burns begins with removing the patient from the source of contamination and removing any remaining hydrofluoric acid (removal of contaminated clothing, lavage in the nearest shower for at least 30 minutes). Next, the burns should receive treatment with 2.5% topical calcium gluconate gel (rubbed into the affected area for 15 to 30 minutes ). Gauze moistened with 10% calcium gluconate can also be wrapped around the burns; this neutralizes the fluoride ions and blocks their infiltration into deeper tissues.

**Isoniazid**: Treatment for isoniazid overdose or seizures in a patient with suspected isoniazid toxicity is IV pyridoxine. The dose is generally 1g IV or 1g of pyridoxine per gram of isoniazid ingested.

**Tricyclic antidepressants**: Sodium bicarbonate should be given to patients presenting with TCA overdose and dysrhythmias or hypotension (Grade C evidence). It should also be a consideration in cases of QRS widening over 100ms in association with TCA overdose (Grade E evidence).

**Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers**: Treatment of calcium channel blocker and beta blocker overdose is similar. Treatment consists of calcium, glucagon, and high-dose insulin therapy. Calcium is given as an initial IV bolus of 10 to 20ml of 10% calcium chloride, or 30 to 60ml of 10% calcium gluconate (for pediatric patients the dose is 0.2 ml/kg or 0.6 ml/kg respectively) with repeated boluses can be given every 15 to 20 minutes for up to four additional doses.

**Heavy metals**: Heavy metal toxicity treatment is with chelation therapy. For lead toxicity dimercaprol (British anti-lewisite, BAL), edetate calcium disodium, and succimer are the most common options. A fourth agent, penicillamine is less frequently used as it carries a risk of interstitial nephritis. For severe symptoms including encephalopathy, dimercaprol is the agent of choice at a dosage of 75mg/m2 every 4 hours for five days.

**Iron**: For severe iron overdose IV deferoxamine is the treatment of choice. Deferoxamine acts as a chelating agent that binds with ferric iron forming ferrioxamine which is water-soluble and excreted by the kidneys.

**Cyanide**: Treatment of cyanide toxicity depends on the rapid administration of one of the three currently available antidotes. The first is hydroxycobalamin which binds cyanide to form cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) which is then renally excreted. Hydroxocobalamin is currently the preferred antidote for severe cyanide toxicity from smoke inhalation.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Overdoses and accidental exposures to toxic agents are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Combating this issue involves an interprofessional team and multiple approaches. First, there should be a focus on prevention. Community leaders, health care workers, and educators can all play roles in the prevention of toxic exposures. Patients should be educated on the correct way to take various medications and to keep them out of the hands of small children. The public should similarly receive education on the proper storage and disposal of medications and household supplies as well as potentials for toxic exposures and how to avoid them. The next area of focus is on preparation which again involves a team approach. Health professionals from a variety of specialties (such as emergency medicine, toxicology, critical care, hematology/oncology, pediatric emergency medicine, etc.) should work with pharmacists, local poison centers, EMS, and hospital administration to form a consensus on which antidotes should be stocked in the hospital. Knowing what is available and how soon a specific antidote is obtainable is critical as the administration of most antidotes is very time sensitive with morbidity and mortality drastically increasing with treatment delay. The next area of focus is a timely and adequate treatment which again involves a team approach. A patient with an overdose or toxic exposure may arrive by EMS or private vehicle. EMS can provide not only a description of patients clinical condition and treatments given on scene or en route but also information on the scene itself that can help point to a particular toxic exposure. Nurses are critical in triage and assessment of the patient, obtaining labs and other tests, carrying out treatment plans, and monitoring and reassessing the patient's clinical status. Respiratory therapists are often needed to help treat the pulmonary manifestations of various toxicological emergencies. Pharmacists should have involvement with recommendations of multiple antidotes and their dosing. Regularly communication with local poison center is also important in the patient's management. Psychiatry and social work will often need to be involved after patient stabilization if the exposure is deemed to be from an attempt at self-harm. Additional treatment teams will likely offer consultation as the patient will often need admission to the hospital and possibly to the intensive care unit. By preparing ahead of time and communicating efficiently with various health care professionals, we can improve the outcomes of patients presenting with toxic exposures.
