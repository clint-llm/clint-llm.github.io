In conclusion, prehospital ultrasound is an exciting field with many diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Future applications for prehospital ultrasound are unlimited and could include ultrasound-guided venous access, fracture diagnosis, and nerve blocks for rural pain management. Prehospital ultrasound alters the diagnosis and emergency management services treatment of patients, but evidence that it makes a difference in patient outcomes is lacking. More large, randomized, blinded prospective studies must be done.
