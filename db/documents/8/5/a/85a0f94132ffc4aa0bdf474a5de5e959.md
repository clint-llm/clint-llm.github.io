Lichen planopilaris is best managed by a dermatologist. However, the patient may initially be seen by a general physician or nurse practitioner. These clinicians need to refer patients with complex skin disorders to the respective specialist for treatment. Coordination between this interprofessional team will improve outcomes. [Level 5] Treatment aims to reduce hair loss, control the symptoms, and stop the scarring process. Regrowth should not be expected since the complete elimination of inflammation is unlikely. As there are no consistent markers to measure the progress of the disorder, therapy is based on perceived severity and patient tolerance to treatment. The duration of treatment should be guided by clinical response and relapse rates. General measures include avoiding chemical or physical insults to the hair (coloring or perming). Some patients may benefit from hydroxychloroquine and minoxidil, but a complete response is rare. Improvement, when it occurs, may take 6 to 9 months or even longer.
