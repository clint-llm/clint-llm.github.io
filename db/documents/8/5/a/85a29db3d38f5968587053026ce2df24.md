The prognosis of rectal prolapse is generallyÂ good, especially when diagnosed between the age of 9 months and 3 years and not associated with any other underlying condition. It is usually a condition of childhood and often does not recur after age 6. When rectal prolapse is diagnosed after age 4, children are more likely to have underlying neurologic or musculoskeletal problems requiring surgical management and symptoms into adulthood.
