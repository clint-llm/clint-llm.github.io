The designation of brain death often involves an interprofessional team. Physicians, nurses, social workers, and clergy will play a vital role in working with family members during the evaluation and discussing the results of the brain death examination once the diagnosis has been made. Subspecialists within the domains of neurosurgery, neurology, and radiology may be required to interpret ancillary testing if the clinical diagnosis is inadequate. Simultaneously while the possibility of brain death is considered, an interprofessional team specially trained in organ procurement and independent from the treating healthcare team should be involved; these specialty teams handle all aspects of the patient's care only once the diagnosis of brain death has been made.
