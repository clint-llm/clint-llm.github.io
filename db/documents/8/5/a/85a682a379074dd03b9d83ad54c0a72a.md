The only possibility of substantially improving the outcome of analgesia-induced nephropathy lies in its prevention. This will require the effort of an interprofessional team, including primary care providers, nephrologists, nurses, and pharmacists, to coordinate patient care. Studies have shown a significant decrease in the incidence and prevalence of this disease as compared to the previous decades due to improved patient education and awareness. Clinicians, pharmacists, nurses, and all health care professionals should emphasize the detrimental effects of long-term analgesia usage.

The best care of analgesic nephropathy is avoiding the risk. An interprofessional approach can provide a multifaceted strategy to decrease this risk. Pharmacists dispensing the medications should counsel patients about the long-term risk of continued analgesic use and guide dosing. If they identify a patient at particular risk, they should contact the health care provider to encourage alternative forms of pain relief. Nurses often provide the initial evaluation of a patient's medications. In doing so, they can identify patients who are using excessive analgesics. The nurse should educate the patient and discuss their concerns with the healthcare team so that a plan of action can be initiated to assist the patient in reducing analgesic use. Only by approaching the education and treatment of a patient at risk through an interprofessional team will outcomes be improved. [Level 5]
