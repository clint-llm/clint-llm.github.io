Olecranon bursitis presents as swelling overlying the olecranon process. As the swelling progresses, it can restrict elbow movement. In the initial states, elbow movement is not restricted, distinguishing this from swelling within the elbow joint. The appearance of the bursitis is characteristically round or "golf ball" shape given the fluid's confinement within the bursa.

If bursitis occurs due to underlying infection, it is usually associated with erythema and tenderness. It can also be associated with systemic features such as fever and malaise. It should be noted that fever is only present in approximately 70% of all septic bursitis; therefore, an infectious etiology may not be reliably ruled-out in an afebrile patient.
