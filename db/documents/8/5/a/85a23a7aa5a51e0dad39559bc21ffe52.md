BTK plays a major role in promoting the maturation of pro B cells to pre-B cells. The mutation in the BTK gene results in the failure of B cell development, leading to significantly low levels of mature B lymphocytes in peripheral blood circulation. As a result, B cells fail to generate plasma cells, leading to significantly reduced levels (hypogammaglobulinemia) or absence (agammaglobulinemia) of all classes of immunoglobulins.

These immunoglobulins (antibodies) fight against extracellular organisms, particularly encapsulated pyogenic bacteria, which commonly include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type B, Streptococcus pyogenes and the Pseudomonas species. Lack of humoral immunity leads to recurrent sinopulmonary infections.
