Computed tomography (CT) is the choice to evaluate wrist pathology after radiographs further when osseous detail is important for diagnosis and treatment (Figure 3).

Another advantage of CT is greater soft tissue delineation, though not to the level of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Sensitivity for TFCC injuries with CT is increased when paired with arthrogram injection before CT imaging. Additionally, when used with intravenous contrast, vascular structure and integrity can be evaluated, and the assessment of fluid collections and infection. Finally, patients who are unable to undergo MRI scans due to indwelling ferromagnetic material can safely receive a cross-sectional evaluation with CT.

The disadvantages of CT include increased ionizing radiation dose, increased imaging time required and thus the possibility of motion artifact, decreased availability, beam-hardening artifact when imaging through metal hardware, and possible difficulty of patient positioning of the wrist within the CT gantry without also exposing the torso or head or forcing the patient into uncomfortable positioning with the arm fully extended over the head while lying down (Figure 4).

Examples of appropriate uses of CT for wrist pathology may include:

- High-quality osseous detail with multiple planes of view

- Enhanced evaluation of anatomic alignment

- Fracture characterization, especially when complex, occult, and as a surgical planning tool.

- Degree of fracture nonunion or healing

- Post-surgical changes

- Carpal tunnel syndrome

- Soft tissue delineation (vessels, hematoma, soft tissues masses, tendon entrapment in trauma patients)

- TFCC, ligament, and compartmental integrity when paired with pre-scan joint injections (arthrograms)

- Vascular assessment when used with intravenous contrast agents (anatomy and integrity)

- Cross-sectional evaluation when MRI is not an option (indwelling metal, availability, claustrophobia)
