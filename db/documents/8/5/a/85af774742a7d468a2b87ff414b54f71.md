**Primary or autoimmune photodermatoses**

- Polymorphic light eruption

- Juvenile spring eruption

- Actinic folliculitis

- Actinic prurigo

- Solar urticaria

- Chronic actinic/photosensitivity dermatitis

- Hydroa vacciniforme (associated with Epstein-Barr virus)

**Exogenous or drug/chemical-induced photodermatoses**

- Drug-induced photosensitivity: common photosensitizing drugs are thiazides, tetracyclines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), phenothiazines, voriconazole, quinine, vemurafenib, and many others

- Photocontact dermatitis: due to phototoxic chemicals such as psoralens in plants, vegetables, fruit; fragrances in cosmetics; sunscreen chemicals; dyes and disinfectants

- Pseudoporphyria: induced by drugs and/or renal insufficiency
