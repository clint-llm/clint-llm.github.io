Giant cell arteritis, formerly known as temporal arteritis, is an inflammatory vasculopathy that affects medium- and large-sized arteries, with a predilection for the branches of the carotid artery. The disease process is not limited to the temporal artery. Symptoms of giant cell arteritis include temporal headaches and tenderness, scalp pain, jaw claudication, and visual changes that may ultimately result in blindness. Giant cell arteritis is frequently associated with polymyalgia rheumatica.

Giant cell arteritis is a granulomatous arteritis with mononuclear cell infiltrates and giant cell formation within the vessel wall. In biopsy specimens of the superficial temporal artery, this histologic finding is pathognomonic for giant cell arteritis.
