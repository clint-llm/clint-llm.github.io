Once an infant with congenital rubella is diagnosed, an interprofessional team of nurses and clinicians should be involved in its care because of the diverse manifestations and family education requirements.  Children with congenital rubella syndrome should be considered contagious until at least one year of age unless two negative cultures are obtained one month apart after 3 months of age. A birth the Neonate should be isolated. The nurse should emphasize the importance of hand hygiene for reducing disease transmission from the urine of children with congenital rubella infection. More important, all healthcare workers should encourage parents to have their children vaccinated against rubella.
