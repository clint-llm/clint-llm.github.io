Caroli disease is also known as congenital communicating cavernous ectasia of the biliary tree, is a rare inherited disorder involving segmental dilatation of large intrahepatic bile ducts.

Caroli syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is associated with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). Treatment is supportive with antibiotics and if indicated, endoscopic treatment with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for obstruction or impaction.
