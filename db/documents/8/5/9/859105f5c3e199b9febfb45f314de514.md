The diagnosis and management of HP often require integrating multiple aspects of the clinical setting, involving various sub-specialties: primary care physicians, hospital medicine, interventional radiology, emergency medicine, gastroenterology, hepatology, general surgery, a specially trained nurse, and a pharmacist. They included physicians must coordinate patient care to provide the best healthcare possible, improve their outcomes, and provide optimal patient results. Physicians should be familiarized with HP as managing a patient with HP requires a close watch on the patient for any progression in his symptoms to interfere in a perfect timely manner.

Reaching the prompt diagnosis of HP requires a high level of expertise which ultimately prevents prolonged suffering, frequent hospital admissions, and multiple blood transfusions.Â The choice of therapy depends on the clinical condition of the patient and the local availability and expertise of the gastroenterologist and emergency medicine doctors in the area.

Because of the paucity of HP, there is a lack of randomized clinical trials on the lines of management and the disease itself. The literature only shows case reports, case series, and retrospective cohorts.
