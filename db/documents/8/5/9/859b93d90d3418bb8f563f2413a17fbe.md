Ultrasound is a safe, reliable, cost-effective, and easily available imaging modality to assess the anatomy and morphology of the female reproductive organs. Performing 2D ultrasound along with SIS, HyCoSy, and 3D ultrasound in one setting can curtail the significant time delay in performing infertility workup. Performing a 2D ultrasound is part of general ob-gyn training, but performing SIS, HyCoSy, 3D ultrasound generally needs additional training. All general obstetricians and gynecologists are not equipped with this special skill. Therefore collaborating with an REI provider or physicians who provide fertility services is important to provide care in a timely and efficient manner.

Patient care coordinators and nurses also play a crucial role in managing infertility patients. The timing of ultrasound is typically precise to the patientâ€™s menstrual cycle. Therefore, scheduling patients for ultrasounds expeditiously is essential to an infertility evaluation. Involving an interprofessional team of providers who can prioritize the patient's needs, provide education and support while navigating their journey to a successful pregnancy can increase patient satisfaction and alleviate burnout for care providers. This interprofessional care coordination involving nurses, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and physicians can improve patient outcomes.
