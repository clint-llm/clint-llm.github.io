Although a full neurological examination with its specific maneuvers and domains is within the comfort zone of neurologists, it is an essential tool in the arsenal of primary care physicians. Localizing a disease to the neuroaxis will assist them in the appropriate management and referral to appropriate specialties. Also, basic neurologic assessment should be a point of emphasis for other health care professionals, especially in areas with a high likelihood of seeing neurologic casesÂ such as in emergency rooms, intensive care units, and post-operative monitoring.
