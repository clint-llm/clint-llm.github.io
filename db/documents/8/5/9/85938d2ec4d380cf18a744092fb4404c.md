Agoraphobia is usually first identified in young adults, with the mean age of diagnosis beginning in the mid to late twenties. There is no consensus on the childhood experiences, personality characteristics, or psychosocial risk factors that lead to a diagnosis of agoraphobia. However, proposals point to several commonly occurring etiological factors. These include parental overprotectiveness, the presence of childhood fears or night terrors, experience of grief or bereavement early in life, unhappy or traumatic childhoods, or genetic predisposition. Comorbid personality types include dependent, obsessive-compulsive, or otherwise “highly-neurotic.”

The DSM-5 further stratifies risk factors into three categories: temperamental (neuroticism, sensitivity to anxiety, and anxiety disorders), environmental (negative or traumatic events in childhood, and reduced warmth or overprotectiveness in childhood), and genetic and physiological predisposition.
