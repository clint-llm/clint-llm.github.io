The etiology of subdural empyema can be multifactorial; however, some of the predisposing factors associated with the development of subdural empyema include prior cranial surgery, head trauma with open skull fractures, or penetrating injury, infected hematoma or subdural effusion, and not properly treated ear and sinus infections. Of the reported literature, up to 40 to 80% of patients with subdural empyema have otorhinologic infections, especially paranasal sinuses.

The most common microorganisms are anaerobes, aerobic Streptococci, Staphylococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other gram-negative bacilli.Streptococcus milleri and Streptococcus anginosus).Staphylococcus aureus.
