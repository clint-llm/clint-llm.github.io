On light microscopy, osteoclasts are identifiable as containing red in their cytoplasm if stained with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). The multinucleated appearance of osteoclasts can typically be visualized on light microscopy, and large vacuoles can also be seen. Light microscopy allows visualization of the osteoclasts being surrounded by osteocytes and other components of the bone matrix, allowing viewers to gain an understanding of the complex interactions between different cells within the bone matrix.
