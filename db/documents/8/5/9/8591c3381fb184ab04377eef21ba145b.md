Unlike head and pubic lice, body lice do not live on the skin but rather live and lay their eggs in seams of clothing or bedding, moving to the skin only to feed.

The most significant difference between body and head lice is the distinct ability of body lice to transmit the bacterial diseases trench fever, relapsing fever, and epidemic typhus to humans.

Infestations are strongly correlated with poor body hygiene, lack of access to clean clothing, and crowded conditions, and most commonly occur in situations where large groups of people live in unsanitary conditions such as prisons or camps of large groups of refugees from war, famine or natural disasters.

In the United States and other developed countries, body lice infestations most commonly occur in homeless populations who lack access to clean clothes or showers.

Bites of the body louse can produce a variety of skin lesions and severe pruritus which is thought to be due to an allergic and/or inflammatory reaction to the louse saliva.

Infestation with body lice is typically diagnosed by finding eggs and lice in seams of clothing rather than on the skin.

Treatment of body lice does not usually require the use of a pediculicide because improvements in hygiene, including showering and laundering clothing in hot water, will most often eradicate the infestation.
