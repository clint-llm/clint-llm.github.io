Due to their relative infrequency, data on the prognosis of GLAD lesions are scarce, so it is difficult to be confident on this topic. When the lesion was originally reported in 1993, all five cases could return to full functional activities with a full range of movement post-operatively.

Other case reports also support this outcome, suggesting excellent results following operative treatment of GLAD lesions when assessed by both pain and function.
