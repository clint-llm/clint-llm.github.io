The administration of bronchodilators is primarily through inhalation devices to deliver the drug to the lung's bronchioles. Inhalation devices come in all shapes and sizes, but the critical factor is to maximize the amount of drug reaching the bronchioles. Even when used with a perfect technique, the bioavailability of this class of medications remains very low. The best way to achieve maximum bioavailability is by fully exhaling, placing the inhaler in the mouth, and taking a full inhalation. After the patient has inhaled completely, it is followed by 10 seconds of no breathing to wait for the medicine to dissipate into the lung space. Then, a slow exhalation back to normal breathing is advised.

Failure to follow the correct steps risks not maximizing the full potential of the inhaled medicines. Patients taking short-acting bronchodilators should benefit from the medication's effects quickly, within seconds to minutes, and should have the clinical benefit for around 4 hours. These are sometimes called emergency inhalers due to their immediate impact on bronchodilation. Long-acting bronchodilators do not typically work as quickly and are not helpful in an emergency setting.
