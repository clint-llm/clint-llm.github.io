The incidence and prevalence of neonatal abstinence syndrome require an understanding of maternal substance use epidemiology during pregnancy. Globally, as of 2016, the highest prevalence for any substance use disorder (SUD) was in Australasia, while opioid dependence disorder was highest in North America.

In the US, the prevalence of opioid use during pregnancy has increased by 333% over 15 years (1999 to 2014) and continues to rise.

The increasing incidence of NAS has, in turn, lead to increasing admission rates to NICU, from 7 per 1000 to 27 per 1000 cases.

The incidence of NAS rose from 21,732 in 2012 to 32,128 in 2016, while hospital charges have tripled to $2.5 billion.
