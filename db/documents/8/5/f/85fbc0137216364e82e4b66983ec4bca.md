Dysarthria is described as chronic if persistent for greater than 5 years. Dysarthia is considered stable in patients with nonprogressive etiologies.

Recovery also appears to be dependent on the etiology. One study evaluating dysarthria following stroke showed recovery in about half of the patients.

Functional Communication Measures (FCMs) refer to rating scales used to define an individual’s functional abilities. They are seven-point rating scales, ranging from least functional (Level 1) to most functional (Level 7). They help measure a patient’s functional communication and swallowing abilities throughout speech-language pathology intervention.
