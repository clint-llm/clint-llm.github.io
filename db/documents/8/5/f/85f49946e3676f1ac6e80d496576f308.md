The diagnosis of eczema herpeticum can be made clinically if characteristic morphology is present. Viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be performed on vesicle fluid to confirm the diagnosis and determine the type of herpesvirus with high sensitivity and specificity.

If PCR is not available, a Tzank smear, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing, and viral cultures can confirm HSV infection. Bacterial culture should be done if there is a concern for impetiginization. If the clinical presentation is atypical, a skin biopsy may be indicated. Laboratory tests may reveal lymphopenia and an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
