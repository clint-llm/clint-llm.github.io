Peripheral nerve blocks such as the GON-block can be a safe and effective pain treatment modality when performed by a provider with adequate knowledge of head and neck anatomy.

The greater occipital nerve is the largest of the three occipital nerves, innervating the posterior scalp. The GON sensory fibers arise from the dorsal primary ramus of the C2 spinal nerve and then ascend through the fascial plane between the obliquus capitis inferior and semispinalis capitis. The fibers pierce the semispinalis capitis and travel deep to the trapezius muscle until exiting the aponeurosis inferior to the superior nuchal line. At this location, the occipital nerve lies subcutaneously and just medial to the occipital artery.  This tortuous path allows a potential source of nerve irritation and compression.

The frequent co-occurrence of neck pain and headache can also be attributed to the greater occipital nerve and its direct role in what is known as the trigemino-cervical complex (TCC).
