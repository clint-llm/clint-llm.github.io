For patients suspected of nickel toxicity, it is recommended to seek medical toxicology and occupational health consultations. These specialized consultations can provide expertise in evaluating and managing cases of nickel toxicity, considering factors such as the route of exposure, symptoms, and potential long-term effects.

Additionally, for individuals suspected of nickel sensitization, a dermatology consultation may be considered for allergy testing.Â Dermatologists can perform patch tests to confirm nickel allergy and provide further guidance on avoidance strategies and appropriate management of contact dermatitis related to nickel exposure. By involving these consultations, healthcare professionals can ensure comprehensive and specialized care for patients with suspected nickel toxicity or sensitization.
