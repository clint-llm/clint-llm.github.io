For normal patients who are not on anticoagulation, the INR is usually 1.0 regardless of the ISI or the particular performing laboratory.

- For patients with an On-X mechanical bileaflet aortic valve with no other risk factors for thromboembolism, the INR goal is 2 to 3 for the first three months after valve surgery; and after three months the goal is 1.5 to 2.

- For patients with a bileaflet (other than On-X) or current generation, single-tilting disk, mechanical, aortic, prosthetic valve with no other risk factors for thromboembolism, the target INR is 2.5.

- For patients with a mechanical aortic prosthetic valve (other than On-X) and an additional risk factor for thromboembolic events (atrial fibrillation, previous thromboembolism, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or hypercoagulable condition) or an older generation mechanical aortic valve prosthesis (ball-in-cage), the INR goal is 3.

- For patients with a mechanical mitral prosthetic valve (including On-X valve) or mechanical tricuspid prosthetic valve, the target INR is 3.
