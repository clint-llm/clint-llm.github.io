Acute angle-closure glaucoma presents as a sudden onset of severe unilateral eye pain or a headache associated with blurred vision, rainbow-colored halos around bright lights, nausea, and vomiting. The physical exam will reveal a fixed midpoint pupil and a hazy or cloudy cornea with marked conjunctival injection (most prominent at the limbus). Intraocular pressure will be elevated and can be as high as 60 to 80 mm Hg in an acute attack. A mild amount of aqueous flare and cells may be seen. The optic nerve may also be swollen during an acute attack.
