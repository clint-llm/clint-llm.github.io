Early diagnosis and treatment in MGS are essential. The strabismus and anisometropia should be corrected to prevent amblyopia. Full cycloplegic refraction is done, and spectacles are given. Squint may be managed surgically. Retinal detachment is an associated condition that requires management surgically. Pars plans vitrectomy with or without encircling band is employed. First, a core vitrectomy is done. Then triamcinolone-assisted posterior vitreous detachment is induced. Meticulous base shaving is done. All breaks are identified and diathermized. If an epiretinal membrane is present, membrane peeling has to be done. Fluid air exchange is done, and subretinal fluid is drained. All breaks are lasered, and a peripheral barrage laser is done. Silicone oil or gas tamponade is given. Chang et al. and Zhang et al. reported retinal reattachment in all cases with pars plana vitrectomy.

In some cases of retinal detachment, spontaneous attachment has been noticed. Haik et al. reported spontaneous attachment in four patients over seven and half years. Thus it is important to consider this factor prior to any surgical treatment.

Close monitoring of the fellow eye in unilateral cases of MGS is essential. The fellow eye may develop a cataract or retinal detachment. Accordingly, phacoemulsification and lens implantation is done, or vitreoretinal surgery is undertaken.
