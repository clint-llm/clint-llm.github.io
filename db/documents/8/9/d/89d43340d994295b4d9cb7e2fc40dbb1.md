Despite the rarity of MNTI, which makes it difficult to assess the complication of this tumor, this rapidly growing mass may cause facial asymmetry and invade muscles, bony structures and act in a locally destructive manner. Metastasis is rare but has been reported in limited cases. Treatment also can lead to complications as well. For example, surgical excision of the mass may lead to local nerve and tissue injury as well as potential disfiguration. Chemotherapy may cause side effects such as ototoxicity.
