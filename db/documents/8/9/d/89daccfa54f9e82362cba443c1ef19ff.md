After the filtration surgery, the patients should be started on steroids (1% prednisolone or 0.1% dexamethasone) or steroids or antibiotics combination (1% prednisolone + 0.5% moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin) in the tapering doses of 8/7/6/5/4/3/2/1 for one week each. Antiglaucoma drugs may or may not be needed based on the postoperative IOP spike. The patient should be regularly followed-up to rule out any complications associated with the surgery.
