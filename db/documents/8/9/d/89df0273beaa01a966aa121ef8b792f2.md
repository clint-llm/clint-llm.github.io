The dawn phenomenon, and more recently, the extended dawn phenomenon (persistence of hyperglycemia into the later morning hours), have been studied extensively with numerous articles published on the subject. Both entities are responsible for morning glucose elevations, which areÂ difficult to control. The dawn phenomenon has been documented in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and has been demonstrated in all age groups, even patients with type 2 diabetes over 70 years of age. For both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, its prevalence is estimated to exceed 50 percent.
