- Acanthamoeba is a rare cause of keratitis that is both difficult to diagnose and treat. The clinician should have a high suspicion for AK in the setting of keratitis that is not responsive to standard first-line treatments.

- Most cases of AK develop in contact lens wearers. Though poor lens hygiene is implicated, most multipurpose solutions are ineffective against Acanthamoeba.

- The classic findings of AK on slit-lamp examination are a ring-shaped infiltrate and radial keratoneuritis. Notably, ring-shaped infiltrates are only present in the advanced stage, and even then, only in 50% of patients.

- Biguanides and diamidines are the first-line treatment for AK. The use of topical corticosteroids is controversial and discouraged by many physicians.
