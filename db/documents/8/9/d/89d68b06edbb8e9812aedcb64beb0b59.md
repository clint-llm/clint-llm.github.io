The embryology of the portal venous system begins during the fourth week of gestation and continues to the twelfth week. During development, the hepatic portal system is composed of the vitelline venous system in conjunction with the umbilical veins. The primitive venous system of the liver begins as the right and left vitelline veins. Over time, these two veins undergo selective involution involving the cranial portion of the left vitelline vein and their anastomoses. The dorsal and cranio-ventral anastomoses give rise to the main portal vein and the left portal vein, respectively.
