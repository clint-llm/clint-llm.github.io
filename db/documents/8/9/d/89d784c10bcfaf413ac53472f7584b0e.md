Hereditary spherocytosis, a type of congenital hemolytic anemia, is the most prevalent cause of hemolytic anemia due to an abnormal red cell membrane. These atypical erythrocytes are unable to maintain their normal biconcave shape due to genetic mutations in the membrane/cytoskeletal proteins that play a role in structural morphologic stability. The clinical manifestations vary according to the severity of the disease. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of hereditary spherocytosis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in providing quality care.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of hereditary spherocytosis.
- Describe the presentation of hereditary spherocytosis.
- Summarize the treatment of
hereditary spherocytosis.
- Identify the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team in the prompt recognition of hereditary spherocytosis and referring these patients to a hematologist for better management.
