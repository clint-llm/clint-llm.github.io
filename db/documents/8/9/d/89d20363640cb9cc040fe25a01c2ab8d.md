**Alzheimer Disease**

One clinical implication of the EW nucleus is its association with Alzheimer disease. Being that there are more than 5.4 million Americans estimated to be affected by AlzheimerÂ disease and that this neurodegenerative disease is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, this relationship could prove to be an important finding in the understanding of the disease.

**Weber Syndrome**

Weber syndrome is a rare brainstem infarct syndrome characterized by occlusion of one of the paramedian branches of the basilar artery or posterior cerebral artery. The resulting infarction affects the oculomotor nucleus and the cerebral peduncle.

**Benedikt Syndrome**

Benedikt syndrome (otherwise known as paramedian midbrain syndrome) is the name given to the rare clinical syndrome resulting from the infarction of branches from the posterior cerebral artery that supplies oculomotor nerve fascicles and the red nucleus.**.**

Other clinical considerations would include the presence of structural lesions that could lead to the compression of the nucleus. These lesions include tumors, aneurysms, and impaired CSF outflow leading to cerebral aqueduct enlargement.
