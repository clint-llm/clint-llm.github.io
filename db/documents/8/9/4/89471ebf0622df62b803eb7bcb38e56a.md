Nocturnal cough can be due to the disease of the upper airway, lower airway, gastrointestinal system, or cardiovascular system. Following are the differential diagnoses of nocturnal cough.

- The most common cause of an acute/subacute cough is a viral respiratory tract infection

- Upper airway cough syndrome

- Asthma

- GERD

- Non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis

- Bronchiectasis

- Bronchogenic carcinoma

- Chronic aspiration

- COPD

- Congestive heart failure

- Foreign body of the airway

- ILD

- Tracheoesophageal fistula

In adults with a cough longer than eight weeks, most of the cases are due to post-nasal drip, asthma, eosinophilic bronchitis, and GERD. The causes of chronic cough are the same in children with the addition of bacterial bronchitis.
