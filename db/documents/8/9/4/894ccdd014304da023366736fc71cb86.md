If there is any dispute with the family regarding brain death and treatment, nurses should not hesitate to call the ethics team to help with the situation. It is essential to be supportive of the family and their wishes during these difficult discussions with an understanding that once the patient has been declared brain dead, the patient is, by definition, dead without any chance of recovery.
