When evaluating a patient for potential Glanzmann thrombasthenia, his or her bleeding and bruising history is a common starting point. Additionally, a family history of bleeding can be an important aid in diagnosis. Epistaxis is particularly prevalent in children,

A voluntary Glanzmann thrombasthenia registry enrolled patients with GT, and their data indicates that the first symptoms occurred at a median age of 1one year and a mean of 5.6 years. Of the enrollees, 85% were diagnosed with GT by 14 years of age.

Physical examination is focused on identifying bleeding and its sequelae, such as ecchymoses.
