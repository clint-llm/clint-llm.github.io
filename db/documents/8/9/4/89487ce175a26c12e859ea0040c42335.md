Metachromatic leukodystrophy is a progressive disease. This means that the symptoms tend to get worse over time. People who have this disease lose all muscle and mental functions eventually. Lifespan often depends on the age at which a person is first diagnosed.

- **Late infantile form**: The prognosis is worse than later-onset forms of the diseases; progression to death typically occurs within five to six years.

- **Juvenile form**: Progression is slower in this form of the disease, and the patients may survive until early adulthood.

- **Adult form**: The disease course in this form of the disease may be static or of insidious progression.
