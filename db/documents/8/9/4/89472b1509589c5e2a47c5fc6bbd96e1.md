An important contributor to thumb function, the extensor pollicis longus (EPL) muscle is an extrinsic thumb muscle that extends and adducts the thumb metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and interphalangeal (IP) joints. Innervated by the posterior interosseous nerve, the EPL receives its blood supply from the anterior interosseous artery, posterior interosseous artery, radial artery, and ulnar artery. Extensor pollicis longus variants are rare, with a prevalence of only 1%. The EPL tendon is associated with pathologies ranging from stenosing tenosynovitis to spontaneous tendon rupture.
