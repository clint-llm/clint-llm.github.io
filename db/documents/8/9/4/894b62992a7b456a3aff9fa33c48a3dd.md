Liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis of glycogenic hepatopathy, typical features are swollen hepatocytes, due to the accumulation of glycogen in the cytoplasm. The hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain shows pale and enlarged hepatocytes with numerous glycogenated nuclei. Diastase enzyme, when added to the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stained specimen, causes enzymatic degradation of glycogen, causing empty hepatocytes (“ghost cells”).
