Microscopically, cavernous hepatic hemangiomas appear as cavernous vascular spaces. They are lined by endothelium and contain a fibrous stroma. In larger hemangiomas, a fibrous nodule or collagen scar may be seen.

Grossly, the lesions are a sponge-like consistency with a red to brown coloration. They are encased in a thin capsule and well circumscribed. They range from millimeters in size to some greater than 10 cm.
