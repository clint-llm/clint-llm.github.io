Nursing management of hypoglycemic episodes may consist of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic actions. Immediate and frequent glucose monitoring is vital for any patient presenting with symptoms of unstable blood glucose, particularly with hypoglycemia. Nursing management includes administering glucose tablets (approximately three), glucose gel, or carbohydrates for the conscious patient. Carbohydrates may consist of 4 to 6 ounces of fruit juice or soda (not sugar-free), saltine crackers, or hard candy (only if the patient is alert). For the unconscious patient, nursing management of hypoglycemia includes obtaining adequate intravenous access, and possible administration of 50% dextrose or glucagon, per the facility's protocol or provider's order.
