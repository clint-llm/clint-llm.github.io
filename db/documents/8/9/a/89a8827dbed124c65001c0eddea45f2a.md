HFS is dose-related. The treatment for HFS is dose modification or drug interruption.

HFS resolves within two to four weeks of discontinuation of the chemotherapy. In patients who are getting capecitabine, topical urea 10% cream can be used for the prevention of HFS from capecitabine.

For severe grade 3 HFS, subsequent doses of chemotherapy need to be reduced.
