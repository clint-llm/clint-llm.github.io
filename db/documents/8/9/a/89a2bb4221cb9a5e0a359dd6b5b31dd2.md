Since the presentation of porphyrias is variable, the list of differential diagnoses is also diverse. Lead poisoning may present with similar symptoms as an acute porphyria attack. There may also be elevated zinc protoporphyrin levels, however, blood lead levels are more specific. Acute abdomen from surgical or gynecological causes as well asÂ acute viral gastroenteritis are other common differentials, but with acute porphyria, there is no rebound tenderness. Other differential diagnoses include:

- Acute anemia

- Hepatitis B and C

- Hodgkin lymphoma

- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)

- Pediatric acute myelocytic leukemia

- Pediatric generalized anxiety disorder
