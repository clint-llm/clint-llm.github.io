A recurrence occurring after three years has been considered exceptional in the literature.

Pulmonary metastases account for about 16-25% of the reported cases. Pulmonary metastases are treated with wide resection, combined with interferon alfa, chemotherapy, and radiation. When these metastases cannot be fully excised surgically, adjuvant treatments, like radiation or chemotherapy, are generally recommended. For unresectable metastases, both chemotherapy and radiation therapy are implemented. Lung metastases can have poor outcomes.

There is a probability of the presence of a primary bone sarcoma within prominent areas of giant cell reaction and hemorrhage of a newly discovered GCT that was missed at the initial evaluation instead of a malignant transformation explanation.

Overall, GCT has a good prognosis. Pulmonary metastases cause death in 16-25% of the patients presenting them. When a true malignant transformation occurs within a GCT, the prognosis is much worse than for a benign GCT, but it is still somewhat better than for other high-grade sarcomas.
