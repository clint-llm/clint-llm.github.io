It is essential to differentiate between adrenal insufficiency due to primary adrenal hypoplasia or secondary adrenal hypoplasia because treatment gets tailored according to the deficient hormones. In primary adrenal hypoplasia, all the adrenal gland hormones that are synthesized by adrenals, i.e., cortisol, aldosterone, and sex steroids, are deficient. In secondary adrenal hypoplasia, aldosterone replacement is not necessary since it is under the regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Only ACTH-controlled hormones, i.e., cortisol and sex steroids, are decreased.

The fundamentals of the treatment of an adrenal crisis are similar in children and adult patients. Children warrant close monitoring. X-linked AHC gets treated with glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and salt supplementation starting at two weeks of life. Symptoms usually resolve by two months of age, and ACTH and plasma renin activity return to normal. Management involves life-long glucocorticoid replacement therapy. According to guidelines, all adrenal hypoplasia patients who are receiving treatment should keep steroid emergency cards. Hydrocortisone is the preferred steroid as it has mineralocorticoid activity. However, if ordering a cosyntropin stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis, dexamethasone can be given before the test without any interference of results.

Growth hormone therapy (GnRH analogs) should start in patients with growth hormone deficiency.

Testosterone replacement is required when there is delayed puberty during adolescence to ensure normal development of secondary sexual characteristics and bone mineralization.

Emergency treatment of an adrenal crisis in adrenal hypoplasia should focus on correcting metabolic and electrolytic disturbances, including the correction of hypovolaemia and hypoglycemia. If the patient is hypotensive, aggressive fluid resuscitation, as well as, glucocorticoid treatment may be needed.
