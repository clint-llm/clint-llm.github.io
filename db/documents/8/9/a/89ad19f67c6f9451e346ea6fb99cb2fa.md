The human amniotic membrane grafting is used as an adjunctive procedure across surgical specialties and in translational medicine to cultivate stem cells. Experts use amniotic membrane graft (AMG) in multiple specialties, including ophthalmologists, dentists, urologists, burn specialists, ear, nose, and throat surgeons, gynecologists, and researchers in stem cell technology. An amniotic membrane graft is prepared from the placenta. This activity describes its preparation, storage, mechanism of action, and use in ophthalmology.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the physiology and mechanism of action of amniotic membrane graft.
- Describe the preparation, storage, and transport of amniotic membrane graft.
- Review the indications of amniotic membrane grafting in ophthalmology and techniques of utilization.
- Outline the role of interprofessional collaboration for ensuring the best patient care outcomes.
