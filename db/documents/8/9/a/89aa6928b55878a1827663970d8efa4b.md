Glycopyrrolate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to glycopyrronium, excipients, or other ingredients in the anticholinergic class. The following is a list of medical conditions that would preclude the use of anticholinergic therapy, categorized by the system:

- Ophthalmic: angle-closure glaucoma

- Cardiovascular: mitral stenosis and cardiovascular instability in acute hemorrhage

- Gastrointestinal: hiatal hernia, gastrointestinal obstruction, paralytic ileus, reflux esophagitis, severe ulcerative colitis, toxic megacolon, intestinal atony in elderly or debilitated patients
