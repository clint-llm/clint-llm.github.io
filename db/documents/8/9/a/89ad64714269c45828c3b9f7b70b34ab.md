Most believe the hypothesis underlying Duret hemorrhage is due to the distortion of the pontine perforating branches against the relatively immobile basilar artery due to caudal displacement of the upper brainstem by descending transtentorial herniation coupled with an anterior-posterior elongation of the brainstem by the side to side compression. However, some authors have also postulated a venous origin of these hemorrhages due to obstruction of venous return resulting from a sudden increase in intracranial pressure, which results in venous thrombosis, infarcts, and hemorrhages.
