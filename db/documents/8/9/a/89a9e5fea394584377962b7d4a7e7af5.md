Coronary artery calcification increases with age and is more common in men than women. Furthermore, people with metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, tobacco use, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and a high baseline C-reactive protein level are at an increased risk to develop coronary artery calcification. It is to be noted that coronary artery calcification has 2 main subtypes, intimal and medial. Intimal artery calcification is correlated with advanced age, tobacco use, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Conversely, medial calcification is associated with kidney disease.
