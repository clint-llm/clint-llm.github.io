The physical examination is the most important aspect of the diagnosis of craniosynostosis. Radiological imaging studies are usually not required to diagnose positional plagiocephaly but may be helpful in unclear cases.

Conversely, synostotic infant head shape abnormalities require radiographic evaluation of the abnormal sutures either by skull X-ray or computed tomography (CT scan of the head. CT imaging with three-dimensional image reconstruction is the imaging modality of choice. Other imaging modalities, such as ultrasonography prior to fontanelle closure or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may also be employed if there is a concern for intracranial abnormalities, such as hydrocephalus. In synostotic brachycephaly (bicoronal synostosis), CT imaging studies usually demonstrate the thickening of the sutures implicated. Skull x-rays will demonstrate a sclerotic margin along the suture of interest. In some instances, there may be non-visualization of these sutures. Genetic tests may be undertaken if affected infants present with additional features suggesting the presence of an underlying genetic syndrome.
