Classic galactosemia: Classic galactosemia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the deficiency of GALT. It usually arouses clinician suspicion in infants with an abnormal newborn screen, hypergalactosemia, or galactosuria. Almost all the patients manifest in the neonatal period if not diagnosed at birth. Classic galactosemia results in life-threatening complications, including feeding problems, failure to thrive, hepatocellular damage, E. coli sepsis, and bleeding. If dietary restrictions start within ten days of life, complications of liver failure, sepsis, and neonatal death are preventable.

Duarte galactosemia (DG): It is an autosomal recessive condition resulting from partial impairment of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT).

Epimerase deficiency galactosemia: Epimerase deficiency should be considered in an infant with failure to thrive, liver disease, and elevated erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate concentration with normal GALT enzyme activity. Detection of reduced GALE enzyme activity is diagnostic.
