During the last decades, electrophysiology has evolved into an essential subspecialty in the field of cardiology. Through meticulous electrophysiologic studies (EPS), researchers have gained insight into the mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias, developing very effective ablative therapies. This activity reviews the fundamental knowledge required for the interpretation of an electrophysiologic study and highlights the role of the arrhythmia team in the management of patients with cardiac arrhythmias.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of electrophysiologic study.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to electrophysiologic study and its interpretation.
- Summarize appropriate evaluation of the potential complications of the electrophysiologic study and clinical significance of its interpretation.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the electrophysiologic study and improve outcomes for arrhythmia patients.
