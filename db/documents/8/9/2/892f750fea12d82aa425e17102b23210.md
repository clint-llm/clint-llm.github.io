Among the sites at which tributaries of the portal vein anastomose with systemic veins (portocaval anastomoses), the umbilicus is one of the important sites. Cutaneous veins surrounding the umbilicus (tributaries of the superficial and inferior epigastric veins) anastomose with small tributaries of the portal vein called paraumbilical veins. Elevated pressures of the portal venous system cause these anastomoses to recanalize to create dilated veins radiating from the umbilicus called caput medusae and can also result in esophageal and rectal varices. However, the blood flow in the dilated veins is normal and does not break the barrier of the watershed line.

The blockage of the hepatic portal vein or vascular channels in the liver can interfere with the pattern of venous return from abdominal parts of the gastrointestinal system. Vessels that interconnect the portal and caval systems can become greatly distended and tortuous, allowing blood in tributaries of the portal system to bypass the liver, enter the systemic caval system, and thereby return to the heart.

In vena caval obstruction, the thoracoepigastric veins open up, connecting the great saphenous vein with the axillary vein. In a superior vena cava obstruction, the blood in the thoracoepigastric vein flows downward, breaking the barrier of water-shed line. In an inferior vena cava obstruction, the blood flows upward, once again crossing the watershed line.
