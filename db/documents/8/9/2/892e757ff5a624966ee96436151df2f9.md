Alpha thalassemia is prevalent in Asian and African populations while beta-thalassemia is more prevalent in the Mediterranean population, although it is relatively common in Southeast Asia and Africa too. Prevalence in these regions may be as high as 10%. The true numbers of thalassemia affected patients in the United States are unknown, as there is no effective screening method in place.
