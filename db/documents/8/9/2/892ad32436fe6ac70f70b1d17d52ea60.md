- Sternoclavicular injuries are rare due to the strong ligamentous support of the joint.

- A significant force is required to cause a dislocation although spontaneous subluxation can occur.

- If suspicion for sternoclavicular joint injury exists, the patient should be evaluated emergently.

- Although radiographs can be helpful, the diagnosis is made with CT.

- Most patients can be managed nonoperatively with analgesia, rest including a sling or figure-of-8 brace, physical therapy, and a graded return to activities of daily living.

- Reduction of acute anterior or posterior dislocations should be done in consultation with an orthopedic surgeon.

- Posterior sternoclavicular joint dislocations are a surgical emergency requiring evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon due to the proximity of the great vessels and mediastinal structures.

- In patients younger than 25, the provider also needs to consider medial clavicle physeal fracture.
