Pediatric trauma results in over 11,000 deaths and over 8 million ED visits annually.

Soft tissue injuries to the face are common, with approximately 34 to 92% of facial trauma presentations in children having soft tissue injury, generally contusions or lacerations, and around 15 to 69% having a dental injury.

There are more than 22,000 pediatric dental trauma cases annually, with 10 to 60% of pediatric athletes report having experienced dental trauma at some point.

Many minor facial traumas can be treated in the home without contacting the medical system. Thus there is likely underreporting of facial trauma as care at home or in stand-alone clinics may not be captured in a hospital or systems-based data collection.

Neonates and toddlers generally have an equal gender representation or a slight male bias. However, with increasing age, there is an increasing predominance of male involvement, attaining a case gender ratio of male-to-female 2 to 1 to 4 to 1 by late adolescence.

The cause of injury is highly correlated with age. Overall, 38 to 55% of presentations were due to a fall or play, typically in children under six years of age.
