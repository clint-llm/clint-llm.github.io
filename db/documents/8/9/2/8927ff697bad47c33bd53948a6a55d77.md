Complications of enteroviral infections include the development of secondary infections, progression to persistent or chronic disease, irreversible paralysis, destruction of lung tissue, and exacerbation of underlying diseases. Acute exacerbations of COPD and asthma are among the most common complications of rhinoviral infections.

As there are no approved treatments for enteroviruses, mitigating risk factors and preventing co-infections is vital to reducing the risk of complications.
