Sever disease, or calcaneal apophysitis, is an overuse injury in young athletes that causes heel pain. This overuse injury is thought to be caused by a traction apophysitis at the heel, correlating with the Achilles tendon insertion site. It presents in children and adolescents undergoing a rapid growth spurt or who take part in sports involving running and jumping. The pain classically resolves on rest or periods of inactivity. The disease has a self-limited course and management includes activity modification or relative rest as guided by pain. Symptoms may be managed with anti-inflammatory medications, ice, heel cups or heel lifts, and in severe cases, immobilization. This activity describes the evaluation and management of Sever's disease and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of a patient with Sever disease.
- Describe the pathophysiology of Sever disease.
- Summarize the treatment options for Sever disease.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members in rehabilitating the affected patient using heel cord stretching and strengthening that will improve symptoms in those with Sever disease.
