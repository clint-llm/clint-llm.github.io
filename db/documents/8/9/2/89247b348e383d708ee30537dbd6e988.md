A basic understanding of the anatomy of articular (i.e., hyaline) cartilage is important in preparation for osteochondral allograft transplantation.

The **extracellular matrix**makes up approximately 65% to 80% of the total mass of cartilage and is composed of water, type II collagen, and proteoglycan.

**Chondrocytes**are the cells within the articular cartilage that produce collagen, proteoglycans, and enzymes. They are derived from chondroblasts and physiologically respond to mechanical loading and hydrostatic pressure changes.

Normal articular cartilage is composed of four major layers:

- The **superficial zone**(i.e., tangential zone) is, as the name suggests, the most superficial layer and has the highest concentration of collagen with the lowest concentration of proteoglycans. Within this zone, the collagen fibers are oriented parallel to the joint, and it is here where only articular progenitor cells are found.

- The **intermediate zone**is deep to the superficial zone and is the thickest layer of the four zones. Its abundant collagen with random orientation and proteoglycans sets it apart from the superficial and deep zones.

- The **deep zone**(i.e., basal layer) is beneath the intermediate zone. It has the highest concentration of proteoglycans and the lowest concentration of collagen, with the collagen fibers being oriented perpendicular to the joint.

- The **tidemark**is the deepest layer separating the articular cartilage from the subchondral bone.
