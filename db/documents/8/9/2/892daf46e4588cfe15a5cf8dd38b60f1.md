Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (CNLDO) is defined as the failure of drainage of tears down the nasolacrimal system in the neonatal age group. It results in tearing, which is termed "epiphora." The prevalence of CNLDO is between 5% and 20%.

Of interest is the finding of Cassidy in 1952, who noted that there was obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct in 13 of 15 stillborn infants. His postulation that patency of the nasolacrimal duct occurs within the first few days to weeks after birth is a reasonable one.

Children most often present within a few months of birth with epiphora and sometimes mucoid discharge from one or both sides. However, even with symptoms present since birth, patients may present when several years old. Other causes of epiphora in children like epiblepharon, congenital glaucoma, foreign body, corneal infections, and corneal dystrophies need to be excluded. Wheres the Jones 1 test where insertion of fluorescein dye into the eye is followed by the presence of dye in the nose after 5 minutes may be used, it is rarely used now since the clinical history and observation of the tearing, and mucoid discharge generally confirms the diagnosis. Similarly, the dye disappearance test over 5 minutes may also be used, but there may be significant false positive and negative results in infants.
