Lymph nodes are involved in the production of both cellular and humoral immunity. They filter all kinds of foreign material, viruses, bacteria, and tumor cells. In response to the antigens that are presented to T lymphocytes, activated T and B lymphocytes are produced. They also aid lymph drainage. In the absence of lymph nodes, as is the case in cancer patients post lymphadenectomy, lymphedema develops, and the risk for angiosarcoma is increased.
