Patients with DBA should be monitored with complete blood counts frequently.

Relatives of DBA are at risk of developing DBA, given approximately 40 to 45% of autosomal dominant DBA patients have inherited a pathognomic variant from one of the parents. Additionally, X-linked inheritance has been noted.

Approximately 55 to 60% of cases of DBA are found to have a de-novo pathognomic variant; this may be a result of alternate paternity or maternity, including assisted reproduction or adoption.
