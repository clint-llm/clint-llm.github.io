GBM has typical features of malignant tumors like atypical cells, nuclear hyperchromasia, increased mitotic figures, angiogenesis, and necrotic areas GBM has high vascularity.

Two patterns of necrotic regions are observed, one is a large necrotic area in the center resulting in insufficient blood supply, other is multiple small foci surrounded by pseudopalisading. The first is typically observed in primary glioblastoma, while the second is seen in both primary and secondary variety.

WHO classification categorizes GBM according to histopathology and molecular patterns. According to histopathology, astrocytomas contain glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Loss of its expression indicates increasing malignancy and denotes undifferentiated tumor cells. Molecular pattern includes IDH-mutant and IDH-wild type detected by Immunohistochemistry (IHC).

Tumors are classified morphologically by WHO as grade I–IV. Grade I includes benign tumors; grade II includes relatively benign tumors; grade III includes low-grade malignant tumors, and grade IV represents aggressive malignant tumors. Grade IV tumors usually have a median survival of 6–12 months. Glioblastoma multiforme is classified as grade IV.
