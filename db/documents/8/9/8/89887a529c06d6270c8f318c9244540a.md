Although the earliest reported use of mechanical ventilation is in the 16th century, its use has become widespread in the 20th century in patients with respiratory failure. Over the decades,Â optimal respiratory care and ventilator support have been supported by strong clinical evidence. Mechanical ventilation is triggered by either change in respiratory flow or pressure. Change in the respiratory flow (commonly termed as flow trigger) may cause false triggering or missed triggering. This produces patient-ventilator asynchrony.

Invasive mechanical ventilation causes alveolar overdistention, pulmonary air leaks, and small airway injury.
