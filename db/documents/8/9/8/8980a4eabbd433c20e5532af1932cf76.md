A thorough review of the patient's past medical history, surgical history, medications, and allergies is imperative to optimize outcomes. A critical review of previous cardiac imaging and tests, including electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, stress tests, and past angiograms, helps to delineate coronary anatomy in preparation for the planned intervention. Understanding any previous interventions is essential for planning before the procedure. Based on patient anatomy and the proceduralist's personal preference, an arterial access site should be chosen before starting the case. All personals who will be in contact with the patient must scrub using sterile technique. After necessary members have been donned in sterile gowns and gloves, and a time-out has been conducted, the orbital atherectomy (OA) procedure can begin.
