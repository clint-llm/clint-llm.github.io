H1N1 influenza is a subtype of influenza A virus, a communicable viral illness which causes upper and in some cases lower respiratory tract infections in its host. This results in symptoms such as nasal secretions, chills, fever, decreased appetite, and in some cases, lower respiratory tract disease. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of H1N1 influenza and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the global, historical impact of H1N1 influenza.
- Summarize the transmission of H1N1 influenza. 
- Describe the common symptoms associated with H1N1 influenza. 
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination, with particular emphasis on communication between interprofessional medical teams, to enhance prompt and thorough delivery of care to patients with H1N1 influenza and prevent further disease spread.
