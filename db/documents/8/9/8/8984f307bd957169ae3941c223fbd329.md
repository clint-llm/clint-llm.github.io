There are several types of necrotic processes that occur following injury or an infection. The final diagnosis of the type of necrosis is made by the pathologist. Sometimes patients may need to be referred to the surgeon or radiologist for aspiration or debridement of the necrotic tissues. Often radical debridement is required in cases of fournierÂ gangrene and the patient and family should be notified about the possibility of a stoma. If time permits, a stoma nurse should visit patients who are about to undergo an abdominal procedure for gangrene or necrosis.
