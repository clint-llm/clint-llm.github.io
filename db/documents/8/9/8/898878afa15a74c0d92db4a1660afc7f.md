There are few absolute contraindications for rapid sequence intubation. These contraindications include complete upper airway obstruction and the loss of facial or oropharyngeal landmarks, which will require a surgical airway to be placed.

Relative contraindications are related to issues that may lead to procedural failure, and this can be due to injuries to the airway, anatomic abnormalities, and the proficiency of the clinician.
