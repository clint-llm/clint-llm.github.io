Clinical laboratory scientists (medical technologists) must perform laboratory procedures both accurately and safely.

Pathogen-specific and risk-specific biosafety measures are shown to be more practical and cost-effective.

Proper disposal of wastes is necessary to prevent disease transmission.

Recording and reporting procedures must be free from possible contamination and clean and dedicated space.

Because of the complexity of the laboratory work, one must be well-trained and supervised to performÂ biosafety measures at work, while non-authorized personnel must have restricted access to the laboratory, especially when a diagnostic test is in process.
