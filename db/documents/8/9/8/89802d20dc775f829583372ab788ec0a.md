Pulmonary artery banding (PAB) is a palliative surgical technique used for the correction of congenital cardiac defects, characterized by pulmonary over-circulation caused by left-to-right shunting of blood. PAB is reserved for palliation in a certain subset of infants with complex congenital heart disease.

In patients with D & L transposition of great arteries (TGA), PBA helps "train" the left ventricle in preparation for a staged arterial switch procedure. A multidisciplinary team of healthcare workers, including cardiothoracic surgeons, pediatric cardiologists, cardiac anesthesiologists, surgical and intensive care nurses, and perfusionists, is involved in the pre-surgical planning, intra-procedural support, and post-surgical care.
