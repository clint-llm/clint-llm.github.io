In the United States, Lyme disease is caused by the bacterial spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted by the bite of an Ixodes genus tick, mostly commonly Ixodes scapularis. In Eurasia, the predominant causes are B. burgdorferi, Borrelia afzelii, and Borrelia garinii.

B. Burgdoferi has a particular affinity for the joint. B.garinii is exclusively found in Europe and has selectivity for causing white matter encephalitis. B. afzelli has an affinity for the skin and is found at the site of the infection.

There are several Ixodes subspecies that transmit Borrelia.
