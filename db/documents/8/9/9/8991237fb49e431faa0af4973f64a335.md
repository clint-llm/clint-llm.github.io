The splenic artery (branching off the celiac artery) supplies blood flow to the spleen in combination with the short gastric arteries (branches off of the left gastroepiploic artery).

One of the most common causes of splenic infarction sickle hemoglobinopathies. In patients with sickle cell disease, episodes of hypoxia or acidosis cause red blood cells to transform into an abnormal shape leading to crystallization and occlusion of the vasculature. This process can lead to multiple infarctions beginning in childhood. Over time, multiple infarctions cause scarring and contraction of the spleen. This may ultimately result in complete splenic autoinfection by the time of adulthood.

Diseases which cause splenomegaly may place patients at risk for splenic infarction. These diseases include chronic myelogenous leukemia, myelofibrosis, Gaucher disease, Malarial splenomegaly syndrome, AIDS with mycobacterium avium complex, Lymphoma.

Rarely, abnormal splenic vascular anatomy may cause infarction. An anatomical variant known as the wandering spleen has been identified in which the spleen has an abnormal vascular attachment that predisposes to torsion.
