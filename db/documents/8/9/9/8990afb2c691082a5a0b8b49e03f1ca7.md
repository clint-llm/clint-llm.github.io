Overall prognosis in patients with pancreatic ascites has improved with the availability of endoscopic interventions. A course of conservative medical management leads to recovery in approximately 30% to 50% of patients. Endoscopic placement of a transpapillary stent appears to have a success rate of 82% to 100%. For those in whom medical and endoscopic management fail, a surgical approach is often taken with reported mortality ranging from 15% to 25%. Recent studies suggest that endoscopic management has reduced mortality, hospital length of stay, recurrence, and cost more than medical and surgical interventions alone.
