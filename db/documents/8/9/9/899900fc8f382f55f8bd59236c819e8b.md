The treatment for BRVO is the prevention of the complications that cause vision loss and treatment of those complications, primarily macular edema and neovascularization. The systemic risk factors should be optimized in consultation with the patient's internist. The 2 general approaches to treating BRVO are pharmacologic management or surgical intervention. Pharmacologic management of BRVO involves intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF therapy and/or corticosteroids. For anti-VEGF injections, one study showed patients with BRVO who were injected monthly with either 0.5 or 0.3 mg of ranibizumab versus those receiving sham injections showed greater than 15%Â improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline at 12 months.

The Branch Vein Occlusion Study (BVOS) established macular laser treatment as the standard of care for BRVO.
