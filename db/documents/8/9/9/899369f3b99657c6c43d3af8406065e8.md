Mitral valve edge-to-edge repair procedure is typically performed in a catheterization lab or hybrid operating room with fluoroscopic capability and requires real-time TEE. TEE is essential to confirm the pathology, guide the procedure and ensure adequate repair. This procedure is usually performed under general anesthesia (GA) to facilitate TEE evaluation and avoid patient movement, which can be catastrophic. Pre-operative echocardiography (usually TEE) should be done to assess the lesion and ease of repair. Pre-anesthesia evaluation should be done to optimize patients for general Anesthesia. Typically structural heart team discussion involves the entire peri-procedure team - interventional cardiologist, cardiac anesthesiologist, operating room personnel, and nursing staff. The equipment and devices should be available and preferably pre-procedure time out to ensure appropriate communication between the team.

Before undergoing a catheter-based approach to MR, management requires a thorough assessment of the mitral valve apparatus by echocardiogram and sometimes other forms of cardiac imaging by a trained cardiovascular interventionalist. Sometimes a cardiovascular imaging specialist is used for the consult. The principal preparation for any procedure is to obtain a sterile field. As in most catheterizations, the site of sterilization is the site of catheter insertion. All personnel close to the sterile field should scrub and be fully gowned. Clean and drape the area before beginning the procedure.

**Device Selection**

The primary criteria to be taken into account while choosing a device are shown in [Table 5]. Using 3D echocardiography, it is crucial to carefully assess the underlying etiology, baseline mitral valve area, mean transmitral gradient, and anatomical complexity before selecting the appropriate device.

Multiplanar reconstruction on precisely collected high-resolution 3D volumes of the mitral valve should ideally be utilized to quantify the mitral valve area. The deployment of a PASCAL P10 device reduces the mitral valve area by roughly 47%. The baseline mitral valve area is anticipated to be more significantly impacted by the use of rigid implants with extended arms (XTW/XT).  The mitral valve area reduction achieved with the NTR and XTR implants was  52% and 57%, respectively

Two key variables that affect device selection are treatment strategy and jet localization. In fact, a greater baseline mitral valve area of around 6 cm2 is needed in individuals with discrete jets, in whom the implantation of two distant clips is anticipated, to prevent causing significant mitral valve stenosis
