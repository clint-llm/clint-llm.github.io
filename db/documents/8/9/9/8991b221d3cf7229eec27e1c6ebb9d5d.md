The main purpose of screening for hypertensive retinopathy is that retinal vessels are the only blood vessels visible on routine examination. The effects of chronically elevated HTN are easily visible in the eye as hypertensive retinopathy and choroidopathy, and this reflects the vascular changes occurring in other systems.Â Ophthalmologists and general physicians should work in collaborations to ensure that hypertensive patients are efficiently screened, and timely managed to reduce the risk of ocular and systemic morbidity and mortality.

The management of hypertensive retinopathy depends on the severity of the disease:

- Mild hypertensive retinopathy: The treatment consists of controlling of BP with regular monitoring.

- Moderate hypertensive retinopathy: Referral to a physician is essential to exclude other associated factors like diabetes mellitus and to check for any cardiovascular abnormalities. Routine care including BP control and monitoring is a must.

- Severe hypertensive retinopathy: Requires urgent treatment and referral as it has the strongest association with mortality. Other systems such as renal, cardiovascular, and brain should be monitored for signs of TOD.

Important to note is that BP should be lowered in a controlled fashion. This is crucial to prevent ischemic damage to vital organs such as optic nerve and brain.
