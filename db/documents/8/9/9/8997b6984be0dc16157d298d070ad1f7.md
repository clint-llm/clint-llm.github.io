Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular pathogen capable of causing a broad spectrum of human disease. The clinical course of the disease depends on the site of bacterial inoculation. The L serovars of Chlamydia trachomatisÂ have the capability of invading beyond the mucosal surface. Infectivity is mediated by binding of the organism to epithelial cells via a heparin sulfate-like ligand.
