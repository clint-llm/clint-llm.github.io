Known risk factors for PTC include:

**Radiation Exposure**

The incidence of papillary thyroid cancer is greater in people with a history of exposure to significant ionizing radiation.

**Childhood Exposure**

External low-dose radiation therapy to the head and neck during childhood, used in the 1940s to 1960s to treat various benign diseases, predispose to PTC. The average time from irradiation to tumor recognition is approximately ten years but may be longer than 30 years.**Medical Therapy**

High radiation doses (> 2000 cGy) used in treating malignant diseases have also been associated with an increased risk of PTC. **Environmental Exposure**

The Chornobyl nuclear accident, which occurred on April 26, 1986, led to a 3- to 75-fold increase in the incidence of PTC in fallout regions, especially in younger children.

**Genetics**

A few familial syndromes are associated with PTC, including familial adenomatous polyposis—Gardner syndrome, Werner syndrome, and Carney complex type 1. Familial PTC cases have been reported in 5% of all patients with PTC and may portend a more aggressive disease course.

**Other**

There is a higher incidence of PTC in regions with high dietary iodine intake and patients with preexisting benign thyroid disease.

There is also a trend for an increased incidence of thyroid cancer due to being overweight or obese, as shown in a report studying the changes in the frequency of thyroid cancer between 1995 to 2015.
