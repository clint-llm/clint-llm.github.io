Solid and cystic pseudopapillary and epithelial neoplasms of the pancreas are encapsulated and have a variegated and degenerative appearance with solid, cystic, and papillary areas with foci of hemorrhage and necrosis.

Rarely these neoplasms are associated with malignant transformation. The criteria for malignancy have not been well defined. Invasive features such as lymphovascular or perineural invasion with or without infiltration into the surrounding organs point towards a malignant neoplasm. Morphologically malignant neoplasms present as lobulated with focal margins and incomplete encapsulations, whereas, benign neoplasms are round with lobulated margins and complete encapsulation. While solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas is considered to have a low Ki-67 proliferation index because of the indolent nature of such tumors, one study highlighted the role of Ki-67 in prognostication of the adverse outcome in patients with SPENs and therefore should be a consideration as part of the routine histological assessment.
