On January 24, 2006, The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an entity of the United States of Department of Health and Human Services, published a final rule on the content and format of labeling for human prescription drugs and biologics.

The FDA’s primary purpose of drug labeling is to ensure patient safety by giving healthcare professionals a summary of the safety and efficacy of a drug. The labeling is not aimed at a patient population because prescription drug administration is always under the supervision of a healthcare practitioner that is licensed to prescribe the medication.

The following list is an outline of the requirements in a drug label:

- Highlights (a concise summary of label information)

- Full prescribing Information

- Limitations Statement

- Product Names

- Date of Initial U.S. Approval

- Boxed Warning

- Recent Major Changes

- Indications and Usage

- Dosage & Administration

- Dosage Forms & Strengths

- Contraindications

- Warnings & Precautions

- Adverse Reactions (listing of most common adverse reactions)

- Drug Interactions

- Use in Specific Populations

- Patient Counseling Information Statement
