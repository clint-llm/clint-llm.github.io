Guyon canal serves as a protection for the ulnar nerve and ulnar artery as they traverse from the distal wrist into the hand. It is formed by the following structures:

- The volar portion/roof of the canal is created by the volar carpal ligament (also known as the palmar carpal ligament).

- The transverse carpal ligament forms the dorsal portion/floor of the canal.

- The ulnar border of the canal is formed by the pisiform, pisohamate ligament, and the abductor digiti minimi.

- The radial border is formed by the transverse carpal ligament and hook of the hamate.
