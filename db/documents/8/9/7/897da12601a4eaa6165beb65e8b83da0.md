Bisacodyl administration can be via oral or rectal routes.

In children from 3 to 10 years old, bisacodyl oral or rectal is given in doses of 5 mg per day in one dose at night. Children over ten years old or older can be given up to 10 mg per day in one dose a day at night.

Continued use of bisacodyl may decrease its efficacy, which occurs because bisacodyl increases the production of PGE2, which decreases the expression of AQP3. The effectiveness of compounds that decrease AQP3 expression in the colon can be reduced by continued use.
