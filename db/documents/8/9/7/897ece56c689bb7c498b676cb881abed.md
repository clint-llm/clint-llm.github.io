Disturbances that increase or decrease the production of cellular messengers, hormones in this case, usually lead to pathologic states that affect many organs and systems because of their pleiotropic effects throughout the body; at the cellular level, hormones can affect cell division, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. On a more complex level that comprises organs and systems, hormones can regulate blood pressure, glucose levels, digestion, growth, production of red blood cells, menstrual cycle, and many more processes, which is why clinical manifestations are so varied. Drugs targeting the receptors to modify the signal transduction pathways are being used every day in practice. For example, fenoldopam is a D1 (GsPCR) agonist used for hypertensive emergencies, tamsulosin is alpha1 (GqPCR) antagonist used for benign prostatic hyperplasia, desmopressin is V2 (GsPCR) agonist is used for bedwetting, epoetin is EPO agonist (JAK/STAT pathway) used for anemia associated with chronic kidney disease, and glucagon (GsPCR) injections to treat hypoglycemia.

Although abnormal production is the most common mechanism of disease, it is not the only one; other mechanisms involve different stages of the signaling process; as we saw before, the signaling process entails production, secretion, and reception of the messenger; disruption of any of these processes lead to alteration in signaling.
