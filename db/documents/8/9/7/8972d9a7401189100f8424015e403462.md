If the patient undergoes resection of the involved segment, postoperative complications can occur. These include air leak and pneumothorax, which may require drainage. Postoperative care is a continuum of severity from minimal care to mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, achieving optimal pain control is necessary for patient comfort. Early mobilization of the patient is encouraged to promote rapid recovery.
