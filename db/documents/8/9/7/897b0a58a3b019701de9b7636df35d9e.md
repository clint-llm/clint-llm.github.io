Alveolar osteitis can be assumed when a patient presents within the first week after extractions with severe pain. Depending on the severity of the pain, it could be classified as normal post-operative discomfort or be a result of food debris impaction.

Treatment with intra-alveolar irrigation is indicated with any of the above diagnoses. Some sources contend that pain beyond a week from surgery is not consistent with alveolar osteitis, and others state that persistent pain longer than three weeks necessitates a different diagnosis.

The primary differential diagnosis that needs to be considered is an infection, mainly if there are signs of disease beyond the extraction socket. Symptoms consistent with alveolar osteitis presenting or persisting weeks after surgery are concerning for acute osteomyelitis, subperiosteal infection, or bony sequestra formation. Based on the clinical evaluation of the patient, it may be appropriate to obtain a panoramic radiograph to evaluate healing.
