In the last 15 years, many high profile police events have occurred that have encouraged the development of tactical emergency medical support (TEMS). This concept has been adapted from the military. In WWI, nonmedical personnel was assigned to the trenches to treat the injured. In WWII, these men were put into combat and had become the combat medics in the military we see today. Care and evacuation in the Tactical EMS (TEMS) environment vary significantly from the civilian EMS realm.
