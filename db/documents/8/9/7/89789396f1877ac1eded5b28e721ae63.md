**Structure**

The posterior compartment of the lower leg consists of superficial and deep divisions. The three muscles within the superficial posterior compartment include the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris muscles. The deep posterior compartment muscles include the flexor hallucis longus (FHL), flexor digitorum longus (FDL), TPM, and popliteus muscles.

The TPM's muscle belly originates from many proximal attachments; these attachments include the posterior surface of the upper half of the posterior tibia, the middle of the posterior fibula, and the posterior interosseous membrane. These deep attachments lie in the center between the FDL and the FHL. The tibialis posterior tendon (TPT) travels distally, then posterior to the medial malleolus along with the FDL tendons, posterior tibial artery, tibial nerve, and FHL.

Once the TPT travels distal to the medial malleolus, it courses along the plantar aspect of the foot, where it splits into three components: primary, plantar, and recurrent. This split allows for the broad attachment site of the tibialis posterior tendon (TPT). The main portion inserts primarily onto the navicular bone tubercle as well as the plantar sections of the medial cuneiform. The plantar portion inserts onto the base of the second, third, and fourth metatarsals along with the second and third cuneiform and the cuboid. Finally, the recurrent portion has a small insertion site at the sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus.

The flexor retinaculum (FR), also known as the laciniate ligament and the tarsal tunnel, is a strong fibrous band that covers the medial ankle from the medial malleolus to the calcaneus. The flexor retinaculum forms the canal allowing the passage of the tendons from the posterior compartment of the lower leg. The TPT passes beneath the flexor retinaculum, covered by a synovial lined tunnel acting as a tendon sheath to reduce friction.

**Function**

The tibialis posterior (TP), along with the tibialis anterior, is a primary inverter of the foot. This inversion happens at two synovial joints of the foot: the midtarsal joint, between the talus and navicular bone, and the subtalar joint, between the talus and calcaneus.

Because the tibialis posterior (TP) originates from the posterior compartment of the lower leg, the tibialis posterior is also a secondary plantar flexor of the foot along with the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris muscles.

The plantar insertions of the tibialis posterior allow for support of the medial arch of the foot. The medial arch in a normal person is higher than the lateral arch and is maintained by the following bones: calcaneus, talus, navicular, three cuneiforms, and the first three metatarsals.
