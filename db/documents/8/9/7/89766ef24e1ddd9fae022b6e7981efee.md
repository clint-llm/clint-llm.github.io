Leukodystrophies are generally suspected in pediatric patients with difficulties in meeting appropriate development milestones when previously was able to do so. Peripheral neuropathy can present prior to dysarthria and other CNS manifestations.

- **Late infantile onset**: Onset < 30 months. Typically early milestones are met, followed by a progressive regression of motor skills, ataxia, dysarthria, hypotonia, spasticity, hypotonia, hyporeflexia, extensor plantar posturing, and optic atrophy.

- **Juvenile onset**: Onset between 30 months and puberty, with a heterogeneous presentation. Early milestones are met, followed by psychomotor regression, intellectual decline (e.g., dropped school performance), behavioral difficulties, personality changes, ataxia, upper motor neuron signs, and peripheral neuropathy. In late juvenile-onset, the patient presents similarly, with +/- seizures. Neurocognitive tests demonstrate dementia, memory loss, disinhibition, impulsiveness, decreased motor function, and optic atrophy.

- **Adult onset**: Adult-onset (can present as early as adolescence) shows neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric difficulties. Patients may have dysesthesias (peripheral neuropathy), psychosis, schizophrenia, or seizures. It is frequently misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and dementia. Tends to be exclusively neuropsychiatric with minimal or no motor findings. Neurocognitive tests in this group of patients present similar to the juvenile onset group.
