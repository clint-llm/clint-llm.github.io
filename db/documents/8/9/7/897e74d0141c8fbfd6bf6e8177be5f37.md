The optical canal has crucial surgical implications given the important function of the structures within the canal. A significant surgical procedure involving the optic canal is optic nerve decompression. Some of the indications for optic nerve decompression include traumatic optic neuropathy, non-traumatic optic neuropathy (e.g. Graves ophthalmopathy, space-occupying lesions/tumors of the orbit, periorbital sinuses, and the surrounding structures), idiopathic intracranial hypertension (also known as pseudotumor cerebri), neoplasms (sinonasal tumor, meningioma, orbital apex tumor), and osseous lesions.

Decompression of the optic nerve is achievable through several approaches, including transcranial and transsphenoidal routes. Endoscopic optic nerve decompression is an option for both traumatic and non-traumatic optic neuropathies. However, its utilization has been far less common for non-traumatic optic neuropathy.

Another important structure within the optical canal is the ophthalmic artery. Ophthalmic artery aneurysms pose a serious surgical challenge. By the time patients become symptomatic enough for a diagnosis, they are usually emergency cases. Embolization using the coiling technique is a standard of care. Embolization is contraindicated in cases of large ophthalmic artery aneurysms, atherosclerotic, or hypoplastic internal carotid artery.
