Cholinesterase inhibitors come in many forms. The administration of many available cholinesterase inhibitors is by IM, IV, or oral routes. Different forms can be available for different types of cholinesterase inhibitors. For example, neostigmine has a solution form used to counteract muscle relaxants at the end of surgeries. For patients with myasthenia gravis, an oral form of neostigmine is available for treatment. Rivastigmine, used in patients with dementia, has a transdermal patch form that is also frequently used.
