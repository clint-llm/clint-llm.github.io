A cochlear implant is a device that uses electricity to directly stimulate the spiral ganglion cells of the auditory nerve, bypassing the damaged hearing apparatus and restoring hearing in those with sensorineural hearing loss. A cochlear implant electrode is placed through the round window and implanted in the scala tympani. The electrode provides direct stimulation to the auditory nerve, allowing signals to be sent to the auditory cortex of the brain. Of course, for a cochlear implant to be effective, there must be relatively preserved anatomy of the cochlea and CN VIII.

It is well known that many loop diuretics can be ototoxic, as they inhibit the Na/K/2Cl cotransporter in the stria vascularis. Loop diuretics induce pathological changes in the cochlea, including the formation of edematous spaces in the stria vascularis epithelium. This then leads to decreased cochlear electrical potential and, with long-term use, temporary or permanent sensorineural hearing loss.

From a clinical perspective, dysfunction of normal cochlear physiology will manifest as hearing loss. Cochlear dysfunction should be in the clinician's differential diagnosis for any patient presenting with hearing loss.
