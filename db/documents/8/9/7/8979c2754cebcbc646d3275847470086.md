Careful history taking in women with suspected or confirmed hyperemesis gravidarum should include their pregnancy status, estimated gestational age, history of complications during prior pregnancies, the frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting, any interventions done to treat her symptom(s), and the outcomes of the attempted interventions. The average onset of symptoms happens approximately 5 to 6 weeks into gestation.

The physical exam should include fetal heart rate (depending on gestational age) and an examination of fluid status, including an examination of blood pressure, heart rate, mucous membrane dryness, capillary refill, and skin turgor. A patient weight should be obtainedÂ for comparison to previous and future weights. If indicated, abdominal examination and pelvic examination should occur to determine the presence or absence of tenderness to palpation.
