Neonatal and pediatric patients differ from adults, both anatomically and physiologically, in many aspects that can affect resuscitation. A child’s jaw is shorter than in adults, reducing the available room to maneuver. The hypopharynx is shorter and narrower, with a more anterior location of the vocal cords. This further complicates an initial approach already affected by a proportionally larger head to body size. This limited view is further reduced with the presence of large tonsils and adenoids.

Prematurity, congenital complications, and maternal factors can add to the difficulty in resuscitating neonates. In a crashing patient, familiar causes of cardiac arrest should be considered and treated if present. This includes trauma, tamponade, pneumothorax, and shock due to blood loss or infection. In children, cardiomyopathies and myocarditis should also be included in a differential as their preceding symptomatology may have gone unnoticed. Metabolic derangements secondary to internal disease processes, such as sepsis or toxic ingestion, may result in arrhythmias. In these instances, correction of the underlying cause should be addressed in addition to CPR.

Of note, channelopathies are a common cause of cardiac arrest and SIDS. Between 2% and 10% of SIDS cases result in a known or unknown channelopathy.
