CG is mainly a clinical diagnosis. Histopathology should be considered and, if positive, may be extremely helpful in diagnostic confirmation. Investigations to rule out sarcoidosis (high-resolution computed tomography scan of chest, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels) and purified protein derivative (PPD) testing may be done as per the clinical scenario. Since the period between the onset of lip swellingÂ and the appearance of typical symptoms of Crohn's disease is highly variable and unpredictable, the role of investigations like colonoscopy or gastroduodenoscopy with biopsies in patients without gastrointestinal symptoms remains controversial.
