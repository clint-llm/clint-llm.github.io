The early stage management requires treatment of fever and malaise. Close monitoring of the CNS status is necessary. Sometimes, patients may require intubation and mechanical ventilation as they can not maintain a patent airway.

HAT Trypanosoma brucei gambiense: Treatment during the first stage consists of pentamidine. After patients develop CNS symptoms, patients will require eflornithine and nifurtimox. If no response is achieved, providers may resort to melarsoprol.

HAT Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense: Treatment of the initial stage consists of suramin while treatment of the second stage consists of melarsoprol.

Most studies today show that combination therapy with melarsoprol and nifurtimox is more effective than either solo therapy.
