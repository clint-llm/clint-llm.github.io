Escharotomies often are performed as part of a burn victim's resuscitation care, and the decision is made based on clinical assessments of the patient and their response to treatment provided before that assessment. Generally, an escharotomy is performed when full circumferential thickness (and sometimes partial thickness) burns result in circulatory or respiratory compromise.  In the limbs, this can present with 6 “P”s: pain, pallor, paresthesia (either tingling or numbness), paresis, poikilothermia (usually the affected limb will feel colder than the unaffected one), and absent pulse (late sign). Moreover, decreased oxygen saturation (usually less than 95%), decreased or absent Doppler signals in the affected limb, and high compartment pressure (more than 30mmHg) can also be seen.
