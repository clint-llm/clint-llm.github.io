The combination is contraindicated if the patient has a contraindication to one component.

**Caffeine**

Caffeine use requires caution under the following conditions:

- When used with isoflurane in premature infants, a clinical study on mice showed that caffeine increases the toxicity of isoflurane when used together.

- When used with adolescents at high risk of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury, a study showed that chronic caffeine consumption might alter the recovery from the condition.

- When used in people who have a positive family history of Meniere disease, a study showed that caffeine might lower the age of onset of symptoms in this disease.

**Acetaminophen**

Acetaminophen should be used with caution and in reduced doses (2 to 3 grams per day) in patients with hepatic impairment for a period not exceeding a few days.

Patients with chronic hepatitis C infection are predisposed to developing liver failure after acetaminophen overdose. Also, Acetaminophen showed a dose-dependent enhancement of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, although studies in healthy volunteers have shown no such effect. Competition for CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 metabolic activity, but conditions such as aging and tissue hypoxia alter the activity of these pathways in human studies. Acetaminophen still is the analgesic and antipyretic of choice in patients who take warfarin, but patients should avoid excessive amounts and prolonged administration (greater than 1.3 grams per day for two weeks).

**Aspirin**

Contraindicated in:

- Children under the age of 12 because of the risk of Reye syndrome, except with Kawasaki disease

- An aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease is a form of chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, asthma, and acute reaction after aspirin ingestion. However, when aspirin is necessary as a therapy, aspirin desensitization is the most relevant therapeutic approach that improves the nasal symptoms and appears to stabilize intrinsic asthma.

- In patients with peptic ulcer disease, aspirin is injurious to the mucosa of the stomach and duodenum by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Patients who need to take aspirin should use it with caution, and a proton pump inhibitor is an option during the treatment period.
