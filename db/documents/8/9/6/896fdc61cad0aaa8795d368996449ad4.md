Initial treatment should be focused on assessing the degree of renal impairment and correcting the hemodynamics, volume status, and electrolyte disturbances. In addition, the formation of casts and paraprotein concentration needs to be minimized as early as possible. Most of the patients have some degree of renal injury, which recovers with the treatment of myeloma.

Nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, renin-angiotensin inhibitors, intravenous contrast, and hypotension, need to be avoided. Patients need to be adequately hydrated. Loop diuretics should be avoided, as they can precipitate the cast formation. Depending on the severity of renal impairment and the symptoms, hemodialysis is needed to correct acid-base balance, electrolyte disturbances, volume overload symptoms, and uremic symptoms.

The concentration of the paraproteins can be decreased by the use of chemotherapy and plasma exchange or plasmapheresis. The molecular weight of the FLC is about 25-50 kDa. Evidence favoring the use of plasmapheresis is limited in cast nephropathy due to a large volume of distribution of light chains resulting in a rapid rebound of light chains after the treatment.

About 80% of the patients could have a recovery of renal function by 3 weeks if there is a reduction in the SFLC by at least 60%. This can be achieved by early diagnosis and prompt initiation of treatment. During treatment, labs need to be monitored carefully for any evidence of tumor lysis syndrome, which is characterized by hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. The most common treatment regimen of MM involves cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CyBorD) or lenalidomide, dexamethasone (Rd); lenalidomide, bortezomib, dexamethasone (RVD);Â lenalidomide, thalidomide, dexamethasone (VTD). The most commonly used agent is bortezomib, and it has a rapid onset of action. Therefore, it is not renally dosed. However, the dosing of lenalidomide needs to be adjusted based on the creatinine clearance.

Use of bisphosphonates to reduce the risk of skeletal events and hypercalcemia. The most commonly used agents are pamidronate and zoledronic acid. Caution in the setting of renal failure. Palmidronic acid can cause focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). In the setting of reduced GFR, denosumab is preferred over bisphosphonates.

The risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients with plasma cell dyscrasia and chronic renal insufficiency can be assessed by beta-2-microglobulin levels. Levels less than 2.8 mg/L have a 100% negative predictive value.
