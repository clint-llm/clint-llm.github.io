The malignant, autosomal recessive form of osteopetrosis is frequently fatal in the first years of life without successful bone marrow transplantation treatment. Many patients may undergo multiple attempts at bone marrow transplants without long-lasting success. The other disease forms typically allow patients to live into adulthood with the autosomal dominant form of the disease, having typically very little effect on life span and overall health.
