Adrenergic receptors all have drug antagonists. Alpha-blockers are not generally indicated for the treatment of alpha-agonist overdoses. Beta-blockers may be used to treat adverse effects arising from adrenergic receptor agonists acutely. Beta-blockers can treat tachycardia and hypertension that may occur from vasopressors. Toxicity should be monitored in the pediatric population when using beta-2 agonists as they can increase liver aminotransferase concentrations.

In addition, when prescribing alpha-2 agonists, there are instances where angioedema, atrioventricular (AV) block, and hypersensitivity may occur. Potential toxicities of beta-1 agonists may include tremors, headaches, and vomiting.
