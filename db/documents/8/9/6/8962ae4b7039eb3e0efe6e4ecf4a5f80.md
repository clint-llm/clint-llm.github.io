Evans syndrome is difficult to diagnose and manage; thus it is best treated by an interprofessional team that includes nurses and pharmacists. The condition is usually managed with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents. However, the response is not predictable or consistent.

The outcomes for patients with Evans syndrome are guarded; those who respond to treatment have favorable outcomes.
