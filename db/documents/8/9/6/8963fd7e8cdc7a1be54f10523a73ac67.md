A typical initial HIV regimen includes 3 HIV medications from a minimum of 2 drug classes. Although this treatment is not curative, it can provide longer lives for patients and reduce HIV transmission. This reduction of transmission has become a popular use of antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive individuals with an HIV-negative partner. The successes of antiretroviral therapy have reduced HIV to a chronic condition in many parts of the world as progression to AIDS has become rare. Studies have found that the 3-drug regimen has led to a 60% to 80% decline in rates of AIDs, hospitalization, and death. By 2030 the CDC plans to implement a 90-90-90 plan (90% HIV diagnosed, 90% on therapy, and 90% suppressed). This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and use of HIV antiretroviral therapy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in promoting their safety.

**Objectives:**

- Describe the adverse effects of HIV ART medications.
- Summarize the appropriate monitoring steps of ART.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for HIV patients and improve outcomes.
