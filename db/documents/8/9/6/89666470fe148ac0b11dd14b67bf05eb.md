Caspofungin has a relatively low incidence of adverse effects; the most commonly reported adverse events include chills, fever, phlebitis/thrombophlebitis, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, rash, abdominal pain, headache, and diarrhea.

Caspofungin has been found to cause skin erosions similar to those seen in toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). A case report by Lee et al. describes the development of a rash - erythematous macules and plaques - that quickly progressed to blisters and skin erosions after the administration of caspofungin in an 86-year-old-man with disseminated Candida krusei infection.
