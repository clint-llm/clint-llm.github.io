Hypoglycemia in a non-diabetic individual poses a significant diagnostic dilemma. The differential diagnosis is extensive, and management depends on the cause. Therefore, it requires careful evaluation of the patient. The patient's evaluation and management should involve an interprofessional healthcare team approach involving primary care clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), endocrinologists, specialist diabetes nurse educators, biochemists, pharmacists, radiologists, surgeons, and dieticians. The interprofessional approach is key to diagnosis, management, and improved patient outcomes. Finally, the team needs to coordinate and educate the patient regarding the best way to manage the condition, including the acute management of hypoglycemic episodes. This interprofessionalÂ paradigm to care will yield the best patient outcomes. [Level 5]
