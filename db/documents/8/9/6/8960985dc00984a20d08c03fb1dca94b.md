Antenatal ultrasonography is widely used in pregnancy to assess fetal growth and anatomy. Although ultrasound screening is now an integral part of routine antenatal care, recommendations for the delivery of obstetric ultrasound vary from country to country.

The diagnosis of a fetal anomaly significantly reduces perinatal mortality and morbidity and maternal morbidity. Prenatal diagnosis enables a psychologically less traumatic and early medical termination of pregnancy. It thereby decreases the probable complications of continuation of pregnancy and labor, prevent an unnecessary cesarean section for a fetus with lethal anomalies diagnosed too late for medical termination of pregnancy, and allow planning delivery at the optimal time in a well-equipped tertiary center with necessary neonatal care facilities, and in utero therapy in selected cases. Performed systematically, high-resolution ultrasound can now accurately diagnose more than 200 abnormalities. A normal scan is often obtained, but there is tremendous relief of psychological distress, anxiety, and somatic symptoms after the report.

The detection rate of the screening second-trimester ultrasound scan was good in high-risk patients examined by the well-trained sonographer. On the other hand, in low-risk pregnant women, the scan could also be sensitive in anomaly detection if a systemic searching pattern was followed.
