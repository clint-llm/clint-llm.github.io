Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited cardiac condition characterized by left ventricular muscular hypertrophy in the absence of other cardiac, systemic, or metabolic conditions like hypertension, aortic stenosis, amyloidosis, glycogen storage diseases, or lysosomal storage diseases. The diagnosis is established by non-invasive imaging modalities such as two-dimensional echocardiography (ECHO) or cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), or cardiac computed tomography (CT). The maximal end-diastolic wall thickness of ≥1.5 cm or 1.3 to 1.4cm with a positive family history or positive genetic test without other obvious cause is diagnostic of HCM.

Septal reduction therapy (SRT), either percutaneously or surgically, is effective in reducing LVOT gradients. Even though there is increased mortality among HCM patients with LVOT obstruction, the evidence lacks SRT in asymptomatic patients to improve survival. SRT is recommended in symptomatic patients despite maximal medical therapy in a comprehensive HCM center.
