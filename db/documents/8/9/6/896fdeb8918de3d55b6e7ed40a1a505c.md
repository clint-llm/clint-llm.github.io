The sural nerve forms from the combination of two smaller sensory nerves: the medial sural cutaneous nerve, and the lateral sural cutaneous nerve. The medial sural cutaneous nerve is a terminal branch of the tibial nerve, and the lateral sural cutaneous nerve is a terminal branch of the common peroneal nerve. The union occurs in the distal third of the posterior leg, and the nerve then travels posterolaterally between the two heads of the gastrocnemius aside the short saphenous vein, becoming superficial around the mid-calf. It reaches the lateral malleolus lateral to the Achilles tendon, passing it 2.5 cm posteriorly before running deep to the fibularis tendon sheath and reaching the lateral tuberosity of the fifth toe. At the level of the ankle, the sural nerve and small saphenous vein run posteriorly between the calcaneus and lateral malleolus. The nerve is the preferred site for a biopsy if a peripheral nerve biopsy is necessary.
