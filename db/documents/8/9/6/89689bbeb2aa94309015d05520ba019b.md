The evaluation of patients with acute wrist pain is broad. Patients with acute carpal instability frequently have associated carpal bone fracture. Scaphoid fractures are the most commonly fractured carpal bone. Other fractures, including the most common fracture of the wrist, the distal radius fracture, should be the clinician's differential diagnosis. Wrist sprains, frequently involving only the extrinsic ligaments, can be diagnosed after more serious injuries have been carefully excluded.
