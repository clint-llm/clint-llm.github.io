The nasoseptal flap is a local pedicle-based flap used chiefly in anterior skull base surgery. This flap was revolutionary when it was originally described in 2006 and is now the workhorse for local flap reconstruction of the anterior skull base. This activity describes the anatomy, indications, technique, and significance of the nasoseptal flap. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in optimizing care for patients who undergo endoscopic reconstruction of the anterior skull base with a nasoseptal flap.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the vascular supply and anatomical boundaries of the nasoseptal flap.
- Outline the indications for skull base reconstruction using a nasoseptal flap.
- Summarize the technique for nasoseptal flap elevation.
- Review the complications of nasoseptal flap utilization.
