Baclofen is an agonist of the G-protein-mediated GABA B receptor. GABA B receptors are located in the brain and spinal cord presynaptically and postsynaptically. At therapeutic levels, baclofen works in the spinal cord. It binds presynaptically, decreasing calcium influx which impairs the release of neurotransmitters.

These effects result in reducing spasticity at the level of the spine. In overdose, baclofen loses specificity for receptors in the spinal cord and exerts greater effects on receptors in the central nervous system (CNS). This can result in CNS depression, respiratory depression, flaccid paralysis, autonomic abnormalities such as hypotension and hypertension, bradycardia and tachycardia, and seizures. Central nervous system depression can be so severe that it can mimic brain death.

Of note, GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate), an illicit drug classically used in nightclubs as well as for drug-facilitated sexual assault, has a similar structure to both GABA and baclofen and, in overdose, produce similar signs.
