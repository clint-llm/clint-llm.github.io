All interprofessional healthcare team members need to have good communication regarding the treatment plan for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. This includes the clinicians (including mid-level practitioners), residents, infectious diseases consultants, nurses, pharmacists, and the infection prevention team. By coordinating treatment efforts and sharing information about the case, patient outcomes will be improved with fewer adverse events. [Level 5]

Antibiotic stewardship programs are also critical in preventing and treating Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections by limiting the unnecessary use of broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobials to the minimum.

Strict infection prevention measures are also to be implemented and stressed to all team members, including hand hygiene, central venous line insertion precautions, appropriate disposal of potentially contaminated solutions, and proper handling and disinfection of medical equipment.

Environmental sampling, especially in outbreak situations, is important to identify potential sources. Maintenance of the water supplies, water filtration, and copper-silver ionization for plumbing systems disinfection is recommended to limit the transmission.
