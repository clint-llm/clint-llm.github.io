If possible, to obtain a thorough history, clinicians should query patients regarding perforated peptic ulcer risk factors. However, if the PPU occurred, the patient's history does not change the treatment plan.

Three phases define the clinical manifestations of PPU. Within two hours of onset (initial phase), tachycardia, epigastric pain, and cold extremities are characteristic. Within 2 to 12 hours (second phase), pain becomes generalized and increases with movement. Fluid moving along the right paracolic gutter can lead to typical signs such as right lower quadrant tenderness and abdominal rigidity. More than 12 hours (third phase) can manifest as abdominal distension, fever, and hypotension.

Patients with retroperitoneal perforation present more indolently without peritoneal signs.
