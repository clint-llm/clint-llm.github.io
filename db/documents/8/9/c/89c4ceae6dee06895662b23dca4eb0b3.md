No routine evaluation for hypertensive urgencies exists. The goal is to rule out target organ damage.

Obtain electrolyte levels, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels to assess renal function. A dipstick urinalysis to see if there is hematuria or proteinuria and urine microscopy to detect red blood cells/casts must also be performed.

Patients at high risk for rapidly evolving target organ damage warrant particular caution, such as those with chronic congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, or a history of stroke. While there is little data to guide specific evaluation in such patients, a lower threshold to obtain lab testing, electrocardiography, or imaging should be considered.

Pregnant patients with elevated blood pressure also require extra caution. In these patients, especially in the absence of preexisting hypertension, preeclampsia can ensue at lower blood pressure levels than in hypertensive emergencies. In the absence of a history of hypertension, especially if the patient complains of potentially worrisome symptoms such as a headache, vision changes, or abdominal pain, lab testing should be obtained, including complete blood count, hepatic function panel, and lactic dehydrogenase.
