**Mechanism of Obstetrical Compression Neuropathy**

All the lesions discussed in this paper belong to the category of compression neuropathy. The pressure exerted by the fetus compresses the axons of the nerve, damaging them and cutting off their blood supply. This mechanism of injury is classified as Wallerian degeneration.

This process generally involves the death of the axon distal to the lesion. Descriptions of the mechanism have been published.
