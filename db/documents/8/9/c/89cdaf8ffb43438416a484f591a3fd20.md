The earliest sign is from parents who notice that their infants’ soiled diapers are black in color. Skin and bone discoloration can be striking, or this disease can be insidious and manifest later in life.

Patients may present with back pain or large joint arthralgias in their post-teenage years or early 30s. Pigmentation of the sclera and pinna of the ear, although classic, is often seen later in life. The severity can be extremely variable and holds little prognostic value.

Constant tendon ruptures at multiple sites, especially with minimal trauma, is also a red flag. On physical exam, thickened Achilles tendon and bursa effusions are common for those with this condition.

Aortic valve murmurs are heard at a much earlier point in life as well, often without predisposing congenital anomalies such as a bicuspid aortic valve.
