Electrosurgery is a technique often used in surgery to control bleeding and to rapidly dissect soft tissue in surgery. The electrical resistance of these soft tissues to an electromagnetic current generates heat. The endpoints of electrosurgery vary based on the waveform, power used, and surgical technique. This results in a variety of effects on the target tissue. This activity reviews the applications and considerations of safe electrosurgery and highlights the importance of a well-informed interprofessional team in ensuring patient safety.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the biophysical foundations of electrosurgery.
- Review appropriate patient preparation required for electrosurgery.
- Summarize the safety considerations of unique patient populations when implementing electrosurgery. 
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the safe use of electrosurgery and improve patient outcomes.
