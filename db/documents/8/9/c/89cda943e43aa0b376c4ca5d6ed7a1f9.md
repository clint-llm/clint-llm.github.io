CIDP is commonly misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed. Patients need to know that early diagnosis and treatment can prevent the progression and disabling deficits. The patients need to be aware of the diverse symptoms and the need for timely evaluation by a neurologist or a neuromuscular specialist. The long course of the disease, the side effects of medications, and medical expenses can sometimes discourage the patients from continuing therapy. However, several therapeutic options are available that can prevent relapses, and some patients achieve complete remission.
