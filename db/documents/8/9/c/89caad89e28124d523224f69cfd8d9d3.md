Barrett's esophagus is seen in about 10% to 15% of individuals with GERD. It is discovered during endoscopic examinations done for evaluation of GERD or other indications. It mainly affects middle-aged and older adults, and the average age at diagnosis is approximately 55 years. The condition is prevalent in White race males, and for unclear reasons, fairly uncommon in African Americans and Asian populations. The prevalence of Barrett's esophagus ranges between 1.6% to 6.8% in western societies.

The estimated risk for esophageal cancer in patients with Barrett's esophagus ranges between 0.2% to 2.9%. The highest risk is found in patients with high-grade dysplasia. Malignant transformation in non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus is low.
