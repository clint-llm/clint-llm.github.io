In the appropriate clinical context, a positive pathergy test should prompt consideration of BD on top of the differential diagnosis due to the high specificity of the test for the disease. The most common clinical feature of BD is the occurrence of recurrent, painful mucocutaneous ulcers (greater than 3 times a year). Oral aphthae are present in most patients with BD, but can also occur in other diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Pathergy was once regarded as pathognomonic of BD because it was essentially absent in patients with SLE and recurrent aphthous stomatitis who presented with oral lesions akin to those seen in BD.

There have been various reports of the pathergy phenomenon in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with interferon-alpha, atypical eosinophilic pustular folliculitis, myeloproliferative disorders, and in neonates with Down syndrome. A previous study showed that CML patients receiving treatment, specifically with interferon-alpha, had a high prevalence of positive pathergy tests (24%).

Although pathergy testing has not been extensively studied in other disease entities, pathergy is a known feature of several other neutrophilic dermatoses, including pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), Sweet syndrome, erythema elevatum diutinum, and blind loop syndrome.
