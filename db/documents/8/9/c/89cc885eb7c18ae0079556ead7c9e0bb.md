Cryptogenic cirrhosis is cirrhosis of uncertain etiology that lacks definitive clinical and histological criteria for a specific disease. Although the exact cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis is unknown, correlations suggest that non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) plays a dominant role. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of cryptogenic cirrhosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of cryptogenic cirrhosis. 
- Identify common exam findings in cryptogenic cirrhosis.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for cryptogenic cirrhosis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance management of cryptogenic cirrhosis and improve outcomes.
