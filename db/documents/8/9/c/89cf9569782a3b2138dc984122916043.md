Although spontaneous remission can occur, it is recommended that all patients with the mild or moderate disease be treated to avoid dissemination and recurrence. Itraconazole is the treatment of choice for all forms of the disease, except in severe, life-threatening cases. It is recommended that 600 mg be given orally daily for three days, followed by 200 mg to 400 mg per day for 6 to 12 months.
