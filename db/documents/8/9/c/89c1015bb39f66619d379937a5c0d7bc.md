Treatment and management of digital clubbing are not focused on the clubbing finding itself but rather on the underlying etiology behind clubbing if it exists. Response to treatment will have a significant degree of variation depending on the underlying disease process. Data for the reversibility of clubbing is sparse. Clubbing reversibility has been reported in particular in patients undergoing prostaglandin therapy for liver disease who developed clubbing which reversed with the cessation of therapy.
