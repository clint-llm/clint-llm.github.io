The drug of choice for recurrent bipolar illness management remains to be lithium

**Pharmacodynamics**Lithium's physiologic role is unknown, and its mechanism is not well understood; however, some proposed mechanisms include:

- Producing brain inositol depletion, leading to reduced responsiveness to alpha-adrenergic stimulation

- Reducing neuronal responsiveness to neurotransmitters due to inhibitory effects on adenylate cyclase and G proteins vital for ion channel opening

- Stimulating serotonin release from the hippocampus

- Being a cation, acting similar to potassium and sodium, thus affecting ion transport and cell membrane potential
