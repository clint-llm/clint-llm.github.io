Long arm splints are used in a variety of settings for immobilization of both bony and soft tissue injuries to the upper extremities. This type of splint provides immobilization to the elbow and the wrist. As a result, elbow flexion and extension and wrist flexion, extension, forearm supination/pronation can be restricted. Long arm splints are often the initial form of immobilization placed on an injured limb to accommodate soft tissue swelling before more definitive treatment with a cast or surgical fixation. This activity presents the indications for a long arm splint and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with arm pathology.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the technique of a long arm splint.
- Describe the indications of a long arm splint.
- Review the complications of a long arm splint.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the safe use of a long arm splint and improve outcomes.
