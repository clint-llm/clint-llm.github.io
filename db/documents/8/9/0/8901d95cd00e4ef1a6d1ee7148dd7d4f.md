Myotonia is an impairing disorder that resulted in the delayed relaxation of skeletal muscles after voluntary contraction. The illnesses, while rare, often cause great physical and psychological difficulty for individuals. Myotonic disorders can go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed for years due to their relative rarity. It is paramount that healthcare practitioners have at least a functional understanding of the disorders that present with myotonia. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and management of myotonia.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of myotonic disorders.
- Describe the evaluation of myotonia.
- Outline the management options available for myotonia.
- Explain how an interprofessional team can optimize the care of patients with myotonia.
