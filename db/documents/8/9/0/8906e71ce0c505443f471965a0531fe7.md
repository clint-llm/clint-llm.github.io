Due to the significant burden worldwide and the serious nature of infections caused by N. meningitis, the pharmaceutical industry has developed vaccines. Providing vaccination is the best way to prevent the patient against this aggressive disease, leaving little time for intervention after the first manifestation of signs/symptoms.

It is a known fact that the characteristics of the organism, host, and environment likely play a role in disease pathogenesis. Regarding the organism, N. meningitis, its capsular strains are more likely to cause invasive disease, as encapsulated bacterium whose pathogenic strains divide into serogroups based on its capsular polysaccharide (CPS) components, which represent the major virulence factor that allowing for evasion of opsonization as well as complement and phagocytic-mediated killing, which also represent the basis of currently licensed vaccines.

To date, worldwide, there are 12 known distinct meningococcal serogroups designated based on the composition of CPS polymers (A, B, C, E, H, I, K, L, W, X, Y, and Z), with serogroups A, B, C, W, Y, and X, being responsible for the majority of disease. These 12 serogroups differ immunologically due to characteristic differences in their polysaccharide capsule; serotype menW correlates with more severe clinical manifestations and higher fatality rates than the rest, with more estimated outbreaks and disease clusters worldwide. These polysaccharides form the basis of production for the current vaccines, except for serogroup X and B, for which no vaccine is available, and the MenB vaccine's basis is on its outer membrane polysaccharides, respectively.

We know two types of meningococcal vaccines: (1) polysaccharide and (2) conjugated polysaccharide vaccines.

Initially, vaccines were polysaccharide in nature, called plain polysaccharide vaccines, available as bivalent (groups A and C) forms, trivalent (groups A, C, and W) forms, or the quadrivalent (groups A, C, Y, and W) forms, which are generally safe and well-tolerated. However, since the conjugation of a bacterial CPS to a protein induces stronger antibody responses to the carbohydrate moiety than the corresponding plain CPS, and that the success of the Hib type B CPS conjugate vaccine in eliminating all Hib disease in countries that use this vaccine has provided strong evidence, the development of Men CPS-conjugated vaccines has emerged.

Quadrivalent plain polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines do not provide an adequate immune response in the age group with the highest disease incidence, namely children under two years of age. However, the conjugation of a bacterial CPS makes the glycoconjugate vaccine MenACWY-CRM197 highly immunogenic for serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y across broad age groups, including infants beginning from 2 months of age due to the conversion of T-cell-independent plain CPS into a T-cell-dependent antigen. This response results in a more robust primary immune response, producing immunologic memory and boosting potential, compared with polysaccharide-only vaccines that rely on humoral responses; hence, the immune protection may be short-lived. In addition to the conjugated vaccine's ability to elicit immunologic memory, it reduces nasopharyngeal carriage. Hence, it interrupts the transmission and establishment of population protection, which also effectively protects children less than two years of age who may respond poorly to conventional polysaccharide vaccines.

The commercially available conjugated vaccines are usually conjugated to a protein carrier and do not contain other adjuvants in their formula. There are three available quadrivalent conjugated vaccines in the global market, all of them contain the most common polysaccharides (A, C, W, and Y), but each uses a different protein carrier: MenACWY-TT conjugated to tetanus toxoid, MenACWY-DT conjugated to diphtheria toxoid, and MenACWY-CRM conjugated to the nontoxic mutant of diphtheria toxin. Maintaining a protective and effective immune response of these licensed vaccines requires booster doses and needles for administration. Nevertheless, some limitations hinder the effectiveness and availability of these vaccines, including the high cost of the chemical conjugation, the cold chain requirements (continuous refrigeration), and the preparation of every single dose. All of the above are limitations affecting the production and distribution of conjugate vaccines.

Until recently, no effective serogroup B vaccine was available. Many studies have attempted to develop a protective MenB vaccine, but to date, they have not obtained satisfying results. Developing a MenB vaccine was very challenging, as the capsular MenB polysaccharide proteins resemble a human neural cell adhesion molecule, which increases the concern about autoimmunity. Moreover, to obtain a broadly effective vaccine,Â one must consider a high level of antigenic diversity/variability and escape mutants.

The pharmaceutical industry has developed vaccines containing outer membrane vesicles (OMV) to overcome these issues. They have many areas of utilization, but the main limitation is their lack of broad protection against the wide global diversity/variability of serogroup B meningococcal strains.

A new improvement occurred with the subsequent recent breakthroughs using "reverse vaccinology," which was successfully created based on conserved proteins. These new formulas provide broad MenB coverage that overcomes the main previous limitation, which may protect even against some non-serogroup B strains, but not all of them, as it may miss some serogroup B meningococcal strains.

A new era of vaccinology and nanotechnology entered the field of meningococcal vaccines, which facilitate the development of novel meningococcal vaccine formulations that mimic conjugation effects by using albumin-based nanoparticles encapsulated into spherical shaped micro and nanoparticles that biologically mimics N. meningitis bacteria. This way of presenting the vaccine into the body makes the immune system deal with it as an invader but without causing disease. This spherical albumin-based nanoparticle capsule contains meningococcal CPS polymers in a biodegradable matrix that slowly releases antigens. Upon contact with antigen-presenting cells as dendritic cells and macrophages, the nanoparticles will induce phagocytosis and then trigger a respiratory burst that leads to reactive oxygen species (ROS) released in huge amounts. That not only triggers the oxidative killing of invading pathogens but also potentiates a second messenger that enhances adaptive immunity.

The antigenicity of these nanoparticles is significantly higher when compared to the vaccine delivered in solution. It is also greatly potentiated when combined with some adjuvants such as alum or MF59 that become encapsulated in these nanoparticles. These alum and MF59 adjuvants have approval from the Federal and Drug Administration (FDA) for administration with licensed vaccines. There is a high potential for novel nanotechnology-based slow-release antigens to enhance antigen presentation, induce immune responses, and overcome the limitations of traditionally formulated vaccines. In addition to the low cost, its ability to be stored as a dry powder without the requirement of maintaining the cold-chain reaction facilitates storage and distribution, which in turn provides a suitable solution not only to low resource countries with endemic areas but also for vaccinations required for the annual Hajj season.
