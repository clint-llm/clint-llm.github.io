Proteins in the body are produced by the cytoplasmic ribosomes and the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The cytoplasmic ribosomes produce proteins necessary for cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, and peroxisomal functions. The RER produces the proteins required for endoplasmic, Golgi, and lysosomal functions. These proteins must be localized appropriately to carry out their intracellular and extracellular tasks. The process of directing proteins to their appropriate location is termed protein targeting.
