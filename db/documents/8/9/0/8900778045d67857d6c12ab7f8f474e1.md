The meninges protect the spinal cord. Three layers cover the spinal cord which includes the dura mater, arachnoid mater and pia mater, from outermost to innermost covering. The epidural space is a potential space that exists between dura and vertebrae. Subarachnoid space exists between arachnoid and pia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exists in subarachnoid space. Pia mater tightly covers the spinal cord.  The epidural space surrounds the dural sac and continues from foramen magnum superiorly to the sacral hiatus inferiorly. This space is protected by the posterior longitudinal ligament anteriorly, and posteriorly by the ligamentum flavum and the periosteum of laminae. The integral elements of the spine are supplied by the dorsal rami of the spinal nerves, and by the sinuvertebral nerves.
