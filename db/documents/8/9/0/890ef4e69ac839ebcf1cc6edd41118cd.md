Knowledge of risk factors for difficult mask ventilation and difficult intubation can help physicians and advanced practitioners who routinely perform endotracheal intubation prepare for and successfully secure the difficult airway. Involving other healthcare team members such as additional physicians, nurse anesthetists, anesthesia assistants, nursing staff, and respiratory therapists, when appropriate, can help aid the proceduralist in successful mask ventilation and/or endotracheal intubation.

When intubation is needed on a patient known to be difficult to intubate, the most experienced provider should make the initial attempt as multiple attempts can result in airway edema and decreases the likelihood of successful intubation. Successful oxygenation and ventilation can avoid adverse and potentially fatal outcomes.

Mallampati score, though a risk factor for difficult mask ventilation and endotracheal intubation, is not independently sufficient to predict the difficult airway.
