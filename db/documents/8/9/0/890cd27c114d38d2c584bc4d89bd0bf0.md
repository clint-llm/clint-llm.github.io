Psychosocial interventions are a crucial part of addiction treatment programs as they target the social, environmental, and psychological factors that contribute to increased use, which medication is generally unable to address.

Professionals can deliver treatments from multiple disciplines, including psychiatry, psychology, social work, and nursing. The most common current psychosocial treatments for SUDs include motivational interviewing, mutual help groups, family-based interventions, cognitive-behavioral interventions, supportive psychotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and contingency management.
