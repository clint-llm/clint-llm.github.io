Both patients that are classified as high-risk, as well as those sustaining high-risk injuries, should be promptly evaluated by a medical professional after injury via an animal bite or scratch. Low-risk individuals with signs of developing an infection following an injury should also seek medical attention.

High-risk patients include those that are immunosuppressed or immunocompromised (i.e. patients with diabetes mellitus, asplenia, or cirrhosis) as well as patients with degenerative joint disease or prosthetic joint replacements. Injuries that are classified as high-risk include any injury to the hand, injuries to the face or genitals, any injury that requires surgical repair or primary closure, deep puncture wounds or lacerations (more common in cat bites), wounds with associated crush injury (more common in dog bites), and wounds that are close to the bone or joint (especially prosthetic joints).
