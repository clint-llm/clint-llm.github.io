Due to the many manifestations of PRIS, clinicians need to discern whether the signs and symptoms presented by a patient are due to propofol or another pathophysiologic mechanism. If propofol infusions are overlooked, the patient’s condition may be considered to result from other severe illnesses such as shock, sepsis, or renal disease.  Other possibilities are congenital problems (i.e., Brugada Syndrome) or other medications that may be concomitantly given. If propofol is being administered, then PRIS must remain high on the differential.
