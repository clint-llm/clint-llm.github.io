Detailed prostate anatomy is not well defined on the CT scan, as its pathology. It may show a hyperdense central zone with density adjusted around 40 to 60 Hounsfield Unit (HU), and the peripheral zone may appear hypodense between 10-5 HU density.

**BPH**

CT scan is not typically done for diagnosis, but BPH is identified when the prostate extends above the pubic symphysis on axial imaging. BPH can also be diagnosed on a CT scan with a volume greater than 30 ml (measured with the help of coronal reformate images).

**Prostate Inflammation**

In prostatitis, the gland appears diffusely hypodense with symmetric or asymmetric enlargement. Prostatic abscesses are well-defined hypoattenuating (approximately fluid density, around -19 to 13 Hounsfield unit) areas with peripheral rim enhancement. Progression of the disease can be monitored with a CT scan or alternative to the sonography.

**Prostate CA**

Prostatic malignancy appears as contrast-enhancing areas, particularly in the venous phase. These areas can be focal or diffuse and are found within the peripheral zone. CT scan has a role in carcinoma imaging to assess local and distant spread.
