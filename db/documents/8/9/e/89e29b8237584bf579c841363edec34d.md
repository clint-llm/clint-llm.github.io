Like many other medical interventions, there are limitations and drawbacks to the high-flow nasal cannula. One of the primary drawbacks is the expense for care relative to low flow nasal cannula, increased complexity and training to initiate care, decreased mobility, the risk for ineffective sealing of the passageways leading to leaking of air and loss of the positive airway pressure effect, a potential to delay intubation, and the potential to inappropriately delay of end-of-life decisions (Spoletini et al. 2015). Furthermore, potential risk factors to noninvasive ventilation apply to a limited extent in the use of high-flow nasal cannula as well. That includes patients with alteration of consciousness, facial injury, excessive secretion with the risk of aspiration, and hemodynamic instability.
