Instructions for collecting a 24-hour urine sample vary by the laboratory. Typically, the patient's first voided morning urine is discarded. Subsequent urine produced for next 24 hours including the next morning's first voided specimen, is collected in containers that are provided by the laboratory. A preservative solution is added to the urine collection to stabilize the sample for later analysis. Once a full 24 hours of urine is collected, the total volume is recorded. A representative sample from the total collection is then submitted to the laboratory for analysis. Serum samples, usually calcium, potassium, uric acid, and phosphorus, are sometimes also included in the study. It is important for patients to adhere to their normal diet and activities during the collection.

Once the analysis is complete, a detailed report of the results is provided to the ordering clinician. These results are used to direct prophylactic medical management. Collecting a sample for a full 24 hours can be difficult for some patients and is certainly inconvenient. However, it is necessary to accurately and reliably identify urinary chemistry risk factors for calculus formation as spot urine chemistry is inadequate.

A chemical composition analysis of any stone material is very helpful if available.
