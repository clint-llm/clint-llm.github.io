Atrial tachycardia is a less common form of SVT, accounting for 5-15% of diagnosed SVTs. Atrial tachycardia is seen in all age ranges but tends to present more in older patients. There is no known ethnic or racial association but appears more commonly in patients with known triggering risk factors (see etiology).
