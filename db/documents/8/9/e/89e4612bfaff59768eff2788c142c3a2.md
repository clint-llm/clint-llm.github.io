The semilunar canals are a part of the inner ear that plays a vital role in maintaining balance and spatial orientation. There are three semilunar canals: horizontal, superior, and posterior. Each contains aÂ fluid called endolymph and is responsible for detecting angular or rotational movements of the head. Each semilunar canal dilates into a fluid-filled sac called the ampulla, which contains the sensory component of the vestibular system.
