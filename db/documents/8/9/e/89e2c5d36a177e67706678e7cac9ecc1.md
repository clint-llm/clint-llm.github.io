Montelukast is an orally dosed drug (available as a film-coated tablet, chewable tablet, or oral granules) that is FDA-approved for treating chronic asthma and prophylaxis and the prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. It is also approved to relieve seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis symptoms. This activity reviews the indications, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, administration, dose in adults and specific patient populations, adverse drug reactions, contraindications, warning and precautions, and toxicity of montelukast therapy in the clinical setting as relates to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients with chronic asthma, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and allergic rhinitis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of montelukast.
- Describe the possible adverse effects of montelukast.
- Summarize the indications for montelukast.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the safe use of montelukast for asthma and improve outcomes.
