The digestive tube begins to form during the third week of gestation. During this time, gastrulation occurs, and three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) are formed.

The endoderm forms the epithelial lining of the GI tract, gallbladder, pancreas, and liver. The mesoderm gives rise to the connective tissue and smooth muscle of the gut tube wall. The ectoderm separates into the surface ectoderm, neural tube, and neural crest. The neural crest forms the peripheral nervous system, including the enteric nervous system (ENS); the ENS contains the neurons of the GI tract.
