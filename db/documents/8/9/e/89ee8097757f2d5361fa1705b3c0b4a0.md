Strongyloides stercoralis is a soil-transmitted helminth. It is classified as a roundworm or nematode. There are more than 50 species of Strongyloides. Most of them do not infect humans. Strongyloidiasis, the disease caused by S. stercoralis in humans, is contracted mainly through the transcutaneous route.

Host factors such as HIV infection, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection, and alcoholism have been reported as risk factors for Strongyloidiasis. The most prominent risk factors for severe disease include immunosuppressive therapies (including corticosteroid use), diseases like diabetes, HIV, HTLV infection, and alcoholism.
