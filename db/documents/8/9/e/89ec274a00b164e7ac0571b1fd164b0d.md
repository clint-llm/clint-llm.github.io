- Polycythemia with a hematocrit greater than 55%
- Elevated hematocrit greater than 55% leads to a decrease in plasma of the blood sample, thereby reducing the coagulating factors available. The sodium citrate levels must be readjusted to prevent artificially prolonged PT measurements, to account for this decreased plasma

- Underfilled tubes

- Similar to polycythemia, underfilled tubes also will lead to an artificially prolonged PT measurement.

- Samples obtained from indwelling catheters may suffer contamination as these lines often require a flush with heparin or other solutions that would artificially prolong coagulation times

- Anticoagulants

- All direct acting anticoagulants prolong PT
- Argatroban
- Dabigatran
- Rivaroxaban
- Apixaban
- Edoxaban

- Storage and temperature

- Blood samples for PT testing are only acceptable if stored for less than 24 hours at either room temperature or 4 degrees Celsius
- Prolonged cold storage at 4 degrees Celsius or lower can activate Factor VII, which can lead to shortened PT results

- High lipid levels

- Patients with hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia have a shorter PT measurement due to more elevated fibrinogen and factor VII levels
