The FinkelsteinÂ test should be performed only by a trained medical professional (physician or nurse) who have adequate knowledge about the anatomy of the compartments of the wrist and understand the clinical significance of the outcomes of this test. However, it is important to remember that this test is not 100% sensitive for De Quervain tenosynovitis and if there is doubt about the diagnosis, the patient should obtain a referral to a rheumatologist or an orthopedist. As missing the diagnosis can have untoward consequences, a team approach is best to evaluate patients. [Level V]
