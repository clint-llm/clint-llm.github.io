The most commonly used method of measuring cervical dilation during labor is a digital cervical exam. The obstetrician places two fingers inside the vagina and measures the width of the opening of the external os of the cervix using fingers to approximate the distance. In simple terms, 1 cm is about one finger's width, and 3 cm is the width of two fingers. 4 cm dilated is when the two fingers are approximately 1 cm apart. The widest stretch of the two fingers is about 7 to 8 cm. At 10 cm (full dilation), the cervix should not be present in front of the presenting fetal part (typically the head).

One meta-analysis suggested that ultrasound may play a new role in measuring cervical dilation to assess labor progression accurately. Still, at the moment, the digital cervical exam remains the gold standard.

A pelvic scoring system, known as the Bishop score, is an important criterion utilized to determine the probability of successful labor induction. It is a clinical tool used to assess the cervix in pregnant women that can be obtained at the time of induction by a digital cervical exam. This scoring system considers the dilation and effacement of the cervix, its position and consistency, and the fetal station. There is a maximum score of 13, with a higher score (defined as 6+) indicating a more "favorable" cervix for vaginal delivery. A lower score indicates a more "unfavorable" cervix for vaginal delivery and a higher chance of the woman undergoing cesarean delivery.
