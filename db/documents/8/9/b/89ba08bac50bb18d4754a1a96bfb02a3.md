Health care workers should take an interprofessional team-based approach to ensure that athletes participate safely in sports.  Primary care clinicians, including PAs and nurse practitioners, can provide optimal screening for their athletic patients and ensure they do not have any significant medical issues. Pharmacists also play a significant role as educators, assisting the clinical team, especially in the era of supplements. Unnecessary use of nutritional and health supplements can be avoided if an athlete is thoroughly educated and has ready access to a pharmacist. Nurses can perform parts of the examination, take patient history, and answer any questions patients or parents may have about the examination, both before and after. An interprofessional team approach will result in the best outcomes. [Level 5]
