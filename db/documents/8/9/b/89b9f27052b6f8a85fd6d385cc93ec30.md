Evaluation criteria regarding sensory neuropathy mainly revolve around neurophysiological examination and dermatopathological studies such as skin biopsy. When diagnosing small fiber neuropathies, electromyography (EMG) results may appear normal, and the presence of sural and plantar responses does not exclude purely small fiber neuropathy. In EMG studies, sensory neuropathies demonstrate a reduced or absent sensory nerve action potential.

Regarding autonomic sensory testing, there are quantitative exams that assess for hot and cold sensation, transient changes in the electrical potential of the skin (e.g., sweat gland activity), and noninvasive electrochemical skin conductance studies for detection of sudomotor dysfunction.

The current validated gold standard for the diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy is a skin biopsy.

Imaging studies also have a role in diagnosing sensory neuropathies and are of greatest utility when assessing for paraneoplastic etiologies. Magnetic resonance imaging and its analogs, inversion recovery MRI pulse sequencing, and T2-weighted spoiled gradient-echo sequencing are of particular merit in visualizing dorsal column pathology.
