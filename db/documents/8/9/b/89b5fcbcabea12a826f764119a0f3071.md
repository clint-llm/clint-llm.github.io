Predominantly, treatment is comprised of supportive care with securing airway with endotracheal intubation as necessary. In ingestions that present acutely within the first few hours, activated charcoal or gastric lavage can be considered. Caution should be used when performing gastrointestinal decontamination as manipulation may provoke seizures.

Barbiturates and benzodiazepines can be used to control muscle contractions in cases of mild to moderate toxicity. Patients should be intubated and paralyzed with nondepolarizing paralytic agents if convulsions are uncontrollable and causing hyperthermia or acidemia. Generous intravenous fluid hydration should be administered for the treatment rhabdomyolysis. If intubation is required for airway protection, succinylcholine should be avoided given the potential for hyperkalemia.

In the case of minor to moderate exposures, recovery is usually complete with no neurologic or musculoskeletal sequelae.
