Caring for a sexual assault victim is a complex process and requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that includes a sexual assault nurse examiner, and a number of physicians in different specialties, for example, psychiatry, OB/GYN, and orthopedics. The moment the triage nurse has admitted the patient, the emergency department clinician, and the assigned nurse are responsible for coordinating the care that involves ensuring the patient's safety, medical management, and commencing the proper assault protocol. On account of the serious implications of sexual assault on the mental health of the patient, complete mental health evaluation, and follow-up with a therapist/trained professional are absolutely necessary to improve patient outcomes.
