Elimination kinetics play an essential role in drug clearance. In first-order kinetics, a constant fraction of the drug is cleared per unit time because the mechanisms used for elimination are not saturated. Thus, drug clearance does not vary with changes in the plasma concentration of a drug when drug elimination occurs by first-order kinetics. The vast majority of drug elimination takes place by first-order kinetics. In zero-order kinetics, the same quantity of drug is eliminated per unit time because the mechanisms used for elimination are saturated.  In zero-order kinetics, drug clearance can vary due to changes in the plasma concentration of a drug.

As stated in the previous examples, drug clearance plays an important role in determining drug concentration and thus dosing regimens. Steady-state plasma concentration is inversely related to the total body clearance of a drug. The dosing rate is calculated by multiplying total body clearance by a drug’s desired steady-state concentration, assuming the drug is fully bioavailable. For patients with cardiac insufficiency, kidney and liver disease, drug clearance can be severely affected.  The ability of serum proteins to bind to drugs also can play a role in clearance. A decrease in serum proteins may cause an increase in free drug concentration in the plasma, thus increasing its rate of elimination from the body.
