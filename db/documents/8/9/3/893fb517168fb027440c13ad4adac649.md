Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is a technique that is used when rapid control of the airway is needed as a precaution for patients that may have a 'full stomach' or other risks of pulmonary aspiration. The goal of the technique is to protect the airway with a cuffed ETT as quickly as possible while minimizing coughing, straining, and vomiting with secure airway placement. This technique is the standard of care for the management of non-difficult emergency airways. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in carrying out this procedure successfully.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for rapid sequence intubation.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to rapid sequence intubation.
- Explain the potential complications of rapid sequence intubation and identify the correct procedure to prevent or correct these complications.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance rapid sequence intubation and improve outcomes.
