Minor trauma accounts for the majority of presentations of periprosthetic fractures in the emergency department. Abu Rajab studied 40 patients, twenty cemented and twenty uncemented total knee arthroplasties, and revealed a loss of 27% loss of bone mineral density seen behind the anterior flange of the distal femur. They noted the majority of density loss occurs over the first 24 months and stabilizes after. During this period, patients were at an increased risk of traumatic events secondary to stress shielding.
