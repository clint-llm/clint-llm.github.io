Trigeminal neuralgia (TN), also known as tic douloureux, is the most common neuropathic pain involving the craniofacial region. It is characterized by sudden, brief, usually unilateral severe recurrent episodes of stabbing pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. This activity describes the evaluation and management of trigeminal neuralgia and explains the role of the interprofessional health care team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the classic presentation of a patient with trigeminal neuralgia.
- Explain the diagnostic criteria for trigeminal neuralgia.
- Outline the management options available for trigeminal neuralgia.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance trigeminal neuralgia and improve outcomes.
