Major depression has very high morbidity and mortality contributing to high rates of suicide. Even though effective drug treatment is available, nearly 50% may not initially respond. Complete remission is not common but at least 40% achieve partial remission in 12 months.

However, relapses are common and many patients require a variety of treatments to control the symptoms. The quality of life of most patients with depression is poor.

Depression accounts for nearly 40,000 cases of suicide each year in the US. The highest rate of suicides is in older men.
