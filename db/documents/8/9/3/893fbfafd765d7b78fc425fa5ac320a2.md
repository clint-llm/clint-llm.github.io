Pes planus is best managed by an interprofessional team that also includes orthopedic nurses and therapists. Clinicians should be fully aware that Children rarely require treatment for pes planus. Foot orthotics are indicated for foot pain secondary to pes planus alone or combination with leg, knee, and back pain. Surgery is only indicated for rigid pes planus. Unnecessary surgery in children can lead to more harm than good. In adults, surgery may be an option for pes planus, but overall the results are not satisfactory. Most patients have decent outcomes with the use of orthotics.
