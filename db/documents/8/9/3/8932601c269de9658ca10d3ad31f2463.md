Fragile X testing should be a consideration in the differential diagnosis of any individual with intellectual disabilities, impaired development, or autism of unknown etiology.FMR1 missense mutations or deletions. Both sequencing of the FMR1 gene and direct measurement of the FMRP protein level would be useful for detecting potential “nonCGG repeat” causes of FXS.

Prenatal testing for FXS can be accomplished by PCR using DNA from chorionic villi or amniocytes. Prenatal detection of FXS can promote early intervention and help with family planning decisions. Due to its complex mode of inheritance and long-term health implications, genetic counseling is especially important.

Individuals with FXS require evaluation by a geneticist and a specialist in neurodevelopment, such as a neurodevelopmental pediatrician. Specialists in occupational therapy, speech therapy, and behavioral therapy are essential to target specific developmental differences. Early access to these specialists is essential for a better outcome. Psychiatry evaluation may be helpful if there are symptoms of mood disorders, self-injurious behavior, depression, or specific phobias, all of which have been reported in higher frequency in FXS.21518720

Mothers of a patient who has been diagnosed with FXS should also be evaluated since in the vast majority of cases, the mother is the carrier of the full mutation or the premutation.
