Pacinian corpuscles (PCs) are highly specialized corpuscles found in the dermis of glabrous skin. This specialization is partly due to the adventitial tissue surrounding the corpuscles. PCs have a large, ellipsoid shape, ranging up to 3 to 4mm in the digits. Their shape and size vary depending upon the location in the body and area of skin of their residence. PCs have a large myelinated centrally located nerve fiber called neurite, running along their long axis. Bilaterally arranged glial lamellae immediately surround the neurites, and perineural (collagenous) lamellae further surround them on the outer aspect. Inner core cells are derived from Schwann cells and are involved in the conduction of signals. These lamellar layers are separated from each other by a fluid-filled layer, kept in between due to the presence of tight junctions found between adjacent lamellar cells. A capsule surrounds the outer lamellar layer. When a vibratory stimulus deforms skin, this stimulus reaches the dermis where it transmits to the external capsule of PCs. This distortion travels through the external and internal core until it reaches the central neurite. As a result, stretch-gated cation channels (voltage-gated and non-voltage gated) on the neuronal membrane open and conduct a neural response.
