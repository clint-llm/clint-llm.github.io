The exact mechanism remains uncertain. It is hypothesized that displacement occurs due to a high physiologic axial load transmitted across a relatively weak physis. Conditions such as obesity increase the mechanical weight and force transmitted, whereas certain endocrine or renal disorders may contribute to the weakening of the physis.

The epiphysis stays in the acetabulum, and the metaphysis externally rotates with anterior translation. This slippage occurs at the level of the hypertrophic zone of the physis. In adolescence, a combination of factors puts the physis at high risk of slippage. That includes: the physis being in a vertical position more susceptible to shear forces, thinning and weakening of the perichondrial ring of la Croix, along with unlocking of the mamillary processes of the physis, further destabilizing it. SCFE is a Salter-Harris type I fracture that can be differentiated with preceding epiphysiolyis, more steady displacement, and intact periosteum in chronic cases or partially torn in acute cases.
