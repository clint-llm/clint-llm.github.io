Prior to the procedure, an echo should assess the aortic valve, the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and any other cardiac abnormality. The pulmonary valve should also be assessed for stenosis or regurgitation. Echocardiography also allows for sizing the aortic and pulmonary annulus. If the aortic annulus is smaller than the pulmonary annulus by 2-3 mm, the surgeon may be required to perform an aortic root enlargement procedure.

The Ross procedure is performed via a median sternotomy under cardiopulmonary bypass.

The postoperative course is the same as for any other open-heart surgery patients. Patients are usually weaned off the ventilator the same night and extubated in the morning.
