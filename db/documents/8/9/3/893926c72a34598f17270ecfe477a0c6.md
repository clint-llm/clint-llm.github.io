Y. pseudotuberculosis causes self-limiting acute gastroenteritis and mesenteric lymphadenitis that mimics acute appendicitis. Enteritis is usually seen in children as opposed to the mesenteric adenitis seen in adults.

Other problems associated with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection include terminal ileitis and intussusception, more commonly in children. In most cases, enterocolitis lasts one to three weeks. Erythema nodosum, arthralgias, reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and lumbar facet joint disease can occur. A sporotrichoid pattern of disease has been associated with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection. Cutaneous manifestations include erythema of the face and neck, conjunctival hyperemia, strawberry tongue, punctate skin rash, and desquamation. Ophthalmic findings such as uveitis and conjunctivitis have also been reported.

Physical findings caused by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection may be grouped into three main categories: systemic, enteric, and rheumatologic.

- Systemic findings include jaundice, hypotension, and lymphadenopathy

- Enteric findings include abdominal tenderness with or without rebound over McBurney point

- Rheumatologic involvement includes joint effusion, tenderness, or decreased range of movement and may be asymmetric in distribution.

Patients with immunosuppression and iron-overload states such as hemochromatosis, venous congestion, hemolytic anemia, and cirrhosis are at risk for sepsis.
