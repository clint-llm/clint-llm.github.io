Clinicians frequently encounter patients with a complaint of "all my joints hurt." In reality, many of these patients have either transient self-limiting or non-significant problems. The art of history taking and physical examination should narrow the broad differential diagnosis of polyarticular arthritis to a manageable few, and then confirmatory tests should prove or rule out the exact etiology. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of polyarticular arthritis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology and progression of polyarticular arthritis.
- Review the components of a proper evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with polyarticular arthritis, including any indicated diagnostic imaging studies, as well as possible differentials.
- Identify the treatment and management option available for polyarticular arthritis.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in prompt diagnosis of polyarticular arthritis and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
