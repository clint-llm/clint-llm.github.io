Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has become a key element in the diagnosis and treatment of esophageal, gastric, and small-bowel disorders. The many accepted indications for EGD include evaluation of dysphagia, GI bleeding, peptic ulcer disease, medically refractory GERD, esophageal strictures, celiac disease, and unexplained diarrhea. During EGD evaluation, diagnostic biopsies can be performed as well as therapies to achieve hemostasis and dilation for significant strictures. If properly performed, it is generally a safe and well-tolerated procedure. EGD's availability and use in the pediatric population have increased. Decisions surrounding the conditions and time for EGD use in children remain more of an art than a science, and additional critical review of this tool's use is needed to maximize results and minimize risk.
