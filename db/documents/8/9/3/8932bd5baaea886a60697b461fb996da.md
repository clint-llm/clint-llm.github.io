Acupuncture translates, “needle penetration.” Small needles are placed into specific acupuncture points, acupoints, identified in TCM as areas to open qi. Qi is arranged into meridians or channels that allow the flow of qi. Traditionally and most commonly, needle penetration is the means of opening qi. Manual pressure, electrical stimulation, laser, heat, and even ultrasound have also been utilized. The application of these modalities is thought to manipulate qi in much the same way that needle penetration would.
