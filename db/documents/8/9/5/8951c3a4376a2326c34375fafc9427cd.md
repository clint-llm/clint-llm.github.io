Eyelid myokymia is a self-limited condition. Usually, it resolves within a few days or weeks with rest and avoiding triggering factors.

A specialist referral is indicated in patients with myokymia if:

- The twitching does not resolve within a few weeks.

- Twitching develops in other parts of the face.

- There is difficulty opening the eye.

- There is complete eyelid closure with each twitch, which may indicate a hemifacial spasm rather than myokymia.

- Redness or swelling of the eyelid

- Drooping of the eyelid
