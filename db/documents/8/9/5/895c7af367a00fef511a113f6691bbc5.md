Nalbuphine is FDA indicated for moderate to severe pain in where the patient requires an opioid agent, and other alternative treatments have been insufficient. Non-FDA approved uses of nalbuphine do exist such as treatment of labor pain, opioid-induced urinary retention, opioid-induced respiratory depression, and pruritus associated with neuraxial opioid use.

Pruritus is usually secondary to opioid activation of the mu-opioid receptor. Because nalbuphine is an antagonist at the mu-opioid receptor, it has utility as a treatment for opioid-induced pruritus. In fact, research has found that nalbuphine to be superior in treating opioid-induced pruritus when compared with placebo, diphenhydramine, naloxone, or propofol in patients receiving neuraxial opioids for acute pain related to surgery or childbirth1.

Although nalbuphine can result in respiratory depression, due to its antagonism of the mu-opioid receptor, it antagonizes the respiratory depressant effects of other opioid medications while concomitantly adding to the analgesic activities of these drugs.
