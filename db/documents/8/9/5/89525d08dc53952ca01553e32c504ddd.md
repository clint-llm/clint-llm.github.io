A pediatric cataract is an important cause of treatable childhood blindness, provided it is recognized and managed early. Leukocoria, strabismus, and nystagmus are common presenting signs. Various other differentials of leukocoria must be ruled out before managing a case of pediatric cataract. This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, management, and postoperative rehabilitation of pediatric cataracts and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating children with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pediatric cataracts.
- Review the appropriate history and systemic and ocular evaluation of pediatric cataracts.
- Outline the management options available for pediatric cataracts.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving final visual outcomes in children with pediatric cataracts.
