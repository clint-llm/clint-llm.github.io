Patients with focal seizures have a higher risk of seizure recurrence than those with generalized seizures. Recurrence rates of simple and complex partial seizures appear to be the same. Loss of consciousness can cause trauma, aspiration, burns, and accidents. Associated anxiety, limitations in work, and driving add to significant morbidity. The mortality rate in patients with epilepsy is 2 to 3-times higher than the general population. Most deaths are due to underlying etiology and accidents. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is more in patients with medically intractable seizures.
