Oral melanomas show an aggressive nature and worse prognosis than cutaneous melanoma. Almost a third of patients already have signs of lymph node metastasis at the moment of diagnosis,

Primary oral melanomas have a strong preference for the maxilla, mainly developing in the hard palate, gingiva, or alveolar ridge.****Secondary oral melanomas (even rarer than primary tumors) commonly occur in the tongue.

The clinical aspect of oral melanomas is indeed diverse. They can present as macules, patches, or nodules, showing various colors: brown, black, grey, red, or purple shades and even depigmentation.

The most typical presentation comprises three particular features: a) a brown-black pigmented plaque that is flat or slightly raised, b) a light brown macular feature, and c) a central area of nodular aspect.

Amelanotic melanomas are not uncommon, accounting for around a third of oral melanomas.
