This complex (TFCC) includes the triangular fibrocartilage disc proper (TFC), a meniscus homolog (MH), radioulnar ligaments (RUL), the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) and the sheath of the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU).

**Triangular Fibrocartilage Disc Proper**

Being its main component, the horizontal triangular fibrocartilage disc proper is a disc-shaped fibrocartilaginous structure that extends from the sigmoid notch of the radius to the ulnar styloid. It is a single band in its radial attachment, which separates into a proximal and distal lamina. It is called the triangular ligament. The ligamentum subcruentum is a fibrovascular structure that separates these two laminae. While the proximal lamina attaches to the styloid fovea, the distal lamina connects to the ulna styloid at its distal portion.

The triangular fibrocartilage disc proper has a biconcave shape, thinner in its center, and while it does not show fenestrations in the early decades of life, these will appear later.

**Radioulnar ligaments**

Two thick ligamentous structures border the triangular fibrocartilage disc proper in its dorsal and volar aspect. These are the dorsal and volar radioulnar ligaments (RUL).

Reinforcement of the radioulnar ligaments is by fibers attaching to the lunate; the ulnolunate ligament, triquetrum, ulnotriquetral ligament, and the hamate and base of the fifth metacarpal as the ulnar collateral ligament. The ulnar collateral ligament is superficial to the meniscal homolog and of limited importance.

**Meniscal Homologue**

As opposed to the triangular fibrocartilage disc proper, it is primally constituted of fibrous tissue. It spans from the tip and lateral side of the ulnar styloid to the ulnar aspect of the triquetrum and base of the five metacarpal.

**Extensor Carpi Ulnaris Tendon**

The extensor carpi ulnaris tendon sheath runs in an ulnar groove and appears to be an essential stabilizer of the ulnar side of the TFCC.

**Function**

TFCC serves three crucial roles. Most importantly, it stabilizes the distal radius ulnar joint. It also cushions the ulnar carpus, being responsible for 20% of axial wrist load. And it acts as a stabilizer of the ulnar carpus.

While there is consensus that the dorsal and volar radioulnar ligaments primarily maintain distal radius ulnar joint stability, there is conflicting evidence as to which provides stability during pronation and supination.
