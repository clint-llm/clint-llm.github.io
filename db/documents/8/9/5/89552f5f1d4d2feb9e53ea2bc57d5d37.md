As stated above flail chest is associated with significant complications and one should keep a high level of suspicion for this condition. Flail chest is a clinical diagnosis. It most often occurs when 3 or more ribs are broken in at least 2 places but this injury will not always cause flail chest.

The elderly are particularly at risk for flail chest and suffer more from the complications. Children rarely develop flail chest because of the elasticity of their chest wall. If a child does develop this condition it is a marker for a significant amount of trauma and should warrant extra care in the evaluation.

Mechanical ventilation should be avoided when possible in favor of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation.
