Acute SCI is a two-step process involving primary and secondary mechanisms. Primary injury occurs as a combination of initial impact with underlying chronic cord compression. This can occur with fracture-dislocation, burst fractures, and acutely ruptured discs. In some cases, primary injury can occur without pre-existing cord compression. This is seen with severe ligamentous injuries leading to transient spinal column dislocation or spinal cord laceration from sharp bone/metal.

Underlying molecular mechanisms for these injuries remain unknown for the most part. Animal models have been used to study the pathophysiology of spinal shock. These models elucidate the natural progression of injury in SCIs to some degree. After initial hemorrhagic foci in the gray matter, there appears to be significant protein accumulation in the gray matter of the spinal cord. Edema then ensues and peaks at three to six days post-injury. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), edema can be visualized for up to two weeks after the injury. The slow process of central cord necrosis and vacuolization then follows and continues for about two months. The characteristically thin rim of white matter surrounding the central core of necrosis remains intact throughout this process. Often it is observed that the patient starts losing neurologic function above the level of injury. Loss of function that happens several days post-injury above the level of the injury is primarily due to spinal cord pathway rearrangement. Once this process abates, the function above the injury returns to normal, although the exact time needed for this process is not precisely defined and could last from weeks to months. If a patient survives the initial injury but remains immobile, the area fills with gliotic tissue.

The transection of the spinal cord results in spinal shock and transient extinction of reflexes below the level of injury. The main pathophysiological mechanisms include

- Synaptic changes in cord segments below the level of injury (due to enhancement of presynaptic inhibition and high concentration of glycine)

- Hyperpolarization of spinal motor neurons.

- Sudden withdrawal of facilitatory inputs of the descending pathways disrupts the synaptic transmission and interneuronal conduction.

- A functional abnormality of the fusiform, gamma-efferent system that controls the sensitivity of the muscle stretch receptors

- The loss of normal function of spinal cord interneurons and motoneurons in the corticospinal, rubrospinal, vestibulospinal, and reticulospinal pathways.
