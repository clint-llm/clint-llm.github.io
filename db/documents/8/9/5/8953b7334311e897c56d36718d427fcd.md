At the time of publication, there are two active studies found on ClinicalTrials.gov. These are:

- 
Gastric Ultrasound for Estimation of the Aspiration Risk Study - the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida

- 
Continuous Supraglottic pH Monitoring in Prolonged Intubated Intensive Care Patients and High-Risk Aspiration Intraoperative Patients: Vanderbilt University Medical Center Nashville, Tennessee, United States

These two studies will help the clinician narrow the differential diagnosis when a new clinical finding of hypoxemia, tachypnea, or change in lung auscultation occurs.
