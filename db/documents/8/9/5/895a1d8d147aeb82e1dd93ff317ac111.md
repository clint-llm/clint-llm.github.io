History and physical exam are essential towards making an adequate diagnosis in cases of TVIE. Establishing diagnosis can be more difficult in these cases because presentation can often be subacute or present with absence of typical IE features. Peripheral phenomenon such as splinter hemorrhages is less common, as is a cardiac murmur. However, clinicians must always be aware of potential complications of this disease process that are manifested by the various embolic phenomenon. Characteristics, which should lead clinicians to consider TVIE, include:

- Fever

- Chills

- Anorexia

- Weight loss

- Fatigue

- Malaise

- Arthralgia

- Dyspnea on exertion

- A cough

- Pleuritic pain

- Abdominal Pain

**Physical Exam Findings**

- Tachypnea

- Hypotension

- Cardiac murmur

- Splenomegaly

- Splinter hemorrhages

- Petechiae

- Janeway lesions

- Osler nodes

- Roth spots

- Focal neurologic deficits
