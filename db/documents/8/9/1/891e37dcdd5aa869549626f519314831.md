Scombroid toxicity is very rare in the US and most healthcare workers are not familiar with its presentation and management. The toxicity primarily results in symptoms of excess histamine. The disorder is ideally managed by an interprofessional team that includes an emergency department physician, toxicologist, specialty nurses, internist, and intensivist. Treatment is supportive with antihistamines used to reverse the symptoms. Steroids, beta-2-adrenergic agonists, ipratropium bromide, and epinephrine may be given for severe cases.

Patients with bronchospasm, airway edema, or distributive shock should be treated as anaphylaxis with epinephrine. The outcomes for most patients are excellent.
