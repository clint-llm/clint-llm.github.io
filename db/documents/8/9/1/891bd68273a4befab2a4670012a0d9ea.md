Foscarnet is an FDA-approved antiviral therapy used to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) and CMV-associated ophthalmic retinitis in individuals diagnosed with AIDS and who are unable to tolerate gancyclovir or as salvage therapy for those who have drug-resistant CMV and fail gancyclovir. It also has approval for use as a treatment option in immunocompromised patients with the herpes simplex virus (HSV) who exhibit resistance to acyclovir, the gold standard therapy for HSV.

Foscarnet also has off-label use in certain instances, such as gastrointestinal diseases such as esophagitis or colitis, outer retinal necrosis, allogeneic stem cell transplant, Varicella zoster virus (VZV) treatment, and even in the prevention of CMV infection itself.
