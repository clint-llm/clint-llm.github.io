Ommaya reservoirs are used for the administration of drugs into the intrathecal space, primarily for CNS hematological malignancies and also for drainage of intracranial cystic tumors. These devices are implanted by neurosurgeons under general anesthesia. Immediate postoperative care and repeated tumor cyst drainage would involve coordination between the neurosurgeons and the neurosurgical nursing team. These reservoirs are accessed by hematologists and oncologists for the administration of chemotherapeutic drugs and CSF sampling for the dose titration, as early as the day of operation. Radiologists play a part in their management as these patients often require imaging to assess for intracranial disease/tumor staging or, rarely, for malfunctioning of the device. General practitioners and community nursing staff should be aware and able to identify early signs of infection. Once the skin heals, these devices do not require any special care. They can remain in place for months to years. [Level 5]
