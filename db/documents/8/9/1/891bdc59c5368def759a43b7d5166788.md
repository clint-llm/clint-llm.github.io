Patients with actinic prurigo will typically present in early spring as sunlight becomes more prevalent, and individuals spend more time exposing their skin to sunlight. Patients will present with intensely itchy, erythematous papulonodular lesions on predominantly sun-exposed areas of the skin. The face, especially over the zygomatic arches, nasal bridge, lower lip, and conjunctiva, is typically affected. However, lesions may develop anywhere on the neck, trunk, extremities, and even non-sun exposed areas such as the buttocks. Since the lesions are intensely pruritic, excoriations, skin thickening, scarring, and hyper- or hypopigmentation may occur.

Actinic cheilitis has been described as a hallmark finding in patients with actinic prurigo. Individuals may present with actinic cheilitis as a solitary finding or in concurrence with more widespread papulonodular lesions.
