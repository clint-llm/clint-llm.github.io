Traumatic retroperitoneal hemorrhage has a high associated degree of mortality, with an overall rate of approximately 18%. More deadly injuries were identified to be those from blunt trauma, injuries of two or more retroperitoneal zones, and those who received surgical intervention more than 6 hours after injury.

As the causes of spontaneous retroperitoneal bleeding are diverse and wide-ranging, so too are the clinical outcomes. A large majority of patients will respond to medical management alone. Of those with ongoing bleeding and worsening symptoms, approximately 25% will receive angiographic therapy as definitive management, and an additional 9% will need surgery. All-cause mortality ranges from as low as 6% to as high as 22% overall.
