**Complications of Hyphema**

- Increase in intraocular pressure

- Chances of rebleeding

- Corneal staining

- In patients of sickle cell anemia, the hypoxic environment inside the anterior chamber increases the chances of sickling, leading to blockage of trabecular meshwork by the sickled RBCs leading to further aggravation of the condition.

**Complications of Vitreous Hemorrhage**

- Epiretinal membrane formation

- Pigmentary retinopathy

- Pre-retinal fibrosis

- Strabismus (long-standing hemorrhage involving the visual axis)

- Occlusion amblyopia (if the hemorrhage is obstructing the visual axis at an early age)

- Tractional retinal detachment

- Secondary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.

- Neovascular glaucoma

**Complications of Suprachoroidal Hemorrhage**

Suprachoroidal hemorrhage is one of the most dreadful complications of any intraocular surgery. Once it occurs, visual recovery is very difficult despite all measures.

**Complications of Macular Hemorrhage**

- Photoreceptor cell damage

- Submacular fibrosis

- Retinal neovascularization(secondary to ischemia)

- Vitreoretinal fibrovascular proliferation.

- Chronic heme collection can lead to macular scarring leading to a drastic loss of vision.
