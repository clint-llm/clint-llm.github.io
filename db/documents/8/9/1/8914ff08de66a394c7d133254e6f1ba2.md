The differential diagnosis for hearing loss in the elderly is broad, and although ARHL is common, other causes of hearing loss must be considered. Key components in distinguishing ARHL from other causes of hearing loss are a thorough history and physical exam and a comprehensive audiogram. By first distinguishing conductive, sensorineural, or mixed hearing loss, providers can subsequently perform more advanced diagnostics if indicated.

Conductive hearing loss is caused by a problem with the external ear, ear canal, tympanic membrane, or middle ear ossicles – all of which transmit sound waves to the inner ear. Common causes include cerumen impaction, foreign bodies, otitis externa, otitis media, tumors, perforation of the tympanic membrane, cholesteatoma, and otosclerosis.

Sensorineural hearing loss results when there is a problem with the cochlea, auditory nerve, or sound processing. Differential diagnoses include ARHL, noise exposure, toxin exposure, Meniere disease, labyrinthitis, viral infection, acoustic neuromas, and other inner ear and skull base lesions.
