Because PLDs are frequently missed, their true incidence is unknown. Furthermore, PLDs lack their own diagnosis code, and as such, they are grouped under mid-carpal joint dislocations in both the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 and ICD 10. This classification makes it difficult to aggregate epidemiological data. In general, fracture-dislocations of the carpus are uncommon as compared to fractures of the distal radius, metacarpals, and phalanges. Fractures and fracture-dislocations of the carpus have an annual incidence of 37.5Â per 100,000 persons and constitute 2.8% of all fractures. Perilunate injuries are estimated to represent less than 10% of all wrist injuries.
