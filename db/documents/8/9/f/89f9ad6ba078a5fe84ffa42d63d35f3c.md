The breast implant controversy peaked in the early 1990s when Connie Chung aired a segment suggesting implants were causing autoimmune diseases after anecdotal reports were linking gel implants with systemic diseases such as connective tissue disorders and even cancer. Due to safety concerns and lack of clinical studies to support the safety of the devices, the FDA issued a moratorium on the use of gel implants. This led to a class-action lawsuit that was settled in 1994 and led to the chapter 11 bankruptcy of Dow Corning. Saline implants were the only type that was available until the return of gel implants in the mid-2000s.
