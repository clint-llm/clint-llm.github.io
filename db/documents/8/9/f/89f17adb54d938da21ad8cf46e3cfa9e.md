The LAD is the largest coronary artery.  Atherosclerosis or thrombotic occlusion of this vessel causes myocardial infarction involving large areas of the anterior, septal and apical portions of the heart muscle leading to serious impairment of cardiac performance.  For the same reason, during revascularization by percutaneous or surgical methods, it is important to restore the flow in the LAD.
