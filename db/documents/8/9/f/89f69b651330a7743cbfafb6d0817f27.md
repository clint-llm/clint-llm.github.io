- It is essential to establish the etiology of the dislocation, particularly in those that have recurrent dislocations as this can alterÂ the management plan

- Acute dislocations can be managed conservatively with bracing and physiotherapy with a focus on quadriceps, VMO and core strengthening

- Be wary of the patient with a large hemarthrosis and normal radiographs as they may have a sizeable osteochondral fragment that requires early fixation

- Surgery, where needed, is typically tailored to the patient's anatomical profile and their predisposing factors

- Most surgical procedures are not indicated in patients with open physes

- Despite surgery, there remains a small risk of recurrence
