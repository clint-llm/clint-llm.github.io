Oophorectomy alone or in conjunction with a hysterectomy has excellent outcomes. Most oophorectomies are performed as outpatient surgeries. Laparoscopic oophorectomy should be considered standard unless an open approach is otherwise indicated. As fertility preservation techniques evolve, the recommended technique for oophorectomy may change, as well, specifically with where to begin dissection and if electrocautery versus sharp dissection yield better outcomes.
