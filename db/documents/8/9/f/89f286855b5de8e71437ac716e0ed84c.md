An alloplastic chin implant is used to augment chin projection and can be used to provide a more attractive appearance of the face. Increasing the projection and/or width of the chin to provide a more balanced nose-chin relationship or more pleasing pre-jowl area, respectively, are two examples where this is especially apparent. When performing an alloplastic chin implantation, a comprehensive understanding of the anatomy and precise surgical technique are essential to achieving optimal results.
