The diagnosis and management of fat embolism is best done by an interprofessional team. The diagnosis is not always simple and there is no specific treatment for the disorder. The key is to keep the patient hydrated and ensure that the fractured limb is immobilized or fixed promptly. Many agents have been recommended for the treatment of fat embolism but none has proven to be reliable or consistently effective.

A meta-analysis ofÂ seven randomized control trials using corticosteroid prophylaxis showed close to 77% reduction in the risk for fat embolism syndrome in a patient with a long bone fracture. There is, however, no difference in mortality, infection, or avascular necrosis between the treatment group and control. For this reason, the use of corticosteroids is still very controversial.

The prognosis of patients with fat embolism depends on early open reduction and internal fixation of the long bone fracture. Most patients with adequate support therapy can recover from the neurological, respiratory, and retinal changes associated with fat embolism syndrome. Delays in treatment can lead to ARDs, cerebral edema and a mortality rate that averages 7%.
