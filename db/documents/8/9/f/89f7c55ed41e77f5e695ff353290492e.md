Several types of cartilage are found in the human body, and their structure and relevant function depend on this variation.

**Hyaline Cartilage**

Hyaline cartilage is the most copious type of cartilage in the human body.

**Elastic Cartilage**

This cartilage appears a dull yellow and is most commonly found in the larynx, ear, epiglottis, and eustachian tube. A perichondrium-like layer also surrounds it. It provides flexibility and is resilient to pressure.

**Fibrocartilage**

This is abundant in type 1 collagen and contains significantly less proteoglycan than hyaline cartilage. It can resist high degrees of tension and compression. It is commonly found in tendons, ligaments, intervertebral discs, articular surfaces of some bones, and in menisci. Unlike other cartilage, it has no perichondrium.
