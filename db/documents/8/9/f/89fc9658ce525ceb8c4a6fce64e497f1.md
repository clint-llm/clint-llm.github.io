The ophthalmic artery is the first intradural branch of the carotid artery; thus, its function reflects the activity in ocular microcirculation and carotid artery blood flow. Ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS) is defined as visual function disorder symptoms accompanying carotid artery stenosis. In its acute state, OIS manifests as amaurosis fugax and retinal artery occlusion, whilst in its chronic state, OIS manifests as retinopathy and rubeotic or neovascular glaucoma. This activity discusses the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and treatment of patients with ocular ischemic syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of ocular ischemic syndrome.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with ocular ischemic syndrome.
- Summarize the management considerations for patients with ocular ischemic syndrome.
