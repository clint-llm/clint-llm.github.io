Sleep is vital to a patient’s overall health and feeling of well-being. There is emerging evidence tying sleep disturbances and insomnia disorders to increased cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality. Due to the hyperarousal state, patients with insomnia have a higher incidence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and acute myocardial infarction. These states mostly relate to the hypercortisolemia effect of insomnia by way of causing stress. Other studies show a correlation between insomnia and neurocognitive decline; this includes impairments in memory, executive functions, and attention. These impairments over time give way to developing psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and even suicide. The long-term prognosis, however, of short-term insomnia is very good if interventions and treatments are made appropriately and promptly.
