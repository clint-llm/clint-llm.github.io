Malignant atrophic papulosis, otherwise known as Kohlmeier–Degos disease or Degos disease, is a rare disorder of thrombo-obliterative vasculopathy affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system. The characteristic papular skin lesions with central porcelain-white atrophy and a surrounding telangiectatic rim are considered pathognomonic. There are currently two forms of the disease described in the literature: a potentially life-threatening systemic form and a benign monosymptomatic cutaneous form. Thus, atrophic papulosis, rather than malignant atrophic papulosis, has been proposed as a more inclusive disease name. Subsequently, the disease would then get further subclassified into malignant systemic disease (malignant atrophic papulosis) and benign cutaneous disease (benign atrophic papulosis).
