A cloverleaf skull usually results from premature closure of the coronal and lambdoid sutures. Bi-coronal synostosis can lead to skull base hypoplasia leading to reduced intracranial volume. This can lead to a rise in intracranial pressure (ICP), which can present as headache or visual disturbance. Another cause of hydrocephalus is aqueductal stenosis, which is seen rarely in these patients. Characteristic facial features of PS result from the premature fusion of the skull bones. Abnormal growth of these bones leads to proptosis, wide-set eyes, a high forehead, an underdeveloped maxilla, and a beaked nose. Patients with PS may manifest upper airway obstruction related to midface hypoplasia and secondary nasal obstruction.

Maxillary hypoplasia leads to a reduced intra-orbital volume, which ultimately results in the development of proptosis, xerophthalmia, and exposure keratitis. Visual disturbances can be due to extraocular muscle imbalance secondary to proptosis or due to raised intracranial pressure. Hearing loss can be due to recurrent ear infections, hypoplasia of the middle ear, or auditory canal atresia. Maxillary hypoplasia also results in reduced space of nasopharynx, oropharynx, and larynx leading to snoring, nasal regurgitation, aspiration of food, and obstructive sleep apnea.
