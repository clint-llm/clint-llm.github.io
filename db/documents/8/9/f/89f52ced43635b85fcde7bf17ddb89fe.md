There is a difference between the weight of the gland in females and males. In females, during pregnancy, the size of the gland may even double. The gland may be flattened laterally due to the pressure of the carotid arteries. The height of the gland ranges between 3Â to 11 mm. If the gland did not fill the hypophyseal fossa, the subarachnoid cisterns would encroach upon the fossa. There are variations in the size and degree of pneumatization of the sphenoid sinus. The sellar type is the most common type of pneumatization of the sphenoid sinus. This pneumatization has clinical relevance as there can be complications from the transsphenoidal resection surgery due to these variations. The distance between the optic chiasm and the tuberculum sellae ranges between 1.5 to 8 mm. The common variations in the gland anatomy must be taken into consideration as they may prove to be hazardous and may lead to life-threatening complications during surgical procedures.
