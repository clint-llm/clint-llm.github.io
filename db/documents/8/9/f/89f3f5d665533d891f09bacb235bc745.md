The majority of patients with rotator cuff syndrome (RCS) in the absence of FTTs improve with nonoperative management. The most recent AAOS CPG touted a “moderate” recommendation grade for initial treatment of NSAIDs and/or exercises programs based on multiple level II studies in the literature.

In 2013, The MOON shoulder group provided insight into the management and outcomes of atraumatic, FTT of the RC.  In a cohort of almost 500 patients, nonoperative treatment resulted in 75% reporting positive patient-reported outcomes at 2-year follow-up.  In addition, the patients electing to undergo surgery (25%) typically decided to do so between 6- and 12-weeks following the initial onset of symptoms.
