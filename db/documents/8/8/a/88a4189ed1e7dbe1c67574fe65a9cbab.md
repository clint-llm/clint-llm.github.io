**External genitalia:**These anatomical structures are visible on inspection and do not require speculum examination. They include the mons pubis, clitoris, urethral meatus, vestibule of the vagina, labia majora and minora, vaginal opening, hymen, perineum, and anus. The external female genitalia is collectively known as the vulva.

**Vagina**: The muscular canal that connects the vulva to the cervix. It is an elastic passageway that varies in length and width. It functions as a source of sexual pleasure and a route for fetal delivery. It also conducts the passage of sperm after intercourse and blood during menses.

**Cervix:**The opening from the vagina to the uterus. It is usually 2 or 3 cm long. The cervix has a central opening called the cervical canal flanked by the external os anteriorly and the internal os posteriorly. Canal width varies throughout a female’s life, with maximal dilation to around 10cm during childbirth.

**Uterus corpus:**The uterus lies midline within the pelvis between the bladder anteriorly and the rectum posteriorly. It usually lies in an anteverted and anteflexed position. Version refers to the position of the cervix relative to the vagina, and flexion refers to the position of the fundus relative to the cervix. The fallopian tubes connect to the uterine corpus at the fundus bilaterally, with tubal ostia able to be visualized on hysteroscopy.
