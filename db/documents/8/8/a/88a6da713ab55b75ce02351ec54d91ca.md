The patient is positioned supine with their injured knee flexed to 20 to 30 degrees while also slightly externally rotating the injured leg to relax the iliotibial band.  The examiner then uses one hand to stabilize the distal femur while using the other hand to grasp the proximal tibia. Next, an anterior force is applied to the proximal tibia in an attempt to sublux the tibia forward while keeping the femur stabilized.

The test is considered positive if there is excessive anterior translation of the proximal tibia greater than the uninjured side and also a lack of a firm endpoint. Endpoints are graded from “hard” to “soft,” and have been nominally classified as A (firm, hard endpoint) or B (absent, soft endpoint).

A modified Lachman test involves placing the examiner’s knee below the patient’s posterior thigh of the affected leg to create a more stable anchor when performing the test. The prone Lachman test, which can be used to enhance patient comfort, is also a reliable evaluation technique that can be used to confirm the presence of an ACL tear but should not be used as the sole criterion to rule out the presence of the injury.
