Microbial contamination of the surgical wound is the first step in the development of an SSI, which may come from either endogenous or exogenous sources.

Endogenous flora includes the patient’s skin, mucous membranes, and hollow viscera. The most common endogenous causative organisms are S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus, and Escherichia coli. However, this depends greatly on the procedure performed. In cardiac, breast, ophthalmic, orthopedic, and vascular surgeries, the most common causative organism is S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, while in abdominal surgeries, Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes are more common.

Exogenous flora may come from the theatre room, including air, instruments, materials, and staff members. The most common exogenous organisms are staphylococci and streptococci. Also, the number and the virulence of the organism are major risk factors. There is an increasing rate of high virulence organisms isolated from post-operative wound infections such as MRSA, possibly due to the widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

In a study of community hospitals in the southeastern United States, the incidence of MRSA-associated SSI increased from 12% in 2000 to 23% in 2005. In the 2010 NHSN update, the proportion of SSI due to MRSA was 43.7%.
