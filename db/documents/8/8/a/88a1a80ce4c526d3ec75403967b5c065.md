Mutations in the VHL gene can be transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion or in a sporadic way. More than 50% of the patients with ccRCC sporadically have VHL gene abnormalities.

A defective VHL gene results in the interaction among intracellular proteins resulting in the upregulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding for growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor-beta (PDGFB), vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFA). All these growth factors promote the development of these vascular tumors.Â Under normal oxygen conditions, HIF1A and HIF2A undergo hydroxylation and binds to a protein called pVHL and are degraded. In hypoxemic conditions or the absence of pVHL, HIFA accumulates, leading to the upregulation of mRNA and increased production of the growth factors.
