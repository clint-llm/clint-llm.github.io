A concern regarding the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS)Â is unintended pediatric ingestions. Ethanol-based hand sanitizers can cause alcohol poisoning if a person swallows more than a couple of mouthfuls. The United States National Poison Data System reports 65,000 incidences of ingestion between 2011 and 2014. Several studies have found that ethanol ingestion from hand sanitizers can induce intoxication and hypoglycemia in children. Older children have been known to swallow hand sanitizers to become drunk purposefully as well.
