Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch can be performed through the open or laparoscopic approach. For this article, we will focus on the laparoscopic approach. The basic laparoscopic equipment that will be needed will include an insufflator with CO2 gas, sterile surgical drapes, high definition monitors, laparoscopic instruments, electrocautery devices, and trocars. Bariatric patients typically require longer bariatric trocars and instruments due to the increased thickness of the abdominal wall.
