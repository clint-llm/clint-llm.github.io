There is no specific antidote forÂ treating rufinamide toxicity. Hemodialysis can cause limited clearance of rufinamide; therefore, no specific evidence is available for rufinamide toxicity antidote, except for general maneuvers for removing unabsorbed medication (emesis, gastric lavage, and airway protection, etc.).
