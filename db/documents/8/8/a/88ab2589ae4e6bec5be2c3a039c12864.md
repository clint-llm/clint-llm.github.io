Amidst the coronavirus 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020, trench fever's emergence in Denver, Colorado, served as a reminder that we must remain ready for new and old threats. Historically, trench fever caused significant morbidity for more than 1 million soldiers during World War I and is often linked to those suffering from homelessness and/or poor hygiene. Classic trench fever typically presents with a recurrent fever pattern, "quintan fever," as well as general non-specific influenza-like symptoms like fever, headache, malaise, and a rash.
