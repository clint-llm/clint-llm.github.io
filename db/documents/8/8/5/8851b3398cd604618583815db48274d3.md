Coronoid fractures are believed to occur due to a shearing force when excess stress is placed on the elbow. They are often the result of an associated elbow dislocation. This activity reviews the basic presentation and evaluation of coronoid process fractures. The pertinent anatomy is reviewed, and treatment of these injuries, including various surgical techniques, is included. The importance of an interprofessional approach in addressing these injuries is also highlighted as orthopedic surgery, primary care, radiology, and physical therapist are all vital.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the common history and physical exam findings of patients with coronoid process fractures.
- Explain how to identify a coronoid fracture on imaging. 
- Review the treatment options available for coronoid fractures and outline essential criteria to consider when choosing the appropriate treatment.
- Identify the importance of collaboration and communication between patients, surgeons, primary care, physical therapy, and other members of the interprofessional healthcare team in treating coronoid fractures to enhance outcomes for patients.
