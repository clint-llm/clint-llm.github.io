Complications in primary congenital glaucoma can be related to disease or surgery or anesthesia-related. Patients having delayed presentations may develop significant visual impairment or glaucomatous optic atrophy, or visual field defects. Development of corneal and Haabâ€™s striae may later lead to permanent opacification of the cornea, thus hampering vision significantly. Stretching of the eyeball due to elevated pressures may lead to axial myopia or even astigmatism. Refractive correction needs to be given and followed up lifelong, as untreated cases can develop refractive amblyopia.
