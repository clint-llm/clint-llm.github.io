It is vital to recognize that chronic pain conditions for which intrathecal drug delivery is appropriate are optimally managed by an integrated health care team.  Intrathecal therapy and management can substantially lower health care costs compared with conventional pain management, especially when there is a cessation of systemic opioids.

The guidelines emphasize the necessity for provider education across health care settings and specialties to address the expanding evidence related to intrathecal drug delivery for chronic pain.  Protocols for the patient and IDDS management should be assembled around a collaborative team-based care model that provides ongoing education for patients and caregivers, along with the proper use of psychosocial support services.  A patient-centered approach can lend to encouraging outcomes among patients with refractory chronic pain.
