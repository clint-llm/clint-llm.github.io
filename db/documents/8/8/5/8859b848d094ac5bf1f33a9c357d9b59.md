The clinical presentation of osteomyelitis depends on the etiology. Sometimes diagnosis in adults can be tricky, and it requires a high index of suspicion. A good history and physical is always the right place to start and are essential parts of the initial evaluation. Some patients are at high risk for osteomyelitis, and these include those with bacteremia, endocarditis, intravenous drug use, trauma, and open fractures. Also, patients with chronic poorly healing wounds in the setting of diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, peripheral neuropathy, or orthopedic hardware are at increased risk.

In chronic osteomyelitis, symptoms may occur over a longer duration of time, usually more than two weeks. As with acute osteomyelitis, patients may also present with swelling, pain, and erythema at the site of infection, but constitutional symptoms like fever are less common.  Patients who have deep or extensive ulcers that do not heal after several weeks of appropriate therapy, especially in people with diabetes or debilitated patients, should raise the suspicion for osteomyelitis. Physical examination should focus primarily on finding a possible nidus of infection, assessing sensory function, and peripheral vasculature. Tenderness to palpation over vertebral bone may be a significant finding in vertebral osteomyelitis. The ability to probe an ulcer to the bone with a blunt sterile instrument is highly suggestive of osteomyelitis.
