Actively metabolizing tissue requires a constant supply of blood for the delivery of nutrients and the removal of waste products. Under ideal conditions, the blood supply to the tissue is matched to the rate of oxygen consumption to allow biochemical processes to proceed at optimal speeds. Situations resulting in insufficient blood supply slow down or completelyÂ halt vital reactions. More specifically, subprime perfusion causes cells to shift to anaerobic metabolic pathways leading to the generation of lactic acid and other bioactive compounds. Effects of toxic metabolite accumulation include reduced cellular pH, enzyme denaturation, and altered membrane potentials. These changes are detrimental l cellular, tissue, organ, and eventually, global catastrophe if left uncorrected.
