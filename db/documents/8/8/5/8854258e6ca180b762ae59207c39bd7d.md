The pathogenesis of R. akari infection is still unknown. More research is needed. It is unclear how R. akari acquired the plasmid. It can be a potentially powerful tool for future genetic manipulation, to study the yet unknown facets of the host cell interactions as well as mechanisms of immune evasion employed by this group of organisms.
