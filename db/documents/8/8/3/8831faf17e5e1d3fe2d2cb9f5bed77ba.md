Drug metabolism is a crucial aspect of medical practice and pharmacology. Most drugs undergo chemical alteration by various bodily systems to create compounds that are more easily excreted from the body. These chemical alterations occur primarily in the liver and are known as biotransformations. Understanding these alterations in chemical activity is crucial in utilizing the optimal pharmacological intervention for any patient and is thus of interest to any provider who routinely treats patients with medication.
