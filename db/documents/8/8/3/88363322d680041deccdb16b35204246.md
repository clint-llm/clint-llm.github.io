Urinary diversion involves the re-routing of urinary drainage to the outside of the body - either as a temporary or permanent solution. Commonly, a permanent urinary diversion is created after surgery to treat a bladder or pelvic malignancy, but it can be performed for other functional and anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract. They can be classified as percutaneous, continent, or incontinent. We are focusing on incontinent diversion in this chapter, of which there are two types - cutaneous ureterostomy and intestinal or ileal conduit. Ureterostomy is rarely used and usually only as a last resort in salvage procedures.

Ileal conduits are the most common form of incontinent urinary diversion, other options providing continent urinary diversion do exist, and these are more widely practiced in America, whereas in Europe, ileal conduits are preferred.  Ileal conduits are the gold standard urinary diversion technique against which all others are measured today.

It is thought to have originally been developed by French surgeons during World War II, but the technique did not come to prominence until 1950, when an effective adhesive appliance for ileostomy was introduced. As time has passed, and both oncological and surgical techniques have evolved, selecting the right patients for an ileal conduit has become more refined along with the surgical approach.
