Fingertip injuries can be classified by the mechanism of injury or the level of injury based on the frequently used Allen classification system.

- Crush injury due to forces of compression. An example is a door closing on the finger, injury with a hammer, and objects being dropped on fingers. This can present as a closed or an open injury and can be associated with distal phalanx fractures.

- A laceration is secondary to a household instrument (knife, scissors, and cans) or works tools (rotatory saw) involving pulp or nail and/or the nail bed complex.

- Amputations involve both soft tissue loss and partial or complete distal phalanx loss. Such injuries can cause cosmetic and functional defects.

- Other injury mechanisms are sudden flexion or extension forces leading to distal tendon avulsion injuries.

Allen classifications are based on the four types listed below.

- Type 1: involves only the pulp

- Type 2: involves the pulp and nail bed

- Type 3: includes partial loss of the distal phalanx

- Type 4: injury proximal to the lunula

Type 1 injuries may heal quite well by secondary intention. Type 3 and type 4 often require some flap coverage.
