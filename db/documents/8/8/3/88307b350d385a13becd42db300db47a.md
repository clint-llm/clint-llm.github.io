Egg allergy presents with non-specific symptoms and can often be confused for general food intolerance, gastrointestinal upset, or another associated food allergy.If a patient is lactose intolerant and consumes a milk product that can contain egg product (i.e., custard, ice cream), the gastrointestinal symptoms can be falsely attributed to egg allergy although there is no exact IgE-mediated allergic reaction. Â Skin manifestations (such as atopic dermatitis) can be due to contact allergies.
