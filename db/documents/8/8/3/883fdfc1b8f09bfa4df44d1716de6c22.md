Complications are common after reduction mammoplasty, but most are minor and do not require additional surgeries. BMI over 30 and smoking are risk factors that increase the risk of complications. As the quantity of breast resection increases, so does the chance of complications. Minor complications that can be seen in the early postoperative period include hematoma, seroma, cellulitis, wound infection, delayed wound healing, and minor wound dehiscence. Major complications that often require surgical intervention are major wound dehiscence, flap necrosis, and nipple-areolar necrosis. Once all wounds are well healed, complications involving cosmetic appearance are asymmetry, lack of proper shape, dog ears, under resection, over resection, and unsightly scars.
