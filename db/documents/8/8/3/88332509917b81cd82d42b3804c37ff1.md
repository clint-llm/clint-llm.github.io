As one study states, significant adverse events are not well described or correlated with manual therapy use. For instance, there is no correlation to a musculoskeletal treatment with resulting gastrointestinal complications that we are aware of, although they rarelyÂ coincidentally occur. However, minor adverse events that require little to no follow-up are known to occur with manual therapy, such as headache, muscle soreness, and light-headedness.
