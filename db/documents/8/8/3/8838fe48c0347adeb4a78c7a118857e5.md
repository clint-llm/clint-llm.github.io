The function of DNA replication is multifold and essential to life as we know it. This biological process allows for the genetic blueprints of a cell to be passed on to daughter cells in cell division without loss of genetic information. Without replication, when the cell divides, the information would be split and only partially passed on.

DNA replication also allows for protein synthesis, which is how genes are expressed. Protein synthesis begins with transcribing the specific gene, or section of DNA, which codes for the desired protein. Without replication, a gene could have a limited number of outputs and could transcribe a limited number of proteins.
