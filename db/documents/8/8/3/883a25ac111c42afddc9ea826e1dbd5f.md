The collateral ligaments and their significant responsibility in maintaining elbow function make it pivotal for physicians to diagnose injuries properly. Whether the MCL or LCL injury at the elbow, a history, physical exam, imaging, and exhausted conservative treatments prior to surgery is the generalized outline of patient care.

Medial elbow injuries are amongst the most common in sports. Elbow injuries are the most common cause of time loss (over ten days) in collegiate pitchers, Upper extremity injuries account for 45% of all injuries in the NCAA, and 7-8% of these injuries belong to the elbow. Specifically pertaining to baseball, 97% of pitchers elbow pain is on the medial side of the elbow

A patient history determining the location of the pain, how long the pain has been present, the exact point in motion where the patient experiences the injury is imperative in diagnosing MCL injury. If present in an athlete, they may complain of decreased performance, such as throwing velocity or stamina. Patients might also site issues of numbness and tingling in the ulnar distribution pattern since the chronic UCL injuries are associated with ulnar neuropathy. Physical exam should check for the palmaris longus muscle if surgery is required; this requires the patient to flex the wrist with opposing the first and fifth digits.

Special tests, including the valgus stress test, milking maneuver, and moving valgus stress test, can be performed to facilitate the diagnosis of UCL injury. Imaging such as MRI, MRA, and US provide the best visualization for the UCL. The MRA has the highest sensitivity and specificity, along with superior interobserver reliability. Imaging can also provide prognostic factors. One study demonstrated that MRI of UCL with a higher T2 signal intensity is less likely to benefit from conservative treatment.

While not as common as MCL injuries, PLRI due to LCL damage can occur. Similar to that of MCL, history is a critical portion in evaluation, although injury to the LCL may not be as apparent as is with the MCL. The physical exam can include special tests, such as the pivot-shift test (mentioned above), posterolateral rotatory drawer test, chair push-up test, prone push-up test, and table-top relocation test. All of these are examining for radial head subluxation or apprehension in conscious patients.

Varus posteromedial rotatory instability occurs when axial and valgus stress is applied to the forearm, which is in a pronated position. This stress results in a fracture to the anteromedial facet of the coronoid, and LCL rupture. This injury typically occurs in an acute, traumatic setting. In a subacute setting, the gravity-assisted varus stress test is an option, where the patient flexes and extends their elbow at 90 degrees of shoulder abduction, allowing gravity to apply the varus stress. This technique has shown to be the most sensitive and specific in diagnosing varus posteromedial rotatory instability.
