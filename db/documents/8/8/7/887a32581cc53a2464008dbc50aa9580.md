The humeral head articulates with the glenoid fossa of the scapula and forms the glenohumeral joint, a synovial ball and socket joint.

Articulation of the capitellum and trochlea of the humerus with the head of the radius bone and trochlear notch of the ulna forms the elbow joint, a synovial hinge joint. This joint is stabilized by the ulnar (medial) collateral ligament and radial (lateral) collateral ligament complexes.

- Anterior oblique band: the strongest and most significant stabilizer to valgus stress forces

- Courses from the medial epicondyle of the humerus to the sublime tubercle at the proximal ulna

- Posterior oblique band: tightest in flexion; the posterior component of the UCL demonstrates the most significant change in tension from flexion to extension range of motion (ROM) at the elbow.

- Transverse ligament: contributes minimal, if any, to elbow joint stability.

An olecranon bursa exists here to reduce friction during movementÂ as well. This joint allows only extension and flexion. Elbow movement is principally the result of the biceps brachii, coracobrachialis, and triceps muscles.
