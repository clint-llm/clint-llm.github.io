TTF is a new treatment modality for neoplastic diseases that utilizes low intensity, intermediate-frequency alternating electric fields to produce anti-mitotic activity. It has been approved for the treatment of recurrentÂ glioblastoma alone and in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, in which it may have a synergistic action. Its role in several other malignancies is the subject of many ongoing clinical trials. It is a relatively safe treatment with minimal side effects limited to locoregional skin tissue in the form of dermatitis.

Management of patients with malignancy requires the involvement of professionals from multiple disciplines like the specific surgical specialty, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, medical oncology, palliative care, and nursing staff.
