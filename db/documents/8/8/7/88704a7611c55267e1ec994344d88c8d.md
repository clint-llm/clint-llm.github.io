Although not always a necessity, it is good practice for any patient with some degree of suspected spinal deformity to establish care with either an orthopedic spine surgeon or neurosurgeon.

Neurosurgery or orthopedic spine surgery consultation should be obtained for any patient with the following:

- Hyperkyphosis unresponsive to conservative management

- Any neurologic deficit

- Patients with compromised pulmonary function testing attributable to their kyphosis
