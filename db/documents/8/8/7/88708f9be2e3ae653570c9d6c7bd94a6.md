An angioneurotic edema attack can occur at any point in time after the first exposure up to several times later. The time scale of hypersensitivity and resolution is unknown. ANE tends to recur in certain patients. Family screening plays a role in patients with possible HANE to identify susceptible families. Sudden death due to laryngeal edema is relatively common in HANE. The management strategy is to provide physician-supervised self-managed C1 esterase therapy-on-demand to terminate HANE attacks when the patient feels that needs to be given.

Tranexamic acid, which presumably works on prostaglandin activation, has also been used as prophylaxis for HANE with some reduction in the frequency of attacks and, consequently, has been used in the acute event. However, studies have shown that it usually takes 24 to 72 hours for the resolution of symptoms.
