The prognosis for patients suffering from hypovolemia depends on the underlying etiology and prompt management of the fluid status. There is a high risk of permanent damage such as cardiac arrhythmias, cerebral hypoperfusion, and multi-organ failure if left untreated. However, in the majority of cases, hypovolemia that is quickly identified and managed with proper fluid resuscitation and addressingÂ the underlying etiology results in a very favorable prognosis.
