For planned valve repair procedures, patients should be fasting for eight or more hours prior to the procedure. Adequate pre-operative medical evaluation should be performed, including a comprehensive analysis of history, physical examination, and laboratory testing based on individual risk factors. Most patients usually undergo coronary artery evaluation prior to the valve repair procedure. However, this should be individualized since younger patients with congenital valve deformities may otherwise have no or few cardiac risk factors and hence not necessarily need a coronary artery disease evaluation.

Surgical time out should be performed by one of the team members, affirming the patient, the procedure to be performed, and all essential medications and allergies reviewed. After sedating the patient, the patient should be prepped and draped using sterile technique.
