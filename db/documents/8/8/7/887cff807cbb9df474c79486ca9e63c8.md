In acute topiramate overdose, the most frequent clinical features reported are drowsiness, vertigo, agitation, and mydriasis. In severe overdose, secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures followed by deep coma, somnolence, bradykinesia have been reported. Mild to moderate metabolic acidosis has been observed with topiramate overdose. Therefore it is important to assess arterial blood gas(ABG) status in any patient presenting an acute topiramate overdose.

**Management**

Treatment of acute phentermine intoxication is largely symptomatic and includes lavage and sedation with a barbiturate. Acidification of the urine increases phentermine excretion. Intravenous phentolamine has been suggested for severe hypertension. Activated charcoal has been shown to adsorb topiramate. Hemodialysis is an efficacious means of removing topiramate from the body. Currently, there is no specific antidote for phentermine-topiramate overdose. Therefore, treatment for overdose is largely supportive, focusing on the airway, breathing, and circulation. It is important to note that current AHA guidelines of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) recommend following order CAB (circulation-airway-breathing).
