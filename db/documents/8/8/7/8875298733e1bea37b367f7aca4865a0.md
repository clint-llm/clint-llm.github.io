The differential diagnosis for night terrors can include but is not limited to the following:

- Seizures: An abnormal, excessive synchronous discharge of neurons originating from the cerebral cortex causing a physical disturbance

- Somnambulism (also known as sleepwalking): A benign, self-limited arousal parasomnia disorder that is characterized either excessive bed movement or walking during sleep

- Nightmares: A disorder that occurs during REM stage of sleep that is characterized extreme fear, horror, distress or anxiety

- Narcolepsy: An adolescent age chronic sleep disorder consisting of excessive daytime drowsiness

- Sleep Apnea Hypersomnia: A sleep disorder in which the feeling of constant, recurrent episodes of extreme sleepiness and sleep deprivation are intertwined with interruptions of breathing

- Breath-holding spells: These occur most often between the ages of six to eighteen months in which some irritating stimuli trigger a voluntary episode of apnea or alteration in consciousness. It is not uncommon for these children to become cyanotic during the episodes.

- Syncope: A brief, sudden loss of consciousness and muscle tone that may be caused by a variety of reasons.

- Benign myoclonus: A self-limited episode of sudden jerking of the extremities in the early stages of sleep

- Shuddering attacks: A whole body attacks that resemble an essential tremor

- Tics: These are repetitive movements such as twitching, blinking, head shaking or other subtle movements that are done unconsciously by the patient.

- Gastroesophageal reflux: An arching or dystonic posturing (Sandifer's positioning) due to regurgitated gastric contents or acid into the esophagus

- Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES): formerly known as “Pseudoseizures”; this is a movement disorder that appears to be seizures however there is no abnormal brain activity, underlying etiology is often psychiatrically associated.
