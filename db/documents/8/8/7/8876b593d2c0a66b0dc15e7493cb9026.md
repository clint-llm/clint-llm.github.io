The subclavian veins are the major venous channel draining the upper extremity, arising from the axillary veins. The deep lymphatic vessels of the upper extremity follow the major deep veins, terminating in the humeral axillary lymph nodes, which function to drain lymphatic fluid from the upper limb's joint capsules, periosteum, tendons, and musculature. The efferent vessels from the apical axillary nodes travel through the cervicoaxillary canal before converging to form the subclavian lymphatic trunk. The left subclavian trunk directly drains into the thoracic duct, and the right subclavian trunk continues to form the right lymphatic duct, which enters at the right venous angle (junction of the internal jugular vein and subclavian vein).
