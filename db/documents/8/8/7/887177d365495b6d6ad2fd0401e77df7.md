In asymptomatic patients, treatment is not necessary. Observation and long-term follow-up may be considered; however, most patients do not require imaging follow-up in lesions less than 5 cm unless rapid growth or diagnosis is uncertain. As mentioned before, a percutaneous biopsy is not indicated, given the risk of hemorrhage.

In symptomatic patients or those with hemangiomas large enough, causing mass effect, surgical resection should be considered after other causes of pain have been excluded. Surgical resection options are liver resection, hepatic artery ligation, enucleation, and in severe cases, liver transplantation. Surgery is not entirely curative for symptoms, as it has been reported that 25% of those undergoing resection had persistence of symptoms.

**Non-surgical Treatment Options**

- Hepatic artery embolization: manage acute bleeding, symptoms, and decrease size before surgical resection

- Radiotherapy: rarely utilized and reserved for those lesions associated with Kasabach-Merritt Syndrome. It may aid in the decrease of the tumor size but has increased secondary risks of malignancy.

- Interferon alfa-2a: May work as an anti-angiogenic agent, but success has not been proven.
