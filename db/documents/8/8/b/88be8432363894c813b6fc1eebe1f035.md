Blind NT intubations should be avoided entirely in the veryÂ young pediatric population as the airway is more anterior and cephalic making blind passage of the tube almost impossible. Blind NT intubation should also be avoided in patients with expanding neck hematomas, oropharyngeal trauma, and in patients with apnea (no breaths to guide blind intubation).

Absolute contraindications for NPA and NT intubation include signs of basilar skull fractures, facial trauma, and disruption of the midface, nasopharynx or roof of the mouth.

Relative contraindications include suspected epiglottitis, coagulopathic patients (including those taking anti-coagulants) due to the risk of hemorrhage, large nasal polyps, and recent nasal surgery.
