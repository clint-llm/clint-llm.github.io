The differential diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis includes many pruritic and vesiculobullous disorders such as:

- Linear IgA disease

- Pemphigoid

- Eczema

- Scabies

Because of the often non-specific nature of dermatitis herpetiformis lesions, skin biopsy for direct IF should be considered in the investigation of patients with unexplained or treatment-refractory pruritic rashes.
