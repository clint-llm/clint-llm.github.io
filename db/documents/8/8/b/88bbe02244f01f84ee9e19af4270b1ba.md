Brain surgeries that involve the circle of Willis could cause damage to the sensory distribution of the homunculus due to the blood supply to this region are from the middle and anterior cerebral arteries. The damage to the blood supply would involve the postcentral gyrus, but not isolated to this gyrus only. The precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe (primary motor cortex) is commonly involved when the middle and anterior cerebral arteries are compromised. If the blood supply from the middle cerebral artery becomes affected, this will manifest as loss of sensation and motor function in the face and upper extremity while the compromise of the anterior cerebral artery will manifest as sensory and motor function loss in the lower extremity. The compromise of the middle and anterior cerebral artery can also be from surgery or manipulation of the carotid arteries. Surgeries on the common carotid arteries usually address severe stenosis from atherosclerosis. This procedure is called a carotid endarterectomy. With the carotid endarterectomy, there is a risk of creating a plaque embolismÂ leading to occlusion of one of the cerebral arteries. Thrombosis formation after the procedure can also be possible. The thrombosis would lead to a unilateral decreased in the blood to the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere. The feared complication of carotid endarterectomy is the rupture of the carotid artery leading to death.
