Myofascial pain syndrome is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the pharmacist. There is no one treatment that works in everyone and not everyone has the same response. A pain specialist should be involved early in the care. Because many of these patients have a range of mental health disorders, a mental health consult should be obtained.

Unfortunately, the prognosis for most patients is guarded because of recurrence of pain. Many patients regularly turn to alternative health care because of the failure of conventional medicine to help them with pain relief.
