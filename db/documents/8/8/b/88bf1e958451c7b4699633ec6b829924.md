With any atypical symptoms, careful evaluation and reassessment should take place before prescribing or dispensing clotrimazole. Vaginal candidal infections can co-exist with other sexually transmitted infections. Hence symptoms such as foul-smelling vaginal discharge, abdominal pain, or fever higher than 100 degrees F may indicate another vaginal infection or pelvic inflammatory disease.

The clinician or the nurse practitioner should also counsel the patient on the importance of reading labels to understand the possible side effects and avoid drug-related toxicities due to overdosing. Pharmacists should also check for any associated drug interactions and inform the prescriber and the patient of any concerns. Clinicians, nurses, physician assistants, and pharmacists should cooperate with interprofessional team strategies to advance appropriate antifungal treatment, identify warning signs of serious illness, and improve health outcomes. [level 5]
