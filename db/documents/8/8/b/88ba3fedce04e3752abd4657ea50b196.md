The basilar artery is formed by the convergence of the vertebral arteries at the junction of the pons and medulla. It provides oxygen-rich blood to the cerebellum, brainstem, thalamus, occipital, and medial temporal lobes of the brain. Basilar artery thrombosis is a devastating form of stroke with high morbidity and mortality. Its initial presentation is often extremely nonspecific and may include dizziness or blurring of vision. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of basilar artery thrombosis and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the anatomy of the basilar artery.
- Describe the different presentations of basilar artery thrombosis.
- Outline the management and treatment approaches for basilar artery thrombosis.
- Summarize the importance of improving coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by basilar artery thrombosis.
