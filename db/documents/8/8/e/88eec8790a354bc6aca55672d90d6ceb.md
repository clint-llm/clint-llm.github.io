A slip runs from the flexor digitorum longus to the flexor hallucis longus in most individuals, but an additional slip can also be viewed as an anatomical variant. This extremely rare extra muscle slip is known as the peroneocalcaneus internus. It originates inferiorly or laterally from the flexor hallucis longus muscle at the back of the fibula and passes over the sustentaculum tali alongside the flexor hallucis tendon, inserting into the calcaneus.

In patients with an anatomically variable flexor hallucis longus, research has found that the mean distance to the neurovascular tibial bundle increased, as the normal anatomy was 0.9 mm apart, while the anatomically varying individuals were 1.3 mm apart. This increased distance helps to improve safety in hindfoot endoscopic procedures.
