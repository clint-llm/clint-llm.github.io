A diagnosis of renal failure is based on abnormalities in GFR or creatinine clearance.

A 24-hour urine collection may provide insight into GFR and creatinine clearance, though this method is both burdensome and often inaccurate. Alternatively, a nuclear medicine radioisotope (iothalamate) clearance assay may be used to measure GFR. However, this test is also time-consuming and expensive relative to the Cockcroft-Gault formula [creatinine clearance = Sex times ((140 - Age) / (serum creatinine)) times (weight / 72)] or the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula [(GFR (mL/min/1.73 m) = 175 x (S) times (Age) times (0.742 if female) or times (1.212 if African American)] that are often used instead.

As per the National Kidney Foundation, patients presenting with chronic kidney disease are staged based on the estimated GFR (creatinine clearance) as calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.

- Stage 1 – normal GFR (90 mL/min or greater)

- Stage 2 – mildly reduced GFR (60 mL/min to 90 mL/min)

- Stage 3 – moderately reduced GFR (30 mL/min to 59 mL/min)

- Stage 4 – severely reduced GFR (15 mL/min to -29 mL/min)

- Stage 5 – ESRD (GFR < 15 mL/min or patient is on dialysis)

A renal ultrasound may be helpful to determine the size and shape of the kidneys and to evaluate for hydronephrosis or ureteral and/or bladder obstruction. This may result from kidney stones, neurologic abnormalities, trauma, pregnancy, prostate enlargement, retroperitoneal fibrosis, abdominal tumors (secondary to cervical or prostate cancers), or additional structural abnormalities. Early diabetic nephropathy, multiple myeloma, polycystic kidney diseases, and glomerulonephritis associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are all associated with enlarged kidneys on ultrasound.

Measuring the excretion of proteins in a patient's urine could also help clinch the diagnosis, as glomerulopathies are not an uncommon cause of ESRD. There is increasing evidence to support that the changes in dipstick proteinuria are an independent predictor of ESRD. Changes in proteinuria over two years may be relevant for the risk prediction of ESRD.

A brain computed tomography (CT) scan may be warranted if a patient presents with significant alterations in mental status. Uremic patients with a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level greater than 150 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL are also at an increased risk of developing spontaneous subdural hematomas. Given the increased risk of bleeding and hemorrhage in uremia (especially in the setting of a fall or trauma), a CT scan of the brain and abdomen may also be considered. In addition, an abdominal CT scan might help further elucidate the underlying cause of hydronephrosis if it was found on ultrasound without any obvious etiology.

Finally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be considered to assess for renal artery stenosis, thrombosis, or aortic and renal artery dissection - all potentially reversible causes of renal failure.

A renal biopsy may help determine the reversibility or treatability of the renal injury. It may ultimately be required to diagnose acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease accurately. However, a biopsy should not be performed in the case of small kidneys because of the associated comorbidities and increased risk of bleeding.
