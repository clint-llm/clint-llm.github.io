The absence of a cremasteric reflex in significant proportions of males at different ages would greatly impact the specificity of this reflex in the diagnosis of testicular torsion.

The cremasteric reflex is variable in performance. The definition of a positive cremasteric is unclear and is not well defined. Is a twitch of the muscle a positive response, or should the specific distance of testicle movement with the reflex be considered positive?

Another important practical point related to the cremasteric reflex in spinal anesthesia is that while the cremasteric reflex absence after spinal anesthesia may be an indicator of efficient anesthesia in adults, yet, it is an unreliable sign of assessing efficient spinal anesthesia in children.
