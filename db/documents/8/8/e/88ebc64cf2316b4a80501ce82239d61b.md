First described in 1880, most reported cases of ureteral involvement with a groin hernia have been ureteral inguinal hernias. Ureterofemoral and ureterosciatic hernias are also seen. Both genders are affected, although ureteral inguinal hernias are more common in men. Risk factors for developing a ureteral inguinal hernia include male gender, increased age, and a history of a kidney transplant.Â Ureterofemoral hernias are more commonly seen in women.
