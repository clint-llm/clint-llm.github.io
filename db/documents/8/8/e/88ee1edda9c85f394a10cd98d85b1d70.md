Diagnostic testing for protein C deficiency is performed using functional assays including clotting assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and chromogenic tests to determine levels of protein C activity. Mutational analysis of the PROC gene is also available.

The mean plasma concentration of protein C in a normal term infant is 40 IU dL-1, increasing to approximately 60 IU dL-1 at 6 months old. The normal range of protein C activity in healthy adults is between 65 to 135 IU dL-1. Patients with mild protein C deficiency have activity levels between 20 IU dL-1 and the lower limit of normal values, as determined by age. Moderately severe protein C deficiency is activity levels between 1â€“20 IU dL-1 and severe deficiency for activity demonstrates levels less than 1 IU dL-1. The relative level of protein C activity may also be expressed as functional percentages.
