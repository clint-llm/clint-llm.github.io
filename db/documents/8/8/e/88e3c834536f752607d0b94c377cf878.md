Spinal dysraphism is a congenital abnormality that results in an abnormal structure in the spine, including the bony structure, the spinal cord, and the nerve roots. Myelomeningocele is a spinal dysraphism in which the spinal cord and its contents herniate through a congenital bony defect in the posterior elements. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of spinal dysraphism and myelomeningocele and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of spinal dysraphism medical conditions and emergencies.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of spinal dysraphism and myelomeningocele.
- Outline the management options available for spinal dysraphism and myelomeningocele.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in patients with spinal dysraphism and myelomeningocele to improve outcomes.
