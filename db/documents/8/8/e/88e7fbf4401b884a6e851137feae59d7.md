Discussing driving safety at every visit is of the utmost importance given the significantly increased risk of motor vehicle accidents for patients with narcolepsy. Maintaining vigilance during monotonous tasks can be particularly challenging to these patients, making long highway drives or long commutes in heavy traffic potentially problematic. Establishing driving recommendations related to reported symptoms may be one approach (e.g., no nighttime driving, driving for <30 minutes at a time, planned naps before or during specific drives, etc.).

If there are continued concerns about refractory sleepiness or there has been an accident related to sleepiness, a Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) can be used to evaluate a patient’s ability to stay awake during mundane circumstances. The test consists of four to five 40-minute testing periods during which they will be asked to take their medications, as usual, sit still in a quiet room, and remain awake. The results can help to guide medication changes and driving recommendations.

Additionally, patients should:

- Avoid medications that can increase drowsiness (narcotics, allergy medications, etc.), heavy meals, and alcohol intake

- Keep a regular, nocturnal sleep schedule

- Consider brief planned naps throughout the day (e.g., 15 minutes at noon, 15 minutes at 1700 before driving home from work)

- Maintain medication compliance

- Follow up regularly to ensure symptoms are adequately controlled
