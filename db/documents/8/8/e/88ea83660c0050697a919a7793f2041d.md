When treating patients suspected of having malaria, it is important that treatment does not start until there is a definitive diagnosis of malaria. To guide malaria treatment appropriately, it is important to identify three factors: (1) the infecting Plasmodium species, (2) the clinical status of the patient, and (3) the drug susceptibility of the infecting parasites (the geographic area from where the infection was acquired from and any previous antimalarial medications). The obvious exception is in waiting for confirmation to treat suspected malaria if the patient shows signs of severe malaria, and clinical suspicion for malaria is high.

By identifying the infecting Plasmodium species, the healthcare practitioner can identify which infections will progress to severe manifestations and which will not. Also, some infections can remain dormant in the liver as hypnozoites and can lead to a relapse. The clinical status of a patient can fall into two main categories: uncomplicated malaria or severe malaria. The main difference in treatment is that uncomplicated malaria is treated with oral antimalarials, while severe malaria gets treated with parenteral antimalarials. Last, healthcare practitioners can select an appropriate treatment course by determining the drug susceptibility of the infecting Plasmodium species. Practitioners can do this by looking at where the patient was when they acquired the infection and if they have received any previous treatment with antimalarials.
