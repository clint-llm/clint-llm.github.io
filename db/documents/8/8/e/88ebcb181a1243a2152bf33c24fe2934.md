Clinical presentation varies widely based on the mechanism of injury. Because the diaphragm is integral to normal respiration, patients with diaphragmatic injury may present in respiratory distress. Most often, blunt diaphragmatic injuries are discovered during the evaluation and management of the associated injuries. A physical exam should focus on the airway, breathing, and circulation, with inspection for signs of mediastinal shift or lung displacement.  When herniation of abdominal contents occurs, bowel sounds may be auscultated in the chest. Any patient with penetrating trauma in the zone of concern (described above) should be assessed for diaphragmatic injury. Less than half of diaphragmatic injuries are diagnosed preoperatively, and a high index of suspicion based on the mechanism is required.

The physical exam should concentrate on the ABCDEs with a focus on the neck and chest. Some patients may have tracheal deviation, absent breath sounds, or asymmetrical chest expansion.

In most cases, the diagnosis is not made preoperatively and in 10-50% of patients, the diagnosis may be delayed for days or weeks. When patients present late, they usually have visceral or bowel herniation into the chest cavity. Strangulation, incarceration and even cardiac tamponade have been described in patients with delayed presentation.
