Azithromycin, like other macrolides, is associated with QTc prolongation. Particularly in patients with a known history of QTc interval perturbation, cardiac arrhythmia, or concomitant use of other medications associated with QTc prolongation, azithromycin can result in dangerous or potentially lethal arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. In animal studies, although azithromycin was associated with similar QTc prolongation compared to other macrolides, azithromycin seemed to have a smaller proarrhythmic effect.

While significant hepatoxicity resulting from azithromycin is relatively rare, macrolides are an established cause of mixed hepatocellular/cholestatic drug-induced liver injury. With prompt discontinuation of azithromycin, liver injury is almost always reversible with minimal residual impairment. Often, azithromycin-induced hepatotoxicity has associated immunoallergic features such as rash, fever, and eosinophilia. Severe forms of immunoallergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, SJS, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), are rare.

Gastrointestinal toxicity is common but typically mild, and most patients complete the prescribed course of azithromycin. This toxicity stems largely from azithromycinâ€™s activation of pro-motility receptors in the gastrointestinal tract.
