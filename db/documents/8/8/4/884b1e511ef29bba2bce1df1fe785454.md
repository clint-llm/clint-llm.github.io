Water is known as the "universal solvent," and almost all known life depends on it for survival. Therefore, the principle of osmosis, though seemingly simple, plays a large role in almost all physiological processes. Osmosis is specifically important in maintaining homeostasis, which is the tendency of systems toward a relatively stable dynamic equilibrium. Biological membranes act as semipermeable barriers and allow for the process of osmosis to occur. Osmosis underlies almost all major processes in the body, including digestion, kidney function, nerve conduction, etc. It allows for water and nutrient concentrations to be at equilibrium in all of the cells of the body. It is the underlying physical process that regulates solute concentration in and out of cells, and aids in excreting excess water out of the body.
