Like most benzodiazepines, adverse reactions to lorazepam include CNS and respiratory depression, which are dose-dependent. More severe effects occur with high doses.

Serious adverse effects of lorazepam include:

- Respiratory depression

- Respiratory failure

- Seizures

- Suicidality

- Dependency and abuse

- Tachycardia

- Hypotension

- Syncope

- Blood dyscrasias

- Jaundice

- Paradoxical reaction; hyperactive and aggressive behavior

- Gangrene (intra-arterial)

- Withdrawal symptoms if abruptly discontinued after long-term use.

- Cognitive deficits

- Behavioral changes

- Paradoxical agitation

- Propylene glycol toxicity when using the parenteral formulation in high doses (hyponatremia and metabolic acidosis).

Common adverse effects of lorazepam include:

- Sedation

- Dizziness

- Asthenia

- Ataxia

- Local injection site reaction

- Respiratory depression

- Hypoventilation with IV use

- Hypotension

- Fatigue

- Amnesia

- Confusion

- Disinhibition

- Irritability

- Libido changes

- Menstrual irregularities

- Diplopia

- Dysarthria

- Appetite changes

- Constipation

- Incontinence

- Urinary retention

- Dystonia

- AST and ALT elevation

- In rare instances, lorazepam can cause acute liver injury(cholestatic pattern)

**Drug-Drug Interactions**

- Lorazepam has drug interaction with other drugs, which causes CNS depression. Concomitant use of sedatives, hypnotics, opioids, cough and cold medicines, antiepileptics, muscle relaxers, and alcohol can worsen adverse reactions caused by lorazepam. If a patient starts treatment with UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) inhibitors, then taper off lorazepam to discontinue.

- Metronidazole should not be used with products containing propylene glycol(present in parenteral lorazepam formulation). A disulfiram-like reaction may occur.

- Kratom is a plant with partial opioid agonist effects, and its misuse has become widespread in the US.
