Since this is a poorly studied disorder, the actual prognosis is unknown. Very few cases are self-reported, and the majority of offenders are discovered via legal processes. There is a dearth of large RCTs or long-term outcome-based studies. Since a significant component of treatment is based on self-report and the individualâ€™s desire to seek help, it is safe to assume that motivated individuals with good community support and actively engaged in treatment may have a better prognosis than those who are not.
