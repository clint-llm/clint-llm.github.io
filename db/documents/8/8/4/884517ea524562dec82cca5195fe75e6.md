Morbidity from EBUS itself is very low, and rates are similar to those seen with fibreoptic bronchoscopy. Cough, fever, hemoptysis, bronchospasm, anesthesia-related complications, and pneumonia are the most commonly reported adverse events. EBUS is generally a very safe procedure.

The majority of complications arise from the sampling procedure involved in EBUS-TBNA. Specific complications include bleeding, pneumothorax, bronchial fistula formulation, pericarditis, and mediastinitis.

Data from meta-analyses suggest that complication rates from EBUS-TBNA are lower when compared to transbronchial biopsy. Overall, a complication rate of around <1% for EBUS-TBNA could be expected, and it bears mentioning that even when complications do occur, further interventions are rarely required.

Informed consent for EBUS-TBNA should be obtained from the patient addressing both the common and uncommon complications, and particular mention should be made of the risk of pneumothorax, bleeding, and infection, including mediastinitis, as these rare complications are the most serious adverse events. Most complications will manifest within the first 24 hours post-procedure, and patients should receive counseling regarding symptoms that are suggestive of a complication. Those who develop hypoxia, significant hemoptysis, or persisting fever should be assessed urgently.
