Hemorrhagic fever renal syndrome (HFRS) is an acute zoonotic disease transmitted through aerosolized excrement of rodents (mice, rats, shrews, and voles). The infection is caused by various species of viruses under the hantavirus genera which use rodents as hosts. The outcome of the disease is usually self-limited and the severity of the disease depends on the viral strain. This activity reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, outcome, and treatment of HFRS. It highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating, preventing, and management of the disease.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the causes of hemorrhagic fever renal syndrome.
- Identify the signs and symptoms of hemorrhagic fever syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment of hemorrhagic fever syndrome.
