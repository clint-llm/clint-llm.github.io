Traumatic fibromas have an excellent prognosis, as they are a reactive overgrowth of normal tissues. With appropriate surgical excision and removal of any source of local irritation, their recurrence rate is low.

TUGSE has a good prognosis, as the lesion itself is self-limiting and aggressive treatment typically is not indicated.

Inflammatory papillary hyperplasia has a good prognosis. Discontinuing the use of ill-fitting dentures and allowing the tissue an appropriate time to heal has shown to resolve the condition.

Thermal injuries have a great prognosis, as the oral mucosa is resilient and will heal on its own, granted no additional thermal challenge is introduced.

Aspirin-induced oral lesions have a great prognosis, as the oral mucosa will heal with removing the aspirin from the tissue. However, recurrence is dependent on the patient discontinuing this habit.
