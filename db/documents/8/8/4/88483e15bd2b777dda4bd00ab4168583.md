Dental caries is a common chronic infectious resulting from tooth-adherent cariogenic bacteria, primarily Streptococcus Mutans, which metabolize sugars to produce acid, demineralizing the tooth structure over time. This activity describes the evaluation and management of dental caries and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with dental caries.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of dental caries.
- Summarize the pathophysiology of dental caries, highlighting the currently accepted theory.
- Describe dental caries' clinical findings.
- Explain the treatment considerations for patients with dental caries.
