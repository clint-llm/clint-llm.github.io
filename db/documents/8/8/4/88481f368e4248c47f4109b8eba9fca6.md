Surgical resection is considered the standard of care for early-stage lung cancers in all medically fit patients.

More limited resections consisting of segmentectomy or wedge resection for T1N0 NSCLC result in higher rates of local recurrence (6% vs. 18%) as well as higher rates of death compared to a lobectomy but with better pulmonary function.

A Pneumonectomy, which consists of total lung removal, may be necessary but only after less radical interventions have been considered. They are usually indicated when the tumor is centrally located, involving a mainstem bronchus, or crosses major fissure lines. Pneumonectomies can have higher mortality rates and a substantial reduction in pulmonary reserve.

Regardless of the resection type, the representative N1 and ipsilateral N2 nodal stations should be evaluated. A minimum of 3 N2 nodal stations should be sampled.

Pre-operative assessment is critical in identifying suitable candidates for surgery. A patient's history of cardiac disease, prior lung resections, COPD, bronchiectasis, chronic pulmonary infections such as tuberculosis, interstitial lung diseases, pulmonary hypertension, etc., can all affect the patient's ability to tolerate surgery. It is essential to determine a patient's pulmonary reserve and predict their postoperative lung capacity. The consequences of not taking this into account are severe disability and death. A simple and important first step in pre-op assessment is the CT scan of the chest, which the patient would have already received. This can be used to count the number of lung segments, determine the extent of surgery required (i.e., lobectomy vs. pneumonectomy), and predict postoperative lung volumes.

Quantitative pulmonary function testing with spirometry and diffusion capacity is an essential part of determining a patient's eligibility for surgery. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is considered the most important predictors of post-op complications. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) endorses the use of these metrics and provides a useful algorithm to aid in determining the need for further testing. If a patient's FEV1 and DLCO ≥ 80%, no further testing is required; if DLCO or FEV1 falls below 80%, then predicted postoperative (PPO) lung function testing should be performed.

Predicted postoperative values are determined by the pre-op values, the amount of lung to be resected, and its overall contribution to lung function. This is accomplished with either segment counting on CT chest (preferred in lobectomy) or lung scintigraphy (preferred in pneumonectomy).

Arterial blood gases are not helpful in predicting postoperative lung function or the risk of postoperative complications,

Mortality for lobectomies ranges from 1.4 to 2.6%.
