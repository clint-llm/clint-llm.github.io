Myelin can be seen on transmission electron microscopy typically as a thick dark outline surrounding myelinated nerve fibers. In research, the use of three-dimensional electron microscopy can be used to view various injuries and disease processes related to the myelin sheath. This technique is typically not used clinically but has prospects to be advantageous to further the understanding of various pathophysiologic processes.
