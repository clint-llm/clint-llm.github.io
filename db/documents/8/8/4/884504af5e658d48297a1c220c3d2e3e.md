The immune system is the body’s defense mechanism against infections and is made of two pathways - the innate pathway and the adaptive pathway.

Complement deficiencies are primary immunodeficiencies that cause various clinical scenarios depending on the specific complement protein that is deficient. This can include an increased risk of a wide range of infectious as well as local or systemic inflammatory and thrombotic conditions.

Additionally, the complement system does not only act as the defense mechanism against infections it also works as a mediator in both the prevention of immune complex-related diseases and pathogenesis, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
