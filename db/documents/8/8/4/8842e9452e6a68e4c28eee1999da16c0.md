A detailed history needs to be obtained, including any recent exposure to fresh water. While most leech bites are external, leeches can attach internally, and patients will present with epistaxis, hematemesis, hemoptysis, vaginal bleeding, hemoptysis, otorrhagia, and rectal bleeding. When the leech bite is external, patients' symptoms may include painless bleeding, bruising, itching, burning, irritation, and redness. Patients may present with recurrent epistaxis if they have a nasal leech infestation.

A focused physical exam will be required depending on the area of concern. If there is a concern for a nasal leech infestation, examination with anterior rhinoscope is not sufficient, and inspection with an endoscope is usually necessary. When there is the concern for vaginal leech infestation, a speculum exam is required. Depending on the age of the patient, this may need to be done under anesthesia. A rectal exam with a proctoscope may be indicated for a patient presenting with rectal bleeding in the setting of concern for a leech bite.
