Psoas syndrome results from dysfunction of the iliopsoas muscle and causes a constellation of symptoms, including low back pain, groin pain, pelvic pain, or buttock pain. The primary action of the iliopsoas muscle is hip flexion. Therefore, back pain may occur with standing, walking, or changing position from sitting to standing.

Psoas syndrome is commonly seen in athletes, especially jumpers, dancers, and runners, and is among the most common causes of groin pain in this group.

This procedure review focuses on the use of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) to treat iliopsoas dysfunction. The two specific osteopathic manipulative treatment modalities for the iliopsoas that will be discussed are muscle energy treatment (MET) and counterstrain (CS).

MET is a direct technique where the muscle or joint is taken into a restrictive barrier and asked to provide an isometric muscle contraction against the provider.

CS is an indirect technique where a tenderpoint is localized and moved into a position of ease for 90 seconds while monitoring for the reduction of pain and change in the texture of the tenderpoint. The muscle or joint returns to a neutral position, and the tenderpoint is released, resulting in a decrease in hypersensitivity and proprioceptive activity.
