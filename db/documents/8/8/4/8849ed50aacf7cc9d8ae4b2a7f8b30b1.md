The etiology of recurrent posterior instability is multifactorial and complex. However, three broad processes have been implicated in the pathogenesis, including repetitive microtrauma, acute traumatic events, and atraumatic causes.

Repetitive microtrauma to the posteroinferior capsulolabral shoulder complex is the most common cause of recurrent posterior subluxation.

Acute trauma to the shoulder may lead to recurrent posterior instability. Patients will often recall the incident prior to the onset of symptoms. These patients sustain a high impact injury to the anterior shoulder or an axial load with the shoulder in the position of flexion and internal rotation. Such injuries canÂ be seen in American football linemen.

Patients may also report posterior instability with no history of trauma. This atraumatic presentation is the least common and is usually attributed to ligamentous laxity.
