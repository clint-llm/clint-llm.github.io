The initial management includes supportive measures such as IV fluids and even nasogastric tubes given that patients with catatonia are susceptible to malnutrition, dehydration, pneumonia, etc. The key is early identification of catatonia in a patient with schizophrenia and initiation of treatment.

If a patient is on anti-psychotic medication, this should be stopped immediately, as this may contribute to catatonia in schizophrenia.

The treatment of catatonia in schizophrenia is with benzodiazepines as the first line of treatment and then electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The Bush-Francis group has conducted a study where they have shown a reduction in the BCFRS by 60% by administrating 2 mg of lorazepam in 10 minutes.

In a study of 107 people, it has been seen that two-thirds of patients studied responded adequately to the use of lorazepam. Only one-third were in remission.

ECT is to be used for patients that have failed an adequate trial of benzodiazepines. ECT is also used for rapid and malignant catatonia with autonomic dysfunction. Specifically, in catatonic schizophrenia, ECT is the treatment of choice. There have been large-scale trials conducted for patientsÂ with schizophrenia with intractable catatonia.

Other agents such as zolpidem have been studied for schizophrenia but not for catatonic schizophrenia. However, anti-NMDA agents like amantadine and memantine have been studied in single cases of catatonic schizophrenia and have shown some efficacy.

Lithium has also been studied but has not been studied exclusively for catatonic schizophrenia. Rather its efficacy is seen in cases of recurrent catatonia mostly associated with mood disorders.
