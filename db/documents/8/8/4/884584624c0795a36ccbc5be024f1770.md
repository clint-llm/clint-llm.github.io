It is important to exclude secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia such as hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, and liver disease by history and laboratory testing. Diagnosis of FH in most cases is:

- **Clinical**, by a personal history of early CAD, family history of premature CAD (definite MI or sudden death, at an age younger than 55 in male first-degree relative or younger than 65 in a first-degree female relative)

- **Physical exam findings**(tendon xanthomas and premature corneal arcus)

- **Elevated lipid levels**(LDL-C greater than 190 mg/dL)

In the past, the diagnosis was usually made at the time of an acute MI in a young person. However, it is now most commonly found by routine lab testing that reveals elevated LDL-C, which leads to clinical suspicion. Triglyceride levels are characteristically normal, and HDL levels might be low. It is important to emphasize that any LDL-C level greater than 190 mg/dL should trigger an investigation for HeFH or HoFH.

The diagnosis of FH in most cases is made phenotypically. Available clinical tools to make the diagnosis of FH are the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria, Simon Broome criteria (Table 1), Make Early Diagnosis to Prevent Early Deaths (MED-PED) criteria, and Japanese FH criteria.

Detection of index cases could be done by targeted screening of individuals with premature CVD, opportunistic screening in primary care based on age and gender-specific plasma LDL-C levels, or universal screening based on age and gender-specific plasma LDL-C levels before the age of 20 years and ideally before puberty. Children with xanthomata or other physical findings of FH or suspected to have HoFH by family history should be screened at 2 years of age. Children suspected to have HeFH should be screened between the ages of 5 and 10 years. It is recommended that two fasting LDL cholesterol values are obtained in children and adolescents. A high probability of FH is indicated by LDL of greater than or equal to 155 mg/dL or greater than or equal to 135 mg/dL with a parental history of hypercholesterolemia or premature CHD.

Testing should not be done during acute illness because it can lower LDL-C levels leading to false-negative testing. If already on statin therapy, it is important to look at pre-treatment values of LDL-C. If not available, the LDL-C level should be estimated based on the dose of the specific statin.

Cardiovascular risk assessment tools such Framingham risk score should not be used as FH is a lifetime coronary risk equivalent.

In asymptomatic patients with FH, cardiac CT and carotid ultrasound may be useful for stratifying risk and needs further studies.

Criteria for the clinical diagnosis of homozygous FH include:

Untreated LDL-C >500 mg/dL (>13 mmol/L) or treated LDL-C ≥300 mg/dL (>8 mmol/L),  **AND**

- Cutaneous or tendon xanthoma before ten years of age,**OR**

- Elevated LDL-C levels consistent with heterozygous FH in both the parents

It is important to note, however, that untreated LDL-C levels <500 do not exclude homozygous FH, particularly in young children.
