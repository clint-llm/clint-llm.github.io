Many of the complications arising from neuroacanthocytosis syndromes derive from neuromuscular deficits or neurocognitive decline (see Table 3). Neuromuscular symptoms such as chorea, ataxia, myopathy, dystonia, loss of dorsal column, or spinocerebellar spinal tracts can result in gait disturbances and inability to participate in ADLs. Additional progressive cognitive deficits or personality changes (including increased impulsivity, aggression, or psychiatric symptoms) can further complicate care for patients diagnosed with a neuroacanthocytosis syndrome. Several complications can be life-threatening, including seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, status dystonicus, and psychiatric comorbidities such as suicidality.

Ophthalmological complications such as retinal degeneration and retinopathy are commonly described in cases of PKAN, ABL, HHBL, and aceruloplasminemia. In the case of several metabolically driven diseases such as ABL, HHBL, and aceruloplasminemia, multiple organ systems can be involved resulting in anemia, diabetes mellitus, cardiomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly, and hypothyroidism.
