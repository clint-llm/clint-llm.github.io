When the entire lobe of the lung is excised, it is known as lobectomy, and removal of just a segment is a segmentectomy. A lobectomy may be necessary when the pathology is only in one lobe and to prevent the spread of a disease, such as in tuberculosis, lung abscess, emphysema, benign tumor, or lung cancer. A segmentectomy is done for benign lesions to preserve the lung, or in bronchiectasis, early-stage I cancer, lung nodules, or tuberculosis.

Saddle pulmonary embolism is an obstruction of the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk. It is a surgical emergency and requires embolectomy.
