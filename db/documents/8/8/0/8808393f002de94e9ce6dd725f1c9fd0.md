Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is an uncommon but aggressive subtype of diffuse, large, B-cell lymphoma. The diagnosis of PBL is difficult because its features overlap with myeloma and lymphoma. The primary organs involved are usually the gastrointestinal system, lymph nodes, oral mucosa, and sometimes the skin. It has a very aggressive disease course comprising relapses and refractoriness to chemotherapy. PBL is a very rare diagnosis, and hence there is no established standard to treat PBL.
