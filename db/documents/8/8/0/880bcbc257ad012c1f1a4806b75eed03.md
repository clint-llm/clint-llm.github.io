Patients frequently present to the emergency department with a variety of external ear complaints ranging from traumatic injuries (lacerations and avulsions) to auricular collections that require drainage (hematomas and abscesses) and embedded foreign bodies (earrings and earring backings). Typically, oral and parenteral medications do not provide adequate pain relief, and procedural sedation has a sizeable risk burden, particularly for pediatric patients. Injections directly into the external ear are painful and have a high risk of provider needlestick. On the other hand, a peripheral nerve block is typically a well-tolerated method to achieve analgesia for a procedure. This activity reviews how to perform an ear block, its indications and contraindications, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the nerves involved with ear innervation.
- Describe the technique of performing an ear nerve block.
- Summarize the complications of an ear nerve block.
- Review how an interprofessional team approach can help manage ear problems with a nerve block and improve outcomes.
