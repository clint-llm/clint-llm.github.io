Penile erection or tumescence refers to the physiologic process during which the penis becomes engorged with blood, usually in response to sexual arousal but sometimes spontaneously.Â Comprehension of penile anatomy, neuro-vasculature, and the associated hormonal and molecular factors is required to understand the physiology of tumescence. Understanding the physiology of erections is important for clinicians and fertility experts to help aid patients in the therapy of erectile dysfunction. Knowledge of physiology helps derive medical intervention; thus, it is an important topic for the basis of erectile dysfunction treatment. This article will review the associated anatomy, vascular, neurologic, hormonal, and molecular factors behind the physiology of an erection.
