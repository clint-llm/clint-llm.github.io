Emphysema, as a part of COPD, is an illness that affects a large number of people worldwide. In 2016, the Global Burden of Disease Study reported a prevalence of 251 million cases of COPD globally.Â Around 90% of COPD deaths occur in low and middle-income countries.

The prevalence of emphysema in the United States is approximately 14 million, which includes 14% white male smokers and 3% white male nonsmokers. The prevalence is slightly less for white female smokers and African Americans. These patient groups tend to develop emphysema after less exposure time than other patient populations.

It is slowly increasing in incidence primarily due to the increase in cigarette smoking and environmental pollution. Another contributing factor is decreasing mortality from other causes, such as cardiovascular and infectious diseases. Genetic factors also play a significant role in determining the possibility of airflow limitation in patients.

Emphysema severity is significantly higher in coal worker pneumoconiosis, and this is independent of smoking status.
