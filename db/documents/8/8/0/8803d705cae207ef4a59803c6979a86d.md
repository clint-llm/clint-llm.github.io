Mucin-producing cystic epithelial neoplasms with septations characterize mCNs. Fluid in the cyst, when aspirated, is usually thick and viscous. The cysts are lined by columnar epithelium, which may occur in a single layer, with some areas showing papillary projections or invaginations. The presence of ovarian stroma is the pathognomonic finding in an MCN.  FNA cytology shows characteristic honeycomb sheets, with mucin-producing columnar cells in clusters and rich in mucin. MCNs do not communicate with the pancreatic ductal system, which is the fundamental differentiating character from IPMNs.
