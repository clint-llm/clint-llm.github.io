The pulmonary valve attaches to infundibulum basally, and the muscle of the subpulmonary infundibulum raises this valve above the ventricular septum; so it is positioned superiorly and becomes the most superior of the cardiac valves. This anatomical configuration enables the surgeon to resect the pulmonary valve and its basal attachment within the infundibulum from the rest of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) safely.
