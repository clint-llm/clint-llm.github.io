Besides the physical issues that could affect condom usage, there are also other barriers such as decreased sensation during intercourse or disruption of foreplay.

When the female partner is taking oral contraceptives, this can give the facade that one does not need to wear a condom. Although this may aid in the contraceptive role, oral contraceptives do not protect against STDs.

There is also the myth that condom promotion will, in fact, increase amounts of risky sexual behavior. Condom education/promotion has not been shown to have any change in the amount of sexual intercourse among teenagers but has been shown to decrease the incidence of STDs among study groups.

Although one would believe that wearing more than one condom may increase contraceptive barrier properties (“double bagging”), this has not been shown to be true. In fact, wearing more than one condom may increase friction between condoms which could increase the risk of the condom tearing.

Pregnant females are advised not to have sex or use condoms for at least six months from when their male partner has shown symptoms of Zika infection or returned from an area where there is known Zika infection. Women who have symptoms indicating Zika infection or who have returned from a Zika infection area are advised to use condoms for 8 weeks from the start of their symptoms or when they returned from the Zika infected area.
