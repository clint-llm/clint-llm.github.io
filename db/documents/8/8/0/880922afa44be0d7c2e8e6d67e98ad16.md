Ankle sprains most commonly involve injury to the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) and/or the calcaneofibular ligament (CFL).   Ankle sprains vary depending on the mechanism of injury (high- versus low-energy injuries), position of the foot, and rotational force on the joint and stabilizing ligamentous structures.  Low grade injuries (grade I and II) result in stretching or microscopic tears of the stabilizing ligaments, while a high grade (grade III) ankle sprain compromises the syndesmotic structures
