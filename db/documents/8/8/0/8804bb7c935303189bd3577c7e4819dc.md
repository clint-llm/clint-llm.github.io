Chest x-ray usually reveals a single pacemaker lead stationed in RV.

ECG reveals pacing spikes with adequate capture but no relation/synchrony between P waves and QRS complexes.

Laboratory studies are usually not required; however, cardiac troponins and an echocardiogram may reveal new wall motion abnormalities or a decline in EF suggesting cardiomyopathy. Clinicians best reach diagnosis when they correlate patients' symptoms with the cardiac rhythm. Historically, a drop in systolic blood pressures during episodes of ventricular pacing has been used as a perimeter to diagnose this entity, but this is not always the case and may not be practical.

Diagnosis is clinical and often one of exclusion. This may include the use of a Holter monitor or event recorder to look for arrhythmias. Often, device interrogation reveals pacemaker dependancy which also gives a clue to the presence of this entity.
