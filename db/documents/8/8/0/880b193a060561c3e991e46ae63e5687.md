Currently, the Tullio phenomenon is most commonly associated with superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD). Table 1 lists several conditions linked with the phenomenon. Superior semicircular canal dehiscence was first described in 1998 and is a disease characterized by sound-induced vertigo and eye movements, chronic dysequilibrium, conductive hearing loss (CHL), and decreased hearing thresholds for bone-conducted sounds. Conductive hyperacusis may lead to autophony (hearing one’s own voice), pulsatile tinnitus, or hearing one’s eye movements.

Table 1: Conditions linked to the Tullio phenomenon include:

- Superior semicircular canal dehiscence

- Otosclerosis

- Congenital syphilis

- Ménière’s disease

- Perilymph fistula

- Cholesteatoma with semicircular canal erosion & fenestration

- Head trauma

- Normal individuals

- Post stapedectomy

- Post tympanomastoidectomy

- Collapsed canal syndrome

- Congenital deafness

- Seronegative Lyme Borreliosis

- Middle ear osteoma
