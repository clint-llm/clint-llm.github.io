Performing a detailed abdominal examination should be perfected by all students during medical or nursing school since it is a vital skill for all interprofessional healthcare team members. All healthcare workers should be well aware of the methods to perform an abdominal exam, the significance of any finding that is observed, and be able to correlate the patient’s chief complaint, history, general physical appearance, and examination findings of the other systems with the findings observed in the abdominal examination. The findings observed should be documented and can be used to decide the patient’s diagnostic strategy and management plan. The physicians, nurses, and interns dealing directly with the patients should have a strong consensus regarding the patient’s condition and effective interprofessional communication with the other sub-specialists dealing with the case. This is necessary to enhance patient-centered care and improve patient outcomes.
