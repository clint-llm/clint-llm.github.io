Obesity is a complex and multifactorial neurobehavioral condition where eating behavior is affected by many things, including an imbalance between strong physiologic forces that resist weight loss and weak forces that resist weight gain. Eating behavior is also influenced by the environment, five senses, stress, emotions, habitual time cues, reward, sleep, eating disorders, and information gap.

Some standard behavioral approaches to obesity treatment include the following:

- Motivational interviewing (MI)

- Behavioral therapy (BT)

- Cognitive therapy (CT)

- Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)

- Interpersonal therapy (IT)

- Acceptance-based therapy (ABT)

Eliciting behavioral change is a significant challenge to clinicians in managing obesity, especially with limited time in an office or clinic setting. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a collection of behavioral tools that have been proven to evoke change in patients who are ambivalent, reluctant, and otherwise not motivated to change.
