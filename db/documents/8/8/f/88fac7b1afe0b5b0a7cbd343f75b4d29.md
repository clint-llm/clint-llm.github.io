Phocomelia is a rare congenital anomaly where the proximal aspect of an extremity is absent with the hand or foot attached directly to the trunk. This disorder was brought into prominence as a characteristic side effect of the drug thalidomide but can occur spontaneously. This activity seeks to summarize the topic of phocomelia and examine the etiology and epidemiology of this disorder. Furthermore, we seek to review the role of the interdisciplinary health team in optimizing the management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the possible etiologies of phocomelia.
- Outline the appropriate steps for the evaluation of phocomelia.
- Review the management options available for phocomelia.
- Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance phocomelia and improve outcomes.
