tPA is a thrombolytic (i.e., it breaks up blood clots) formed by aggregation of activated platelets into fibrin meshes by activating plasminogen. More specifically, it cleaves the zymogen plasminogen at its Arg561-Val562 peptide bond to form plasmin, a serine protease. Plasmin, an endogenous fibrinolytic enzyme, breaks the cross-links between fibrin molecules, which are the structural support of the blood clot, and its activity is extremely short-lived. This short duration is because alpha 2-antiplasmin, an abundant inhibitor of plasmin, quickly inactivates it and restricts the action of plasmin to the vicinity of the clot.

The following sequence summarizes the action of tPA:

- tPA attaches to the fibrin on the clot surface.

- It activates the fibrin-bound plasminogen.

- Plasmin is subsequently cleaved from the plasminogen affiliated with the fibrin.

- The plasmin breaks up the molecules of fibrin, and the clot dissolves.

Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI 1) eventually terminates the catalytic activity of tPA by binding to it, and this inactive complex (PAI 1-bound tPA) is removed from the circulation by the liver via the scavenger receptor, LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRRP1). In the nervous system, a neuronal-specific inhibitor of tPA, neuroserpin, acts similarly to PAI 1, and the LRRP1 internalizes the inactive tPA-neuroserpin complexes for removal from circulation.
