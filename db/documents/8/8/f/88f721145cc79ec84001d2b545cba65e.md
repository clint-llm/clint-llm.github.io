Controlled studies involving injecting venom from Lonomia species into laboratory rats demonstrate histopathologic changes consistent with ATN.  Specifically, increased acidophilia, dilation of renal tubules, loss of proximal brush border, cytoplasm vacuolation, nuclear pyknosis and desquamation of necrotic cells.

Continuing research is currently underway for other caterpillar species and their venom.
