The histopathology of emphysema is intimately related to the integrity of the lung's integral epithelial cell barrier.  After an insult upon this barrier such as by cigarette smoke, the resulting inflammatory response transports antigens to the bronchial associated lymphatic tissue layer. There, the macrophages and neutrophils release enzymes such as elastase which leads to the eventual destruction of the lung's epithelial barrier.

Emphysema is often sub-classified into groups based on the primary location of the emphysematous disease within the lung and acinus (an extensive collection of alveoli that are fed by the terminal bronchioles).  Proximal acinar/centrilobular emphysema refers to the destruction of the central portion of the acinus which has general associations with smoking.  Panacinar emphysema refers to the destruction of all parts of the acinus and is usually related to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Lastly, the distal acinar or paraseptal emphysema involves the alveolar ducts,  which often occurs in combination with the previous two types of bullous emphysema.
