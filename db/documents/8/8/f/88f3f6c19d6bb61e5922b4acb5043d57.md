Patients are sent overnight to the pediatric intensive care unit to closely monitor vital signs and evaluate the necessity of additional blood transfusions. The drain, if placed, is removed the next day. If stable, the patient is sent to the ward for another day. When discharged, the patient is followed at the clinic for wound inspection and suture removal. The head shape is followed at three months, six months, and then annually with photography and anthropometric measurements. The patients are also closely evaluated for behavioral, cognitive, and psychological problems.
