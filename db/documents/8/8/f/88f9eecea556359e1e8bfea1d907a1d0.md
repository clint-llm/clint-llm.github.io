Patients with intermittent exotropia require a detailed evaluation by clinicians, orthoptists, and ophthalmic technicians. The health staff should discuss the underlying possible pathogenesis of the condition and help the parents make a correct choice of management. They should play an active role by ensuring treatment compliance in the form of patching or orthoptics exercises. These patients should be followed up closely by the healthcare team, who would also help in better decision-making when surgical intervention is needed.

The team members should be well versed with post-operative care instructions and the correct administration of eye drops. They should explain to the patient/parents the red-flag symptoms/signs during the follow-up, which should be addressed at the earliest possible opportunity. They should understand their role in the patientâ€™s treatment, evaluation at each visit, discuss the future treatment plan and ensure compliance and regular follow-ups.
