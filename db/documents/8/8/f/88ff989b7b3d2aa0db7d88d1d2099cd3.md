Cholinergic toxicity may occur with pesticides or medications, but most serious exposures are due to organophosphate or carbamate pesticide exposure.

This poisoning kills about 200000 people worldwide, especially in the Asia-Pacific region.

Diagnosis is made by recognition of the cholinergic toxidrome when suspected by the history of illness.

Toxicity may be immediate or delayed.

Treatment is aggressive supportive care, plus targeted therapy for cholinergic toxicity: atropine followed by an available oxime such as pralidoxime.

Decontamination and personal protective equipment must be used to prevent further absorption of the agent by the patient and harm to caregivers.

Toxicology or poison center consultation is recommended.
