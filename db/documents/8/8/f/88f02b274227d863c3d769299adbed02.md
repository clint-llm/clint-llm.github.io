Nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography are required to locate the site of nerve impingement and rule out a more generalized or systemic disorder. Nerve conduction studies reveal axonal damage of the radial nerve. Plain x-rays can look for the presence of a fracture or bone spurs. MRI may also be used to search for nerve compression or damage in the brachial plexus area. Finally, high-resolution ultrasound is a valuable tool to detect lesions of peripheral nerves that can be particularly useful to determine the nature of an injury, such as enlargement, constriction, torsion, or fascicular entwinement, which can be important when planning the surgical intervention.
