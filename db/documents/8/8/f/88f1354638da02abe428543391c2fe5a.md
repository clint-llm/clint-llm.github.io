Also known as nervus incisivus, the nasopalatine nerve is a division of the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve. Its function is to provide sensation to the anterior palate. The sphenopalatine artery supplies the same area it innervates. The pathological development of a cyst in the incisive canal can cause impingement of the nasopalatine nerve and limit its function. Clinically, injecting local anesthesia or performing nasopalatine nerve block facilitates procedures of the palate/maxilla.
