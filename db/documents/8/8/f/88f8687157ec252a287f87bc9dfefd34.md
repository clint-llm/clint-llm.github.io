Embryologically, the colon develops from the midgut (cecum to the distal transverse colon), the hindgut (distal transverse colon to the dentate line in the anorectum), and the proctodeum (below the dentate line). Derivatives of the midgut receive blood supply from the SMA, while the IMA supplies derivatives of the hindgut.
