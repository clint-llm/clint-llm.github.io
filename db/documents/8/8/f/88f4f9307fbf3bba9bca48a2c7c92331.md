There is no doubt that mechanical ventilation is a life-saving procedure that has impacted millions of lives of patients with respiratory failure around the world. It is also beneficially used in patients with chronic irreversible causes of respiratory failure like neuromuscular disease or spinal cord injuries, permitting them to live a life that would not have been possible before the creation of the mechanical ventilator.

Mechanical ventilation requires the simultaneous skills of many in the interprofessional healthcare team. The respiratory therapist is the guide on how to resolve acute issues with the ventilator. Nurses are usually the first in identifying set issues, and understanding the physiology and management of mechanical ventilation is crucial for clinicians managing patients in the ICU. These caregivers must alert the clinician managing the case immediately if there are any issues with ventilator use. This type of interprofessional collaboration will lead to improved results in managing patients on ventilators. [Level 5]
