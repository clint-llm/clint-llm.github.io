People with eczema have a dysfunctional barrier which causes various problems. The cells that make up our skin are essential for optimal skin hydration. People with eczema tend to have dry skin due to the dysfunction in the skin barrier. Water can more easily escape from the skin leading to dehydrated skin. People with eczema are also more susceptible to infection. Harmful substances can more readily penetrate the skin due to the dysfunction. People with atopic dermatitis tend to have a skewed inflammatory immune response, and their skin is easily irritated by fragrancesÂ and allergens.
