Androgen insensitivity syndrome is the result of profound resistance of the androgen receptor towards the action of androgen. Various studies done in women established the androgen receptor (AR) dysfunction with no detectable androgen receptor binding, leading to resistance to the virilization effect of the exogenous androgen. The androgen receptor nuclear receptor contains a hormone-binding domain and an N-terminal region used for transactivation, and most mutations cause androgen receptor dysfunction to localize specifically in the hormone-binding domain.
