Ossiculoplasty is the surgical restoration of the sound transmitting mechanism of the middle ear. A myriad of prosthetics and surgical techniques have been described over the last half-century, with no overall consensus on the ideal method of treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of conductive hearing loss secondary to ossicular disruption and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of ossiculoplasty.
- Describe the technique of ossiculoplasty.
- Outline the evaluation of patient undergoing ossiculoplasty.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance ossiculoplasty and improve outcomes.
