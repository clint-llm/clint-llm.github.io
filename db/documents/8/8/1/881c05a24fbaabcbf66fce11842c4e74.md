Coronary artery disease is a multifaceted health problem. It comprises of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, physical and emotional imbalances, and private and social relationships. Therefore, it needs an interprofessional approach, mainly an efficacious interprofessional team. Prevention of cardiovascular diseases might provide a general framework for improving follow-up for patients with chronic diseases by targeting many domains for quality improvement: e.g., self-management support, decision support, clinical information systems, community resources and policies, and organization of health care. Interactive approaches have to be used to engage clinicians in simultaneously developing and implementing the interventions.

The optimal approach to managing coronary artery disease utilizes an interprofessional healthcare team approach. Doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, dietitians, physical trainers, psychologists, patients, and family members should all have involvement.
