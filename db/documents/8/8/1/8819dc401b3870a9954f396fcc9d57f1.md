Calcium is the fifth most common element in the body and the most prevalent cation. An average human body (70 kg) contains about 1 kg, or approximately 25 mol, of calcium.

About 50% of the calcium present in circulation is free (also known as ionized calcium); 40% of serum calcium is bound to proteins, especially albumin (80%) and, secondary, to globulins (20%); and about 10% exists as various small diffusible inorganic and organic anions (e.g., bicarbonate, lactate, citrate). The free calcium fraction is the biologically active form.

Physiologically, calcium may be classified as intracellular or extracellular. Intracellular calcium has key roles in many important physiologic functions, including muscle contraction, hormone secretion, glycogen metabolism, and cell division. The intracellular concentration of calcium in the cytosol of unstimulated cells is around 0.1 μmol/L, which is less than 1/20,000 of that in extracellular fluid.
