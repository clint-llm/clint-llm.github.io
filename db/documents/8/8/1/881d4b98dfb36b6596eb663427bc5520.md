It is necessary to prevent spontaneous muscular contraction and movement when performing surgical procedures. The introduction of muscle relaxants has revolutionized the practice of anesthesia. By the end of the 1950s, non-depolarizing, neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs), d-tubocurarine, and gallamine were available.

Non-depolarizing NMBDs work by competing with acetylcholine (Ach) for binding sites on nicotinic alpha subunits, blocking Ach from binding to the receptor. In some instances, they can also cause direct blocking of the inotropic activity of Ach receptors.
