Saturday night palsy refers to a compressive neuropathy of the radial nerve that occurs from prolonged, direct pressure onto the upper medial arm or axilla by an object or surface. The radial nerve is composed of the C5 to T1 nerve roots, which arise from the posterior segment of the brachial nerve plexus. It initially runs deep to the axillary artery, before passing inferior to the teres minor and then wrapping down the medial aspect of the humerus, where it lies in the spiral groove. Compression of the radial nerve leads to a nerve palsy causing motor and sensory deficit. This activity covers the etiology, anatomical definition, and clinical presentation of Saturday night palsy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in diagnosing and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify common causative injuries that can lead to Saturday night palsy.
- Describe the clinical presentation and physical exam findings associated with Saturday night palsy.
- Outline the appropriate management and expected time frame of recovery for patients with Saturday night palsy. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes for patients affected by Saturday night palsy.
