Medullary sponge kidney is a benign congenital abnormality that was first described in 1939. Anatomically it is characterized by cystic dilatation of the renal medullary collecting ducts. These numerous small cysts range in diameter from 1 to 8 millimeters and give the kidney, when cut, the appearance of a sponge, thus the name. Medullary sponge kidney is usually bilateral but can affect only one kidney. The condition is bilateral in 70% of cases, and it is a relatively rare disorder with a prevalence of about 1/5000 population. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of medullary sponge kidney and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of medullary sponge kidney.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with medullary sponge kidney.
- Summarize the prognosis of medullary sponge kidney.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by medullary sponge kidney.
