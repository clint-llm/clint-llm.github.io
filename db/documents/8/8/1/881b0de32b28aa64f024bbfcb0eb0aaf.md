# Introduction

Healthcare is a high-stakes industry that is prone to crises; this is especially true for acute care specialties such as anesthesiology and emergency medicine, in which healthcare practitioners must treat critically ill patients while facing diagnostic ambiguity, resource limitations, and numerous disruptions in chaotic work environments. To deliver safe and effective patient care, medical professionals must execute highly coordinated team-based strategies. Crisis resource management (CRM) refers to a set of principles dealing with cognitive and interpersonal behaviors that contribute to optimal team performance.

Crisis resource management has its origins in the aviation industry. In the 1970s, the National Transportation Safety Board found that human error contributed to over 70% of aviation accidents.

In healthcare, anesthesiology was the first specialty to incorporate CRM principles into the training of its clinicians. In the late 1980s, David Gaba and his colleagues recognized that, like aviation, traditional training in anesthesiology focused on the technical aspects of patient management and not on the behavioral aspects of team performance.

Following their success in aviation and anesthesiology, simulation-based CRM training programs were soon developed in other high-risk, high-acuity medical specialties, including emergency medicine,

# Function

Adverse events in healthcare are generally the result of complex combinations of human factors and systems failures.

**Leadership**

Effective teams require effective leadership.

**Communication**

Failures in communication are the leading cause of medical errors.

**Anticipation and planning**

In healthcare, sudden unexpected events can have serious negative consequences for patients and their medical teams. By thinking ahead and anticipating what might happen, teams can plan for changes to the patient or environment. Planning can take place long before an emergency (e.g., developing and practicing a hospital-wide disaster plan),

**Resource utilization**

Resources for the effective management of a medical crisis include personnel, equipment, and cognitive aids.

**Workload distribution**

During medical crises, teams must perform a multitude of tasks almost simultaneously. Individual team members can quickly become overwhelmed if asked to perform too many tasks at once or tasks beyond their skill set. Balancing the workload is important for establishing role clarity, maximizing efficiency, and ensuring the safety of patients and staff.

**Situational awareness**

Situational awareness refers to an individual’s ability to perceive relevant data from their surroundings, process the information and determine its impact on current goals, and utilize this understanding to predict future events.

**Triage and prioritization**

Medical crises often demonstrate a mismatch between the number of tasks that require completion and the resources available to address those tasks. Teams should rapidly determine the criticality of each task and prioritize those that are more important for optimizing patient outcomes.

**Management of disruptions**

Healthcare teams often work in dynamic environments where they encounter frequent disruptions. Some interruptions (e.g., an overhead announcement stating that there is a fire in the vicinity) require immediate attention and resources. In contrast, others serve as distractions that can negatively impact a team’s performance. Teams should quickly and accurately assess the urgency of each disruption to determine if attention to the disruption can be delayed.

# Curriculum Development

Simulation-based training offers a unique opportunity for healthcare teams to practice and assess CRM behaviors while managing realistic clinical scenarios in a controlled setting without posing a threat to the safety of real patients.

When planning a CRM curriculum, it is essential to note that one size does not fit all. Each training program may have different goals for and constraints on implementing a CRM course for its learners. Thus, it is essential first to perform a needs assessment to identify the most critical teamwork competencies for a particular learner group and clinical environment.

After identifying learner needs, instructors should develop a simulation-based curriculum that systematically addresses each of the targeted CRM principles. It may be tempting to create scenarios that incorporate many or all CRM competencies at once, especially if simulation time and resources are limited. However, teamwork training is such a dynamic process that the curriculum will likely have a more significant impact if specific scenarios are dedicated to addressing a defined subset of CRM concepts.

The next step is to define specific and measurable learning objectives for each of the targeted CRM principles.

When crafting a CRM simulation scenario, it is crucial to select an appropriate clinical context for learners to engage in teamwork training.

Structured debriefing is a critical component of simulation-based CRM training.

Several behavioral rating scales have been developed to assess healthcare teams on various CRM competencies. Some of the most well-known rating systems include the Anesthetists’ Non-Technical Skills System,

# Clinical Significance

Today, it is widely recognized that simulation-based CRM training is an essential component of healthcare education. There is abundant evidence from almost every high-acuity medical specialty and healthcare profession supporting the effectiveness of simulation-based CRM training programs in promoting the acquisition of crisis management skills.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

To deliver safe and effective patient care in dynamic work environments, healthcare practitioners must employ highly organized, team-based strategies. Crisis resource management consists of a set of teamwork principles that can be utilized to avert and mitigate medical crises. CRM can be summarized through the following eight teamwork behaviors: leadership, communication, anticipation and planning, resource utilization, workload distribution, situational awareness, triage and prioritization, and management of disruptions. It is clear that simulation-based CRM training improves the cognitive and interpersonal behaviors of medical professionals in simulated settings. There is also a growing body of evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of CRM training programs in enhancing team performance and reducing adverse patient outcomes in the real-life clinical workplace. As such, simulation-based CRM training is an essential component of educational initiatives aimed at improving healthcare delivery and patient safety.
