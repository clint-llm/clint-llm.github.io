Generally, a non-contrast head CT is obtained on presentation.

However, If the non-contrast head CT is indeterminate or if the patient presents outside of the 6-hour window, a lumbar puncture (LP) is indicated.

Regarding laboratory testing, consistently elevated red blood cell counts in all cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tubes may indicate a SAH. The CSF can also be examined for xanthochromia (yellow appearance to the centrifugate fluid) by spectrophotometry or visual examination.

Lastly, cerebral angiography or CT angiography canÂ help to identify an aneurysmal source of the bleeding.

In 1968, Hunt and Hess established a SAH severity scale based on symptoms at presentation.
