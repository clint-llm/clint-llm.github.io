- Kidney failure is a common complication of multiple myeloma. When initially diagnosed, about 20% to 40% of patients with multiple myeloma will have some amount of kidney failure.

- It can affect different parts of the kidney, including the glomerulus, tubules, and interstitium.

- Serum-free light chains (SFLC), serum electrophoresis, urine electrophoresis, and immunofixation should be performed.

- Initial treatment should be focused on assessing the degree of renal impairment, correcting the hemodynamics, volume status, and electrolyte disturbances.

- The most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent is bortezomib, and it has a rapid onset of action.
