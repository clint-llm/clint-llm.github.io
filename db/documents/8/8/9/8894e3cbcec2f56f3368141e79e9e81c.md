Patient education should focus on the avoidance of overcrowding and poor hygiene. Hand-eye contact should be avoided as much as possible, particularly scratching the eye with dirty hands. Regular handwashing should be encouraged. Infected individuals should keep themselves isolated from close family and friends to avoid spread. Once the patient has the diagnosis, they need to understand its nature and mode of propagation along with necessary preventive measures. They should also receive adequate counsel about possible complications due to inadequate treatment compliance.
