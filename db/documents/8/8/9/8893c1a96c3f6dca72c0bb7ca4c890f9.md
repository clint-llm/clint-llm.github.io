There were several areas of concern surrounding the passage of this amendment. At the time, individual physicians were concerned about accusations of assisting suicide if withdrawing IV fluids, feeding tubes, etc. as it was not yet certain how the law would treat any subsequent accusations toward those trying to implement the PSDA into their clinical practice. There was a concern for malpractice liability if difficulty arose in implementing patient wishes for any reason. There was concern about physicians having to adapt their own moral compass; treating patients in a way they might not have before the passage of PSDA. There was concern that other individuals, from family and friends to insurance companies, might get involved and obstruct a physician from implementing a patient's wishes or advanced directives. Over the decades, many of these concerns have been put to rest as the amendment approaches its 30th anniversary. Nevertheless, there are new concerns and complexities which arise with the dynamic status of healthcare delivery.
