Contact dermatitis is an inflammatory eczematous skin disease. It is caused by chemicals or metal ions that exert toxic effects without inducing a T-cell response (contact irritants) or by small reactive chemicals that modify proteins and induce innate and adaptive immune responses (contact allergens). Contact dermatitis is divided into irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis. Irritant contact dermatitis is a nonspecific response of the skin to direct chemical damage that releases mediators of inflammation predominantly from epidermal cells while allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed (type 4) hypersensitivity reaction to exogenous contact antigens. Immunological responses are due to the interaction of cytokines and T cells. In photo contact, allergic dermatitis lesions are confined to sun-exposed areas even though the allergen is in contact with covered areas. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of contact dermatitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the causes of contact dermatitis.
- Review the workup of a patient with contact dermatitis.
- Summarize the treatment options for contact dermatitis.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by contact dermatitis.
