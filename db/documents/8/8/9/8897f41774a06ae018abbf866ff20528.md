Different genetic mutations have been associated with the pathogenesis and tumor progression of various types of NETs. For example, mTOR pathway genes are observed in more aggressive tumors with higher proliferative activity and are found in about 15% of pancreatic NETs. However, they are rarely found in carcinoid tumors.
