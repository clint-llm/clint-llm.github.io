Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter that acts on the central nervous system (CNS), the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ).

- Mad as a hatter (delirium)

- Blind as a bat (ocular symptoms)

- Dry as a bone (anhidrosis/dry mouth/dry skin)

- Hot as a hare (fever)

- Bloated as a toad (constipation)

- The heart runs alone (tachycardia)

- Full as a flask (urinary retention)

- Red as a beet (cutaneous vasodilation)

Clinically the most significant feature is delirium, particularly in the elderly, who are most likely to be affected by the anticholinergic reaction.
