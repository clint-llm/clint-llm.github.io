Advanced trauma life support protocol, including a full trauma evaluation, is required for the assessment of any high energy mechanism injury. The clinical evaluation usually manifests as severe pain about the thigh and knee. Patients typically present with an inability to weight bear on the affected extremity. There may be noticeable deformity about the distal thigh and knee. A thorough evaluation of skin is mandatory to rule out the possibility of an open fracture, which may present in 5 to 10 percent of supracondylar fractures.
