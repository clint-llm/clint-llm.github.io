The pathophysiology of annular pancreasÂ is explained by the direct impact of the migratory defect during embryogenesis. Duodenal obstruction is secondary to a mechanical defect, which can be extrinsic from the encasement of the duodenum or intrinsic from scarring, stenosis, or the presence of duodenal webs. The pathogenesis of pancreatitis in AP is unclear. Pancreatitis, when it occurs, is usually confined to the annulus and the adjoining pancreatic head sparing the body and tail of the gland which is likely secondary to fibrosis resulting in the inability of the pancreatic secretions to pass through the annular duct and increased intrinsic susceptibility of the annular pancreatic tissue to damage.
