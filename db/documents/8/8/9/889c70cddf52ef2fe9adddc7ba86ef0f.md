Nerves of the skin include both somatic and autonomic nerves. The somatic sensory system is responsible for pain (nociceptors), temperature, light touch, discriminative touch, vibration, pressure, and proprioception medicated primarily by specialized cutaneous receptors/end organs including Merkel disks, Pacinian corpuscles, Meissner’s corpuscles, and Ruffini corpuscles. The autonomic innervation is responsible for the control of the tone of the vasculature, pilomotor stimulation at the hair root, and sweating. The **free nerve endings**extend into the epidermis and sense pain, heat, and cold. They are most numerous in the stratum granulosum layer and surround most hair follicles. Merkel disks sense light touch and reach the stratum basale layer. The other nerve endings are found in the deeper portions of the skin and include the Pacinian corpuscle which senses deep pressure, Meissner’s corpuscle which senses low-frequency stimulation at the level of the dermal papillae, and Ruffini corpuscles which sense pressure.
