An osteoid osteoma is a benign bone-forming tumor that has no potential to become malignant. It classically causes severe pain at night and is relieved with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Occasionally, it resolves without treatment. Surgical excision is an option for osteoid osteoma-associated pain that does not respond to conservative management. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of osteoid osteomas of the foot and ankle and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients affected by this disease process.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the pathophysiology of osteoid osteomas.
- Explain the typical exam findings in a patient with an osteoid osteoma.
- Summarize the treatment options for patients with osteoid osteomas.
- Outline a structured interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients with osteoid osteomas.
