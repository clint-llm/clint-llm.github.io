The normal GFR for an adult male is 90 to 120 ml per minute. A GFR of less than 15 ml per minute is considered to be end-stage renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy, e.g., dialysis. The presence of a normal GFR does not exclude the presence of renal disease, which may be evidenced by the presence of albuminuria/proteinuria or imaging.

Reference intervals for serum creatinine and urea are dependent on age and gender.

The presence of electrolytes in urine depends on the hydration status, duration of the collection of urine apart from pathological factors, and reference intervals are often wide and dependant on the clinical context.
