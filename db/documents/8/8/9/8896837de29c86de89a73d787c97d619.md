Asian populations tend toÂ have a lower eyelid crease than Caucasian populations. This is because the orbital septum in Asian eyelids fuses with the levator aponeurosis closer to the eyelid margin; whereas, the orbital septum in Caucasians fuses with the levator aponeurosis closer to the superior border of the tarsal plate.
