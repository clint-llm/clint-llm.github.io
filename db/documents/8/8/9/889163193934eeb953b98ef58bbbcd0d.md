The landmarks of the uterus are the bladder and vaginal stripe. The bladder is located anterior and inferior to the uterus, and the vaginal stripe is a hyperechoic line that is located posterior to the bladder. The vaginal stripe ends at the cervix, and the uterine fundus usually curves up anteriorly (anteverted uterus, approximately 80% of women), but in a smaller subset of females, curves posteriorly (retroverted uterus). The endometrium usually appears as a hyperechoic line in the center of the uterine fundus.

An intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) is confirmed on ultrasound when an intrauterine gestational sac containing a yolk sac and/or a fetal heart rate is visualized with an endomyometrial mantle greater than 7mm. Lack of any of these features would be classified as no definitive intrauterine pregnancy (NDIUP).
