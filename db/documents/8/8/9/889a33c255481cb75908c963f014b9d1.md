Ezetimibe is a dyslipidemic agent used to treat people with hyperlipidemia. It was FDA-approved in 2002. Ezetimibe is the most commonly used nonstatin agent, which lowers LDL-C levels by 13% to 20%.

However, the FDA approved ezetimibe and rosuvastatin's FDC (Fixed-Dose Combination). Combination therapy of ezetimibe plus statin is indicated in patients with primary or mixed lipidemia and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Secondary causes of hyperlipidemia should undergo evaluation before initiating ezetimibe therapy.

Atherosclerosis is one of the major causes of coronary heart disease. Therapeutic lifestyle changes, including weight reduction, increased physical activity, and dietary changes, are first-line management for elevated cholesterol levels.

The American College of Cardiology recommends consideration of ezetimibe therapy in addition to maximally tolerated statin therapy for both primary and secondary prevention in patients who have not achieved target reduction in their LDL levels by maximally tolerated statin therapy alone. Another study found that lipid-lowering treatment in those over age 75 was just as effective in decreasing cardiovascular events as those less than 75 years of age.
