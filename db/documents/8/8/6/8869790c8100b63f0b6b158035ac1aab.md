Type V dislocations were sub-classified according to Pipkin

- I    Fracture below the fovea; not involving weight-bearing surface of the head.

- II   Fracture above the fovea; involving weight-bearing surface of the head.

- III  Type I or II fracture with associated femoral neck fracture.

- IV  Type I or II fracture with associated acetabulum fracture.
