The prognosis for patients presenting with dysphonia is variable and dependent on the underlying condition. Patient prognosis can range from poor to excellent. Patients who have acute laryngitis only requiring symptomatic treatment will usually recover in 1Â to 3 weeks. Meanwhile, patients with muscle tension dysphonia, vocal fold nodules/polyps, or other functional dysphonia may require voice rest and/or several sessions of speech therapy to experience improvement in symptoms.

Patients with early-stage laryngeal cancer have reported 5-year survival rates of up to 95% while those with late-stage laryngeal cancer have 5-year survival rates ranging from 30% to 63% with the most frequent cause of death being due to metastasis. The stark difference in prognosis between early and late-stage laryngeal cancer prognosis demonstrates the significance of identifying laryngeal cancer early.
