Scabies spreads quickly from person to person via regular skin contact or transmission via clothing or bed sheets. Management involves promptly treating infected persons and their close contacts and decontaminating bedding, towels, and clothing.

Isolation becomes crucial in crowded settings like hospitals, to stop the spread of infection. The bedding, towels, and clothing of the infected individual must be machine-washed in hot water (at least 75 degrees Celcius) and dried with hot air. Topical medication may be given to close contacts for prophylactic therapy
