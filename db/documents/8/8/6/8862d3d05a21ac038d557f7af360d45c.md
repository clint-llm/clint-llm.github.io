Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as “Lou Gehrig disease,” is a neurodegenerative disease of the motor neurons. No single etiology has been proven; rather, multiple pathways (both heritable and sporadic) have been shown to result in unmistakably similar disease entities. ALS necessarily affects both upper and lower motor neurons with variable patterns of onset, most commonly beginning with signs of lower motor neuron degeneration within proximal limbs. As it is a progressive disease, it will eventually lead to paralysis and, inevitably, death. There is no cure for ALS; however, multiple medications and interventions can reduce symptoms and prolong life, sometimes up to 10 or more years.
