The IVD is made up of the nucleus pulposus in the center and surrounded by the annulus fibrosis and cartilaginous endplates.

A healthy IVD is poorly innervated and is supplied only by sensory and sympathetic perivascular nerve fibers, which are usually found in the periphery of the annulus fibrosus.

The vertebral body itself has scarce innervation, which is largely found to be perivascular.

With age, the height of the disk may be reduced, and the endplates may become irregular with Modic endplate changes as part of endplate-driven degeneration.
