Identifying the underlying etiology, particularly the presence of paraneoplastic syndrome, is paramountÂ in determining management and treatment outcomes.

In those with proven cancer-associated opsoclonus or OMS, targeted cancer therapy (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation) should be commenced and may be combined with immunotherapy when needed.

Given the underlying immunopathogenesis of opsoclonus, immunosuppression with corticosteroids (oral prednisone or intravenous dexamethasone pulses) or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) have proven to be efficacious and are usually administered in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as the recent evidence demonstrated a higher response rate when IVIG was added to steroid therapy.

In children, treatment for paraneoplastic opsoclonus also commonly involves the use of corticosteroids, ACTH, and IVIG. Low dose cyclophosphamide or rituximab can be considered as an adjunct therapy in cases unresponsive to the above treatment, and plasmapheresis has proven useful in refractory cases.
