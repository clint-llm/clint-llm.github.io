Ependymomas are glial cell tumors that commonly arise in the lining cells of the ventricular system, and less commonly outside the central nervous system (CNS), or within the brain parenchyma. They are comprised of genetically distinct subgroups of tumors and affect children more commonly than adults. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and presentation of ependymoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in their management.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the causes of ependymoma.
- Describe the presentation of ependymoma.
- Summarize the treatment options for ependymoma.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by ependymoma.
