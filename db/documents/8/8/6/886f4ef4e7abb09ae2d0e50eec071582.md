Atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini is a rare disease that most likely will not be encountered by the primary care provider or nurse practitioner. However, when faced with unknown skin lesions, the best recommendation is to refer the patient to a dermatologist for a definitive diagnosis and then work as a team to provide coordinated follow up. Atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini has a marked female preponderance, with a female to male patient ratio of 6:1. The condition is more frequently reported in white Europeans. The disorder may progress in some people, but little is known about its long term course.

Due to the challenge of dealing with a rare disease, it should be managed with an interprofessional team. The pharmacist should assist with medication reconciliation, and treatment options as the patient may need topical steroids and antimalarials as well as antibiotics. The pharmacist should also assist with patient education and assist in monitoring compliance. The clinician should have the support of a dermatology specialty nurse to assist with patient and family education. Further, the nurse should make sure regular monitoring is attained, and close follow-up visits are arranged. Any concerning issues should be reported to the interprofessional team. The best outcomes will be achieved with a coordinated approach to treatment, education, and monitoring. [Level 5]
