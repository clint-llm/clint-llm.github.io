The nerve innervation of the long flexor muscles of the hand subdivides between the median nerve and the ulnar nerve. The ulnar nerve (C8, T1) innervates the muscles on the ulnar side of the forearm and hand. The ulnar nerve only innervates one of the long flexor muscles, the flexor carpal ulnaris muscle.
