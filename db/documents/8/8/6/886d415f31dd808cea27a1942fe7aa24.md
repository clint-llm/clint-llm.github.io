Factor V, also known as proaccelerin or labile factor, is a non-enzymatic coagulation protein that plays a crucial role in the coagulation cascade. The liver produces approximately 80%, with the remaining 20% being synthesized within alpha granules of platelets and megakaryocytes.

Once factor V is activated by either thrombin or factor Xa, it becomes the plasma cofactor of the prothrombinase complex. This complex, composed of calcium, phospholipids, factor Va, and factor Xa, aids in converting prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then activates factor XIII and fibrin leading to clot formation. Once hemostasis is achieved, factor Va is deactivated by protein C.

It is valuable to note that factor V also plays a vital role in the anticoagulation pathway. Together with protein C, factor V deactivates factor VIII leading to decreased prothrombinase activity and, ultimately, decreased thrombin and fibrin production. The end product is an overall decrease in clot production. This function of activated protein C (aPC) shifts the balance towards the inhibitory regulation of coagulation.

It is also essential to distinguish factor V deficiency from the more common factor V Leiden mutation, which results in resistance to activated protein C and the inability of protein C to adequately block the anticoagulant effects of factor V. Individuals with factor V Leiden mutations are therefore at increased risk of venous thromboembolic events.
