It is vital to verify the patient's surgical goals in the preoperative holding area at the time the consent form is signed to ensure the correct maneuvers are performed intraoperatively. Similarly, it is critical to post preoperative photographs of the patient in the operating room for reference during the case. The preoperative physical examination should identify and mark tear troughs, nasolabial folds, and jowls, and should identify any preexisting weakness of the facial nerve - particularly in the frontal and marginal mandibular branches - and any numbness in the distribution of the greater auricular nerve. Intraoperatively, the anesthesia provider may administer steroids to diminish postoperative edema and nausea, as well as antibiotics that cover skin flora, and some providers may prefer to run a total intravenous anesthetic with propofol and remifentanil rather than using volatile anesthetics to limit intraoperative bleeding and coughing during extubation.
