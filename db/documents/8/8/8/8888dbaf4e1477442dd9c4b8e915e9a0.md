One of the most important aspects of tuberculosis treatment is close follow-up and monitoring for these side effects. Most of these side effects can be managed by either close monitoring or adjusting the dose. In some cases, the medication needs to be discontinued and second-line therapy should be considered if other alternatives are not available.
