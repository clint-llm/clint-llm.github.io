Hydroquinone cream is the standard depigmentation or skin lightening agent. Clinically it is used to treat areas of dyschromia, such as in:

- Melasma

- Chloasma

- Solar lentigines

- Freckles

- Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation

Its most common use is in patients with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and melasma.

**Post-inflammatory Hyperpigmentation**

Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation results from cutaneous inflammation, causing increased melanin production. Common causes of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation are acne vulgaris, eczematous dermatoses, contact dermatitis, psoriasis, lichen planus, and burns.

**Melasma**

Melasma is an acquired hyperpigmentation condition and presents on sun-exposed areas of the face, commonly the forehead, cheeks, and chin.

Photoprotection is a significant key in maximal benefit from hydroquinone use. Melanocytes become stimulated from UVB, UVA, and even visible light leading to pigmentation. Therefore, broad-spectrum sunscreens are a recommended strategy.

Hydroquinone is not FDA approved due to its unknown safety profile. It is banned in the EU, Australia, and Japan.
