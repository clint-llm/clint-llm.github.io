Education of the families with newborns with androgen insensitivity syndrome is vital for optimizing the plan of care for the newborn into adulthood, which is achievable by undertaking an interprofessional teamÂ approach with the help of the clinician, geneticist, along with support groups to tailor the needs of the individual suffering from this disorder and their families. The nurse has a paramount role in educating patients with AIS and their families and making sure they have access to community support groups and to educational materials.
