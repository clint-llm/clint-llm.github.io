**Hematology-Oncology**

Bone marrow suppression: myelosuppression leads to anemia, leukopenia (more common), and thrombocytopenia. This toxicity is reversible by withholding the medication for two weeks and can potentially be resumed at a lower dose.

Hydroxyurea causes macrocytosis, seen early in treatment, and may be confused with pernicious anemia. While unrelated to vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency, prophylactic folic acid supplementation is the recommended intervention to assist with macrocytosis.

Hydroxyurea used to manage myeloproliferative disorders can cause secondary leukemias. A case series detailed three patients with essential thrombocythemia who were continuously receiving hydroxyurea for 47, 81, and 90 months had a leukemic transformation.

Long-term use of hydroxyurea can cause skin cancer; cutaneous carcinomas are a severe side effect of hydroxyurea.

**Gastrointestinal**

Hydroxyurea has correlations with gastric distress, gastritis, mucositis, and oral mucosa ulcer.

There are reports of elevation of serum concentrations of hepatic enzymes in patients receiving hydroxyurea. While rare, there are reports of hepatotoxicity resulting in fatal hepatic failure in patients with HIV infection receiving the drug in combination with antiretroviral agents. Fatal hepatotoxicity occurred most frequently in patients receiving combination therapy with hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine.

Fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis has been reported in patients with HIV infection, during therapy with hydroxyurea and didanosine, with or without stavudine. In these patients, close monitoring of signs and symptoms of pancreatitis the recommendation, along with permanent discontinuation hydroxyurea in patients who develop signs and symptoms of pancreatitis.

**Dermatology**

Long-term treatment with hydroxyurea is associated with painful skin ulcers, aphthous ulcers, non-ulcerative toxicity with erythema, and skin infiltration.

**Reproductive**

Hydroxyurea decreases sperm count and sperm motility in males and is considered pregnancy category D.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during hydroxyurea treatment.

**Pulmonary**

Hydroxyurea can cause severe interstitial pneumonitis.

**Cardiology**

There is a case reported in the literature, a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia receiving hydroxyurea treatment who had an acute myocardial infarction. The pathogenesis of this adverse effect is unclear.

**Neurology**

Rare side effects include headache, dizziness, disorientation, hallucinations, and seizures.
