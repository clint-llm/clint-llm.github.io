There are three stages to brain injury in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. First, there is an immediate primary neuronal injury that occurs due to interruption of oxygen and glucose to the brain. This decreases ATP and results in failure of the ATP-dependent NaK pump. Sodium enters the cell followed by water, causing cell swelling, widespread depolarization, and cell death. Cell death and lysis cause release of glutamate, an excitatory amino acid, which causes an increase in intracellular calcium and further cell death.

Following the immediate injury is a latent period of about six hours, during which reperfusion occurs, and some cells recover.

Late secondary neuronal injury occurs over the next 24-48 hours as reperfusion results in blood flow to and from damaged areas, spreading toxic neurotransmitters and widening the area of brain affected.
