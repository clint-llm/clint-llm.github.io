One of the most important causes of liver dysfunction is drug-induced liver injury (DILI) which can lead to a wide spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild non-specific symptoms like asymptomatic transaminitis, acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, cholestasis to liver failure. It can be caused by a multitude of prescription drugs, herbal and dietary supplements and commonly leads to withdrawal of the drug from the market. This activity reviews the cause of liver toxicity, the pathophysiology, presentation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the drugs that can cause liver toxicity. 
- Describe the pathophysiology of drug induced liver damage.
- Summarize the evaluation of patients with drug induced liver toxicity.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by liver toxicity
