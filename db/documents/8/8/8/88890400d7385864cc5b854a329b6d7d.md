Enthesopathies can be due to a loss of fibrillar structure secondary to edema, mineralization, which leads to calcification and ossification, diffuse inflammatory disease, or altered structure of collagen fibers leading to a thickened enthesis.

Enthesitis is a common finding in both PsA and SpA. The key difference between enthesitis from mechanical stress and that from a diffuse inflammatory process such as PsA and SpA is that the diffuse inflammatory processes tend to affect multiple entheses. Mechanical stress, albeit theorized to be at a lower threshold, seems to be an inciting event in both localized enthesitis from repetitive stress and diffuse enthesitis from an inflammatory disease.
