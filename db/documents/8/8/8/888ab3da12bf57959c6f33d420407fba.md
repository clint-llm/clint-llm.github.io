Cardiac anomalies are commonly seen in velocardial facial syndrome and frequently need repair. Complications from surgery, particularly in the newborn stage, may occur and should be explored with parents before surgery.

Autoimmune disease is seen in approximately 10% of patients with velocardial facial syndrome, most likely secondary to their immune deficiency from thymic hypoplasia.

Idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) occur with increased frequency in patients with velocardial facial syndrome.

Velocardial facial syndrome patients are at increased risk for hematologic malignancies due to a depressed immune system.

Depending on the severity of immunodeficiency, patients with velocardial facial syndrome may be at higher risk for viral infections, particularly in childhood. These infections may last longer and have more frequent bacterial infections superimposed. Close monitoring and early treatment are required.
