In a study by Kim et al., patients that underwent surgical removal of neurilemmomas in the brachial plexus who had full strength pre-operatively maintained their normal strength in 88% of cases. 90% of those who had post-operative weakness had strength that was either improved or unchanged from their preoperative examination.
