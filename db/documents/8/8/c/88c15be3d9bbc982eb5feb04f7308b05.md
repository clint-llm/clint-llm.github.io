Development of the small intestine begins at week three of gestation and is comprised of three stages: (1) morphogenesis and cell proliferation, (2) cell differentiation, and (3) functional maturation.SOX9, GATA4, and FOXA2. The Hox signaling pathway, involving the interplay between the endoderm and mesoderm, determines the different features of the small intestine.

Around week four of gestation, the premature midgut is open to the yolk sac, which grows more slowly than the developing embryo. Eventually, the edges of the embryonic disc come together with the midgut, forming the lumen of the small intestine, while the yolk sac becomes the vitelline duct.

By week five, the midgut has grown to the point of folding onto itself, while week six is when the loops of the gut herniate through the umbilicus, allowing for more room for the developing bowel, liver, and kidneys to grow. Weeks nine to 10 is when the small bowel returns to the abdomen.

During week six herniation, a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation occurs, which causes the ileum to reach the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. When the bowels return to the abdomen, another counterclockwise rotation of 180 degrees occurs, causing the cecum to now sit in the right upper quadrant.

Around week 11, the villi and microvilli form, and the small intestinal components are in their final arrangement. Throughout early development, the epithelium of the small intestine goes through recurrent turnover via stem cells. Originating from neural crest cells, the ENS is completed by week 13 of development.

The development of the small bowel is regulated by growth and transcription factors, such as epidermal growth factors (EGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Late in gestation, fetal cortisone levels in the blood rise and aid in the process of gut development.

While most of the small intestine is part of the midgut, the duodenum is both a part of the foregut (anterior gut) and the midgut. The first (superior) part of the duodenum is a part of the foregut. The second (descending) part of the duodenum proximal to the ampulla of Vater is a part of the foregut, while the second (descending) part of the duodenum distal to the ampulla of Vater is a part of the midgut. The third (horizontal) and fourth (ascending) parts of the duodenum are a part of the midgut. The first part of the duodenum, as well as the jejunum and ileum, are intraperitoneal organs, while the 2nd-4th parts of the duodenum are retroperitoneal.
