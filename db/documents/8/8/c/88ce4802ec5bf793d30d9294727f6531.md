Because the optic cup gives rise to so many ocular structures, it has broad clinical significance. One classic example of a condition that can result from defective optic cup embryogenesis is coloboma. A coloboma is a defect with absent tissue in part of an ocular structure. Colobomas are thought to be caused by failed closure of the optic fissure.

Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) is a rare genetic condition that may be due to defects affecting the optic cup. ARS is an autosomal dominant syndrome that has multiple effects on the anterior segment and may lead to glaucoma.

Defects in the development of the optic cup also contribute to numerous rare ocular diseases.

Morning glory syndrome is another rare anomaly that may be due to optic cup dysgenesis.

Retinoic acid is essential to proper optic cup development. Thus deficiency or mutations in retinoic acid signaling can lead to anomalous development; this can range from relatively mild disorders, such as Fundus albipunctatus, to very severe disorders such as Matthew-Wood syndrome or Leber congenital amaurosis.

In summary, the optic cup is an embryologic structure that gives rise to many structures in the globe. Also, signaling from the optic cup leads to the development of additional intra-ocular and extra-ocular structures. Dysgenesis can result in a wide array of disorders, from retinal detachment to glaucoma to anterior segment dysgenesis.
