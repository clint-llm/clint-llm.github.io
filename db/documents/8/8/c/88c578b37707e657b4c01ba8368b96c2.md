Osteoblastoma is an uncommon benign bone-forming neoplasm that accounts for about 1% of all primary bone tumors. It commonly arises in the posterior elements of the spine and the sacrum. An accurate diagnosis of osteoblastoma is critical in determining the appropriate treatment modality and prognosis. In most cases, the basis for diagnosis is from clinical, radiological, and mainly histopathological examination. Osteoblastomas have a variable radiologic appearance ranging from indolent to very aggressive. This activity describes the cause, pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis of osteoblastoma and highlights the interprofessional team's role in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of osteoblastoma.
- Outline the evaluation process for a patient with suspected osteoblastoma.
- Explain the management options available for osteoblastoma.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance osteoblastoma treatment and improve outcomes.
