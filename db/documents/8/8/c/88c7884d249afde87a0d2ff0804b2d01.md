The procedure may take approximately 45 minutes to complete. After obtaining written and verbal consent, the patient is accompanied to the radiology suite, and a peripheral IV is placed in the patient’s arm. Radioactive Tc-99m tracer is then injected into the patient’s veins. After approximately 10 to 15 minutes, a scintillation gamma camera takes images while the patient is placed in various positions. The patient is asked to lay in the anterior, posterior, and oblique right positions as images are taken of the patient’s liver.

Left-sided images are taken to evaluate the patient’s spleen.
