Adverse reactions reported from adapalene include photosensitivity, irritation, redness, dryness, itching, and burning. These are usually mild adverse events.

Adapalene is less irritating compared to other topical retinoids. In a blinded, randomized, controlled, parallel-group study of 591 acne patients, a combined safety analysis conducted in the United States and Europe compared adapalene 0.1% gel and tretinoin 0.025% gel. The number of patients discontinuing the study due to adverse events was about twice as high in those using tretinoin (2.4%) compared to adapalene (1.3%). There were no systemic adverse reactions noted in the study. Most of the adverse reactions observed were related to skin irritation. Multiple other studies have demonstrated similar findings.

Adapalene 0.1% and 0.3% have also been compared to tazarotene in multiple studies showing adapalene to be non-inferior in efficacy and demonstrated superior tolerability.

Rare, severe allergic reactions characteristically demonstrate pruritus, facial edema, lip swelling, and eyelid swelling.
