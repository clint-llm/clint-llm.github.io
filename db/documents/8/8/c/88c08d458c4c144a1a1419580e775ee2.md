HFM is a dysfunction of the 1st and 2nd branchial arches, which are formed by the neural crest cells (NCC).

Embryonically, the first branchial arch becomes the maxilla, mandible, zygoma, muscles of mastication, trigeminal nerve, anterior auricle (tragus, helical root, helix), malleolus, and incus. The second branchial arch becomes the hyoid bone, muscles of facial expression, facial nerve, stapes, and the remainder of the auricle (antihelix, antitragus, and lobule). Disruption during pharyngeal arch development from genetic defects, teratogens, smoking, hormonal therapy, vascular injury, vasoactive medications, cocaine, and maternal-fetal factors such as maternal diabetes, hypothyroidism, and celiac disease can result in hypoplasia or aplasia.
