Salmonellae are motile gram-negative bacilli that infect or colonize humans, causing a number of clinical infections with different clinical features like gastroenteritis, enteric fever, bacteremia, and a chronic carrier state. Enteric fever is caused by Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi, while other strains of Salmonella are known as nontyphoidal strains. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Salmonella infection and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Salmonella infection.
- Describe the findings associated with Salmonella infection.
- Review the management considerations for patients with Salmonella.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interdisciplinary team to enhance the delivery of care and prevention for patients affected by Salmonella.
