Understanding the anatomy of the lumbar spine is essential when performing a lumbar puncture. The order in which the spinal needle will traverse the lumbar spine is as follows:

- Skin

- Subcutaneous tissue

- Supraspinous ligament

- Interspinous ligament

- Ligamentum flavum

- Epidural space

- Dura

- Arachnoid

- Subarachnoid space

The distance from the skin to the epidural space is approximately 55 mm or 2/3 the length of the spinal needle.
