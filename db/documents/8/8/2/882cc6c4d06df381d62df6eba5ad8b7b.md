OSA is a condition caused by obstruction of the upper airway during sleep that can lead to symptoms including daytime sleepiness, snoring, gasping for air while sleeping, and morning headaches that are associated with adverse outcomes, including increased rates of MVCs and sleepiness-related accidents as well as increased rates of cardiopulmonary complications, cerebrovascular events, and neurocognitive effects in the long term.

In addition to a comprehensive history and physical exam, in-lab polysomnography is the gold standard for treating obstructive sleep apnea.

For patients with OSA, positive pressure therapy is the mainstay of treatment. However, additional treatments are available for those who fail positive pressure therapy or have an inadequate response to positive pressure therapy alone.
