ICBN has been anatomically identified as a single trunk or as a bifurcation transitioning into two individual nerves. A meta-analysis on ICBN anatomy reported a single ICBN nerve to be prevalent in about 47% of cases. Bifurcated ICBN's presented about 42% of the time, with 63% of bifurcated nerves unequally distributed. ICBN also communicates with the brachial plexus in 40% of cases, via the medial brachial cutaneous nerve and the medial cord.
