When taking a thorough history of a patient to evaluate for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), one must ask if they have any ruminations or incessant intrusive thoughts that consume more time than they would like (less than one hour) or interfere with their life in any way. The same must be inquired about compulsions or repetitive behaviors such as desires to tap, count, reorganize, or behave in any manner that might put their mind at ease.

Since there is a heritable component of the disorder, it is also essential to ask if any family members have been diagnosed or experience similar symptoms.

As the course of OCD is waxing and waning, the severity of symptoms may vary. To receive a formal diagnosis, the DSM V required more than 1 hour/day to be consumed by the obsession or compulsions or that they cause significant daily stress.

The 12-month prevalence of OCD in the United States is 1.2%, with a similar incidence internationally (1.1 to 1.8%). Females are affected at a slightly higher rate than males in adults, although males are more commonly affected in childhood.

Those with OCD may present with evidence of their rituals, such as chapped hands from compensatory over-washing, or being underweight from food restrictions secondary to contamination fears. It is important to have a keen eye for signs of OCD as patients are unlikely to seek treatment early on as they may be ashamed of their obsession and compulsions.

Patients’ obsessions are ego-dystonic, and they may appear anxious when unable to neutralize their “fear."
