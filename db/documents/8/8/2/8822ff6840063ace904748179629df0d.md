Annular pancreas (AP) is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by encasement of the duodenum by a band of pancreatic tissue. AP is not commonly encountered in clinical practice and affects both children and adults. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of this condition can improve the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of AP and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of annular pancreas.
- Summarize the diagnostic evaluation of annular pancreas.
- Outline the currently available treatment options in the management of annular pancreas.
- Summarize the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance and improve outcomes in patients diagnosed with annular pancreas.
