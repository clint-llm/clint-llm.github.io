The primary role of fluid resuscitation is to maintain organ perfusion (hemodynamics) and substrate (oxygen, electrolytes, among others) delivery through the administration of fluid and electrolytes. An enteral route can be used; however, when oral intake is not possible, clinicians can replace fluid losses by intravenous (IV) administration. This activity describes the types of fluids, indications, contraindications and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in monitoring the patients during resuscitation which will assist in improving outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify conditions where fluid resuscitation is recommended.
- Describe the types of fluids used to resuscitate trauma patients.
- Summarize the complications of inappropriate fluid resuscitation.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure appropriate fluid resuscitation of patients in shock and to enhance outcomes.
