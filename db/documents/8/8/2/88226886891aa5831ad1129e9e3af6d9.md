When history and the physical examination findings are suggestive of a coronary cameral fistula, the diagnosis can be established with the help of the following investigations:

- Laboratory tests: Cardiac enzymes may present elevated in patients with coronary cameral fistulae. The B-type natriuretic peptide may also be elevated, especially in patients with heart failure.

- Chest radiograph: Usually normal, however, chamber enlargement may be seen with large fistulae. Signs of pulmonary congestion or interstitial edema can present in patients with heart failure.

- Electrocardiogram (ECG): Usually normal, however, evidence of ischemia or chamber enlargement can be seen with large shunts.

- Echocardiography: In children, transthoracic two dimensional and color doppler echocardiography can be useful to diagnose coronary cameral fistulae. On the other hand, in adults, transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography is more sensitive in detecting the fistulae. In one study conducted in Italy, color doppler transesophageal echocardiography allowed diagnosis and precise localization of coronary artery fistulae in twenty-one patients with angiographically confirmed coronary artery fistulae.

- Computed tomography (CT scan): Coronary cameral fistulae can be detected noninvasively using 64 slices multidetector CT scanner. It provides high-quality three-dimensional images of the distal coronary artery and side branches. A study published in 2014 by Lim et al., concluded that CT angiography was a useful modality for detecting coronary artery fistulae noninvasively. Moreover, coronary artery fistulae were detected in 0.9% of the study subjects, a percentage higher than the generally reported prevalence of coronary artery fistulae as detected by coronary angiography.

- Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography: This is the test of choice for the diagnosis of coronary cameral fistulae. The anatomical characteristics (site of origin, course, site of insertion), and coronary angiography can determine the exact size of the fistulae.  This test will also provide information on the hemodynamic significance of the fistula.

- Nuclear imaging: This is useful before and after operative repair to detect regions of myocardial ischemia.
