Aside from their involvement in many disease pathophysiologies, NMDA receptors are the pharmacologic target of both therapeutic drugs and drugs of abuse. Several examples of these include:

- Ketamine: An NMDA antagonist, it is used as a sedative, anesthetic, off-label as an antidepressant, or recreationally as a hallucinogenic drug of abuse.

- Phencyclidine: An NMDA antagonist. It is used recreationally as a hallucinogenic, depersonalizing, euphoric drug of abuse. It reportedly causes homicidal and suicidal impulses in users. Users will characteristically experience nystagmus on physical exam.

- Ethanol: A common recreational drug, it modulates NMDA receptors through complex mechanisms.

- Memantine: An uncompetitive NMDA antagonist, this drug is used in the treatment of Alzheimer disease and off-label for Huntington disease.

- Amantadine: An NMDA antagonist used in the treatment of Parkinson disease and off-label for Huntington disease.

- Magnesium: This naturally occurs in the transmembrane ion channel of the NMDA receptor. It is used to prevent migraines and abort migraine aura, prevent seizures in preeclampsia, and as a neuroprotective agent administered to mothers of premature infants to prevent neonatal brain damage.

- Methadone: A mu-opioid agonist and NMDA antagonist used in the treatment of opioid addiction.
