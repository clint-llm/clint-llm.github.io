The diagnosis of aortocaval syndrome is very difficult and is best done with an interprofessional team that includes an obstetrician, emergency department physician, radiologist, nurse practitioner, internist, and intensivist. Once the diagnosis is made, the key is to relieve pressure from the vena cava. In many cases, depending on the cause positional change will improve the symptoms. The patient should be warned that the symptoms may occur when in the supine position and a position change may be required to ease the symptoms.
