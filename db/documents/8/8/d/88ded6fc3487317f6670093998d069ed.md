The classic presentation of this condition is weakness observed in one limb contralateral to the seizure activity after a focal seizure has occurred. This can range from a mild weakness of the limb to complete paralysis; however, this syndrome is not limited to limb weakness and can include confusion, amnesia, alteration of consciousness, aphasia, agitation, psychosis, gaze palsy, neglect, numbness, and visual field deficits depending on the particular anatomic epileptic focus.

It is essential to understand that pure focal seizures may cause this condition, but it may also be observed in focal-onset seizures that are generalized. The key difference being that a focal-onset seizure begins with twitching in one limb (or other effects depending on the initial focus), then affecting one complete half of the body, and later appearing as a more generalized seizure pattern (Jacksonian march). A pure focal seizure persists in the affected area of the body and does not become generalized.

This postictal syndrome may last anywhere from minutes to days, with the vast majority of patients seeing spontaneous and complete resolution within 36 hours.

If the seizure was witnessed, it is essential to ask the observer if any focal activity was observed prior. While this history can be beneficial, it is often too subtle for the witness to recall. This is especially true in the first seizure episode.
