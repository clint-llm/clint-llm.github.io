The diagnosis of the Lown-Ganong-Levine (LGL) pattern requires a highly specialized level of clinical knowledge and suspicion. LGL pattern is suspected to occur in less than 1% of the population, and not all patients experience associated symptoms. [Level 4] Currently, very little is known in regard to the LGL pattern, and it is rarely studied or recognized. It is theorized to be secondary to anatomical variation, resulting due to the presence of an accessory pathway that has the potential to create arrhythmias by partially or completely bypassing the atrioventricular (AV) node resulting in the direct activation of the bundle of His by the sinoatrial (SA) node. [Level 5] The diagnosis of LGL requires the use of a resting EKG, where these patients typically display a pattern of short PR interval but normal QRS complex duration; however, electrophysiology should be consulted to evaluate for the presence of a bypass tract within the conduction system.

Cardiology specialty nursing staff trained in telemetry may aid in the diagnosis of Lown-Ganong-Levine pattern if patients with associated symptoms of palpitations or lightheadedness are found to display LGL pattern on telemetry and can assist in monitoring and assessing treatment effectiveness once the treating physician has initiated therapy. The healthcare team should also include a specialized cardiology pharmacist who can consult regarding anti-arrhythmic pharmaceutical therapy, verifying dosing, offering alternative agents as options if initial treatment is ineffective, and checking for drug-drug interactions. Nurses, pharmacists, and other ancillary staff should have the freedom to voice concerns to the physicians and specialists on the case, ensuring they have a voice at the table in contributing to the overall success of the interprofessional team in directing patient outcomes positively.
