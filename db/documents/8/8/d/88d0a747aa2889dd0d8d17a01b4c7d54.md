The histologic findings of cobalt cardiomyopathy have similar features to cardiomyopathies induced by protein and thiamine deficiency.

More characteristic findings in cobalt cardiomyopathy included myocyte atrophy and myofibril loss.

In patients with hard metal lung disease (HMLD), bronchoalveolar lavage findings include multinucleated giant cells and increased inflammatory cells.

Arthroprostethic cobaltism likely results from the development of metallosis and trunnionosis. Metallosis describes the process by which metal particles from an implant deposit into the surrounding tissue due to abnormal wear.

Trunnionosis is the process of metal erosion at the level of the trunnion, which is the area where the femoral head implant connects to the neck of the arthroplasty.

Histologic findings consist of lymphocytic invasion forming perivascular infiltrates. There can also be gross findings of synovial fluid discoloration.
