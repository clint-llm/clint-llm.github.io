DDS is a clinical diagnosis. There is no specific laboratory testing or imaging. It remains a diagnosis of exclusion in suspected patients who develop symptoms after initial dialysis or resumption of dialysis after a period of non-compliance. Clinical conditions causing similar manifestations should be considered as a part of the differential diagnosis.
