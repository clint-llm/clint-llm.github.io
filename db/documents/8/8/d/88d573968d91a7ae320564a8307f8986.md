Tarsal tunnel syndrome is sometimes referred to as tibial nerve dysfunction or posterior tibial nerve neuralgia. It is an entrapment neuropathy that is associated with the compression of the structures within the tarsal tunnel. It can be thought of as analogous to carpal tunnel syndrome of the wrist, but occurs at the ankle and is much less common than carpal tunnel syndrome. This activity addresses the presentation, evaluation, and management of tarsal tunnel syndrome and examines the role of an interprofessional team approach on the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the signs and symptoms of tarsal tunnel syndrome with the structures that are entrapped.
- Describe the management strategies for tarsal tunnel syndrome.
- Review the potential complications of tarsal tunnel syndrome.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by tarsal tunnel syndrome.
