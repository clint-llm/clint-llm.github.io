# Continuing Education Activity

Chikungunya virus is an alphavirus that is arthropod-borne and transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. This virus causes a rash, an acute febrile illness, and arthralgia known as chikungunya fever which can develop into potentially chronic and debilitating arthritis that may last for months or years. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of chikungunya fever and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mosquito vectors in the etiology of chikungunya fever.
- Outline the epidemiology of chikungunya fever.
- Describe the patient history associated with chikungunya fever.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance preventive measures and improve outcomes for chikungunya fever.

# Introduction

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne alphavirus that belongs to the family Togaviridae transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. The virus is known for causing an acute febrile illness, rash, and arthralgia known as Chikungunya fever followed by potentially chronic and debilitating arthritic symptoms that may last for months or years.

# Etiology

The primary vectors for CHIKV are Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus (Asian Tiger mosquito). These mosquitoes have biological characteristics that provide effective invasiveness, vector competence, and vectorial capacity that sets the tone for the global manifestation of Chikungunya fever.

Ae. aegypti has been established in the U.S. for more than 300 years while Ae. albopictus has been present since 1985 with different vector characteristics making global expansion of the disease possible. Specifically, CHIKV was found to have adapted to Ae. albopictus fairly recently during the Indian Ocean outbreak in 2005-06 when it acquired a mutation in its E1 membrane protein that allowed it to infest the urban mosquito vector.Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes is a function of their focused feeding on and association with humans along with the ability of the human host and mosquito vector to travel.

# Epidemiology

CHIKV was first discovered in Tanzania in 1952, has since spread effectively reaching the Americas in 2013, Florida on July 2014, and severely affecting various Caribbean, Central, and South American countries after that.Aedes mosquitoes initiate local transmission.

Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus are also the vectors responsible for other notable diseases such as Dengue and Zika, causing coinfection in some cases.

# Pathophysiology

CHIKV is known to transmit in 2 cycles: urban and sylvatic. Urban transmission is from human to mosquito to human and is the main source of the current Western Hemisphere epidemic. Sylvatic transmission can be found in Africa and is based on animal to mosquito to human.Ae. aegypti, but incorporation of Ae. albopictus through a mutation in the E1 envelope protein not only increased the fitness of the virus in this species but improved transmissibility to vertebrates.

The route of infection used by CHIKV starts after inoculation and infection of human epithelial and endothelial cells, primary fibroblasts, and monocyte-derived macrophages.

# Histopathology

CHIKV is an arthropod-carried pathogen of the genus alphavirus and the family Togaviridae that possesses 3 known genotypes: Asian, West African, and East Central South African.

# History and Physical

Chikungunya fever usually presents with the non-specific findings of high-grade fever and myalgia, following a 3 to 7 day incubation period, and lasting around 3 to 5 days. Bilateral symmetrical polyarthralgia ensues 2 to 5 days after the onset of fevers and preferentially involves distal over proximal joints.

Manifestations such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and generalized lymphadenopathy may also be found. Although it is not considered to be a neurotropic virus, it has long been associated with neurologic symptoms, with encephalitis among newborns infected through mother-to-child transmission being the most common.

# Evaluation

Chikungunya fever evaluation consists mainly of the clinical findings of fever and polyarthralgia in a person who recently returned from an affected region with an 84% sensitivity, 71% positive predictive value (PPV), and 83% negative predictive value (NPV).

Diagnosis of CHIKV can be established or confirmed by detection of viral RNA with serology and/or reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) depending on disease timeframe presentation.

Chikungunya fever is a nationally notifiable condition.

# Treatment / Management

Symptomatic relief is the mainstay treatment for Chikungunya fever, including adequate hydration, rest, and pain/fever relief preferably with acetaminophen.

Chronic manifestations, including persistent or relapsing-remitting polyarthralgia, polyarthritis, and myalgia, have been found to respond adequately to hydroxychloroquine in combination with corticosteroids or other disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

Management of CHIKV is based on avoidance of mosquito bites. Use of repellents containing DEET, wearing protective clothing, bed nets, and air-conditioned buildings are great ways to prevent exposure.Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus has been of increasing concern.

# Differential Diagnosis

Given the non-specific findings of arthralgia, high fever, and rash, the differential diagnosis for the acute and chronic manifestations of Chikungunya fever can be extensive. As mentioned above, DENV and ZK share not only clinical findings but also identical vectors with CHIKV, which prompts serology testing for all 3 viruses when a patient presents with the above symptoms.

- Malaria

- Yellow fever

- Leptospirosis

- Measles

- Mononucleosis

- African tick bite fever

Chronic arthralgia caused by Chikungunya fever can be easily confused with other more common causes. Furthermore, worse outcomes and increased morbidity has been demonstrated for patients with underlying joint disease and are super-infected with CHIKV.

- Seronegative rheumatoid arthritis

- Reiter arthritis

- Rheumatoid arthritis

- Hepatitis C

- Systemic lLupus erythematosus

# Prognosis

Despite a low case fatality ratio (CFR), Chikungunya fever is highlighted by a substantial post-chikungunya chronic polyarthralgia, defined as joint pains lasting longer than 6 weeks.

# Complications

As mentioned previously, chronic arthritis is the most common and serious complication of Chikungunya fever. Ocular manifestations of disease can include conjunctivitis, optic neuritis, iridocyclitis, episcleritis, retinitis, and uveitis.

# Consultations

Chronic arthritis from Chikungunya fever has emerged as a concern for rheumatologist specialists worldwide due to swelling and recurrent pain that poorly responds to treatment with analgesics, and because it is a debilitating disease that mimics rheumatic arthritis and compromises the quality of life.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Chikungunya fever is a virus transmitted to people by mosquitoes found mainly in tropical and sub-tropical environments. Originating from Asia, this disease has caused serious outbreaks in the Western Hemisphere since 2013. The most common symptoms of this disease are high fevers and joint pain, although headaches, muscle pains, and rash may also occur. Risk factors for the disease consist of travel to affected areas or anywhere with mosquitoes and mosquito bites. Treatment consists of rest, adequate hydration, and pain relief with acetaminophen. Prevention is key and is based on protection from mosquito bites with clothing, DEET, and mosquito nets. Given the risk of co-infection with other viruses from the mosquito bite, individuals with these symptoms must seek medical care immediately.

# Pearls and Other Issues

- Chikungunya fever is an arthropod-borne alphavirus from the Togaviridae family endemic to Asia that is transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and has caused serious worldwide outbreaks with a preference for tropical and sub-tropical climates.

- The Aedes mosquito vectors are also responsible for transmitting Dengue virus and Zika virus, so co-infection is possible.

- Acute clinical manifestations of high fevers, polyarthralgia, and maculopapular rash begin after a 3- to 7-day incubation accompanied by a headache and myalgia. Ocular, neurological, and fetal manifestations have been found in rare instances.

- Chronic arthritis is the most common and severe complication leading to specialist rheumatologic care.

- Diagnosis is obtained with the above clinical findings accompanied by a history of recent travel to an affected area or exposure to mosquito bites. Diagnosis confirmation is performed with RT-PCR or viral serology. The CDC recommends that all patients with exposure and symptoms be tested for CHIKV, DENV, and ZK.

- Supportive care with rest, hydration, and analgesic agents is the mainstay treatment. Aspirin and NSAIDs should be avoided initially for risk of co-infection with DENV. Chronic manifestations can be treated with steroids and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). No antivirals or vaccines are commonly used.

- Prevention with avoidance of mosquito bites is paramount. DEET, clothing with coverage, and mosquito nets. Insecticides have been used as a public health measure, but resistance is a factor of increased concern.

- Chikungunya fever is a reportable disease to the CDC.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Mosquitoes represent the arthropod-vector with the most impact in the world, transmitting diseases from Chikungunya fever to malaria with incalculable morbidity and mortality. Given the lack of specific treatment for most of these diseases, vector control remains the main form of prevention. Insecticide public health campaigns have proven to be effective in the past, but widespread resistance has put a dent on these efforts.

When it comes to improving outcomes, the CDC has highlighted the dangers of CHIKV and DENV co-infection and the differences in treatment modalities, important for all healthcare professionals, to avoid Dengue fever-related deaths.
