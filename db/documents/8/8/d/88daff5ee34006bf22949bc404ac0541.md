The Rome IV diagnostic criteria is widely used for the definition of functional constipation

The Rome IV criteria include two of following for the last 3 months:

- Hard stools in at least 25 percent of defecations

- Straining in at least 25 percent of defecation

- A sensation of incomplete evacuation in at least 25 percent of defecations

- Less than 3 bowel movements per week

- Use of manual measures to help move or remove the stools from the rectum

Additionally, the Bristol Stool Scale can be used to classify the form of feces into seven categories. Type 1 and 2 show hard stools while types 3 and 4 are normal. Individuals with loose stools (types 5 through 7) tend to have diarrhea.

Imaging is not routinely done when patients present with constipation. Physicians should look out for alarm symptoms including weight loss, positive fecal occult blood tests, iron deficiency anemia, and a family history of colon cancer.
