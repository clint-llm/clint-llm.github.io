Congenital generalized hypertrichosis is a feature of several rare inherited syndromes in which genetic errors result in the dysfunction of proteins involved in the development of the hair follicle.

Prepubertal hypertrichosis is linked to elevated levels of free and total testosterone in some patients.

Drugs most often cause acquired generalized hypertrichosis.

- Antibiotics such as streptomycin

- Anti-inflammatory drugs such as benoxaprofen and corticosteroids

- Vasodilators (diazoxide, minoxidil, prostaglandin E1)

- Diuretics (acetazolamide)

- Anticonvulsants (phenytoin)

- Immunosuppressives (cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil)

- Psoralens (methoxypsoralen, trimethylpsoralen)

- Antiseptic agents (hexachlorobenzene)

- Chelators (penicillamine)

- Interferon-alpha

- Fenoterol

- EGFR inhibitors (cetuximab, panitumumab, erlotinib, gefitinib)

Although drugs are usually the culprit, acquired generalized hypertrichosis can also be seen in traumatic brain injuries, juvenile hypothyroidism, juvenile dermatomyositis, acromegaly, malnutrition, and advanced HIV infection.

Acquired hypertrichosis lanuginosa is considered to be a paraneoplastic phenomenon, and in certain instances precedes the diagnosis of cancer.

Several forms of congenital localized hypertrichosis including hypertrichosis cubiti (hairy elbow syndrome), hairy palms and soles, hypertrichosis of the auricle, hypertrichosis of the nasal tip, and anterior or posterior cervical hypertrichosis are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.

Congenital melanocytic nevi are often associated with hypertrichosis that becomes apparent during the infantile period of childhood. Plexiform neurofibromas, lesions pathognomonic for neurofibromatosis type I, also have associated hypertrichosis.

Nevoid hypertrichosis has a variable etiology.

- Primary nevoid hypertrichosis occurs in the absence of extracutaneous associations.

- Secondary nevoid hypertrichosis is associated with lipodystrophy, hemihypertrophy, scoliosis, and abnormalities of the underlying vasculature.

There are several hereditary and acquired systemic diseases that present with localized hypertrichosis. Cornelia de Lange syndrome, caused by autosomal dominant or X-linked dominant mutations can present with synophrys (unibrow), as well as hypertrichosis over the forehead, lateral face, shoulders, and back.AGPAT2, BSCL2, CAV1, CAVIN1/PTRF gene mutations, can present with hypertrichosis as well.

Acquired localized hypertrichosis is caused by repetitive trauma, friction, irritation, or inflammation. For example, localized hypertrichosis is often observed on the back of sack carriers, over a fractured limb after plaster casting, and over the posterior neck in weightlifters.  It can also be seen within vaccination sites and varicella scars.
