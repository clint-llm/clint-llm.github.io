The pathophysiology of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is as diverse as the classification of the disease. AUB can be caused by pelvic pathology like a distortion of the endometrial cavity due to fibroids, or endometrial protrusions into the cervix or vagina (polyps), or because of friable endometrial tissue. The friable endometrial tissue is likely caused by unopposed estrogen which causes the endometrium to become friable, vascular, and lacking sufficient stromal support which equates to heavy, continuous uterine bleeding.

Systemic conditions are also responsible for AUB. Obesity is an epidemic whose consequences affect every aspect of life and every organ system. In women, obesity can lead to unopposed estrogen and can lead to the polycystic ovarian syndrome. Coagulopathies can also lead to AUB; 13% of women with AUB have a variant of Von Willebrand disease, and 20% have an underlying coagulopathy.

Another important consideration and a significant cause of AUB are the patient’s medications. An intact coagulation pathway is essential for menstrual regulation and medications that interact with platelets and coagulation factors can lead to Acute AUB. The following is a list of some medications that can lead to AUB:

- Warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel, and other anticoagulants

- Conceptive medications and devices

- Tamoxifen

- Tricyclic antidepressants

- Antipsychotics

- Corticosteroids
