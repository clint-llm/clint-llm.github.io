**TAVR Indications:**

Current guidelines for TAVR include:

- Intermediate to prohibitive surgical risk patients with severe AS (class I recommendation level B evidence)

- A valve-in-valve procedure for a failed prior bioprosthetic valve (class I recommendation, level B evidence)

In mid-2019 the US FDA approved TAVR for low surgical risk patients. While society guidelines have not yet included this patient population in TAVR indications and practice guidelines (as of the time of this writing), we expect indications to expand to include these patients. Currently, guidelines recommend SAVR for these patients if the patient is a surgical candidate. TAVR is not approved for use in aortic valve insufficiency (AI), although there have been reports of off-label use of TAVR in these patients.

**Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty Indications:**

This procedure was first introduced in 1986 as a non-invasive option for the treatment of aortic stenosis. Unfortunately due to the high failure rate with early restenosis and poor long term survival rates the procedure is rarely performed. Typically, this procedure is offered as a palliative option for patients with contraindications to TAVR or SAVR. Occasionally, it is offered to hemodynamically unstable patients as a bridge to SAVR or TAVR intervention. BAV is often performed at the time of TAVR to aid with valve implantation.
