For medical purposes, methylphenidate is mainly given orally or, less commonly, as a transdermal patch. Multiple oral formulations are available that categorize according to how quickly the drug is released: immediate (IR), extended (XR or ER), and sustained. Two of the more unique formulations of methylphenidate are its ER sphenoidal oral drug absorption system that has a bimodal release and the osmotic (controlled) release delivery system. There are chewable tablets (either IR or ER) for children and an IR solution. Doses should not exceed 72 mg, the maximum dose of the ER tablet. If using the transdermal patch, the patient must be aware of placing the patch on the opposite hip each time to achieve its full effect. Those who misuse methylphenidate for recreational purposes prefer to use the intravenous (IV) or the intranasal route. Assess the risk of abuse before prescribing methylphenidate in any form.
