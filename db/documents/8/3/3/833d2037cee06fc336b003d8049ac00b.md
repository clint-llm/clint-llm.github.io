**Sialadenitis**

- Sialadenitis is the inflammation of the salivary gland caused by obstruction and infection by bacteria, viruses, or stones.

- Signs and symptoms include pain, swelling of the gland, and fever.

- The most common microorganisms involved in the condition are staphylococcal bacteria and the mumps virus

- Treatment includes antibiotics for bacterial infections, oral hydration, warm compresses, and drugs that induce salivary secretion. For cases of refractory infection, surgical management may be indicated (i.e., abscess drainage)

**Sialolithiasis**

- Sialolithiasis is a benign condition caused when a stone or calculus is lodged in a salivary duct. It is the most common cause of obstructive salivary gland disease and is responsible for half of all major salivary gland disorders

- Signs and symptoms include pain and swelling in the affected duct, particularly during and after eating

- Ultrasound imaging is the first step in the diagnosis. CT scan, MRI, and MR sialography can be used in patients with a high suspicion for ductal obstruction that had a negative or inconclusive ultrasound study

- The goal of treatment is to increase saliva flow through the duct with oral hydration and drugs that induce salivary secretion. Surgical removal of the calculus is required for chronic sialolithiasis that has failed conservative treatment
