Hurler syndrome is managed with an interprofessional team that includes nurses. Clinicians should note that the syndrome may not present with any signs or symptoms soon after birth.

Children with Hurler syndrome are usually not born with signsÂ but develop symptoms during the first year of life. Developmental delay may become apparent by the age of 1 to 2 years, with a maximum functional age of 2 to 4 years. The average age of mortality is 5 years, and nearly all patients die before 10 years of age.

Genetic counseling should be offered during pregnancy.
