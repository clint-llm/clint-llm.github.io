Today a great deal of effort is based on reversing the prediabetic state. This is best done in an interprofessional fashion that involves an endocrinologist, bariatric surgeon, dietitian, pharmacists, weight loss nurse, and a physical therapist. The patient should be educated on the importance of exercise and discontinuation of smoking. Further, the blood pressure must be well controlled and the hyperlipidemia lowered. The patient must be educated on the importance of eating a healthy diet and remaining compliant with medications to lower the blood glucose and cholesterol.

**Outcomes**

Many studies have sown that there is a relationship between persistently elevated blood glucose levels and risk for adverse cardiac events and death. Evidence shows that individuals with prediabetes are susceptible to many metabolic complications that may lead to blindness, stroke, heart disease, and renal failure. These individuals are also at a high risk for developing peripheral neuropathy and loss of limb. Further, the elevation of blood glucose during pregnancy also increase the risk of maternal and fetal mortality.
