Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disorder of lipid metabolism. It is characterized by very high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels due to a gene mutation causing premature coronary heart disease. Homozygous individuals typically acquired disease in childhood. The majority of cases are undiagnosed and sub-optimally treated.
