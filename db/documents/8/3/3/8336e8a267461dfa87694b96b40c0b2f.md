Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic inflammatory disease. It was first described by Hallopeau in 1881. Since then, multiple names have been used to describe this condition such as leukoplakia, kraurosis vulvae, balanitis xerotica obliterans, and lichen sclerosis et atrophicus. In 1976, the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease adopted the term of lichen sclerosus.

LS is a mucocutaneous autoimmune disorder characterized by hypopigmentation and skin atrophy. It involves most commonly the genital skin, less often the extragenital sites. LS is more common in women than in men. It may cause phimosis or scarring of the vaginal introitus. The diagnosis is based on the clinical features, but it is often confirmed by biopsy. The lesions can evolve towards the destruction of anatomic structures, functional impairment and a potential risk for malignant evolution. Thus, treatment and long term follow-up are mandatory.
