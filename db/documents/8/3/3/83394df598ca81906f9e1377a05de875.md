- Common adverse effects of diltiazem therapy include peripheral edema, bradycardia, dizziness, headache, and fatigue.

- Severe adverse effects include congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and hepatotoxicity.

- Diltiazem is indicated for treating arrhythmias and, consequently, has the potential to worsen or create new arrhythmias such as extrasystole and AV block.

- Diltiazem is extensively metabolized through the CYP450 system and requires careful medication profile review. Concomitant use alongside potent CYP450 inhibitors may increase diltiazem concentrations leading to adverse effects even at clinically recommended doses.

- Concurrent administration with agents that slow cardiac conduction can further potentiate adverse effects like AV block or bradycardia.

- Diltiazem-associated photo-distributed hyperpigmentation has been described in case reports.

- Drug-Drug Interactions: Beta-blockers and diltiazem interaction may lead to bradyarrhythmias.
