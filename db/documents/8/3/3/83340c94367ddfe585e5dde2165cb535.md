Parasympathomimetic agents can exacerbate symptoms of COPD, asthma, and peptic ulcer disease in susceptible individuals. Caution is necessary when prescribing these drugs to patients with cardiovascular disease, as they can cause bradycardia and hypotension, which may compromise coronary blood flow.Â Parasympathomimetics are contraindicated in patients with hyperthyroidism, as they can precipitate atrial fibrillation in these individuals.
