The well-vascularized flap created by the deep-plane dissection provides increased protection against the potential problems associated with rhytidectomy; however, the following complications may occur

- Hematoma formation: occurs in less than 2% of cases; must be addressed promptly to prevent flap necrosis.

- Infections: occurs in less than 1% of cases

- Skin slough: occurs in less than 3% of cases; most commonly in the post-auricular location.

- Facial nerve injury: occurs in less than 1% of cases (similar for standard facelifts)

- Great auricular nervy injury: occurs in up to 7% of cases (most commonly injured nerve); causes lobule numbness

- Pixie-ear deformity: caused by excessive tension on the lobule during skin inset

- Alopecia: may be prevented with beveled hairline incisions and avoidance of cautery near the hairline

- First bite syndrome: uncommon, but may result from injury to symathetic nerve fibers in and around the parotid gland
