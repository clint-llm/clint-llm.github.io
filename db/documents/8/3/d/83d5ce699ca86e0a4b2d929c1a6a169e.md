The adult mammalian heart is comprised of many cell types. These include cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and perivascular cells. Of these, the cardiomyocytes occupy a significant volume of the heart.

Pacemaker cells are highly specialized myocardial cells with an intrinsic ability to depolarize rhythmically and initiate an action potential.

**Conduction system**: The SA node is located superiorly in the right atrium near the opening of the superior vena cava. From the SA node, the depolarization current spread through the right atrium via gap junctions and also passes to the left atrium via Bachmann's bundle. From the SA node, the impulse pass to the AV node through the internodal fibers. The AV node's location is also in the right atrium but inferiorly at the interatrial septum. The atria and the ventricles are isolated electrically, and the electrical impulses can only pass from the atria to the ventricles via the AV node. AV node conduction is characterized by a conduction delay, which ensures that ventricular contraction occurs after the atria empty its blood into the ventricles. From the AV node, a depolarization wave passes through the bundle of His, located in the interventricular septum. From here passing via the two bundle branches and Purkinje fibers, the action potential reaches the ventricular cardiomyocytes.
