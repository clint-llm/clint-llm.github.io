Bronchial asthma (BA) is considered the most common chronic disease in pregnancy, complicating 4% to 8% of pregnancies. Bronchial asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by increased responsiveness of the tracheobronchial tree to many different stimuli. Asthma is episodic, characterized by acute exacerbations and in between symptom-free periods. Most asthma attacks are short-lived. Bronchial asthma exacerbation in pregnancy represents a major clinical problem that can lead to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality in pregnant patients with asthma. The percentage of women hospitalized for asthma exacerbation during pregnancy was 5.8% in a previous study.
