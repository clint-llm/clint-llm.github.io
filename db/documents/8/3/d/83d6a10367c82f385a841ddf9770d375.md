The pulmonary system exists on the most basic level to facilitate gas exchange from environmental air into the circulatory system. We breathe in oxygen, which diffuses into the blood for systemic circulation and ultimately produces ATP for use as energy on a cellular level, and we breathe out Carbon dioxide along with other metabolic byproducts from the body.  This process is facilitated by the respiratory tract organs, which include the nose, throat, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs. The lungs are further divided into five separate lobes, two on the left and three on the right. Each lobe is made up of small sacks of air called alveoli. There are approximately 300 million alveoli in healthy lungs. It is at the surface of alveoli where diffusion from air into pulmonary arterioles occurs.
