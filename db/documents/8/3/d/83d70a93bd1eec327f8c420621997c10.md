The prognosis of abnormal labor varies by which stage is abnormal. With an abnormal first-stage latent phase, intervention with amniotomy and oxytocin can be helpful and allow for normal progression of the remainder of labor. These same strategies may be utilized with abnormalities in the active phase of the first stage of labor. With an abnormal second stage of labor, again, oxytocin may be utilized. Operative vaginal delivery may also expedite the abnormal labor process in certain situations. Cesarean delivery may be indicated with abnormal labor in the first and second stages, based on recommended criteria. Modern methods to prevent injury, blood loss, and infection during cesarean delivery result in a good prognosis when operative delivery is necessitated.
