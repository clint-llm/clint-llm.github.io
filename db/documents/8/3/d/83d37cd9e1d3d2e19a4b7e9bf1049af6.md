The mainstay treatment strategy for seizures is medication management. However, much like the prescription of any other pharmaceutical agent, a clinician must balance efficacy with adverse events, while considering cost, drug interactions, patient preference, and availability. This article is intended to provide a general overview of seizure medications and the current knowledge base for optimal utilization.

The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the American Epilepsy Society offered recent guidelines on the initiation of seizure medications after a first unprovoked seizure in an adult. The focus is predominantly on an individualized approach, with patient autonomy at the forefront. Before making any decisions, factors that may increase risk should be identified and include abnormal brain imaging, abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG), and the presence of nocturnal seizures. Patients should understand that the risk of seizure recurrence is greatest within the first 2 years (21% to 45%) and that this risk may be mitigated with the initiation of medications. However, adverse events of anti-seizure medications, though most frequently mild and reversible, should be reviewed and discussed in detail.

Of note, certain seizure medications have been used off-label for a variety of other indications, including but not limited to:

- Anxiolytics: Pregabalin, clonazepam, clobazam

- Migraine relief: Zonisamide, valproic acid, topiramate

- Mood stabilizer: Valproic Acid, lamotrigine, carbamazepine

- Neuropathic pain relief: Pregabalin, gabapentin, carbamazepine

- Weight loss: Zonisamide, topiramate

- Antiparkinsonian agent: Zonisamide
