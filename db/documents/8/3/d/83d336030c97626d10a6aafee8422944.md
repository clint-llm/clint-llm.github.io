Approximately one-half billion people currently suffer from disabling hearing loss, and it is also the fourth leading contributor to disability worldwide.

Hearing loss significantly impacts patients' lives in many aspects, including education barriers, workplace barriers, and communication barriers that can lead to social isolation and depression. Recently, research has also revealed that hearing loss is an independent risk factor for developing cognitive decline, including dementia.

Hearing rehabilitation for many patients may be achieved by traditional hearing aids; however, limitations exist in some patients.Â Thus, implantable hearing devices are alternative treatments in patients with hearing loss who do not obtain adequate benefits from traditional hearing aids. Implantable hearing devices provide treatment options for patients who previously received little benefit from hearing aids.
