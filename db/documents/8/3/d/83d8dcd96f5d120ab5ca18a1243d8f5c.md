- More complications occur after intrinsic tendon transfers than adductor-plasty because of the unique balance of the extensor hood mechanism.

- The transfer may not be suitableÂ if the chosen muscle has insufficient strength or excursion. Elongation is also a problem with sewing the transfer into the lateral bands of the extensor hood.

- Tendon transfers that are not strong enough can be treated with a therapy program to strengthen the muscle but often require surgical revision.

- The transfer may also not be suitable if the chosen muscle has too much strength or too short of the excursion. When the transfer is sewn too tightly into the lateral band, it can produce a swan-neck deformity of the digit.

- Tendon transfers that are too tight or too strong can be treated with a passive range of motion therapy to allow stretching to occur.
