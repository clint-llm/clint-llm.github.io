When the lung is biopsied, the histological analysis will reveal a tumor arising from the bronchial glands. Mucus production is also quite evident. The new World Health Organization (WHO) classification subclassifies adenocarcinomas as arising from the following:

- Acinar

- Papillary

- Bronchoalveolar

- Mucus-secreting

Except for Stage 1 lung cancer, adenocarcinoma carries a much worse prognosis than squamous cell cancer.
