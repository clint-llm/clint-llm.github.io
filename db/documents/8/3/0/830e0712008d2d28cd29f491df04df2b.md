On the sagittal cross-section of the female pelvis, the urinary bladder sits most anterior just behind the pubic bone. Moving posteriorly lies the uterus, which lays on top of the urinary bladder. The long axis of the uterus is perpendicular to the long axis of the vagina and where these two lines meet is the location of the cervix. There is a potential space just posterior to the uterus known as the pouch of Douglas (rectouterine pouch or cul-de-sac) that is separate from the uterus by the rectouterine septum. The pouch of Douglas is where blood can potentially pool if there is bleeding within the peritoneal cavity. Behind the pouch of Douglas is the rectum.
