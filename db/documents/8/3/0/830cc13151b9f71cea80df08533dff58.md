The mandibular nerve has an important role in the field ofÂ oral maxillofacial surgery and anesthesia. Major surgical concerns include the location of the infratemporal fossa where mandibular nerve compression is common. The infratemporal fossa is one most difficult regions to access surgically. In anesthesia, variations of the inferior alveolar nerve are of concern for surgical and dental practice. Case reports describe anatomical variations of inferior alveolar nerve mimicking a recurrence of keratocystic odontogenic tumors.

Both sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic nerve fibers travel with different trigeminal nerve branches to reach their target organs and tissues.
