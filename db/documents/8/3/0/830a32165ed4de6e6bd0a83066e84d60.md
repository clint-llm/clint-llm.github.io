The complications of RN are well known but poorly defined because of their insidious onset and slow progression.

- Early growth retardation is observed from recurrent cystitis and pyelonephritis in children affected with VUR and later on with RN. Increased maternal complications are noted.

- Suddenly-accelerated hypertension with associated renal impairment during pregnancy

- Fetal morbidity in women with reflux with renal scarring

Patients with RN will develop hypertension, proteinuria, urine concentration defects, hyperkalemia, acidosis (type 1 renal tubular acidosis), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Progressive CKD can lead to end-stage renal failure. CKD from RN leads to increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.
