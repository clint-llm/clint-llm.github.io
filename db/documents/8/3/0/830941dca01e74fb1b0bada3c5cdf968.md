Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are among the most common rheumatic diseases. These chronic progressive inflammatory diseases lead to a reduction in physical fitness and increase in joint degeneration. Although very closely related, their symptomatology and etiology are different. This activity identifies factors that distinguish rheumatoid arthritis from ankylosing spondylitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Explain how to differentiate rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in a patient with small joint pain. Use data available for this differentiation. 
- Describe the similarities as well as differences between rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. 
- Outline management strategies for rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Different approaches and different medication available for this purpose. Recognize the use of non-pharmacological modalities for management. 
- Review interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication amongst interprofessional team members and improve outcomes for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.
