The fascia plays a key role in dividing and attaching muscles in the foot. The relationship of the fascia with the muscles can be further described by the compartment they are in.

- Medial compartment: The medial plantar fascia overlies the abductor hallucis, flexor hallucis brevis, and the flexor hallucis longus tendon.

- Central compartment: The central plantar fascia overlies the flexor digitorum brevis, the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus, the tendons and musculature of the flexor digitorum longus, the quadratus plantae, the lumbricals, and the adductor hallucis.

- Lateral compartment: The lateral plantar fascia overlies the abductor and flexor digiti minimi brevis.

- Interosseous compartment: The plantar and dorsal interosseous fascias border the interosseous muscles.

- Dorsal compartment: The dorsal fascia overlies the extensors hallucis brevis and extensor digitorum brevis.
