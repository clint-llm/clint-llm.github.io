Complications in neonates with pulmonary hypoplasia include acute respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, persistent pulmonary hypertension, and pneumothorax. Pneumothorax could be either spontaneous or secondary to mechanical ventilation. Long term complications in survivors of pulmonary hypoplasia include growth retardation, chronic lung disease, recurrent respiratory infections, low exercise capacity, and chest wall deformity like scoliosis.
