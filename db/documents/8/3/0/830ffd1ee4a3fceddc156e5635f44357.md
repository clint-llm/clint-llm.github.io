Pseudoexfoliation syndrome is a chronic, age-related disorder of the extracellular matrix that results in the deposition of abnormal fibrillary (pseudoexfoliative) material within various body tissues. This condition manifests primarily in the anterior segment of the eye. Individuals with this condition can develop pseudoexfoliation glaucoma in the presence of chronic elevated intraocular pressure, glaucomatous optic neuropathy, and visual field damage. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of pseudoexfoliation syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for developing pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX) and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PEG).
- Describe the clinical features of PEX and PEG.
- Explain the risks associated with cataract surgery in PEX and PEG.
- Summarize the management and follow-up of patients diagnosed with PEX and PEG.
