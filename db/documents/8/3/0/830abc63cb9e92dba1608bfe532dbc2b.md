As many as 20% of Lisfranc injuries are missed on initial presentation to the emergency department. Lisfranc injuries in athletes have been classified according to the American Medical Association’s Standard Nomenclature of Athletic Injuries. First-degree and second-degree sprains have been classified as partial ligament tears with swelling, focal pain, no instability, and normal radiographs. Instability and diastasis greater than 2 mm between the first and second metatarsals, as seen on anteroposterior radiographs, is consistent with a third-degree sprain. Post-traumatic arthrosis is a very common complication of Lisfranc joint injury associated with higher injury mechanism and purely ligamentous dislocations.
