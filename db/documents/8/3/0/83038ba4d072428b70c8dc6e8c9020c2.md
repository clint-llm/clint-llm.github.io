**Bacterial**

**Staphylococcus Aureus**

Staphylococcus is the most common bacteria on the ocular surface and is an aerobic gram-positive organism with low virulence. It can also enter the after penetrating through an exogenous source. The organism is also commonly seen in the aspirate cultured from lens abscess.

**Staphylococcus Epidermidis**

Staphylococcus epidermidis is also an aerobic, gram-positive bacteria with low virulence. It is commonly seen as a commensal in the eyes or can be associated with postoperative endophthalmitis. The organism has also been cultured from lens aspirate of lens abscess. There can also be a delayed manifestation of postoperative infection because steroids and antibiotics usually mask the initial response. As per previous reports, the microorganism can adhere to the plastic surface of the intraocular lens by producing a glycocalyx polysaccharide which acts as a glue.

**Propionibacterium Acne**

Propionibacterium acne is commonly seen on the skin and conjunctiva and generally can be considered a contaminant of the ocular surface. The microorganism is an anaerobic, Gram-positive rod, which can also result in a mixed eye infection. The organism is sensitive to penicillin, less sensitive to cephalosporins, and resistant to gentamicin and vancomycin. The microorganism has also been reported commonly from lens abscess, postoperative endophthalmitis after trabeculectomy, and keratoplasty. It also invites the development of phacoantigenic uveitis.

**Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia**

This microorganism has also been reported in cases with lens abscesses.

**Paecilomyces Lilacinus**

This is one of the rare species reported in lens abscesses.

**Streptococcus Pneumoniae (Pneumococcus)**

Pneumococcus causes ulcus serpans and has also been cultured in cases with lens abscesses.

**Pseudomonas Aeruginosa**

This is another species reported from lens abscess.
