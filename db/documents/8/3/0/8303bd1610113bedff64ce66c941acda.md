Patients generally receive lifelong intramuscular (IM) injections of vitamin B12 (typically at a dose of 1000 mcg per month). Initially, the injections are given daily or every other day for a week. The injections are then reduced in frequency to every week for 1 to 2 months. Life-long maintenance therapy with once-monthly injections is provided thereafter. Some patients may be able to take high-dose oral therapy for maintenance. A 1000 to 2000 mcg/day has been demonstrated to be effective, although recommendations are to always use the parenteral route in severe neurological manifestations. Some patients may opt for self-administration of IM injections during the maintenance phase.
