To understand the Weber test, one has to understand the basic anatomy of hearing.

The ear anatomically consists of the sound-conducting system (outer and middle ear) and the sound-transducing system (the cochlea).

- The outer ear: Pinna and external ear canal

- The middle ear: Tympanic membrane, ossicular chain (malleus, incus, stapes), and middle ear space

- The inner ear: Cochlea (organ of hearing), vestibular labyrinth (organ of balance)

The purpose of the outer ear is to direct sounds onto the tympanic membrane. The sound vibrations are then transmitted through the middle ear via the ossicular chain before reaching the cochlea. The cochlea plays a vital role in transducing these vibrations into nerve impulses via the auditory nerve (vestibulocochlear nerve), which is then delivered along the central pathways to the auditory cortex, where it is processed and perceived as sound. This pathway is termed air conduction. However, sound can also be transmitted via bone conduction, where vibrations are transmitted via the skull and delivered directly to the cochlea, buried within the temporal bone.

Hearing loss may occur due to interruption at any point along these pathways.

The Weber test, along with its paired Rinne test, is commonly used to distinguish the site and likely cause of hearing loss. Conductive hearing loss is due to problems with the sound-conducting system, while sensorineural hearing loss is due to problems with the sound-transducing system, the auditory nerve, or its central pathways. Occasionally, one can get a mixed hearing loss, which is a combination of the two types of hearing loss.
