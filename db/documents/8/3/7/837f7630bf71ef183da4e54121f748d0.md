Initially, GLP-1 RA was manufactured as injectable medications due to their poor oral bioavailability. The once-daily injections are liraglutide and lixisenatide, while dulaglutide and semaglutide are once weekly. Exenatide has both a twice-daily formulation as well as an extended-release (ER) once-weekly injection. In 2019, an oral semaglutide tablet became available in dosages of 3 mg, 7 mg, and 14 mg.

Missed dose instructions vary among the once-weekly formulations. Exenatide extended-release and dulaglutide can be taken as soon as the patient remembers as long as the next scheduled dose is at least three days later. Conversely, semaglutide can be taken as long as it is within five days of the missed dose. If outside these parameters, the patient should be instructed to skip the dose entirely and continue with the next regularly scheduled dosing day.

Short-acting exenatide and lixisenatide should be given within 60 minutes of meals, whereas all others can be given without regard to meals.Â The oral semaglutide tablet should be taken 30 minutes before any food, oral medication, or beverage, with 4 ounces of water. If taken with any other oral medication, it may alter the absorption of the oral semaglutide.
