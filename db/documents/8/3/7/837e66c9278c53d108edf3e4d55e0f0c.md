Patients presenting with sciatica and no other evidence of CES/CMS in the history or exam should receive counsel on the possible development of other related symptoms such as bladder or bowel dysfunction, impotence, and saddle anesthesia. These patients must be given strict return precautions in the event they develop other symptoms pointing to CES/CMS. Patients who are suspected to have CES/CMS and are undergoing evaluation for these syndromes need to remain informed and updated on their investigations (MRI, bladder scan, etc.) and pending surgical consultations. Patients who receive a definitive diagnosis need counseling on complication rates and must receive a realistic prognosis based on their degree of injury. Due to the nature of sensitive lifelong sequelae resulting from these syndromes, cases with CES/CMS have a high involvement in medicolegal litigation.
