Cetirizine is contraindicated in anyone with a known hypersensitivity to it or any of its ingredients. Cetirizine is also contraindicated in anyone with a known hypersensitivity to hydroxyzine, as cetirizine is a metabolite of hydroxyzine.

There are few well-controlled human studies on cetirizine in pregnant mothers, although these showed it to be safe during pregnancy in animal studies. First-generation antihistamines, diphenhydramine, and doxylamine are safest to use during pregnancy.Â However, first-generation antihistamines are more likely than second-generation antihistamines to cause somnolence; clinicians should counsel the patients regarding the potential adverse effects of the medication they choose to take during pregnancy.
