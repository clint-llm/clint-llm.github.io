Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GP IIb/IIIa) inhibitors prevent platelet aggregation by blocking glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors on their platelet's plasma membrane and inhibiting fibrinogen binding. The available GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors include tirofiban and eptifibatide. These agents, along with aspirin, are used in patients with unstable angina with PCI within 24 hours.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risks associated with initiating intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and identify the critical patient counseling points.
- Describe the mechanism of action and outline the administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. 
- Identify the adverse events of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. 
- Outline the measures to enhance the outcomes of the health care team when taking care of patients receiving anticoagulation with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors.
