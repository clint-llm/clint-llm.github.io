Complications caused by an intestinal perforation can be related to the disease process that caused it or the treatments that are enlisted. Perforation and subsequent leakage of intestinal contents can lead to peritonitis and eventually sepsis if left untreated. Adequate resuscitation and antibiotic initiation early on are important to decrease the physiologic detriment of the infection.

If necessary for control of leakage, surgery can be undertaken, and it is important to discuss potential complications of surgery with patients and their families. Risks of infection, bleeding, potential anastomotic leakage, hernia formation exist. Other risks of pulmonary complications, thromboembolic events, cardiovascular events, and possible prolonged need for ventilator support must also be discussed as well as expected recovery and possible level of function.
