It has been proposed that OAVS develops due to abnormal development of the derivatives of first and second pharyngeal arches. These pharyngeal arches made up of mesenchymal cells, develop at four weeks of gestation.

Their derivatives include neural, muscular, and skeletal elements. Formation and ventrolateral migration of cranial neural crest cells are responsible for the development of craniofacial regions. Any defect in the formation, migration, proliferation, and survival of these neural crest cells is also considered an important mechanism of OAVS. Few authors have also proposed that vascular disruption leading to hematoma in the region of the ear and jaw during embryogenesis can also contribute to this spectrum.

However, this does not explain multisystemic involvement. Another theory proposed by Lam et al. suggested that a subgroup of OAVS may be an ectodermal disorder of nondisjunction involving the otic placode leading to mesodermal disarray similar to occult spinal dysraphism (occult dysraphic syndrome, closed spinal dysraphism, or spina bifida occulta) that involves the embryonic neuraxis. OAVS may also be considered an otological disorder along with the abnormal pharyngeal arch sequence and not a true branchial arch dysplasia.
