The alveoli are the smallest lung units where oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange take place. Under decreasing pressure and expanding volume, the alveoli will rupture along with their surrounding blood vessels. The alveoli will be flooded with blood and debris and will collapse. Alveoli are located centrally and peripherally. Depending on the location of the ruptured collapsed alveoli, air will leak out. Generally, air travels to five areas in the body.
