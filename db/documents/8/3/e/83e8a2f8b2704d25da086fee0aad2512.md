Based on the acuity of presentation, mitral regurgitation can be acute or chronic. However, acute MR has a very specific set of etiological reasons such as rupture of the chord/papillary muscle from trauma or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), or infective endocarditis (IE) leading to leaflet perforation or rupture of the chords.

In the chronic MR, causative mechanisms can be related to the valvular apparatus itself, causing primary (degenerative/organic) MR versus related to structural changes in LV geometry leading to secondary (functional) MR. Most of the intrinsic abnormalities in the valve arising from local/systemic infection, inflammation, excess growth of the tissue, drug or radiation-induced damage, and calcific degeneration lead to primary MR.

In secondary MR, the basic structure of the mitral valve is preserved, but dilatation of LV cavity from various reasons including ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies, increased annular diameter, tethering of papillary muscle, migration of papillary muscles due to structural remodeling of LV, lead to failure of coaptation of mitral leaflets.
