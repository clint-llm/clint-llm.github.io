Acquired reversible autistic syndrome in acute encephalopathic illness in children, immune-mediated chorea encephalopathy syndrome in childhood, acute diffuse lymphocytic meningoencephalitis, acute reversible limbic encephalitis, acute juvenile non-herpetic encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), inborn errors of metabolism (including urea cycle disorders), environmental toxins and medication overdose, rheumatological conditions such as neuropsychiatric lupus and primary psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia.
