Didanosine, a concentration-dependent drug at high doses, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of bone marrow progenitor cells. Its myelosuppressive effect is reversible by the administration of erythropoietin.

Mitochondrial toxicity, induced by the inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase due to ddI, can cause severe metabolic dysfunctions usually associated with inherited mitochondrial disease, most commonly presented as hepatic steatosis, lactic acidosis, and nephrotoxicity.

Intra-ocular toxicity, which presented as peripheral chorioretinal atrophy from ddI administration, has been reported in children under age 2.
