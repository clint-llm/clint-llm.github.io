Radial nerve anesthesia rests upon disrupting impulse conduction in the nerve with drugs such as local anesthetics that can be given locally to block specific nerves and can be reversed as needed. Disrupting nerve impulse conduction can be done in any region of the body where nerves are easily accessible for visualization and injection. A radial nerve block will provide anesthesia and/or analgesia to the hand, specifically the dorsal radial side. This includes anesthesia dorsally to the thumb, index and middle fingers, and the lateral aspect of the ring finger.
