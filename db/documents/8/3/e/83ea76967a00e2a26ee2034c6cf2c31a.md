The femoral nerve is among the largest branches of the lumbar plexus. The femoral nerve arises from the ventral rami of the L2, L3, and L4 spinal nerves, and enters the femoral triangle inferior to the inguinal ligament. The femoral nerve is the most lateral of the structures within the triangle, which also contains the femoral artery and femoral vein at its medial end.

The femoral nerve splits into anterior and posterior divisions that originate near the level of the circumflex artery. The anterior division gives rise to the medial femoral cutaneous nerve and innervates the sartorius muscle. The posterior division gives rise to the saphenous nerve and provides innervation to quadriceps femoris muscle.

In addition to motor innervation, the femoral nerve provides sensation to the anterior thigh and knee and the medial lower extremity below the knee. The saphenous nerve is a femoral nerve branch that is directly responsible for sensation to the medial lower leg and foot. The saphenous nerve can be blocked separately at the level of the adductor canal, and several more distal sites. The adductor canal is a musculoaponeurotic tunnel found in the mid-thigh and extends from the femoral triangle to the adductor magnus.
