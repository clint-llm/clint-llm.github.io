Deteriorating signs in the context of reperfusion in a patient admitted not too long ago will not yield many differentials. Bleeding from a tumor, arterial-venous malformations, infections, subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematomas, meningitis can be considered in the differential and should be carefully ruled out based on findings, history, and evaluation in the context of the reperfusion but are unlikely.
