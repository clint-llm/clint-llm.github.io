The most common patient presentation is a younger female or male with risk factors. Female risk factors include pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, or infection. Male risk factors include a history of hypercoagulable state, genetic or acquired. The patient will complain of new-onset headaches, seizures, or focal neurological deficits. One study found that papilledema and increased intracranial pressure were not common findings in ICVT.

The absence of increased intracranial pressure with focal or generalized seizures associated with aphasia, hemiparesis, hemianopia, and other focal neurological abnormalities should prompt physicians to consider ICVT as a diagnosis.

In patients with a past medical history of headaches or migraines with auras, it is important to compare the headache's features with the previous presentations to determine a significant difference.Â Any new-onset headache with characteristics that differ from their previous headache pattern, new-onset seizures, rapid encephalopathy, or focal neurological symptoms that do not fit typical patterns of stroke should warrant further evaluation.ICVT should be considered in the setting of motor and sensory deficits with a new-onset headache.
