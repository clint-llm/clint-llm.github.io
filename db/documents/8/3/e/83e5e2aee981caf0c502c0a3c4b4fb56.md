Monitor lipid profile, liver function tests, creatine kinase (CK), and thyroid function tests in individuals who start statin treatment:

- **Lipid profile:**Perform a lipid profile at baseline before initiating statins. The lipid panel should be repeated two months after starting the therapy. If the concentration of LDL-C reduction is less than expected in an individual adherent to medication, then increase the dose of statin or change to another potent statin medication and repeat lipid profile after two months. If the concentration of LDL-C is within the expected range, repeat the lipid profile every 6 to 12 months.

- **Liver function tests:**Perform liver function tests at baseline before initiating statins. Routine monitoring of LFTs is not a recommendation. LFTs require rechecking when the patient develops symptoms of liver disease.

- **Creatine kinase (CK):**CK levels are optionally obtainable at baseline before initiating statins. Routine monitoring of CK is not a recommendation.

- **Thyroid function tests:**Hypothyroidism can cause abnormal lipid profile and myopathy. Recommendations are to obtain thyroid hormone levels before starting statin therapy.
