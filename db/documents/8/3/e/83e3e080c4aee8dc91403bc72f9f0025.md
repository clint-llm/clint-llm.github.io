Overall, cirrhosis is associated with an unfavorable prognosis, which worsens with the development of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. The presence of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) and a Child-Pugh score above 8 is associated with a poorer prognosis. In one study, one-year survival in patients with cirrhosis without LVDD was 95%, which decreased to 79% and 39% with grade I and grade II LVDD, respectively. While definitive treatment for CCM is liver transplantation, up to a quarter of patients with cirrhosis will experience postoperative cardiovascular complications, with 7% to 21% total mortality following liver transplantation attributable to cardiovascular causes.
