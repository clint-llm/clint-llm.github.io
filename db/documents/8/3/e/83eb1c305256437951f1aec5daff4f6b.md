With proper treatment for rat-bite fever, the prognosis is good. Without treatment, the infection may resolve on its own, although it may take up to a year to do so. If untreated, streptobacillary rat-bite fever can result in Endocarditis, spread to spinal cord, brain, and lungs. Endocarditis carries the highest mortality as it is often mistaken for rheumatic valvular heart disease, resulting in a delay with appropriate antibiotics.
