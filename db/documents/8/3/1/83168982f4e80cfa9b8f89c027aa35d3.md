an interprofessional team of ophthalmic surgeons, nurses, optometrists, and technicians may be involved in the preoperative evaluation, surgery, and postoperative management of patients who undergo PRK. Ensuring appropriate patient selection per FDA and AAO guidelines and maintaining adequate follow-up is essential for maximizing long-term visual outcomes and patient satisfaction. Nurses have to make sure that patient consent is signed. If surgery is being done on one eye, the eye should be marked by the nurse prior to surgery. The nurse will also assist during the procedure and provide post-operative care, reporting all status changes to the surgeon. Before any anesthesia, a timeout should be called to verify the patient ID, name, and location of the surgery. All members of the team should be aware of clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of major postoperative complications, and prompt referral to a cornea specialist is warranted should any of these complications arise. Close communication between members of the interprofessional team is vital if one wants to improve outcomes.[Level 5]
