Breast pain is a major symptom for which a patient seeks medical attention either out of the fear of having underlying breast cancer or due to its adverse effects on the daily activities of life. However, only 30% of females having breast pain present themselves for medical review. Thus it is important to advise females with breast pain to seek medical assistance so that a thorough history and physical examination is being done and if needed imaging modalities are also being institutionalized in order to make a correct and accurate diagnosis on a timely basis. This will not only help to reduce undue anxiety and pain episodes in patients but will also improve the quality of life and will further provide an opportunity for the patient to get herself educated about her own body.

The strengthening of the patient-physician relationship with open communication will even provide an opportunity for the health caregiver to make females understand the nature of their disease, and consideration of the conservative approach of management with the use of social support, acetaminophen, and NSAID along with the discussion of risks and benefits with the use of pharmacological therapy.

Patients should be educated about the alarm signs and self-breast examination techniques should be taught so that a meticulous watch is kept by the patient and any suspicious finding should immediately be reported and accessed.
