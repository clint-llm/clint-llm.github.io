Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is a hereditary autosomal dominant disease affecting several organ systems. The disease is characterized by the growth of cysts and/or tumors. Tumors can either be benign or malignant. The most characteristic type of tumor in VHL is hemangioblastoma, which is a benign tumor made of newly formed blood vessels. Hemangioblastomas develop in the central nervous system (CNS) and retina and can cause complications, including ataxia and vision loss. Cysts are also a very common manifestation of VHL and occur in the kidneys, pancreas, and genital tract. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are also seen with VHL. Endolymphatic sac tumors found in the inner ear can be seen in patients with VHL.

The hemangiomas are found in close to 50% of patients with VHL and can occur in any part of the retina. These hemangiomas may leak serum, leading to fibroglial bands forming that can cause retinal detachment and vitreous hemorrhage. The result is the development of glaucoma and/or permanent vision loss.

VHL can be classified as follows:

- Type 1 (without pheochromocytoma)

- Type 2 (with pheochromocytoma). Type 2 is further classified as:

- Type 2A: Pheochromocytoma is present along with CNS hemangioblastomas but no RCC.

- Type 2B: Pheochromocytoma is present along with both CNS hemangioblastomas and RCC.

- Type 2C: Pheochromocytoma is present without hemangioblastomas or RCC.
