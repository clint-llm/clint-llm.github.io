**Anatomical Distribution**

Different brain areas contain different opioid peptide-producing neurons. Enkephalins-producing neurons are found in multiple brain regions. Enkephalins are involved in the regulation of several biological processes in different organs, including the cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory system, and pain perception.

Emotional responses are regulated by their action on the limbic system, mainly the amygdala. Other areas with a high concentration of enkephalinergic neurons include the hypothalamus and basal ganglia, particularly globus pallidus. Their respiratory and cardiovascular effects are mediated by their action on the autonomic nuclei of theÂ hypothalamus.

These findings further enhance their neuroendocrine roles. Neurons containing beta-endorphins are predominantly found in the anterior and intermediate lobe of the pituitary and brain stem (the nucleus of tractus solitarius).
