Corticobulbar tract carries upper motor neuron input to motor nuclei of trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory, and hypoglossal nerves. The motor component of trigeminal nerves supplies muscles of mastication. The facial nerve supplies the muscles of facial expression. Glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory nerve innervates muscles of the pharynx, muscles of larynx, sternocleidomastoid, and trapezius muscle. Tongue muscles receive fibers from the hypoglossal nerve.

The corticobulbar tract indirectly affects muscles supplied by third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve through medial longitudinal fasciculus and paramedian part of the pontine formation.
