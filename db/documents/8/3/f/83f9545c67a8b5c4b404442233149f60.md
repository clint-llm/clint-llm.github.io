The etiology of epiphora is divided into:

- Reflex tearing: secondary to inflammation, allergy, ocular surface disorders, trichiasis, foreign bodies, trauma, and dry eye.

- Reduced tear outflow may be caused by many factors, including lid malposition (ectropion, retraction), eyelid laxity, facial nerve palsy causing tear pump dysfunction, or obstruction of the excretory component of the lacrimal system as seen in canalicular obstruction, nasolacrimal duct obstruction, punctal occlusion, plugs in tear ducts, and congenital maldevelopment of the nasolacrimal duct.

- Hypersecretion of tears: primary hypersecretion of the lacrimal gland is very rarely seen. The commonest type of hypersecretion of tears is seen with aberrant nerve regeneration after facial nerve palsy.

Epiphora in adults is a nonspecific finding, representing a broad array of diseases that can cause excessive basal tearing or excessive reflexive tearing secondary to decreased basal tearing. Frequently, more than one factor may cause epiphora. Patients will frequently complain that their eyes tear when they are in the wind or cold: this type of tearing can be seen in normal eyes, in the presence of keratitis sicca, or partial nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Tearing that occurs when indoors is often caused by lower eyelid malposition or nasolacrimal outflow obstruction. In general, older patients are likely to have more eyelid malposition and multiple factors as causes of the epiphora. In younger patients, eyelid malposition is less common: nasolacrimal duct obstruction punctal stenosis or canalicular obstruction is more common. Nasolacrimal duct obstruction affects women more than males (65% to 73%).

Epiphora may be unilateral or bilateral. Unilateral epiphora is more likely to be caused by local conditions (nasolacrimal duct obstruction, foreign body). 75% of cases of nasolacrimal duct have unilateral obstruction. Bilateral epiphora may be caused by oversecretion of tears, as seen in keratoconjunctivitis or allergies. Eyelid malpositions are also more often seen in patients with bilateral epiphora. Bilateral epiphora can also be caused by local conditions, which may result in more epiphora on one side.
