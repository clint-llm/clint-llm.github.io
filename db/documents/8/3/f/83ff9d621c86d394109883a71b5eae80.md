Postpartum blues involve mood changes that are typically mild, transient, and self-limited. However, a diagnosis of postpartum blues can predispose an individual to postpartum depression or postpartum anxiety disorders. According to the DSM-5, the risk of postpartum depression developing in an individual with “baby blues” significantly increases in those who had mood or anxiety symptoms during pregnancy.
