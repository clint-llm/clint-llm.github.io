**Screening**

It is recommended to screen adults for one or more of the following risk factors:

- Chronic kidney disease

- Diabetes

- Hypertension

- Obesity

Screening is recommended because early recognition and management are associated with better outcomes regarding reduced morbidity and mortality.
