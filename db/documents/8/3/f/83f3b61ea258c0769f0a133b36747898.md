The most important differential diagnosis is vocal cord paralysis due to recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis. Laryngeal electromyography is an important diagnostic test to differentiate between arytenoid subluxation and recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis. Further, it may offer some prognostic information regarding potential vocal fold paralysis recovery.

It may have some limitations since a transient paresis may be present with both a subluxation or a hematoma.
