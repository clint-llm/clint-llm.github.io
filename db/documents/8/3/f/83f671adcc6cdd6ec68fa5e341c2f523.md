In one study, post-cricoidectomy epithelial cells from patients suffering from LPR were examined and shown to contain pepsin, while the control group cells did not.Â Even when the pH of the refluxate is neutral, inactivated pepsin at pH 7 is taken into cells and subsequently reactivated, causing mitochondrial and overall cell damage.
