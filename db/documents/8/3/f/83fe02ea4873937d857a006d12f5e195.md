A standard plastic surgery tray or large soft-tissue tray should be opened. In large-volume panniculectomy, a body-contouring retractor system may be employed. These systems consist of rigid tubular frames secured to the operative bed and provide a bar or ring above the patient from which massive panniculus can be suspended with specialized retractors or hooks to facilitate exposure and allow for the design of tension-free flaps and excision lines.

Monopolar diathermy is essential, and bipolar cautery can also be useful for cauterizing smaller perforator vessels.
