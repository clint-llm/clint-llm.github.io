Atypical organisms such as M. pneumoniae, which is the most common, lack cell walls; therefore, beta-lactam antibiotics are not recommended. One does not have to perform blood cultures before initiating treatment. However, sputum should be obtained for gram stain and culture. In hospitalized patients, antibiotics should be started within 4 hours.

First-line treatment is the macrolide family of antibiotics, although resistance is emerging. Azithromycin is the most common and is available in intravenous and oral formulations; the short treatment course of just 5 days increases patient compliance. Alternate outpatient antibiotics include fluoroquinolone and tetracycline. These are frequently utilized in older or more toxic-appearing individuals when more pyogenic organisms are also considered. In patients requiring hospital admission for presumed community-acquired pneumonia, a broadened approach is frequently utilized, and a beta-lactam such as ceftriaxone is added to azithromycin.

Clinician tools such as the CURB 65 score and the pneumonia severity index are frequently utilized to determine if outpatient or inpatient medical treatment is most appropriate.

Treatment failures are not uncommon due to antibiotic resistance, poor compliance and inability to tolerate oral medications. In addition, some patients may have obstructing lung lesions or an incorrect diagnosis.

Close to 50-60% of patients may have a parapneumonic effusion on the chest x-ray. If this fluid does not resolve, empyema is common. Aspiration and drainage of the fluid are highly recommended if the pH is less than 7.2.

In children less than 5, atypical pathogens are not common but if suspected the treatment is amoxicillin for 7-14 days. Macrolides are recommended for children more than 5 years old. Children who develop atypical pneumonia are more likely to need hospitalization and often require parenteral therapy as well as oxygen supplementation.

Elderly patients with atypical pneumonia often have altered mental signs and another comorbidity which also increase the risk for aspiration. These individuals should also be covered for anaerobes.
