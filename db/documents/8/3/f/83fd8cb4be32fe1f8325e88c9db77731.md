Iris cysts are uncommon lesions. There is no population-based study available to estimate the prevalence or incidence of these lesions. The largest case series of 3,690 iris lesions managed at a single center by Shields et al. showed 21% of them were cystic.

Secondary cysts are more common than primary cysts. The secondary cysts are more common in males, which is likely linked to trauma and implantation cysts.
