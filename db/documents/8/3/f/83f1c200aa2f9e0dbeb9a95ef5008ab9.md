Clinically, unicentric Castleman disease presents as a slow-growing, non-malignant painless solitary mass manifesting at a single anatomic site that is generally asymptomatic at first but starts producing symptoms when the surrounding structures are compressed due to its growing size.

In contrast, multicentric CD occurs at multiple sites and is characterized by a proinflammatory response giving rise to the so-called B symptoms, including fever, night sweats, malaise, and weight loss. Exaggerated effects of elevated serum IL-6 levels cause various symptoms, including lymph node enlargement, hepatosplenomegaly, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia- owing to its growth and differentiation factors for both plasma and lymphocytes. Elevated fibrinogen levels cause deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolic disorders, high hepcidin levels cause anemia, increased VEGF levels result in angiogenesis and vascular permeability, which along with hypoalbuminemia induces edema, ascites, pleural and pericardial effusions, or even generalized anasarca.

In extreme cases of iMCD, multiple organ failure with renal insufficiency can ensue, often resulting in death.
