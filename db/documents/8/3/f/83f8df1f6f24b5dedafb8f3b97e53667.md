Subclavian artery stenosis is asymptomatic in most patients. It is sometimes incidentally found when there is a blood pressure difference between the arms or on ultrasound testing of patients with coronary or carotid artery disease.

- It can be symptomatic in some patients and can present as arm pain, fatigue, numbness, or paresthesias. These symptoms are secondary to upper extremity ischemia during vigorous exercise.

- It can also present as a variety of neurological symptoms secondary to vertebrobasilar insufficiency. These symptoms include dizziness, blurring of vision, syncope, vertigo, disequilibrium, ataxia, tinnitus, or hearing loss. The neurological symptoms can be precipitated by upper extremity exercise as well as with head movements, with the rotation of face toward the opposite side. A detailed history can help in diagnosing subclavian steal.

- On examination, a difference of at least 15 mmHg presents between the affected and the normal arm.

- Simultaneous palpation of radial pulses in both arms will show a decreased amplitude and delayed arrival on the affected side.

- Examination of bilateral carotid arteries using palpation and auscultation can also help in detecting occlusive disease.

- Subclavian arteries should be examined in the supraclavicular fossa using palpation and auscultation for paraclavicular bruits.
