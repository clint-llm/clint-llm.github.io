The most common complication is infection (resulting in malunion or non-union) or osteomyelitis. Contributing factors include:

- Oral sepsis

- Teeth in the fracture line

- Alcohol abuse and chronic disease

- The prolonged time prior to treatment

- Poor patient compliance,

- Displacement of fracture fragments

- Fracture of the plate

Other complications include the delayed union of the fractured mandible. If the fracture of the body of the mandible is bilateral along with the parasymphyseal, or condylar fractures, the airway may get impaired. This impairment is due to the muscular action that pulls the distal mandibular segment backward, resulting in obstruction of the oropharynx by the tongue. There may also be nerve damage such as neuropraxia, in which function takes around 4 to 6 weeks to return, or neurotmesis, in which function may take around 18 months to return.
