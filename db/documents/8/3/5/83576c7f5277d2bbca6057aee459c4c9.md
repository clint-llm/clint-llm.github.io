Volkmann contracture needs to be differentiated from:

- Dupuytren contracture

- Pseudo Volkmann contracture

Pseudo Volkmann contracture is defined as the inability to fully extend fingers, because of mechanical entrapment, in patients with forearm fractures. It is important to note that signs and symptoms of ischemia are absent in pseudo-Volkmann contracture.

Dupuytren's contracture is a progressive condition characterized by permanent flexion of one or more fingers. The exact etiology is not fully known; however, risk factors include chronic liver disease, alcoholism, smoking, and prior trauma. Dupuytren's contracture begins as thickening nodules in the palm, later progressing to restriction of finger motion.

Some literature does not limit the term 'Volkmann contracture' to just the presentation in the hand.
