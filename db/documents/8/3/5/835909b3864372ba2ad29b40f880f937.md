Risk management in healthcare is a complex set of clinical and administrative systems, processes, procedures, and reporting structures designed to detect, monitor, assess, mitigate, and prevent risks to patients. Currently, the numerous risk management practices and processes that occur in healthcare organizations are a response to The Institute of Medicineâ€™s ("IOM") report entitled "To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System." This activity reviews the evaluation of risks and highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing and minimizing risks in the healthcare setting.

- Describe common procedures in risk management.
- Summarize the key definitions of terms involved in risk management.
- Outline why risk management is important to clinical practice.
