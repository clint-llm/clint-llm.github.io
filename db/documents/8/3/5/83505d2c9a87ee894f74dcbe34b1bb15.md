Orally ingested cadmium is poorly bioavailable, but inhaled cadmium fumes are readily bioavailable.   Once in the bloodstream, cadmium binds to alpha-2-macroglobulin and albumin and gets distributed to the liver and kidneys.  Aside from these two main organs, cadmium also concentrates in the pancreas, spleen, heart, lung, and testes.

Once in the liver, cadmium binds with metallothionein and this complex is slowly released from the liver.  Because of the slow release, its biologic half-life can be at least ten years. Cadmium then travels to the glomerulus, and large amounts concentrate in the proximal tubule–conferring its renal toxic effects.
