In the United States, most patients with sickle cell disease are diagnosed with newborn or prenatal screening. The diagnosis is based on hemoglobin electrophoresis that quantifies the types of hemoglobin and detects the various hemoglobinopathies. Among patients presenting with symptoms, the usual lab evaluation consists of complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, complete metabolic panel, LDH level, bilirubin level and determination of blood type, and crossmatch for possible transfusion therapy. Appropriate cultures including that of blood should be obtained if the infectious process is suspected.

**Imaging**

Have a low threshold to obtain chest x-rays to diagnose acute chest syndrome. Get a sonogram of the abdomen as needed. Transcranial sonograms are recommended as screening tests from age two years to prevent strokes. Other imaging studies such as bone scan, MRI, and MRA can be considered depending on clinical suspicion.
