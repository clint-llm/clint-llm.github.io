Thus far, no antiviral drug has proven to be beneficial in treating Eastern equine encephalitis. Supportive care continues to be the general approach, and this often includes intensive care unit admission requiring ventilatory support. There is no need to isolate patients.

Prevention then depends on efforts to reduce vectors, such as reducing potential breeding sites and the use of insecticides along with personal protective measures (e.g., protective clothing and use of repellents).
