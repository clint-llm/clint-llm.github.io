Patients and their parents can be reassured regarding the benign and self-limited nature of pityriasis alba. However, they also should be made aware that its slow resolution may take several months to a few years, although most cases resolve within one year. The affected areas should be protected from sun exposure, as darkening of the surrounding skin may worsen the cosmetic appearance. Low-potency topical steroids, such as 1% hydrocortisone cream or ointment, may reduce erythema and pruritis and accelerate repigmentation. Mild emollients, such as petroleum jelly and creams, may reduce scaling. Sunscreen may help prevent the lesions from sunburning and decrease the darkening of the surrounding skin. Treatment with topical calcineurin inhibitors, such as 0.1% tacrolimus ointment and 1% pimecrolimus cream, have also been reported to be effective; however, because of their high cost, they are seldom indicated. Calcitriol, a topical vitamin D analog, showed comparable efficacy compared with tacrolimus. Other treatment options, usually reserved for extensive cases, include psoralen plus ultraviolet-A (PUVA) photochemotherapy and targeted phototherapy with a 308-nm excimer laser.
