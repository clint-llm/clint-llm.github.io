A complete blood count (CBC) should be ordered with any complaint of bleeding to assess the severity and help direct the management. Other important lab tests to obtain are the international normalized ratio (INR) and the partial thromboplastin time (PTT), which will help to assess for any bleeding tendencies. A cross-match test may be needed in order to reserve blood for transfusion in cases of severe bleeding to maintain the hemoglobin level above 7gm/dL.

In patients who practice anal receptive sex, testing should be done for STIs, including gonorrhea and chlamydia. Endoscopies are the gold standard for investigating rectal bleeding, which should be performed in patients who are older than 40 years of age regardless of other clinical symptoms.

CT angiography may be pursued if there is a large volume of bleeding or if the patient is too unstable to undergo anesthesia for endoscopic intervention. If there is a large volume of blood in the gut, it may be difficult to isolate the specific site of where the blood is coming from.

Tagged red blood cell scintigraphies are an accurate investigation for localizing the bleeding vessels and identifying the site into which they bleed. It can be utilized in recurrent and persistent rectal bleeding of an unknown cause.
