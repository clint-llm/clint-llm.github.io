In congenital/hereditary sideroblastic anemia, patients are younger, and health decisions are made for them by their parents or guardians. Parents and caregivers should educate themselves about this anemia and how to manage it. Caregivers at home should ensure that patients avoid iron-rich containing food that could exacerbate more iron overload. Patients and caregivers should follow up with their hematologist for close follow up examination. Medication compliance with pyridoxine and possibly iron chelation medications isÂ important as this has been shown to help improve the healthcare outcomes in X-linked sideroblastic anemia. Balanced nutrition should be adopted to get an adequate amount of vitamins and minerals. Alcohol, isoniazid and lead poison may cause sideroblastic anemia and should be avoided in patients with hereditary anemia.
