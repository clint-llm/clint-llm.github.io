This activity describes the indications, action, and contraindications for chloroquine as a valuable agent in the therapy of malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus erythematosus. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment, prevention, and management of patients with malaria and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of chloroquine.
- Identify the most common adverse effects of chloroquine.
- Review the appropriate monitoring of patients treated with chloroquine.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team that can enhance patient care when prescribing and monitoring chloroquine to improve patient outcomes for patients receiving prophylaxis and treatment with chloroquine.
