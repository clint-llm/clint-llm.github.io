Given that the spleen is a highly vascularized organ, significant blood loss can occur from either the parenchyma or the vascular supply to the spleen. The spleen serves the following significant functions

**Hematologic**

- Maturation of red cells and storage of red blood cells and platelets

**Filtration**

- Removal of particulates such as opsonized bacteria, or antibody-coated cells from blood

- Extraction of abnormal cells and damaged red blood cells via phagocytosis

**Immunologic**

- Contributes to humoral and cell-mediated immunity

- Production of lymphopoietic white blood cells

A healthy adult spleen can weigh up to 250 gm and measure up to 13 cm long. Over time, it spontaneously involutes and may not be palpable in adults.
