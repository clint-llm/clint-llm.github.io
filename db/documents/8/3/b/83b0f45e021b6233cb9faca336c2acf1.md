**Hypertension**

When clinically feasible, two or more measurements taken at different visits should be used to make a diagnosis of hypertension. The threshold at which high blood pressure is diagnosed is constantly evolving in response to new evidence. Previous guidelines had defined hypertension beginning at a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, but the most recent updates have lowered this level based on the benefits of early intervention.

Undiagnosed hypertension places patients at increased risk of developing coronary artery disease, stroke, and end-stage renal disease, among other complications. In the United States, hypertension is the second most preventable cause of death; worldwide, it is the leading cause of death and disability-adjusted life years.

**Hypotension**

Hypotension is less common than hypertension and is generally due to an identifiable cause, such as dehydration, illness, or medication side effect. While there is no formal threshold for the diagnosis of hypotension, a systolic pressure of less than 90 mmHg or a diastolic pressure of less than 60 mmHg is generally used by medical professionals.

**Orthostatic Hypotension**

Some patients are normotensive at rest but experience symptoms of hypotension when standing. Such orthostatic hypotension is defined by a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mmHg or a reduction in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg after three minutes of standing from a sitting or supine position.
