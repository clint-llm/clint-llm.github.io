In the United States, between 0.4% and 3% of the population identifies as transgender, equating to over 1,000,000 Americans.

Transgender patients commonly benefit from behavioral health and endocrine interventions (estrogen and anti-androgen therapy for male to female transitions and testosterone for the female to male), and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), in its most recent Standards of Care publication (SOC 7, published in 2012), has strongly recommended that patients considering genital surgery ("bottom surgery") have not only a persistent, well-documented history of gender dysphoria but have also completed 12 continuous months of hormonal therapy preoperatively. For chest surgery ("top surgery"), either augmentation or reduction mammoplasty, the WPATH recommends patients have a persistent and well-documented history of gender dysphoria and that patients transitioning from male to female also consider 12 continuous months of feminizing hormone therapy preoperatively. There are no explicit recommendations in SOC 7 for behavioral health documentation or duration of hormonal therapy prior to head and neck surgery, which will focus on this article.

With respect to gender affirmation procedures for the face, the majority of interventions will occur in patients transitioning from male to female, i.e., transgender women. While there are slightly more transgender women than transgender men in the population (33% transgender women, 29% transgender men, 35% non-binary, 3% crossdressers, according to the USTS), the reason that more females require surgery than males is that testosterone therapy typically produces enough changes in secondary sex characteristics of the face (growth of facial hair, thickening of the skin, increase in frontal bossing, lowering of the voice, etc.) that surgery is not necessary.

Feminization of the upper third of the face often requires several techniques to be applied in combination: the advancement of the hairline, hair transplantation, brow lifting, and reduction of frontal bossing or "frontal cranioplasty."

Other common surgical interventions requested by transgender women include feminization of the eyes via lateral canthoplasty, reduction rhinoplasty, malar implant placement or fat transfer, upper lip lift, mandibular angle reduction, genioplasty, rhytidectomy, laser hair removal, and laryngeal chondroplasty ("tracheal shave"). Because of the breadth of procedures often performed during gender affirmation of the head and neck, it is advisable to employ a multidisciplinary model for delivering patient care, in which a plastic surgeon or facial plastic surgeon may perform the brow and scalp surgery as well as the lip lift, rhinoplasty, implant or fat placement, and/or rhytidectomy; an oral surgeon may provide the mandibular angle reduction and genioplasty; an ophthalmologist or oculoplastic surgeon may perform the canthoplasty; a laryngologist or otolaryngologist may offer laryngeal chondroplasty or voice feminization surgery, and a dermatologist may provide laser and injectable treatments. Beyond the procedure-oriented physicians, however, it is critical to remember the roles of endocrinologists or primary care providers and behavioral health providers on the team because they will often provide longer-term continuity of care for transgender patients.
