Obesity in childhood is the most challenging public health issue in the twenty-first century. It has emerged as a pandemic health problem worldwide. The children who are obese tend to stay obese in adulthood and prone to increased risk for diabetes and cardiac problems at a younger age. Childhood obesity is associated with increased morbidity and premature death.

**Epidemiology**

The prevalence of childhood obesity has alarmingly increased. The overall burden of obesity has almost tripled since 1975. However, an eightfold increase in obesity burden in the 5 to 19 years age group has been noted between 1975 and 2016.

**Definition**

The word obesity infers the deposition of excessive fat in the body. Different methods can directly measure body fat like skinfold thickness, hydro densitometry, bioelectrical impedance, and air displacement plethysmography.

- Overweight – 85th to less than the 95th percentile.

- Obese (class 1) – 95th percentile or greater

- Severe (class II) obesity – ≥ 120% of 95th percentile (99th percentile) or ≥ 35 kg/m^2 (whichever is lower)

- Class III obesity is a subcategory of severe obesity and is defined as BMI ≥140 % of 95th percentile or ≥ 40 kg/m^2.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using BMI Z-score cut-offs of >1, > 2, and > 3 to define at risk of overweight, overweight, and obesity, respectively.
