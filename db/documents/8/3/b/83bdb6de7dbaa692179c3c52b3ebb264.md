Popliteal artery aneurysms, although rare, may put the affected limb at risk. Any symptomatic aneurysm, or one larger than 2 cm, should be considered for repair as above.

The decision regarding open or endovascular repair should be individualized, and the risks and benefits of each should be discussed with the patient.
