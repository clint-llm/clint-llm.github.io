The frequency of the infections caused by S. pyogenes varies in different parts of the world, depending upon clinical manifestations of the infections. GAS has always been associated with serious diseases that result in high morbidity and mortality. GAS infections declined by the mid of the 20th century. However, by the end of 1980, severe group A streptococcus (GAS) infections remerged.S. pyogenes infection have increased. This increase in disease burden can be attributed to the multitude of factors including, change of virulence and resistance to antibiotics.

The global burden of severe S. pyogenes infections is 18.1 million cases, with 1.78 million new cases per year.  The worldwide prevalence of RHD is at least 15.6 million cases, with the incidence of 282,000 new cases per year. Approximately 233,000 deaths per year are attributed to RHD. Each year approximately 663,000 new cases of invasive GAS disease have been reported with 163,000 deaths per year.S. pyogenes; also, 111 million cases of skin infection in children of developing countries.

Throat infection is more common in temperate areas, and its incidence increases in late winter and early spring. Impetigo is more prevalent in children of humid climates. It has also been observed that the severity of invasive skin infections caused by GAS escalated from January to April and correlates with the host susceptibility to acquiring a serious infection.
