In renal transplantation, the matching of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens is more critical than MHC class I antigen compatibility in determining graft survival. Matching of the ABO blood group system is also essential since A and B antigens can be expressed on the endothelium. When there is a genetic disparity between donor and receptor, MHC class I and II can be seen as foreign by the immune system. CD4+ T cells react to these donor antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells (APC) or themselves and produce cytokines that stimulate a robust immune reactivity that destroy the graft within days or weeks.
