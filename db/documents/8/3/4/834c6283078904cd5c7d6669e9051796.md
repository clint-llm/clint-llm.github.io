Chances of survival of the viable co-twin are excellent if the demise of the twin occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy. Also, the health of the mother is not affected, except for some mild vaginal bleeding that may be experienced by the mother as a sign of the loss of the embryo in early pregnancy. In other words, the earlier the loss of the fetus, the more likely is the chance that the mother doesnâ€™t even notice the twin being vanished, as chances of survival of the other fetus and the health of the mother may not be affected by the loss of the fetus.
