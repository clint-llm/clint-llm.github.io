The broad and extensive involvement of astrocytes in many aspects of CNS development and function suggests that they carry implications in an array of different nervous system disorders. Specifically, any condition or stimulus that would impair the ability of astrocytes to function would effectively disturb the blood-brain barrier, synapse formation and stabilization, signaling efficiency, energy metabolism, and fluid-ion homeostasis in the CNS.
