Koilocytes are not visible grossly, but they are visible microscopically. The anogenital and oropharyngeal regions are the main areas of the body that harbor koilocytes.

With the hematoxylin and eosin stain of fixed tissue, the findings are very similar. The pink cytoplasm condenses around conspicuous perinuclear cavitation, and the enlarged nucleus exhibits hyperchromasia and membrane irregularity.

Electron microscopy, a specialized modality of anatomic pathology, can also contribute to the identification of koilocytes by revealing viral particles within the nucleus.
