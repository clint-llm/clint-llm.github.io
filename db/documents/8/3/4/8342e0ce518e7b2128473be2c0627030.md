The pathophysiology behind cardiac index is rooted mainly in dysfunctions of the heart. These dysfunctions can be further broken down into systolic and diastolic dysfunctions.

- Systolic dysfunctions (failure to pump)

- High blood pressure (high afterload)
- Cardiomyopathy 
- Coronary artery disease 
- Heart valve disease 
- Other structural diseases, congenital or otherwise

- Diastolic dysfunctions (inability to fill, usually secondary to other diseases)

- Hypertrophy 
- Sequelae of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and inactivity
- Other structural diseases, congenital or otherwise
