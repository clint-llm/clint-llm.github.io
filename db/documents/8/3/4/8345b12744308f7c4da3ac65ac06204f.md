A thorough medical history is instrumental in the identification of risk factors. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic women who come in for screening should be asked their sexual history in detail with the use of the 5 Ps: partners, practices, prevention of pregnancy, protection from STIs, and previous STIs. Typical symptoms reported include purulent or mucopurulent vaginal discharge and intermenstrual or post-coital bleeding. Dyspareunia has also been reported. An in-depth inquiry should also be carried out for the associated symptoms, i.e., urinary symptoms (for concomitant urethritis), and abdominal pain (for PID or endometritis).

All women with suspicion of cervicitis should undergo pelvic and vaginal examinations. The classic signs include yellow or mucoid discharge from the os and easy bleeding of the endocervix on touching with cotton applicator (also called friability). However, a normal physical exam does not rule out an infection. Additionally, punctate hemorrhages (strawberry vagina) is suggestive of trichomonas, while vesicles and ulcers indicate an HSV infection. Mycoplasma cervicitis is asymptomatic in many patients; therefore, many cases remain undiagnosed.

Upper genital involvement should be suspected in the case of high fever, abdominal or adnexal tenderness, and cervical motion tenderness.
