The management of chorea is complex because there is no cure. All the currently available treatments are palliative which only manage the symptoms. While the patients are primarily managed by the neurologist, the follow up maybe by the primary care provider and nurse practitioner. The most important is feature isÂ the creation of the patient's support system. As the disease progresses, the patient will need specialized caregiving. Nutrition management is important, due to difficulty swallowing. Genetic testing should be offered to any family member if they want to know the potential risk of inheriting the disease. Educate all patients on the clinical features of the disease options for treatment and prognosis. The prognosis for most patients is poor and the quality of life is markedly diminished.
