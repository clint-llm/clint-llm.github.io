Potentially inappropriate medications are drugs that pose a risk of causing adverse events. Many tools, such as the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria®, have been developed to assess potentially inappropriate medications in the geriatric population. The latest version of the AGS Beers Criteria® was revised in 2019 to assist practicing clinicians in outpatient, acute, and institutional settings. It includes medications evaluated in 5 main categories: drugs to avoid, drugs to use with caution, drug-drug interactions, medications to avoid in particular clinical situations, and dosage according to kidney function. This activity illustrates the main issues concerning inappropriate medication use in the geriatric population and highlights the interprofessional team's role in improving patient care.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the importance of inappropriate medication use in the geriatric population and summarize the risks associated with inappropriate medication use.
- Describe the basis, utilization, advantages, and limitations of the AGS Beers Criteria.
- Outline relevant strategies to assess geriatric patients with potentially inappropriate medications.
- Review the interprofessional interventions for evaluating and preventing inappropriate medication use in older adults.
