**Intraocular Lens (IOL):**Before intraocular lenses were used, cataractous lenses were simply removed, and the patients would then need high-power spectacles or contact lenses to attain optimal visual acuity.

Intraocular lenses (IOL) can be monofocal, multifocal, and toric. Monofocal aspheric IOLs correct for power lost by the removal of the natural lens. They are the most commonly implanted due to their low cost. Since the IOL corrects only one focal distance, glasses or contact lenses may be necessary for either distance or near vision. Note that the patient has an option to choose monovision as an outcome, where one eye has an IOL for distance vision while the other eye is for near vision. Multifocal IOLs are used to correct refractive vision errors to decrease the need for glasses. Of the multifocal lenses, bifocal diffractive lenses provide better near visual acuity than monofocal lenses. Trifocal diffractive lenses are intended to improve intermediate vision; although, current evidence of their effectiveness is inconclusive.

Before surgery, ophthalmologists take into account patient anatomy and other factors to determine the needed power of the intraocular lens.
