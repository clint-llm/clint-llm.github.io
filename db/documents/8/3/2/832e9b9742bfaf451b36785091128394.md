Histologically, it is most important to differentiate common ameloblastomas vs. ameloblastic carcinoma/malignant ameloblastoma.

Ameloblastic carcinoma is generally more aggressive and has a worse prognosis in late disease. Ameloblastic carcinoma has certain features of benign ameloblastoma such as reverse polarization, peripheral palisading, and stellate reticulum-like cells. It has features of malignancy common to many cancers such as high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, increased mitoses with atypical forms, cytological atypia, and necrosis. The following are some features of ameloblastic carcinoma

1) High mitotic figure

2) Cellular atypia

3) High proliferative mitotic index

4) Perineural or perivascular invasion

5) Nuclear atypia such as nuclear pleomorphism

Malignant ameloblastoma, on the other hand, has these histological features:

1) Lack of mitotic figure

2) Normal ameloblastic cells

3) Lack of a mitotic index

4) No perineural or perivascular invasion

5) Normal polarized ameloblastic nucleus
