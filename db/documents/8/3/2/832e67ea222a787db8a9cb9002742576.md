Prehospital treatment is as simple as washing the affected areas of skin with soap and water and drying without contacting the skin (such as using a hair dryer or fan).  Remember to remove any constricting clothing or jewelry as soon as possible.

Consider local cooling measures: gentle application of ice packs and topical isopropyl alcohol.

All suspected ocular exposures should undergo immediate irrigation with copious amounts of water.  Placement of a topical anesthetic will significantly ease eye pain and facilitate treatment/examination.  Consider using a Morgan lens if available.  Analysis with a slit lamp using fluorescein will help to determine if any setae remain on the cornea or if resultant corneal abrasions are present.  Consider urgent ophthalmologic consultation for any caterpillar-related eye exposures.

For suspected setae exposures, adhesive tape applied to the skin then removed will remove remaining caterpillar spines.  Duct tape is most useful for this approach; however, any available tape will do.

Cutaneous symptoms are manageable with oral antihistamines and application of topical corticosteroids.  Systemic steroids can be considered in refractory cases or with severe symptoms.

Supplemental oxygen, antihistamines, and beta-agonist inhalers or nebulizer treatments can control respiratory presentations.

Patients presenting with anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions should receive therapy according to standardized treatment algorithms.

Systemic toxicity requires management in a supportive manner (patient monitoring, following baseline renal and coagulation function, intravenous fluids). Emergent consultation with a toxicologist or poison control center can be beneficial in providing treatment algorithms and/or specific recommended treatment.
