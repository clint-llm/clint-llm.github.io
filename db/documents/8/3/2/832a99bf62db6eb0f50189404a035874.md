While rectus abdominis diastasis can spontaneously resolve, mostly in infants, which is typically congenital rather than acquired, it often persists and may warrant further treatment options for patients.

If a patient fails conservative treatment, surgery can be considered. There is literature available discussing different surgical treatment approaches for diastasis, including rectus plication to reconstruct the linea alba and restore the anatomy, modified hernia repair techniques, and combined hernia repair and plication techniques.

Laparoscopy should only be performed if the patient has not had a prior hernia or laparotomy and does not desire an abdominoplasty. There is a study to support decreased risk of complications with laparoscopic repair compared to open repair.

Many sources also recommend considering surgery if there is a concomitant ventral or umbilical hernia that requires surgical treatment or if the patient is having difficulties with the function of the abdominal wall.
