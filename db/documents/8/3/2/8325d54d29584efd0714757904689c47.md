To control symptoms and reduce the risks of subungual ulceration and secondary bacterial infection, clinicians can use periodic debridement to successfully manage severe onychomycosis in patients who elect to avoid systemic therapy or are unable to apply topical antifungals. In addition, many patients are reluctant to accept the potential risk of idiosyncratic hepatic reactions that may occur during 90 days of continuous systemic antifungal therapy. Some patients will, however, accept and do well with pulsed systemic therapy. In moderate onychomycosis, 250mg of terbinafine daily for one week every nine weeks for three pulses is acceptable.

Although periodic thorough debridement is unlikely to clear onychomycosis, it appears to improve the immediate patient satisfaction and aid the efficacy of medications. Concurrent treatment of the tinea pedis should be undertaken and along with the long-term daily use of an antifungal powder to reduce reinfection and recurrence.
