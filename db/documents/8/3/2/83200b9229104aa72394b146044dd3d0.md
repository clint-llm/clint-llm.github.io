When symptomatic hibernomas are identified and diagnosed through imaging and/or biopsy, possible management options of these benign neoplasms to include surveillance or complete surgical excision should be discussed with patients. If surgical excision is considered, patients should be counseled on the unique risks and benefits of surgery which will depend on the superficial versus the deep location of the tumor and proximity to other neurovascular structures or organs. When superficial or subcutaneous in location, patients should be counseled on expectations relating to cosmesis.
