Lumbar spinal stenosis is a condition often seen in the outpatient setting. Patients frequently come with complaints of pain and/or paresthesias in the extremities. Imaging studies, in addition to electrodiagnostic studies, are routinely ordered. Physicians must be cautious, as imaging findings might not correlate with the patient's symptoms. It is essential to take an interprofessional team including a team of physicians (physical medicine and rehabilitation, pain management, orthopedist, and/or neurosurgeons), physical therapists, occupational therapist, social workers, and case managers who can work together to coordinate mobilization with outpatient therapy and aggressive multifaceted rehabilitation so we can improve a patient's functional status. Typically there is a long and challenging recovery ahead for patients with spinal stenosis, but with a coordinated effort between the various medical disciplines and departments, the best outcomes for patients are achievable.
