Diagnosing autoimmune encephalitis can be difficult as the average onset of symptoms to diagnosis often takes a few weeks to three months. Infectious encephalitis can be fatal and should always be eliminated from one’s differential before considering AIE. Even after eliminating other potential causes, the diagnosis of AIE is not easy. To diagnose autoimmune encephalitis, we need multiple tools to aid in the diagnosis, although clinical judgment is the key to making decisions. They will include a constellation of neuropsychiatric symptoms, lab studies, neuroimaging, and EEG. Therefore, a group of experts came to a consensus to help clinicians identify the disorder to initiate appropriate treatment.

Following criteria were adopted for evaluation of possible diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis:

- Subacute onset (usually within a few weeks but less than three months) with change in the level of consciousness or personality; limbic system involvement including working memory deficits, lethargy, or psychiatric manifestations

- At least one of the following:

- New focal clinical CNS findings

- Seizures not explained by a previously diagnosed seizure disorder

- CSF pleocytosis (>5 WBC per mm3)

- MRI Brain findings suggestive of encephalitis

3. Reasonable exclusion of possible alternative causes*

All three criteria must be met.

#MRI brain increased signal on T2 weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence images seen in one or both medial temporal lobes (limbic encephalitis) or multifocal areas involving grey or white matter compatible with demyelination or inflammation.

Definite diagnosis of autoimmune limbic encephalitis-

- Subacute onset of symptoms (<3 months) involving limbic system area (memory deficits, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or seizures)

- MRI brain is suggestive of abnormality highly restricted to bilateral medial temporal lobes on T2 weighted FLAIR images

- One of the following is present-

- CSF pleocytosis (>5 WBC per mm^3)

- EEG is suggestive of slow-wave or epileptic activity corresponding to temporal lobes.

4. Reasonable exclusion of alternative causes*

If all four criteria** match, the definitive diagnosis can be made.

*Infectious meningoencephalitis, septic encephalopathy, metabolic encephalopathy, toxins, cerebrovascular disease, neoplasms, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, epileptic disorders, Hashimoto encephalopathy, autoimmune disorders, mitochondrial/metabolic storage disorders.

**If one of the first three criteria does not match, a diagnosis of definite limbic encephalitis can be made only in the presence of antibodies against cell-surface, synaptic, or onconeural proteins. Antibody should be detected both in sera and CSF fluid for diagnosis.

Studies have shown that out of all patients with NMDAR encephalitis with antibodies detected in CSF, 14% of cases were found to have no detectable antibodies in serum. Therefore, collection of both CSF and serum is recommended to detect antibodies.

Antibody titers may correlate with clinical severity in CSF studies and to a lesser extent with serum, but determining the clinical recovery based on titers remains controversial. Moreover, the clinical picture and associated comorbidities are considered relatively reliable for evaluating the clinical course, treatment response, and overall prognosis.

Following diagnosis, screening for the presence of neoplasm is necessary. There is a correlation seen with coexisting neoplasm with a clinical subtype of antibody detection. (Table-1). The best initial step is to undergo a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to look for pulmonary or abdominal, or urogenital malignancies. Females should undergo gynecological exams with breast and ovarian ultrasound /MRI based on sensitivity and clinical judgment. Similarly, males should undergo testicular ultrasound as a part of the urological evaluation. If the above imaging does not yield any findings, a whole-body 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET should be considered.
