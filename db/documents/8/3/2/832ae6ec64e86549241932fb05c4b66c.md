The treatment of delusional disorder is difficult considering the lack of insight. A good doctor-patient relationship is a key to treatment success. Treatment includes psychotherapy by establishing trust and building a therapeutic alliance.

A patient's history of medication compliance is the best guide to select appropriate antipsychotic medication. An antipsychotic should be started for a trial period of six weeks after which there is an evaluation of the effectiveness of the medication. Start a low dose and titrate up as needed. Another drug from another class can be tried after six weeks if no benefit is noted from initial treatment.

Though not a primary indication drugs like lithium, valproic acid, and carbamazepine can be considered as an adjunct treatment if monotherapy with antipsychotics fails.

Treatment response is better when combining psychotherapy with psychopharmacology.
