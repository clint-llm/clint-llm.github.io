AIDS patients, in particular, should be encouraged to adhere to antiretroviral therapy, and issues of non-compliance need to be addressed with the primary care provider. In the event of abnormal neurological symptoms such as changes in cognition, motor or sensory function, gait, and vision, clinicians must be alerted to the importance of such symptoms in conjunction with a history of immunosuppression.
