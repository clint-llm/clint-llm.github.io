Many complications have been reported with endocardial fibroelastosis. Some of them are:

- Intracardiac thrombus precipitated by LV dysfunction and arrhythmias

- Severe mitral regurge due to direct valvular involvement or chronic LV dysfunction

- Thromboembolism leading to stroke, pulmonary embolism, and systemic embolization

- Myocardial infarction either from ischemia or thromboembolism

- Arrhythmias due to the involvement of the cardiac conduction system

- Congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock

- Right heart involvement leading to pulmonary hypertension

- Hydrops fetalis presumably due to intrauterine cardiac failure

- Sudden cardiac death
