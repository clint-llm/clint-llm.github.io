There is a high level of variability in arterial branch points and the dominance of the circulation. This variability carries clinical significance. Some of the most predominant examples of physiologic variance include the inconsistent presence of the corona mortis, the incongruity in the arterial dominance of the proximal femoral artery, the trifurcation of the tibial artery to form the anterior tibial, the posterior tibial, and the fibular arteries, as well as the inconsistent presence of a superficial plantar arterial arch of the foot. There is a plethora of anatomic variations of each of the vessels. These variations differ in their clinical importance.

Physiologic variation also occurs with varying ages. One example exists in the femoral head, where a significant blood supply exists within the ligamentum teres before adulthood; this supply degenerates with age, resulting in a predominate vascular supply from the medial femoral circumflex artery.
