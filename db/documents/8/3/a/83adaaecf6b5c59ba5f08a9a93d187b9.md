Patients in need of toiletingÂ with the use of a bedpan can impose specific inherent risks, thus should be used with the knowledge of the emotional and physical implications in a clinical setting. This task should not be used for provider convenience, but with certain criteria for client selection to meet the standard of care. Staffing challenges may lead to delays in answering call lights and providing toileting assistance. These delays of care may place a patient at risk for falls and incontinence, thus contributing to emotional and physical duress. Missed care opportunities lead to a decrease in patient satisfaction and overall perception of care. Therefore reimbursement of care may be affected by a trickle-down effect with negative patient satisfaction scores.
