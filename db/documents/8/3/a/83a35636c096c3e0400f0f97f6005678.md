Variations of the anterior scalene muscle include differing origins from C2 to C6, C3 to C5, or insertion into the second or third rib. Variations of the middle scalene include an origin from C1 (the atlas) and, like the anterior scalene, inserting onto the second rib.

The anterior and middle scalene insertions on the first rib can vary, which creates a narrow space, leading to a higher-than-normal subclavian artery and brachial plexus. This is important to consider during a surgical intervention in this area. Also, in some patients, the middle scalene can insert across the full length of the first rib. In rare cases, the middle and anterior scalene have fused, so the artery and plexus have to pierce through the muscular sheath. The muscles are not the only variants that can occur. The first rib can have structural anomalies that narrow the space, including fusion of ribs, abnormal positioning, and a healed fracture. All variations can make the structures harder to visualize and dictate further treatment, whether surgical or non-surgical.
