Most urinary stones start as Randall's plaque at the junction of the nephron's collecting tubule and the renal pelvis in the papilla. These plaques start suburothelial and then gradually grow until they break through the urothelium into the renal pelvis. They form an anchored lithogenic nidus for stone formation. Once in continuous contact with urine, layers of calcium oxalate typically start to form on the calcium phosphate nidus (all Randall's plaques are composed of calcium phosphate). Calcium oxalate stones tend to form when the urinary pH is under 7.2, while calcium phosphate will form in more alkaline urine.

Hyperparathyroidism and similar metabolic disturbances like renal tubular acidosis typically form stones primarily or significantly composed of calcium phosphate. Overly acidic urine is the primary cause of uric acid stones (not hyperuricosuria).

Most renal calculi are made of calcium, followed by urate crystals. Supersaturation of the urine is the common denominator in all cases of renal calculi. In some cases, calcium oxalate stones may deposit in the renal papilla. Calcium phosphate stones usually precipitate in the basement membrane of the thin loop of Henle and may erode into the interstitium. The colicky pain s usually due to the dilatation and spasm of the ureter.

Natural urinary stone inhibitors include:

- Water (urinary volume)

- Citrate

- Tamm-Horsfall protein

- Nephrocalcin

- Uropontin

- Glycosaminoglycans
