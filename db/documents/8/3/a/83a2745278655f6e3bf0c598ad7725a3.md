Some of the toxicities involved with ixazomib include hematological and hepatic toxicities. Hematological toxicities include thrombocytopenia, which was seen primarily during the first three months of treatment in the drug approval study. Platelets usually drop after a dose of ixazomib and then rise again before the next cycle of treatment. Also, during the study, a small percentage of patients had to be taken off of ixazomib therapy due to thrombocytopenia.

Furthermore, unlike other proteasome inhibitors previously reported to cause cardiac toxicity, ixazomib is not known to cause an increase in cardiac events, toxicities, or prolonged QTc interval.
