Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS) is a complex condition presenting due to abnormal fusion of cervical vertebrae at C2 and C3, caused by a failure in the division or normal segmentation of the cervical spine vertebrae in the early fetal development. This condition leads to a characteristic appearance of a short neck, low hairline, facial asymmetry, and limited neck mobility. The anomalies can lead to chronic headaches, a limited range of neck motion, and neck muscle pain. More importantly, it can also result in spinal stenosis, neurologic deficit, cervical spinal deformity, instability, and spinal stenosis. Patients can be polysyndromic in their presentation, as well.
