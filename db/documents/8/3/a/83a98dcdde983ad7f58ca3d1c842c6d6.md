The Institute of Medicine (IOM) gave the following definition for error: "the failure of a planned action to be completed as intended, or the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim." In contrast, a diagnostic error was defined as: "error or delay in diagnosis, failure to employ indicated tests or therapy, failure to act on the results of monitoring or testing." Finally, an adverse event is defined as: "an event that results in unintended harm to the patient by an act of omission or commission."

Reporting an incident is critical in improving healthcare and is exclusively based on the principle of learning from prior medical errors. These events may not need to cause death or even harm to the patient. Incident reporting includes near misses, that is events that did not result in patient harm, despite having harmful potential. There is often difficulty in linking cause and effect when examining adverse events.
