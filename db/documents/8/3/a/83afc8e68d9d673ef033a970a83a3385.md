Eptifibatide is an antiplatelet drug that reversibly binds and inhibits platelets' glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors. A protein found in the venom of a southeastern pygmy rattlesnake is used to make eptifibatide. The PURSUIT and IMPACT-II account for the indications of eptifibatide by the Food and Drug Administration(FDA)as mentioned below:

- **Acute Coronary Syndrome:**FDA-approved eptifibatide for the medical management of unstable angina (UA) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). In the PURSUIT trial, the eptifibatide showed favorable outcomes in reducing the composite end-point mortality and preventing nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina.

- **Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI):**FDA also approved eptifibatide for patients undergoing PCI, including intracoronary stenting. The IMPACT-II trial proved that eptifibatide use with heparin and aspirin reduces ischemic events following a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), especially in individuals with unstable angina.

**Non-FDA-labeled Indications**

- Eptifibatide is used to enhance myocardial perfusion in the ST-elevation myocardial infarction(STEMI) before PCI, as supported by evidence by the "Time to Integrefilin Therapy in Acute Myocardial Infarction (TITAN)-TIMI 34 trial.

- Another possible use of eptifibatide is to enhance the incidence and speed of reperfusion when used in large doses in combination with heparin, aspirin, and tissue plasminogen activators in STEMI patients, as evidenced by the small group in the IMPACT-AMI trial. In the IMPACT-AMI trial, the use of eptifibatide showed complete reperfusion and an early ST-segment recovery on the electrocardiogram.

- Eptifibatide can be used in combination with TPA in acute ischemic strokes to prevent progression to subacute intracerebral hemorrhage, as supported by the "Combined Approach to Lysis Utilizing Eptifibatide and rt-PA in Acute Ischemic Stroke (CLEAR)" trial.
