Itraconazole can treat many different fungal infections. Many of these fungal infections are rare; however, they can be detrimental to the immunocompromised. Itraconazole (sometimes abbreviated ITZ) treats blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, and aspergillosis and has FDA approval as a treatment for these infections. However, itraconazole has also shown efficacy in treating paracoccidioidomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and candidiasis, but it does not have FDA approval for these conditions.

In addition to treating systemic infections, itraconazole can also treat superficial fungal infections like onychomycosis, which has FDA approval. However, the cure rate of onychomycosis with itraconazole therapy is only 63%.
