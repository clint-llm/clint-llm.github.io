Neonatal HSV infection is clinically challenging. Early manifestations may be subtle and nonspecific. Neonatal HSV can mimic other diseases, including bacterial illnesses (sepsis or meningitis) and other viral illnesses, particularly enterovirus. Prompt treatment requires early consideration of neonatal HSV as a possibility in neonates with mucocutaneous lesions, CNS abnormalities, or a sepsis-like picture.Â Early in the clinical course, some neonates with HSV infection may present with persistent fever and negative bacterial cultures.

Neonatal HSV infection should be suspected in neonates and infants up to 6 weeks of age with the following:

- Mucocutaneous vesicles

- Sepsis-like illness (fever or hypothermia, irritability, lethargy, respiratory distress, apnea, abdominal distension, hepatomegaly, ascites)

- CSF pleocytosis

- Seizures

- Focal neurologic signs

- Abnormal neuroimaging

- Respiratory distress, apnea, or progressive pneumonitis

- Thrombocytopenia

- Elevated liver transaminases, viral hepatitis, or acute liver failure

- Conjunctivitis, excessive tearing, or painful eye symptoms
