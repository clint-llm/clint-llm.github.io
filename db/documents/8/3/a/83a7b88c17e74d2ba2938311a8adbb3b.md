**Management of Infectious Processes**

Antibiotics are the mainstay of managing infectious processes.

The choice of antibiotic would be guided by clinical findings and antibiotic susceptibility.

Surgical management is also often indicated and includes:

- Drainage of abscesses

- Wound debridement

- Amputation

**Management of Ischemic Processes/Stroke**

- Myocardial infarction is the prototype example of coagulative necrosis which requires urgent management. Early removal of the obstructive lesions in the coronary arteries is a very important step in the management of myocardial infarction. This is usually achieved medically or by an invasive procedure.

- Stroke management is a multi-disciplinary, multi-specialist effort which should take into consideration several factors including, the extent of residual damage, risk of reoccurrence and the rehabilitative needs of the patient.

**Management of Caseous Necrosis**

This requires standard management for tuberculosis, including the use of combination antibiotics and close laboratory and clinical monitoring.

**Management of Gangrenous Necrosis**

This is a serious medical and surgical situation which requires antibiotics and sometimes necessitates the removal of dead tissues (debridement). In severe, life-threatening cases, an amputation may be required.
