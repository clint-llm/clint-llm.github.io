Thirty percent of those diagnosed with vestibular migraines may present without a history of headache.

A vestibular migraine does not seem to go away. Episodes can be associated with womenâ€™s menstrual cycles. Studies have shown that nearly 50% of those diagnosed with probable vestibular migraine progress to definite vestibular migraine according to the previously mentioned Neuheuser criteria. Another study showed that nearly 30% experienced increased frequency of attacks over a 9-year observation period, although nearly 50% experienced a reduced frequency of attacks. Nearly 90% of vestibular migraineurs still report vertiginous attacks after nine years. Additionally, cochlear complaints such as aural fullness, tinnitus, and/or hearing loss during vertigo spells seem to become more common as time progresses.
