Nebivolol is an FDA-approved medication used to treat hypertension.

Beta-blockers fall into two categories based on whether they block beta-1 receptors in cardiac muscles, beta-2 receptors in the lungs and smooth muscles, or both. Beta-blockers are also classified as vasodilators and non-vasodilators based on their vasodilatory capabilities. A fixed-dose****combination of nebivolol and valsartan is also approved by the FDA for the treatment of hypertension.
