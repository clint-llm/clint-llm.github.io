Anna Freud defined defense mechanisms as "unconscious resources used by the ego" to decrease internal stress ultimately. Patients often devise these unconscious mechanisms to decrease conflict within themselves, specifically between the superego and id. Psychodynamic therapy is used by clinicians to help orient patients to their own unconscious processes. By recognizing and identifying these processes, patients improve their self-awareness and gain a new understanding of their own behaviors. This activity defines major defense mechanisms to increase clinician's understanding of their patients during patient encounters and the role of the interprofessional team in the care of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify and define the common psychological defense mechanisms.
- Describe the goal of psychodynamic therapy in relation to defense mechanisms.
- Review the clinical significance of defense mechanisms in relation to psychodynamic therapy. 
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving coordination and communication in the care of patients with defense mechanisms.
