Padding at the injury site may decrease the incidence of re-injury, limit pain, and allow a return to activity sooner. Patients with a hip pointer may return to activity once the pain and swelling resolve and normal function return. Patients with a hip pointer are at risk for recurrent injury and should be advised to avoid activities that may induce a repeat injury.
