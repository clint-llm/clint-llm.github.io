Treatment options for early localized and early disseminated Lyme disease include doxycycline (100 mg twice per day), amoxicillin (500 mg 3 times per day), or cefuroxime axetil (500 mg twice per day) for 14 days.

Treatment of early Lyme disease with neurologic sequelae includes ceftriaxone (2 g once per day IV) for 14 days. For cardiac manifestations associated with early Lyme disease, treatment options are oral or parenteral antibiotic therapy for 14 days.

For late Lyme disease with the complication of arthritis, treatment recommendations include 28 days of doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil.

Although most patients with Lyme arthritis respond well to antibiotic therapy, a small percentage in the northeastern United States have persistent (post-infectious, antibiotic-refractory) arthritis for months or even for several years after receiving oral and IV antibiotic therapy for 2 or 3 months. Late neurological manifestations should be treated with ceftriaxone (2 g once per day) for 2 to 4 weeks.
