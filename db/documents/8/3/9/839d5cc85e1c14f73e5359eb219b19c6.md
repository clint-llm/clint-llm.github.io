Hypersensitivity reactions are very common. Fifteen percent of the world population will be affected by a type of allergic reaction during their lives. In the second half of this century, allergic diseases have increased. The cause of the increase is unknown, but it may reflect lifestyle changes, decreased breastfeeding, and air pollution. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that since IgE is no longer needed to protect against parasites in the Western world, the IgE-mast cell axis has evolved into a type I hypersensitivity reaction.

European data estimate that 0.3% of the population will be troubled by anaphylaxis at some point in their lives. In addition, 1 out of 3000 inpatients in the United States experiences a severe allergic reaction every year. However, the prevalence of bronchial asthma was 1.5% in Korea. Fernández-Soto et al. in 2018 reported that fungal infections could be as high as 50% in inner cities and constitute a risk factor predisposing to the development of allergic bronchial asthma.
