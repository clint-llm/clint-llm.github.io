First described in the anesthesia literature in the late 1980s, medical simulation has become an essential part of training in medical education at the undergraduate and graduate level, as well as in nursing and pharmacy education.

In situ simulation differs from a center-based simulation in that it occurs in the actual clinical environment, often using providers and staff who are currently on shift. Because it occurs in the real working environment, it provides opportunities for learning on the unit and organizational level as well.
