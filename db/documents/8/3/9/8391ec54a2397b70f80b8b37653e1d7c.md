The infection can spread, causing bony erosions and invasion of distant tissue, using the fascial planes and venous sinuses, with the involvement of the skull base and the surrounding tissue leading to cranial nerve and intracranial structures invasion.

When the infection reaches the temporal bone through the fissure of Santorini, it invades the stylomastoid and the jugular foramina, containing the facial, glossopharyngeal, vagal, and accessory nerves. On the other hand, the spread through the osteocartilaginous junction to the subtemporal area causes invasion of the retrocondylar fat, the parapharyngeal fat, temporomandibular joint, and the masticator.

The spread can be summarized as follows:

- **Anterior:**To masticator muscle, condylar bone marrow, parotid gland, facial nerve, temporal fossa, temporomandibular joint (TMJ), and the styloid foramen.

- **Medial/crossed:**To the parapharyngeal fat, nasopharyngeal muscle, glossopharyngeal, vagal and accessory nerves, sphenoid, clivus, jugular foramen, and petrous apex.

- **Intracranial:**When a dural enhancement is present in the intracranial compartment, the spread might reach sigmoid sinus, jugular vein, internal carotid artery, jugular fossa, and the dura.

- **Posteriorly:**To the mastoid process, however, there is no soft tissue invasion.

Intravascular involvement can be seen as well, which is more common in fungal MOE; however, fungal MOE usually does not affect the temporal bone.
