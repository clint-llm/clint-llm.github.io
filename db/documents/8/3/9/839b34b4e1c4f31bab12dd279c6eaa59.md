Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord is a preventable and treatable disease. Prophylactic vitamin B12 administration is not routinely recommended and is only indicated in specific instances. Individuals who adhere to a strict vegan diet may deplete their vitamin B12 stores in 2-3 years due to inadequate dietary intake and hence require routine oral supplementation. This is especially important in the pre-conceptional counseling of women who are strictly vegan as the developing fetus requires vitamin B12 as well.

Vitamin B12 supplementation is recommended post gastric or bariatric surgery due to the absence of intrinsic factor, which is physiologically produced by the parietal cells of the stomach. It is also recommended post resection of ileum due to loss of absorptive surface for vitamin B12. In patients undergoing surgeries where nitrous oxide is used as an inhalational anesthetic, monitoring of complete blood count and prompt intervention is appropriate as nitrous oxide can cause inactivation of methylcobalamin.
