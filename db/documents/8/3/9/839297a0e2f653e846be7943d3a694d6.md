Some KBS features (i.e., hyperorality, placidity, hypermetamorphosis) persist indefinitely, whereas others gradually resolve over several years.

The clinical course of the disease varies among the case reports.

KBS occurring secondary to epileptic seizures, infections, and traumatic brain injuries may have a better prognosis as many of the damages would be reversible if recognized early and managed appropriately.
