Methylprednisolone may be administered orally with food or milk to decrease gastrointestinal adverse effects. Administration may also be intramuscularly or intravenously. When administered intramuscularly (in the form of methylprednisolone acetate or succinate), the administration should not be into the deltoid muscle due to evidence of subcutaneous atrophy. Injections into the dermis should be avoided, and injection should not be into areas that have evidence of acute local infection.

Intravenous administration of methylprednisolone (in the form of methylprednisolone succinate) is rate dependent upon the dose and severity of the condition. Most commonly, with intermittent infusion, methylprednisolone is administered over 15 to 60 minutes. The administration of large doses should be over at least 30 to 60 minutes.

There are reports of hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and sudden death when methylprednisolone administration occurs under 30 minutes in doses greater than or equal to 250 mg.

The onset of action of intravenous methylprednisolone succinate is within 1 hour, while intra-articular administration of methylprednisone acetate is of 1 week, with a duration of 1 to 5 weeks. Methylprednisolone has an oral bioavailability of 88% approximately. The half-life elimination of intravenous methylprednisolone is of 0.25 hours, with an oral half-life of 2-5 hours. It has hepatic metabolism and undergoes urinary excretion.
