Electronic nicotine delivery systems come in an array of designs. The primary differences are in nicotine concentration, the variety of additives and flavorings, battery type, and superficial aesthetics. The classic e-cigarette consists of a compact lithium-ion battery, a vaporization chamber, and a solvent mixture cartridge.

Particularly popular among youth consumers are the “pod-mod” class of devices that resemble a slick and modern universal serial bus drive. These super-compact vaporizers can deliver highly concentrated puffs at levels that would be aversive to even chronic tobacco users.
