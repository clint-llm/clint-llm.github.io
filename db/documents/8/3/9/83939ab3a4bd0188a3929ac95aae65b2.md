Full-thickness burns affect the normal function of the skin: temperature regulation, perspiration, skin elasticity, sensory function, and infection barrier. Circumferential full-thickness burns with resultant loss of skin elasticity can produce a tourniquet effect on limbs and trunk, which can lead to compromised distal perfusion, airway obstruction, and poor respiratory effort. All of which could lead to limb- or life-threatening situations, which may be avoided through early and adequate burn resuscitation, including escharotomy, to release circumferential full-thickness burns.
