Some of the normal anatomic variations of the cingulate gyrus include a single cingulate sulcus or double parallel cingulate sulci. MRI-volumetric studies on normal brains showed no significant volume asymmetries between the left and right hemispheres, except in the cingulate gyrus, which was larger on the left. Pujol et al. studied the brains of 100 healthy subjects and found larger right ACC to be more frequent in females than males.
