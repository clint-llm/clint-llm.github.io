This activity describes the cause, presentation, and diagnosis of nasal septal hematoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of nasal septal hematoma.
- Describe the presentation of nasal septal hematoma.
- Summarize the treatment options for nasal septal hematoma.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by nasal septal hematoma.
