The most frequently reported adverse drug reaction with amoxicillin are nausea, vomiting, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse drug reactions such as hives, angioedema, and anaphylaxis is low.

Doxycycline is an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate penicillin, cephalosporin, or macrolide. A serious reaction from a single dose of doxycycline is infrequent. There is a risk of a serious cardiovascular event, especially torsades des pointes with ventricular tachycardia, from azithromycin use in patients with a prolonged QTc interval of >450 milliseconds as detected by ECG. Therefore, azithromycin should be used with caution in patients with a prolonged QTc interval.

Clinicians should prescribe antibiotics for prophylaxis as per patient age, risk factors, comorbid conditions, and concomitant medicines. Amoxicillin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions to penicillin antibiotics. Doxycycline use is contraindicated in pediatric patients and pregnant women. Macrolides are contraindicated in patients with existing cardiac arrhythmia and concomitant drugs that can prolong QTc interval.
