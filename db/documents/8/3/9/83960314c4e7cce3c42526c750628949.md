A complete history and physical examination is part of the secondary survey which is done once the patient is stabilized. The patientâ€™s age or clinical condition may preclude them from relaying details of the trauma, so physicians should seek information from a family member, other witnesses of the trauma, and EMS workers. The mnemonic AMPLE can capture important information to obtain about the patient and the clinical scenario:

- Allergies the patient has

- Medications the patient is on

- Past medical history

- Last time the patient ate

- Events related to the sustained trauma (and any intervention by EMS)

Healthcare professionals should seek a detailed mechanism of injury because important information can be gleaned from even seemingly trivial statements.

Waddell triad occurs as a result of a high energy impact; therefore, a clinician's primary goal during the initial physical exam should be to rule out associated injuries and subsequently treat all injuries requiring emergency care.
