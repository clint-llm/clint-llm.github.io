Clinicians need to have a high clinical suspicion for this condition in patients with risk factors.

Treatment of this condition requires an interprofessional team consisting of a hepatologist/gastroenterologist, hematologist, vascular surgeon, transplant hepatologist, interventional radiologist, and transplant surgeon.

A hematologist might be consulted for an opinion regarding an underlying hematologic condition if no other predisposing condition is evident.

In those with acute liver failure, admission and management in an intensive care unit (ICU) is warranted, with evaluation by a vascular surgeon, transplant hepatologist, interventional radiologist, and transplant surgeon. A liver transplant should be considered.

In patients with an acute form with an identifiable clot, thrombolytic therapy is advisable.

Routine stenting with angioplasty was found to be superior to angioplasty only for preventing restenosis in one study.

Once the condition has resolved, patients should be counseled regarding the need for continuing lifelong anticoagulation and proper follow-up.
