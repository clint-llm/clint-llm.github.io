Triage is the sorting and categorizing of patients based on clinical severity to maximize the results for the most number of patients when there are limited resources available.  It is a tried and true method that is used in multiple scenarios in multiple practice environments throughout the world.  Most are familiar with the process of triage upon initial arrival of patients to a medical facility or upon arrival to the scene when there are multiple casualties.  Triage in these situations involves using the START method or similar clinically based tool tailored to the individual practice environment such as emergency departments and refined during training events as discussed in separate articles.  Triage, however, does not stop after the first iteration.  It must be continually used and reevaluated during any transition of care or when resources or situations change.

When patients arrive at a treatment area, they undergo triage as discussed above.  What this article will cover is the process of triage prior to moving patients out from one area of care to another.  This is done to prioritize which patients are to be moved first and determines by what means they are transported based on available resources, acuity of the patients, and treatments or monitoring needed in route; hence the term "evacuation triage."
