A boxed warning cautions that thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and other thrombotic complications have been reported with concurrent administration of aPCC greater than 100 U/kg within 24 hours in patients taking emicizumab.

In emergent cases of bleeding, when the benefit of aPCC exceeds the risk of inducing a pro-coagulable state, clinicians should monitor patients for thrombotic microangiopathy and thromboembolism and discontinue aPCC if symptoms occur. Using both rFVIIa and emicizumab hypothetically should increase the risk for thrombotic complications. However, several pharmaceutical manufacturers have analyzed the data from the HAVEN study, which concluded that rFVIIa use in the context of emicizumab prophylaxis did not change the rFVIIa safety profile as described in the product information.
