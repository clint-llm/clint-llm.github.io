The prevalence of the disease is estimated to be 1 per million. However, due to under-recognition and misdiagnosis, the prevalence may be much higher than the estimated value.

As the disease is widely underrecognized, it is not often diagnosed in the early stages of life, and the average age of diagnosis is 16 years. Many patients are diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and even go on to receive a splenectomy. Hence, it is imperative to understand the presenting features and pathophysiology of BSS to correctly diagnose the disease.
