Anterior mediastinotomy (the Chamberlain procedure) is surgical entry to the mediastinum via an incision in the parasternal 2nd left intercostal space. The use of this technique is decreasing and very specific now. EBUS and other techniques have replaced the mediastinotomy except for certain instances. The procedure is used for obtaining enough viable tissue for histologic confirmation of a diagnosis or obtaining enough viable tissue for cultures in the cases of infection. The primary significance is with obtaining tissue that supports an accurate staging of lung carcinoma, which has AP window node involvement or enlargement.
