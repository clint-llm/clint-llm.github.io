The embryological development of the costocervical trunk follows the development of the subclavian artery on both sides. The development of the costocervical trunk is unique to each side since the development of the right and left subclavian arteries are different. The left subclavian artery arises only from the seventh intersegmental artery, while the right subclavian artery develops from three different embryological vessels. The fourth aortic arch gives rise to the first part of the subclavian artery. The right dorsal aorta gives rise to the second part of the right subclavian artery. The right seventh intersegmental artery gives rise to the last part of the subclavian artery.
