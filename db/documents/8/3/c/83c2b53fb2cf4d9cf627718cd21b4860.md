Clinicians should have a low threshold for referring children with a known history of adoption, abuse, foster, or institutional care to a child psychologist or psychiatrist for a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment detailing the child’s history, description of the symptoms over time, and direct observation of the parent-child interaction.  Attachment behaviors and signs of secure attachment (e.g., comfort-seeking, good eye contact, child-initiated interaction) should be assessed at every visit. Clinicians should maintain a low threshold for referral to a child development specialist, a child psychiatrist, or a child psychologist.
