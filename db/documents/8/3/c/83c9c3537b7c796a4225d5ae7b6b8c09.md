Patients that develop radiation esophagitis may have a history of poor initial performance status, low body mass index, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and dysphagia. In addition, patients with esophageal infiltrated tumors or late-stage cancer have an increased risk of radiation esophagitis.

When examining a patient with a history of cancer with radiation therapy, it is always important to ask about symptoms of the recurrent disease, i.e., weight loss, worsening respiratory status, dysphagia, or hoarseness. Clinicians should evaluate the oral mucosa extensively, looking for signs of thrush or lesions, evaluate for lymphadenopathy, and perform a thorough respiratory exam.

Common symptoms include dysphagia, nausea, anorexia, and odynophagia.
