Sinus squeeze, also known as barosinusitis and aerosinusitis, is irritation of the mucosal lining in the paranasal sinuses as a result of the failure to equalize intrasinus pressures with the ambient environment pressure. Sinus squeeze is associated with rapid ascent or descent while scuba diving, rapid altitude changes during flights, and hyperbaric treatments. Symptoms include pain, epistaxis, lacrimation, and rhinorrhea. Pain is the most common symptom, and the frontal sinuses are most commonly affected. Referred tooth pain can occur when the maxillary sinuses are involved.
