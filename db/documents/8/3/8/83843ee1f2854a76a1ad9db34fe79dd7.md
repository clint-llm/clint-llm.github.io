Management of a novel illness like COVID-19 during pregnancy and puerperium is challenging, as one generally faces difficult decisions regarding the use of ionizing radiation, potentially fetotoxic therapeutics, and the possibilities of poor outcomes if the aforementioned therapeutics are not used. The changing evidence from the start of the pandemic has now alerted the medical community to the possibility of progression to severe disease and worse maternal and fetal outcomes. Therefore, it is essential to have an evidence-based approach, or at the very least a scientifically rational approach where evidence is lacking, while offering medical services to this unique group of individuals. This activity reviews the prevention, evaluation, and management of COVID-19 in pregnancy and puerperium, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving the care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the treatment considerations for pregnant patients or those in the puerperium with COVID-19 and how they compare to non-pregnant individuals.
- Outline the management considerations for pregnant patients with COVID-19 regarding their pregnancy.
- Identify the risk factors for developing severe COVID-19 in pregnancy and the puerperium. 
- Summarize the common preventive measures for contracting COVID-19 or developing severe COVID-19 in pregnancy and puerperium.
