SCLC is divided into the 2 subtypes: oat cell carcinoma and combined-SCLC. Combined SCLC is defined as SCLC with non-small cell components such as squamous cell or adenocarcinoma.

SCLC carcinogenesis can occur by various pathways that disrupt normal DNA repair mechanisms. Common mutations in SCLC include loss of RB1 tumor suppressor gene and TP53(17p13) mutations which decrease the pro-apoptotic activity of cancer cells. Almost all SCLC tumors have a deletion in a section of the short arm of chromosome 3p which contains the tumor suppressor gene FHIT.
