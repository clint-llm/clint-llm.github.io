Prognosis for C. psittacosis depends largely on the patient's baseline health status, the severity of disease, and early diagnosis and treatment. Full recovery may take from 6 to 8 weeks, including residual changes on chest films. Per the CDC, the current mortality rate in the United States is less than 1% with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
