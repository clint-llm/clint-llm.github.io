Secondary hyperparathyroidism is common among patients with vitamin D deficiency and chronic kidney disease. Since about half of the world population is vitamin D deficient, and about 1/7 have CKD, it is important to understand the condition in depth. Calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D metabolism are affected in secondary hyperparathyroidism. This leads to several bone-mineralization disorders, renal osteodystrophy, and calcifications in extraosseous sites, including coronary calcifications that can lead to devastating cardiovascular outcomes and increased mortality. Thus, it is important to detect this disorder early and start therapy. Medical treatments include vitamin D analogs, calcimimetics, and phosphate binders to restore calcium, phosphorus, and the PTH levels within normal range. Early consultation with nephrologists is important to manage the outcomes. Surgery is the last option if patients do not respond to appropriate medical treatments.
