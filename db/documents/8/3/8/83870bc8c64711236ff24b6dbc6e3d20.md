A completed polio vaccine series confers high levels of immunity. After three doses of the standard four-dose series of the inactivated polio vaccine, efficacy stands at 99% to 100%. The fourth and completing dose is given as a booster between the ages of 4 and 6 years of age. No long-term monitoring of immunity is recommended, and no routine post-administration tests are recommended.

Duration of protection is unknown but is suspected to last years after completion of the primary vaccine series.

In regions of the world where polio morbidity is high and immunity is conferred mainly through the oral poliovirus vaccine series, booster doses in addition to the four-dose series may be warranted.
