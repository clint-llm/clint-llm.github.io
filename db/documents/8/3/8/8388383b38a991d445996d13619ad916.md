Do not assume an ankle has a simple sprain and forget to get an x-ray evaluation of pediatric ankle injuries. The physis is not as strong as ligamentous structures, and physeal fractures occur before ligamentous injuries occur. The significance of Tillaux fracture is that it involves a major weight-bearing joint with the consequence of posttraumatic arthritis in cases where articular congruity is not restored. Posttraumatic arthritis develops as rapidly as 4 years post the injury.
