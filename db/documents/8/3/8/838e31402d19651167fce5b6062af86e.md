As highlighted earlier, a western blot has a considerable amount of steps. This lengthy process drives up the time and cost needed for accurate results. However, unlike an ELISA, the western blot is less likely to give false-positive results, especially in diagnosing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Western blotting is used to detect anti-HIV antibodies in human serum and urine samples.

The western blot is also useful in detecting Lyme disease and atypical and typical bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

The western blotting procedure determines the presence or absence, size, and abundance of target proteins in a sample which is beneficial for various scientific reasons across many fields of study.

As western blotting is an antibody-based method, the technique often supports and produces reliable results for detecting non-infectious diseases using high throughput screening. For example, when determining cancers, incongruous isoforms of proteins can become potential markers of the pathology of the disease.

Some proteins are engineered, through molecular cloning, to contain short sequences of amino acids that serve as a tag. Common tags include the HA-tag and the Myc-tag. These tags serve as a foreign protein epitope that does not naturally occur in the biological system being studied.
