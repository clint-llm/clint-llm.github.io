Lung development traditionally subdivides into three main periods: embryonic, fetal, and postnatal. The major airways form during the embryonic period at 4 to 7 weeks. The rest of the airways form during the fetal period, with the bronchial tree developing between 5 and 17 weeks, and the most distal airways form between 16 and 26 weeks.

At the start of bronchial tree formation, the lung looks like a tubular gland. At 4 to 7 weeks, outgrowth and branching of the terminal bud occur, creating bronchial buds, which will later become bronchi. The bronchial buds then bifurcate, ultimately resulting in the formation of bronchioles. This branching continues, and by approximately 26 weeks, the first 20 generations of airways are evident.

Fetal breathing movements begin around week 10 in humans. These breathing movements allow for amniotic fluid to move in and out of the lungs, resulting in the stretching of the lung tissue, which ultimately increases the caliber of the airways.
