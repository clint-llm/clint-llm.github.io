The diagnosis and management of BDD can be challenging and is best done with an interprofessional team that includes a nurse practitioner, primary care provider, an emergency department physician, and an infectious disease expert. The key is to drain and obtain fluid for culture from the bullae. However, it is important to know thatÂ BDD can coexist with and may be secondary to clinically indiscernible bacterial infections of the upper and lower respiratory or gastrointestinal tract, which underlines the need for systemic antibiotic therapy. The condition is always treated with oral antibiotics and the pharmacist should ensure that there is compliance with therapy. For those treated promptly the outcomes are good but when there is a lack of compliance with antibiotics, the infection can have an aggressive course.
