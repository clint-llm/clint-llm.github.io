MODY 2 (GCK) patients generally have a good prognosis as a result of the relatively mild hyperglycemia and low complication rates.

MODY 3 (HNF1A) patients have similar complication rates and prognosis to type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. This is the case with most subtypes of MODY, with the exception of MODY 2, which has the best prognosis.

MODY 5 (HNF1B) patients have a propensity of developing end-stage kidney disease requiring renal replacement therapy independent of diabetic nephropathy. This is because the affected gene is involved in the organogenesis of multiple organs, including the kidneys.
