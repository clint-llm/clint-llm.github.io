Glioblastoma multiforme is an aggressive and most common primary brain cancer. It develops from a type of brain cell called the glial cell. As the tumor grows, it causes pressure on surrounding brain cells resulting in symptoms like headache, seizures, memory problems, personality changes, vision, language difficulty, weakness, and paralysis. Some of the symptoms may mimic a stroke.

It is unknown what causes GBM. Studies reported that a history of radiation treatment in early life could increase the risk of getting it.

GBM is diagnosed by CT/MRI, followed by biopsy for confirmation. If the imaging shows the typical appearance and other characteristics, then the suspicion of GBM is high. In such cases, surgical resection is preferred after extensive discussion with the patient, family, and medical and surgical oncology teams.

The mainstay of treatment includes radiotherapy and chemotherapy after surgical resection. Given its aggressive nature, even with maximal therapy, GBM has poor overall survival and a high rate of recurrence. Survival rate ranges from one to two years in most patients. Due to high recurrence, frequent follow-ups with repeat imaging are recommended even after completion of treatment.

Research is going on regarding the use of various new medications. Patients with GBM can participate in clinical trials.
