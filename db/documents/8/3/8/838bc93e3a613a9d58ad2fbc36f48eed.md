Lens abscess is a rare clinical entity usually diagnosed only by an experienced cornea or a cataract surgeon. Surgeons play a crucial role in diagnosing and managing these cases. The nurses help recruit the patient to the clinic, assist in slit lamp evaluation, visual acuity evaluation, intraocular pressure management, staining the eye, and counseling the patient.
