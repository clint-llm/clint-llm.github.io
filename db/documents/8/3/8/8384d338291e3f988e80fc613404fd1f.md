In preparation for an electrosurgical procedure, the surrounding skin should be cleansed with an antiseptic agent such as chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine. Alcohol should be avoided or allowed to dry completely as can it may ignite with electrosurgery. Local anesthetics should also be administered prior to electrosurgery, with few exceptions, such as treatment of small facial telangiectasias. A nerve block may be a better option for a rhinophyma repair or more extensive procedures.

The operator should ensure sterile sleeves are placed over the wand handle, and new disposable electrode tips should be utilized. Eye protection, gloves, and masks should be worn by both the operator and the surgical assistants to prevent exposure to smoke-borne organisms or potential mutagens. Smoke evacuation should be ready to remove this smoke plume with electrosection procedures. Smoke evacuators with a high-efficiency particulate air filter and a capture velocity of approximately 100 to 150 feet per minute are recommended. It should be held within 2 inches of the surgical site to collect the airborne contaminants.

The operator should determine the proper settings for the particular procedure prior to starting the case.
