Vincristine use is contraindicated in patients with demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome. While documentation of allergenic cross-reactivity for drugs within this class is limited, cross-sensitivity cannot be ruled out due to the similarities in chemical structures and pharmacological actions.

**US Boxed Warnings**:

**Experienced physician:**

Administration of vincristine should be by individuals with experience in administering the drug.

**Extravasation:**

Intravenous (IV) needle or catheter must be in proper position before infusion or injection of any of the medication. Improper positioning may lead to leakage into the surrounding tissue during IV administration. Leakage may cause considerable irritation. Therefore, injection or infusion must be discontinued immediately if extravasation occurs.

**For IV use only:**

Vincristine is indicated for IV use only. It is fatal if given by any other routes. Vincristine administered by intrathecal routes usually results in death. Therefore, all syringes containing vincristine must be labeled and have the provided auxiliary sticker attached. The auxiliary label must state, " For intravenous use only. Fatal if given by other routes."
