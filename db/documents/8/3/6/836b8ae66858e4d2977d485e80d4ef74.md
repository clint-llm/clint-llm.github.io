Subungual melanoma occurs because there is increased melanin production by the melanocytes. When activated, the melanocytes differentiate into matrix cells and migrate distally.

Melanocytes in the nail unit are lower than in normal skin. Moreover, melanonychia usually involves the distal nail matrix. Melanocyte dormancy in the proximal matrix results in a lower potential for involvement with melanonychia. However, almost half of the melanocytes in the distal matrix have the potential to become activated. Accordingly, longitudinal melanonychia results from one of the following events; 1. activation of previously dormant proximal melanocytes or 2. proliferation of melanocytes in the distal nail matrix.

Melanocytic activation might occur during the following circumstances; 1. physiologically in darkly pigmented skin individuals; 2. hormonally stimulated during pregnancy; or 3. in response to inflammatory or infectious stimuli of the nail unit (including but not limited to nail psoriasis, and nail lichen planus), 4. drugs adverse effects, 5. repetitive frictional trauma, or 6. systemic disorders (Laugier-Hunziker syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Melanocytic activation ("functional melanonychia," "melanocytic stimulation," or "hyper melanosis") causes an increase in melanic pigmentation of the nail matrix epithelium without a concurrent increase in the number of melanocytes.

Melanocytic hyperplasia (matrix melanocyte proliferation) is a less frequent cause of longitudinal melanonychia and occurs in only three situations: nevus, lentigo, and melanoma—benign melanocytic hyperplasia results in lentigines and nevi of the nail matrix. Malignant melanocytic hyperplasia includes in situ and invasive melanoma of the nail apparatus.
