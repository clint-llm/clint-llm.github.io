Diagnosis of lipedema is often difficult to differentiate from obesity. According to the WHO guidelines, people with a BMI of> 25kg/m^2 are considered overweight, and a BMI of > 30 kg/m^2 are considered obese. In lipedema patients, BMI is elevated, but differentiating points like diet and exercise favor obesity, whereas disproportionate fat distribution between above and below the trunk, tissue tenderness, and easy bruising favors lipedema. In fact, lipedema can be complicated by obesity or lymphedema later in life.

**Classification**

Lipedema is classified into stages and types. Stage 1 represents the normal skin surface over a thick and nodular hypodermis, but pea-sized fat nodules can be palpated. These nodules are fibrosed and enlarged structures in the extracellular matrix and connective tissue surrounding the fat lobule. In this stage, skin appearance is normal, skin is smooth on palpation, but nodules can be felt and are potentially associated with pain or easy bruising. Stage 2 represents uneven skin surface over hypodermal masses.

Dimpling of the skin, indentations, and mattress-like patterns on the skin is thickening and contraction of connective tissue over increased fat. Stage 3 represents lobular extrusions of skin, fat, and facia tissue. Inflammation and fibrosis of adipofascia result in loss of elasticity; therefore, blood flow and lymph flow out of lobules is reduced. In this stage, the appearance of both lower extremities can be columnar, visible large folds of skin and fat are palpable due to fibrosis in the tissues and loose connection to the underlying hypodermis. This may compromise the integrity of joints, mobility, and balance. Stage 4 is often classified when lipedema is associated with lymphedema, also called lipo-lymphedema.

Types of lipedema are classified based on anatomical locations. Type I lipedema fat is distributed from the umbilicus to the hips, including the pelvis and buttocks. Type II includes fat distribution from around the pelvis to the knees. Type III includes from around the pelvis to ankles with a prominent cuff at the ankle sparing dorsum of the feet. Type IV includes from shoulders to wrists. Type V is a rare occurrence that involves fat distribution from or below knees extends through ankles sparing the dorsum of feet. Type II & IV or III & IV are common combinations. Involvement of arm can be varied in fat distribution from either from elbows to wrists or from shoulders to wrists.
