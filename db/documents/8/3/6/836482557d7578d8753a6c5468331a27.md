Hyams et al. developed the most widely used grading system for esthesioneuroblastoma.

The Kadish staging system is an effective means to predict disease-free survival and is widely accepted. It includes the following groups:

- Group A tumors: are limited to the nasal cavity

- Group B tumors: extend only to the paranasal sinus

- Group C tumors: extend beyond the nasal cavity and sinuses

A modified Kadish system includes group D tumors, which have distant metastasis or cervical lymphadenopathy.

Dulguerov also proposed a TNM (tumor/nodes/metastasis) style staging system allowing the inclusion of nodal status. This system was later reported to correlate closely with survival and recurrence.
