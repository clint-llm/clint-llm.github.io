A thorough discussion with a patient before the procedure includes the following:

- A detailed explanation of the procedure

- The potential level of discomfort/pain

- A comprehensive evaluation of the skin entry site

- Prior medical conditions or surgeries that might affect the procedure, to include joint prosthesis

- Potential diagnoses resulting from the procedure

- Possible complications of the procedure

Prior to beginning the fluoroscopic procedure, all involved personnel must don appropriate lead aprons. The patient is placed in a comfortable supine position. The patient's arm is placed in external rotation with the palm of the hand up. A small weight can be placed on the patient's palm to maintain this position throughout the procedure. A brief fluoroscopic image is obtained with a metallic marker stick overlying the superomedial quadrant of the humeral head immediately lateral to the humeral head cortex. This approach also allows the operator to visualize the proposed needle skin trajectory. The skin is then marked at the proposed site of entry. The skin site is prepared via standard sterile technique.

If the acromioclavicular joint is being accessed, the metallic marker stick serves to localize the acromioclavicular joint capsule, and the overlying skin is marked. The skin site is prepared via standard sterile technique.
