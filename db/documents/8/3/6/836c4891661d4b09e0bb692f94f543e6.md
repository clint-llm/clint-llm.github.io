The specimen collection varies with the sample chosen for testing. The diagnosis requires a combination of laboratory tests, including measuring red cell indices, Hb analysis, and quantifying HbF and HbA2. Whole blood is collected in EDTA vials, and samples are sent for a complete blood profile, electrophoresis, red cell indices, and molecular testing.
