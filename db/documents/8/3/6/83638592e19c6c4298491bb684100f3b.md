An interprofessional care team of nurses, allied health professionals, and physicians must maintain a collaborative and communicative environment to achieve positive patient outcomes. Regarding the Snellen chart, the interprofessional team often includes primary care physicians, hospitalists, ophthalmologists, optometrists, technicians, and nurses. Standardized testing procedures, as outlined above, as well as consistent reporting of visual acuity measurements, provide greater reliability of Snellen chart test results. An example of this can be seen in the case of a hospitalist testing the visual acuity of a temporal arteritis patient in dim lighting and reporting theÂ acuity as 20/70. In contrast, the next day, the ophthalmologist uses the Snellen chart in good lighting and measures the patient's acuity to be 20/50. Despite the progression of vision loss overnight, the Snellen chart results misleadingly suggest an improvement in visual acuity because of the lack of standardization in testing procedures.
