The brain depends on a constant energy supply provided by glucose and oxygen but is unable to store energy. With the cessation of blood flow, intracellular production of adenosine triphosphate is diminished. This results in the dysfunction of energy-dependent ion channels, which contributes to intracellular sodium accumulation and cytotoxic edema. Ongoing ischemia results in the release of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, which promotes calcium influx throughÂ N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Calcium influx exacerbates neuronal injury by activating lytic enzymes, precipitating free radical formation, and interfering with mitochondrial function. This process, known as excitotoxicity, can ultimately lead to cell death.
