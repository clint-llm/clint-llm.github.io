Although only a single translocation defines MCL, there are several morphologic variations that one must know. In lymph nodes, there is often diffuse or nodular effacement of the lymph node. MCL may also show expansion of the mantle zones with a monocytoid appearance surrounding reactive germinal centers. Often pink histiocytes may be mixed with lymphoma cells (see image). Pathologic exam with samples from tissue biopsy is essential for the diagnosis of MCL, which typically shows small lymphocytes with cells characterized by notched nuclei in, small cell, or blastoid variant type.

The cytology of the cells is highly variable as well. In tissue, cells may appear small and mature with irregular nuclei, but in the blastoid variant, they may appear immature with fine chromatin mimicking acute leukemia. The pleomorphic variant shows a marked variation in nuclear size and shape. The proliferation index and mitotic are also highly variable. In blood and bone marrow aspirate smears, lymphoma cells may have discrete vacuoles, which may be a clue in subtle cases.
