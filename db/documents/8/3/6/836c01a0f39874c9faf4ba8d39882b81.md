Complications of muscle and myocutaneous flaps include infection, partial or total flap loss, seroma or hematoma of donor and recipient sites, fat necrosis, and wound dehiscence. Specific flaps such as the TRAM flap may lead to hernia or significant abdominal laxity, while latissimus dorsi donor sites are notorious for seroma formation if not adequately drained.
