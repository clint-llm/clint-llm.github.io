Surgical management can be considered in stage I lesions that are amenable to hysterectomy with upper vaginectomy and lymph node dissection. Ideally, the lesions will be present in the apex of the posterior fornix of the vagina. Lower lesions can be approached with vulva-vaginectomy, but this procedure is uncommon due to its complex nature and associated complications. For young women with vaginal cancer requiring radiation as primary treatment, ovarian transposition can be offered before definitive radiation treatment to prevent the adverse effects of radiation-induced menopause. In selected patients, laparoscopic or extraperitoneal removal of bulky lymph nodes can be done as part of staging and treatment planning.
