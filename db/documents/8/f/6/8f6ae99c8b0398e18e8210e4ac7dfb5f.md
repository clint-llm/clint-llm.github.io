Sometimes confused for melanoma on visual examination, most melanoacanthomas were surgically removed either at the time of biopsy or subsequently by simple excision. Partial removal during the biopsy of a melanoacanthoma has resulted in the persistence of the preauricular lesion in one patient.

Melanoacanthoma is benign epithelial neoplasms. Hence, other therapeutic interventional modalities that result in the removal of the epidermis should effectively treat the lesion. Therefore, cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen, particularly for smaller lesions and curettage, are potential options that might be considered.

Topical 5-fluorouracil 5% cream was used to treat smaller lesions in a 58-year-old woman with multiple melanoacanthomas. She applied the medication twice daily for four weeks. However, the cream was discontinued since it caused a burning sensation at the application sites, and there was not any significant improvement of the melanoacanthomas.
