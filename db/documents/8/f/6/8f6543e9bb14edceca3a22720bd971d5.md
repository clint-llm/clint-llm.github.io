Follicular lymphoma is differentiated from other types of lymphomas based on nodular pattern, absence of tangible body macrophages, monoclonal cells, and immunophenotyping (i-e, CD10, BCL-2, BCL-6). Following are the differential diagnosis of follicular lymphoma,

- Follicular colonization by other low-grade lymphomas

- Mantle cell lymphoma with a diffuse pattern

- Marginal zone B cell lymphoma

- Peripheral T cell lymphoma

- Reactive hyperplasia

- Small lymphocytic lymphoma/ chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL / CLL)
