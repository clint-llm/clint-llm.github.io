The primary blood supply of the hand comes from the deep palmar and superficial palmar arches. The superficial branch of the radial artery forms anastomoses with the superficial palmar arch. The deep branch of the radial artery runs through the dorsal interossei muscle and anastomoses at the deep palmar arch. The ulnar artery divides into a deep branch which anastomoses with the deep palmar arch, and a superficial branch which ends at the superficial palmar arch. This anastomosing network allows for blood supply coming from multiple directions allowing for vast collateral blood supply to prevent ischemic injury

The lymphatic system creates a pathway for lymphatic drainage from the distal fingertips to the lymph nodes found in the lateral axilla. The pathway originates from capillaries in the fingertip and palms. The lymphatic vessels then travel on the dorsal aspect of the hand. The lymph vessels are found just posterior to the cutaneous veins. The lymph pathway continues up the arm and runs parallel to the basilic vein until the lymphatic system connects to the lymph nodes in the lateral axillary region. The hand is a common site for lymphedema to occur which can hinder the function of the hand muscles described in this article.
