The pancreas is made up of three parts: a head, body, and tail. The head receives its blood supply from the superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries, while branches from the splenic artery supply the body and tail. It has both exocrine and endocrine functions. A network of open circulation exists between the exocrine and endocrine pancreas physically linking the two via an integrated vascular system.

Islet cells are clusters of cells that are found throughout the pancreas and are responsible for its endocrine function. Islet cells are made up of five different types of cells, each secreting a unique hormone. Alpha cells secrete glucagon, delta somatostatin, beta insulin, gamma pancreatic polypeptide, and epsilon ghrelin. These hormones are secreted directly into the bloodstream in response to various stimuli.
