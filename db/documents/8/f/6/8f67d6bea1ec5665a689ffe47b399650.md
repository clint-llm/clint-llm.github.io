Nurses who dispense antiepileptic drugs should always check the dose and the route of administration independently. In addition, nurses should read about the potential side effects of the drugs and educate the patient. This ensures extra safety for patients. If a dose does not appear reasonable, the nurse should contact the prescribing clinician immediately.
