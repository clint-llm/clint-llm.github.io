The differential diagnosis of a soft tissue mass is rather wide, ranging from benign conditions to metastatic disease. In general, benign lesions tend to be superficial in the dermal or subcutaneous soft tissue; however, this is not definitive. A partial list of potential diagnosis for a soft tissue mass are listed below. Ultimately, a high-quality biopsy and imaging will aid in establishing the diagnosis.

**Benign**

- Acrochordons

- Lipoma

- Myositis ossificans (look for a history of physical trauma)

- Hemangioma

- Keloids

- Dermoid cyst

- Ganglion cyst

- Pilonidal cyst

- Angiofibroma

- Neurofibromas

- Rickets

**Infectious**

- Abcess

- Cellulitis

**Malignant**

- Squamous cell carcinoma

- Melanoma

- Basal cell carcinoma

- Merkel cell carcinoma

- Skin metastasis

- Keratoacanthoma

- Cutaneous lymphoma

- Nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissues sarcoma

- Kaposi sarcoma

- Pediatric neuroblastoma

- Pediatric non-Hodgkin lymphoma

- Pediatric osteomyelitis

- Pediatric osteosarcoma

- Pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma

- Ewings sarcoma

- Soft tissue sarcoma
