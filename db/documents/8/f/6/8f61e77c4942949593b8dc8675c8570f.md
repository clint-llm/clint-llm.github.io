Inheritance of pili annulati is via an autosomal dominant pattern with variable expression. A locus responsible for pili annulati was mapped on the end of the telomeric region of chromosome 12q (24.32â€“24.33), but the responsible gene for the disease is not yet completely identified.

A report exists of a case of pili annulati associated with Rothmund-Thomson syndrome caused by a mutation in RECQL4.

The literature also describes sporadic cases.
