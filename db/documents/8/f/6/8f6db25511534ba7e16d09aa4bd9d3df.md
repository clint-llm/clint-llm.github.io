A thorough history and physical exam are crucial in the evaluation of PCS patients. Mechanism of injury, date of injury, loss of consciousness at the time of injury, the number of times injured and reported symptoms are all critical in the initial and subsequent evaluation. Past medical history is especially helpful for identifying patients who are at increased risk of PCS. Important past medical history to document includes headache history, history of depression, anxiety or mood disorders, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, insomnia, loss of concentration and memory, noise sensitivity, and chronic pain history. The physical exam should include a full neurological exam including evaluation of cranial nerves, visual acuity, reflexes, strength, proprioception, and sensation, and should be completed with each encounter.
