Microdontia often will produce teeth that are “conical” or “peg-shaped” in appearance, with most cases related to an underlying developmental or syndromic condition.

Macrodontia will present as generally larger teeth than expected, with generalized cases related to an underlying syndrome or systemic condition. Macrodontia of premolars, termed “molarization,” is an extremely rare condition where the premolar is large enough to appear as if it is a molar. There are only 36 documented cases in the literature.

Taurodontism is typically diagnosed radiographically at routine dental visits.

Fusion is the resultant “combined tooth” appearance where two normally separate tooth germs unite as one developing tooth. Depending on the stage of development when the fusion occurred, the fusion may be complete or incomplete. It is considered complete if the entire tooth continues to develop or incomplete if there is a fissure or cleft in the tooth surface.
