A few physiologic variants of abducens nerve anatomy have been documented. In a study of 20 cadaveric heads (40 nerves), three variants were found. Variation I was found in 70% of cases, which was where the abducens nerve was found to be a single trunk. Twenty percent of cases had variation II, branching of the nerve exclusively within the cavernous sinus. Lastly, 10% of cases had variation III, duplication of the abducens nerve.
