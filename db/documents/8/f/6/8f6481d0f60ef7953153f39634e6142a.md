The exact mechanism and cause of ileus are incompletely understood due to the complexity and numerous systems and factors involved. Ileus is a neuroimmune interaction that consists of two phases: the early neurogenic phase and the inflammatory phase.

Macrophages residing in the tunica muscularis external of the bowel wall release cytokines that induce the activation of further pro-inflammatory cells, other antiperistaltic cytokines (including interleukin-6 and TNF-alpha), along with neuropeptides and nitric oxide.
