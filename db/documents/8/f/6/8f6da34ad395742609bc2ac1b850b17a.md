Clonidine is a commonly prescribed biochemical derivative of imidazoline with a variety of clinical uses. It was originally developed as a nasal decongestant, but its main use has been as an anti-hypertensive agent.

Even at therapeutic doses, clonidine has a number of anticholinergic side effects that include dry mouth, constipation, and sedation. However, at toxic doses, it can cause hemodynamic instability and depression.
