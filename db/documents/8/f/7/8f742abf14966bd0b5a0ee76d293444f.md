Patients should be advised to avoid precipitating causes of angioneurotic edema if known. Precipitant drugs should be discontinued if implicated and sought to be replaced with another medication in drug-induced ANE patients. ANE patients who have severe attacks requiring epinephrine should be discharged with EpiPen prescription. HANE patients should be referred to an immunologist and will need to be followed-up in an allergy clinic for a formal diagnosis.
