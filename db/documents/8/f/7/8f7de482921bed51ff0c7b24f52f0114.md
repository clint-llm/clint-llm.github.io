The definitive diagnosis of laryngeal papilloma is a biopsy of the lesion with HPV typing. The malignant transformation of laryngeal papilloma into squamous cell carcinoma can occur in up to 1%Â to 4% of the cases and depends mostly on the HPV typing and is more common in adults. Even though low-risk HPV 6 and 11 are most commonly related to the condition, high-risk HPV 16 and 18 can be present.

Due to the benign course of the disease, imaging modalities are normally not required. Yet, a computed tomography (CT) scan can be useful in evaluating pulmonary papillomatosis or any other respiratory lesion preoperatively.
