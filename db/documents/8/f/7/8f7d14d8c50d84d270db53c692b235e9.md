Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis is a sporadic form of hypokalemic periodic paralysis, which most commonly presents as sudden onset weakness in the proximal muscles. It is a reversible condition that can be treated with quick replacement of potassium and normalization of thyroid hormones. Interprofessional communication by the total team is essential to timely treat these patients and minimize complications.

Pharmacists should be very vigilant when dispensing intravenous potassium, and they should clearly label the instructions about how to infuse the drug, as it can cause complications, including local skin reactions to severe complications like fatal arrhythmias if given too fast. Nursing staff should double-check the instructions on electrolyte infusion bags to prevent complications. The patients need to be carefully monitored for any rebound symptoms from hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. The discharge staff should provide educational materials for patients and family members upon discharge, as this can be a recurrent condition.
