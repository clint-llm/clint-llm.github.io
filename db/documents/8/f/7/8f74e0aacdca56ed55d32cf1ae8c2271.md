Scopolamine derives from the plants of Datura stramonium (Jimsonweed), Scopolia carniolica, and Hyoscyamus niger (henbane). These plants produce toxic compounds called belladonna alkaloids as a protective mechanism.

The vomiting center of the brain is located in the medulla oblongata and contains a high amount of M1 muscarinic acetylcholine, H1 histamine, NK1, and 5-HT3 serotonin receptors. Thus, any agent that antagonizes these receptors will have antiemetic properties. Scopolamine exerts its action by primarily affecting the M1 receptor. However, some research has reported H1 receptor activity.
