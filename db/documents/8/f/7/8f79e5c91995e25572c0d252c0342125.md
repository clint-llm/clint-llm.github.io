Beta-blockers are available in oral, intravenous, or ophthalmic forms and are also injectable intramuscularly.

Dosages are available in various ranges, depending on the specific medication. Outpatient prescriptions may include once-a-day dosing for longer-acting beta-blockers, such as metoprolol succinate.Â However, most beta blockers are often dosed at least twice per day. Certain beta-blockers, such as propranolol, with a half-life of approximately 4 hours, are dosed up to 3 or 4 times a day, depending on the indication and dose.
