Scrub typhus is one of the most underdiagnosed causes of tropical fevers. It can present as a fever of unknown origin and as with other rickettsioses can cause diagnostic confusion. Scrub typhus presenting with encephalitis can be difficult to distinguish from other common causes of viral or bacterial encephalitis. It can sometimes present without eschar with only flu-like symptoms, thus can be confused with other causes of acute febrile illness. Although the incidence of eschar in acute scrub typhus can range from 10% to 90%, these may be easily overlooked.

Since it can affect almost every organ system in the body, even with a high index of clinical suspicion and the best clinical knowledge, diagnosis remains difficult, and the timely initiation of appropriate therapy is sometimes delayed.

The following diseases should be kept in differentials:

- Malaria

- Dengue

- Leptospirosis

- Typhoid fever
