Foot drop is a clinical entity that is not frequently seen in primary care settings. There are multiple etiologies of foot drop. Careful neurological examination, in conjunction with metabolic work-up, EMG/NCS, and imaging, usually lead to appropriate diagnosis and management. Adequate knowledge of anatomy and physiology is essential to arrive at the appropriate working diagnosis and management. This activity is intended to review the evaluation, pathophysiology, and management of foot drop, highlighting the role of the interprofessional team in evaluation, management, and potential treatment of patients presenting with a finding of foot drop.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the common causes of foot drop. A review of anatomy is provided.
- Review the evaluation of foot drop.
- Summarize the pathophysiology of foot drop.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for care coordination and communication to maximize outcomes.
