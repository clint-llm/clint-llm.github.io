- Assess both blood pressure and heart rate before and after the first dose and any dosage changes. [Level 2]

- Cardiac monitoring to observe for QT changes and arrhythmias. [Level 2]

- Assess cardiac and pulmonary status.

- Advise patients with diabetes to monitor glucose levels closely (beta-blockers may alter glucose tolerance).

- Assess other medicines a patient may be taking; alternate therapy or dosage adjustments may be necessary.

- Ensure to utilize a pharmacist to assess drug interactions, renal dose adjustments, and medication education.

A cardiology board-certified pharmacist can assist the clinician team with sotalol dosing and monitoring. Nursing will need to understand the signs of adverse events associated with using this drug and report the therapeutic effectiveness of the regimen to the team to enable therapy modifications if necessary. An interprofessional team approach to sotalol use allows for optimal outcomes while minimizing adverse effects. [Level 5]
