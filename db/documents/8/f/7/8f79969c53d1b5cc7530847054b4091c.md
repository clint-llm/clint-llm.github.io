The epidemiologic data of MERRF is largely unknown, but it is widely considered that the prevalence of MERRF is probably less than 1:100,000. In Europe, three epidemiologic studies detecting the most common MERRF mutation (m.8344A>G) revealed a prevalence of 0 to 1.5 in northern FinlandÂ and 0.39 in northern England per 100,000 adult persons.
