Multivessel CADÂ carries significant morbidity and mortality risk and requires input from various medical and surgical specialists for individualized patient care. Internists and primary care physicians are valuable for primary disease prevention and identification of patients at risk of developing CAD. Risk factor modification through pharmacological and lifestyle modification has been shown to reduce the risk and progression of CAD significantly. Cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons should provide the patient with information regarding procedural risks, benefits, and need for further revascularization if needed. The decision for CABG versus PCI should account for multiple factors, including age, comorbidities, surgical risk, patient preference. This condition is best managed by an interprofessional team of primary care providers, emergency medicine, cardiology, cardiovascular surgery, specialty trained nurses, and pharmacists. [Level 5] Nurses are valuable for their familiarity with the patient and updates on how the patient's condition has progressed. Pharmacists are needed for patient and physician education on potential medication side effects and drug-to-drug interactions.

Currently, CABG remains the recommended treatment modality for patients with triple vessel disease due to reduced risk of mortality and repeat revascularization procedure. [Level 1] The increased risk of stroke with CABG does not outweigh the long-term benefit of the procedure.
