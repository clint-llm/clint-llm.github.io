Hyperthyroidism is an uncommon condition that complicates approximately 0.1% to 0.4% of pregnancies. The condition is marked by increased levels of circulating thyroid hormones, T4 and T3, as well as a decreased level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), also known as thyrotropin. Though relatively rare, identification and treatment of overt hyperthyroidism are important to mitigate maternal and fetal complications. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy.
- Review the management options for hyperthyroidism in pregnancy.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by hyperthyroidism in pregnancy.
