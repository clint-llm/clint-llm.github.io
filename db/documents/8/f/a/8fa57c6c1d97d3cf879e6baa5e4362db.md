The best outcomes with TFCC injuries will occur when other etiologies of ulnar-sided wrist pain are ruled out with prompt initiation of conservative treatment. If the patient does not improve under conservative management, the next step is a surgical consultation obtained in a timely fashion. If an MRI is obtained, it is essential to have the MRI read by a radiologist who has experience with TFCC injuries. An interprofessional team of a nurse, physical or occupational therapist, and physicianÂ will provide the best follow-up care. [Level 5]
