Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy among neonates is a significant cause of infant mortality and neurodevelopmental deficits. It is evident from many systematic reviews that therapeutic hypothermia is beneficial in neonates with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. This activity reviews the indications, preparation, technique, and complications of therapeutic hypothermia. Also, it highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating the neonate under therapeutic hypothermia.

**Objectives:**
- Describe and review the physiology behind neonatal therapeutic hypothermia.
- Outline the indications for neonatal therapeutic hypothermia.
- Explain the technique of therapeutic hypothermia in neonates.
- Review how interprofessional team collaboration can improve patient outcomes in neonates who need therapeutic hypothermia.
