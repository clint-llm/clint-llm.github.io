Pediatric brain tumors are the most common type of solid childhood cancer and only second to leukemia as a cause of pediatric malignancies. They are classified into supratentorial and infratentorial lesions. They could also be classified according to the age of presentation into congenital brain tumors (CBT) (diagnosed antenatally in the first 60 days of life), tumors of the infancy (younger than 1 year of age), and tumors of older children. The prognosis of pediatric brain tumors depends mainly on the age of presentation, histological type, and extent of resectability. This article reviews the etiology, presentation, and pathophysiology of childhood brain cancers and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in their management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of childhood brain tumors.
- Summarize the presentation of childhood brain cancers when performing an evaluation.
- Discuss the various treatment options for brain tumors in children, depending on tumor type and severity.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by childhood brain tumors.
