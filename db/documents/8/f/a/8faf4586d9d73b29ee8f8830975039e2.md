One way of enhancing health care outcomes is by collaborating with both medical and neurological staff as catatonic schizophrenia can present as an emergency with life-threatening medical complications and autonomic instability. It is important to understand that underlying delirium or medical or neurological conditions can precipitate a catatonic state.

An interprofessional team consisting of a psychiatrist, hospitalist, nursing services, nutritional, and peer counselor would be effective in providing round-the-clock care to the patient with catatonic schizophrenia. Often extensive psychoeducation with an emphasis on prognosis is helpful for the family of the patient. The hospital stays are longer than regular, and patients often require months-long treatment in an inpatient service. In the outpatient setting, the benzodiazepine must be tapered off slowly to prevent relapse. It is important for both inpatient and outpatient teams to collaborate on care to prevent relapse of symptoms.
