The recommended treatment for acne fulminans is a combination of corticosteroids and isotretinoin. Oral corticosteroids should be started first at high doses (0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day) for at least two weeks (at least four weeks if systemic symptoms) until lesions heal. Isotretinoin therapy can then start. The initial dose of isotretinoin should be 0.1 mg/kg/day in association with corticosteroids for four weeks. If there is no observable flare, maintain the same dose of isotretinoin for four more weeks, and corticosteroid doses should undergo gradual tapering. Increasing isotretinoin doses should then progressively reduce to a minimum total dose of 120 mg/kg.

In patients who remain adherent, relapses are rare. If a relapse does occur, a repeat cumulative dose of isotretinoin at 150 mg/kg is the recommendation. The treatment with isotretinoin lasts for many months as the initial dose is low.

A recent review suggests that the use of additional high-potency topical corticosteroids may result in a faster response. Once healing occurs, the lesions become smaller, less tender, and have a minimal inflammatory reaction. Scarring is common.

Acne fulminans does not respond to the traditional antibiotics used to treat the typical form of acne. Even when using these agents, the response is slow and incomplete.

In the last few years, anecdotal reports have appeared after the use of biologics, such as etanercept and infliximab, in resistant patients. The response to these agents is effective and rapid. However, it is unknown if biologics will work in all patients. Several other targeted biologics also have been used to treat acne fulminans.

**Other Treatments**

Pulsed dye laser has shown moderate effectiveness, but adverse effects and pain remain an issue. Because the lesions are large, multiple treatments are required, and scarring and hypopigmentation are common complications.

Reports suggest that diaminodiphenyl sulfone use may help ease the symptoms of acne fulminans in patients with ulcerative colitis.

Combinations of prednisone with dapsone or cyclosporine also have been tried with success.

Finally, the management of these patients is best with a dermatologist and an internist. Women of childbearing age should use great caution when using retinoids, as these agents are teratogenic. There is a registry of all patients who receive retinoids. All women who receive therapy with isotretinoin should avoid getting pregnant for at least one month after discontinuing the drug.
