The salivary glands receive parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation. The parasympathetic innervation leads to serous salivary production and ion secretion, and the sympathetic increases the secretion of proteins. The sympathetic innervation is also known to regulate the blood flow of the glands and local inflammatory and immune mediators

The parotid gland is innervated via the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). The parasympathetic cell bodies that innervate the parotid gland are located in the otic ganglion. Postganglionic fibers from the otic ganglion then join the auriculotemporal nerve to innervate the parotid. The submandibular ganglion, located within the SMG and adjacent to the lingual nerve, contains the cell bodies of parasympathetic fibers that innervate the SMG and SLG, as well as their myoepithelial cells

Secretions by the minor salivary glands are not regulated by neuronal control like the major glands are. Instead, they continuously secrete small amounts of saliva, even at night when the major glands are resting, resulting in sustained lubrication to oral surfaces
