Esmolol is a short-acting, cardio-selective beta-blocker, a class II antiarrhythmic agent that is a competitive antagonist of the beta-1-adrenergic receptors primarily in the myocytes.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Absorption: Esmolol is rapidly absorbed, the onset of action is within 60 seconds, and it maintains a steady state within 5 minutes of initiation of infusion.

Distribution: Esmolol has plasma protein binding of 55%.The mean apparent volume of distribution is approximately 0.33 to 0.53 L/kg.

Metabolism: Fast metabolism translates into the rapid decrease of pharmacological effect (within 10 to 30 minutes) once the infusion is discontinued, making esmolol safer when titrated appropriately.

Excretion: The metabolite has a half-life of 3.7 hours and is excreted via urine. Esmolol has a higher clearance (281 mL/kg/min) in infants than in adults and children.
