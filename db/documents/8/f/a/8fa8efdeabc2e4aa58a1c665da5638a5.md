Hypersensitivity is an absolute contraindication to all phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Nitrites are contraindicated to use alongside PDE-5 inhibitors: sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, and avanafil, as they may result in severe hypotension.

Heart failure of any sort is a contraindication to cilostazol use. Patients taking medications that may cause QT prolongation or have congenital QT syndrome should avoid taking vardenafil. Patients with hemostatic or bleeding disorders are contraindicated to cilostazol use as its mechanism of action inhibits platelet aggregations and may worsen the underlying conditions. Milrinone and amrinone are contraindicated in patients with pre-existing valvular disease of the aortic or pulmonic valve as they may cause outflow obstruction. Pentoxifylline is contraindicated in patients with a recent history of cerebral hemorrhage or retinal hemorrhage.

**Black Box Warning**

- Cilostazol: Heart failure is an absolute contraindication to cilostazol use.

- Milrinone: Should not be used for greater than 48 hours for heart failure as it may cause ventricular arrhythmias and result in sudden death.
