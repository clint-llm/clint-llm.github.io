The most common cause of femoral pseudoaneurysm is iatrogenic.

Iatrogenic causes include:

- Arterial access for endovascular procedures (<1% incidence)

- Anastomotic failure

Non-iatrogenic causes include:

- Trauma

- Infection

- Pancreatitis with pseudocyst/pancreatic fistula

Visceral artery pseudoaneurysms can occur with catheter-based interventions and are also associated with pancreatitis and pseudocysts.

Aortic pseudoaneurysms are often the result of blunt or penetrating trauma, infection, atherosclerotic penetrating/degenerative lesions, and at anastomotic sites following vascular bypass or repair.
