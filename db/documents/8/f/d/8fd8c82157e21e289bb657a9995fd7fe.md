Contrast-induced nephropathy is defined as a rise in serum creatinine of at least 0.5 mg/dL or a 25% increase from baseline within 48 to 72 hours after contrast exposure. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) definition is different, with stage 1 being a rapid rise of creatinine to greater than 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or the relative rise of 50% or more from baseline in 7 days or less or a reduction in urine output to less than 0.5 ml/kg/hr for 6 to 12 hours. This severity is further staged based on creatinine levels, urine output, or the need for renal replacement therapy.

In contrast-induced nephropathy, serum creatinine usually begins to rise within 24 hours after the administration of contrast media, peaks between 3 and 5 days, and comes back to baseline in 7-10 days. A surrogate marker of renal function, serum cystatin C, is increased in patients with contrast-induced nephropathy.

Nonspecific formed elements may appear in the urine, such as tubular epithelial cells, granular casts, uric acid crystals, and debris. However, they do not have a correlation with severity.

It is worthwhile to do urine osmolality that tends to be less than 350 mOsm/kg. The fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) may vary a great deal. In a small number of patients with oliguric CIN, FENa is low earlier in the course, despite the absence of clinical signs of volume depletion.
