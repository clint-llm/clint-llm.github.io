Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia is a rare dysplastic pathological condition of the lower limbs leading to significant disability. The etiology of this condition is not clear, but an association has been seen with neurofibromatosis type 1. It may be seen at birth or manifest at the walking age with pathological fractures leading to deformity and limb length discrepancy. The treatment of this condition is mainly surgical, with various options aimed at achieving bone union, correcting limb deformity, and restoring limb length. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia.
- Review the typical presentation of a patient with congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia.
- Identify the various radiological findings in patients with congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia.
- Explain the various treatment options for patients with congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia, along with its prognosis.
