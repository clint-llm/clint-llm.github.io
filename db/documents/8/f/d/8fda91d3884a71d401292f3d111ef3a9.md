Enterobius can be diagnosed through a cellophane tape test or pinworm paddle test where an adhesive tape-like material is applied to the perianal area and then examined under a microscope. The examination might reveal characteristic ova which are 50 by 30 microns in size and have a flattened surface on one side or may reveal the worms. Female worms are around 8 to 13 mm long while male worms are 2 to 5 mm long. The examination is usually done in the early morning for higher diagnostic yield. If the examination is negative for five consecutive mornings, then the diagnosis is ruled out. Stool examination is not helpful in the diagnosis of E. vermicularis as they are only occasionally excreted in the stool usually. Sometimes analysis of the stool specimen is recommended to rule out other causes.
