While classically P. vivax causes lower parasitemia and less severe disease than P. falciparum, more recent publications suggest that P. vivax is responsible for more severe disease than it was initially attributed. Case reports have demonstrated P. vivax causing cerebral malaria, renal failure, acute respiratory distress, and shock.

Another rare complication is splenic rupture which carries a very high mortality rate of up to 80%.

Pregnant women are at increased risk of adverse outcomes from all forms of malaria and P. vivax is no exception. Malaria in pregnancy is associated with higher levels of parasitemia and increases the risk of prematurity, miscarriage, low birth weight, neonatal or maternal death.
