The initial evaluation of patients with pressure injuries involves a detailed history, and the clinician should gather the following:

- Duration of immobility or being bedridden

- Duration of hospital stay

- Associated medical cause that has caused the injury (e.g., paraplegia, quadriplegia, stroke, road traffic accident (RTA) that might have resulted in immobility

- The natural history of the injury; the site at which it first developed. Did it increase in size? How long has the injury been present?

- A brief history of any systemic diseases is also necessary. Diseases like diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and malignancy prevent or slow down wound healing.

- If the patient can precisely localize the site of the ulcer or localize any associated pain because most of the time, the ulcers are painful, but the patient is unaware because either he has paraplegia or is in a critical condition.

- Is there any discharge or foul odor from the ulcer site? These may specify the worsening of the lesions.
