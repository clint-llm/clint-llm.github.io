There are several well-described left atrial appendage morphologies. The LAA classification system has its basis on the shape, the relationship of the LAA to the left superior pulmonary vein, length from the ostium to apex, number of lobes, angle of the fist bend formed by the primary lobe, and the distance from the first bend to the LAA orifice. Based on these features, Wang et. described four classical structural morphologies accounting for the majority of anatomical variants seen.

The “chicken wing” morphology describes an LAA with an obvious bend in the proximal or middle part of the dominant lobe and is the most common variant found in one study of 932 patients to be present in 40%.
