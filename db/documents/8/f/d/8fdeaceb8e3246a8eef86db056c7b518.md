Ophthalmologists (including subspecialists in cornea and anterior segment, glaucoma, vitreoretinal, oculoplastics), oro-dental surgeons, anesthetists, physicians, nurses, and clinical psychologists are essential for optimum outcomes. Psychological, social support, and provisions for access to hospital facilities in planned and emergency follow-up care are necessary components of the service. The care pathway should also have access to patient support groups, the information in the form of leaflets or multimedia to instruct and educate the patient about the procedure and aftercare.
