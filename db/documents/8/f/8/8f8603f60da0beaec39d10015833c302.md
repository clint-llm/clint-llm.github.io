**Chronopharmacology**

Detailed knowledge of the suprachiasmatic nucleus' afferent and efferent projections and its respective neurotransmitters is essential for understanding the mechanisms of the master circadian clock, and for suggesting intervention targets to address circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Designing effective pharmaceutical interventions depends upon many factors that include multiple components of drug absorption, metabolism, excretion, and chronopharmacology; optimal drug doses may vary depending on when administration occurs within the circadian cycle.

**Mood Disorders**

Research has linked disrupted circadian rhythmicity with mood disorders including bipolar disorder, seasonal affective disorder, and other depressive disorders. Patients with major depressive disorder, for instance, frequently report early morning awakenings and insomnia. It has been postulated that circadian rhythms are phase-delayed in major depressive disorder.

**Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders**

**1. Advanced sleep phase (ASP) disorder and delayed sleep phase (DSP) disorder**

Approximately 50 to 70 million adults in the United States live with chronic sleep disorders that have adverse effects on their health and quality of life. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3), published by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), classified more than 80 distinct sleep disorders.

**2. Shift work sleep disorder**

Shift work sleep disorder affects adults with non-standard work schedules that include overnight shifts and rotating day-night schedules that disrupt normal 24-hour sleep-wake cycles. Aging adults begin to lose circadian adaptation to shift work schedules and tend to become sleepier during the daytime compared with young adults who perform similar shift work.

**3. Irregular sleep-wake rhythm (ISWR) disorder**

In irregular sleep-wake rhythm (ISWR) disorder, the sleep-wake cycle loses its normal circadian rhythm. ISWR disorder is often associated with intellectual disability in children and dementia in elders with risk factors that include comorbid psychiatric and medical illnesses.
