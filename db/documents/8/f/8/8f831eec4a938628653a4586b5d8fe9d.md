Both sexes are equally affected. Acquired perforating dermatosis usually occurs during the fifth decade of life.

The exact prevalence and incidence of acquired perforating dermatosis are unknown. In a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with APD between 2002 and 2014, included 33 patients. This estimated incidence was 2.53 cases per 100000 inhabitants per year. While this reported incidence is considered to be very low, the authors believed that actual APD occurs more commonly. The disease could potentially be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as simple excoriations.

According to published studies, acquired reactive perforating collagenosis (ARPC) was found to be the most common form while KD and PF were the least frequent types of APD.

Previous reports have documented the association of acquired perforating dermatosis with various systemic diseases, especially CRF, DM or both.

Other associated disorders rarely reported include hepatic dysfunction, HIV infection, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, atopic dermatitis and cancers such as liver carcinoma, pancreas adenocarcinoma, Hodgkin’s disease, and myelodysplastic syndrome.
