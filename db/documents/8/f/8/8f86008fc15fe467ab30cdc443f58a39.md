**Jugular Venous Pressure**

The internal jugular vein is widely used to assess the jugular venous pressure. One can roughly estimate the pressure in the right atrium by looking at the pulsations and their height in the internal jugular vein. For a professional to measure jugular venous pressure, the patient must be seated at 45 degrees with the head slightly turned to the contralateral side. Elevations of the jugular venous pressure may present in cardiac tamponade, tricuspid regurgitation, right heart failure, and tricuspid stenosis. When the jugular venous pressure is low, it usually signifies low blood volume or dehydration. An important thing to note is that the pulse in the jugular vein is not palpable. One can also raise the pressure in the jugular vein by applying manual pressure on the liver.

**Cannulation**

The internal jugular vein is used for cannulation since it is large, superficial in location, and usually does not vary in its course along the neck; this can be the preferred initial access site for central venous catheterization. The central line may be placed to monitor jugular venous pressure, administer fluids and medications, nutrition, or resuscitate a patient. The most common complication following placement of the internal jugular vein via the neck is a puncture of the carotid artery. Pneumothorax can occur if the needle is penetrated deep into the neck. However, the risk is lower when compared to subclavian access. In rare cases, the vagus nerve may also suffer injury.

**Internal Jugular Vein Thrombosis**

Thrombosis of the internal jugular vein is usually iatrogenic as a result of an internal jugular central venous catheter. Recently, there has been an increased incidence due to intravenous drug users injecting directly into their internal jugular veins. The most common clinical manifestations of thrombosis include neck pain, fever, leukocytosis, and swelling. The swelling may also extend into the ipsilateral upper extremity. Urschel sign is occasionally appreciated in which there is distention in the lower neck and anterior chest veins as a result of the impedance of drainage from the internal jugular. Diagnosis is possible with venous duplex ultrasonography of the neck. US findings include incompressible vein, the presence of a clot, and no response to the Valsalva maneuver. Contrast CT may also assist with diagnosis. Sequelae of thrombosis can include an extension of the thrombus or pulmonary embolism. Therefore, internal jugular thrombosis is viewed as a deep vein thrombosis. Treatment for thrombosis may include a need for anticoagulation.

**Lemierre Syndrome**

Internal jugular thrombosis as a result of pharyngeal infection is known as Lemierre syndrome. This condition can occur when a pharyngeal infection, such as an abscess, extends into the internal jugular vein. A deadly complication of this process includes an extension of septic thromboembolism into the lungs. Treatment is antibiotics and perhaps anticoagulation.
