Clinical blockade of the stellate ganglion is useful for a wide variety of diagnostic and therapeutic indications, including

- Chronic regional pain syndrome I and II

- Craniofacial hyperhidrosis

- Refractory angina

- Atypical angina

- Postherpetic neuralgia

- Phantom limb pain

- Chronic post-surgical pain

- Post-traumatic stress disorder

- Neuropathic pain syndromes in cancer pain

- Vascular headaches including cluster headache and migraine headache

- Raynaud syndrome

- Scleroderma

- Upper extremity embolism

- Meniere syndrome

- Refractory cardiac arrhythmias including Roman/Ward syndrome and Jervell/Lang/Nielson syndrome

- To diagnose sympathetically mediated pain

- Quinine poisoning

- Sudden loss of hearing accompanied by tinnitus

- Accidental intraarterial injection of intravenous medications

Certain conditions may preclude the performance of a stellate ganglion blockade. These include:

- A recent history of a myocardial infarction

- Coagulopathy

- Patients with a preexisting cardiac conduction blockade

- Glaucoma

A successful stellate ganglion blockade demonstrates specific clinical signs which include:

- Miosis (pupil constriction)

- Anhidrosis (lack of sweating)

- Ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid)

- Flushing of the extremities

These symptoms usually disappear in 4 to 6 hours after the blockade. Successful stellate ganglion blockade can be recognized clinically by the above symptoms and signs.  However, the presence of Horner syndrome after a stellate ganglion block does not equate with complete blockage of the sympathetic outflow to the upper extremity. Extremity temperatures may rise by 1 to 3 degrees, thereby indicating a successful block, which is the most widely employed indicator to determine the success of the stellate ganglion block. Other methods to confirm include measuring a sympathetic-galvanic response, which is an increase in resistance after the block.

Complications which may arise during stellate ganglion blockade include :

- Recurrent laryngeal nerve blockade

- Phrenic nerve blockade (leading to ipsilateral diaphragmatic paralysis)

- Pneumothorax

- Total spinal anesthesia

- Severe hypertension

- Paratracheal hematomas

- Generalized seizures

- Hematoma
