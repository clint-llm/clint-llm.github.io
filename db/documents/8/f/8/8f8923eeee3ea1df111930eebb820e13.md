Poor prognostic factors include the following:

- Tumor thickness (worse prognosis in thicker lesions)

- Evidence of tumor in regional lymph nodes (stage III disease)

- A higher number of positive lymph nodes

- Presence of distant metastasis (stage IV disease)

- Anatomic site (trunk and/or face lesions have worse prognoses than extremity lesions)

- Presence of ulceration

- Presence of regression on histologic examination (controversial)

- Male sex

Prognosis depends on the disease stage at diagnosis, as follows:

- Patients with stage I disease - 5-year survival rate of greater than 90%

- Patients with stage II disease - 5-year survival rate ranging from 45% to 77%

- Patients with stage III disease - 5-year survival rate ranging from 27% to 70%

Patients with metastatic disease have a grim prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%.
