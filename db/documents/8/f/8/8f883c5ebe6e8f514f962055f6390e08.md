Human alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a tumor-associated fetal mammalian glycoprotein involved with both ontogenic and oncogenic growth.AFP gene on chromosome 4q25.

In the clinical laboratory, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) has been employed both as a post-operational tumor marker and as a gestational age-dependent fetal defect marker demonstrating utility in screening for neural tube defects and aneuploidies.

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) can be fractionated by affinity electrophoresis into three glycoforms: L1, L2, and L3, based on the reactivity with the lectin lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA).
