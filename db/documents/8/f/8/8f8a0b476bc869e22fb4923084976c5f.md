Childhood obesity is a rising health concern in the United States, as its prevalence continues to increase among children of all ages.

Obesity is a condition characterized by the accumulation of excessive fat in the body. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure used to classify overweight and obesity using height and weight (kg/m^2). BMI values may significantly differ in children and adolescents, depending on their age and gender. Thus, once a BMI of a child is calculated, it is often compared with reference values for a particular gender and age group to determine his or her BMI percentile.
