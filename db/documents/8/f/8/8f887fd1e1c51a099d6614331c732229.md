The management of patients with A-T requires an interprofessional team since the disease presents with a great variety of manifestations.

**Neurological  Symptoms**

Ataxia and other neurological manifestation can severely affect patients’ everyday life. Physical therapy and regular assessment for possible aids that may be needed are extremely important. One of the main goals of these assessments should be to prevent complications such as falls. Children usually require support at school because of the motor and cognitive impairment.

**Cancer and Radiosensitivity**

Proper surveillance for breast and ovary cancer can be lifesaving. Hematological tumors cannot be prevented, but regular monitoring can allow early diagnosis. The treatment of these tumors is not different from the best standard of care approach; specific care must be considered due to the radiosensitivity of these patients.

**Immunological Disease**

Treatment of recurrent infections and prophylactic antibiotic administration, when required, have been able to prolong life expectancy in patients with A-T. Intravenous immunoglobulin has been considered a good option for these patients as well. While inactivated vaccinations have not been associated with complications in patients with A-T, live vaccines may be contraindicated, especially in the presence of a low T-cell count.

Complications secondary to restrictive lung disease must always be considered in case of anesthesia or surgery.

**Future Treatments**

Antioxidant, antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (AMO), aminoglycoside antibiotics that can affect ATM protein function, as well as different small molecules targeting the ATM gene to address tumorigenesis, have been tested. Most of these new therapeutic approaches are still under investigation.
