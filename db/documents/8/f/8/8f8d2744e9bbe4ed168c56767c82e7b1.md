**Cerebral arteries distribution**

Knowledge of the anatomy of the brain and arterial distribution is essential in the management of acute stroke.

There are three pairs of main arteries in the brain: anterior cerebral artery (ACA), middle cerebral artery (MCA), and posterior cerebral artery (PCA).

The blood supply in the brain subdivides into two main categories: Anterior circulation and posterior circulation. Anastomosis between these two main systems comprises the circle of Willis.

Anterior circulation arteries:

The ACA branches from the internal carotid artery. It supplies the anteromedial surface of the brain, i.e., midline portion of the frontal lobe, superior midline portion of the parietal lobe, and anterior portion of the internal capsule and anterior basal ganglia. Ischemic stroke lesions in this territory cause the motor and sensory deficits of the lower limb and account for contralateral paralysis and sensory loss in the lower limbs, and urinary incontinence.

The MCA also branches from the internal carotid artery. It supplies the lateral surface of the brain, i.e., anterior and lateral portions of the temporal lobes, part of the internal capsule, and basal ganglia. The MCA divides into four segments: M1 (sphenoidal or horizontal segment), M2 (insular segment), M3 (opercular segment), and M4 (cortical segment). Ischemic stroke lesions in this territory cause the motor and sensory cortical lesions of the upper limb and face and account for contralateral paralysis and a sensory deficit of the upper limb and face. The MCA also supplies the temporal lobe (Wernicke area) and frontal lobe (Broca area) and lesions in this dominant lobe (usually left) result in aphasia.

Posterior circulation arteries:

The PCA arises from the basilar artery. It supplies the posterior and inferior surface of the brain, i.e., the posteromedial portion of the temporal lobe and occipital lobe. Damage to the visual cortex located on the occipital lobe, which is responsible for the contralateral field of vision, can result in contralateral hemianopia with macular sparing. The cerebellar hemispheres receive vascular supply from branches of the vertebral-basilar circulation, including posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), superior cerebellar artery (SCA), and anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA).

The PICA supplies the lateral medulla, vestibular nuclei, sympathetic fibers, and inferior cerebellar peduncle.Â Infarction in this area results in lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome.
