Patients taking almotriptan should require monitoring for the presence of side effects and response to therapy. Kidney function should be monitored when taking the drug as renal clearance may affect the overall drug clearance from the body, causing toxicity. Regular monitoring of the blood pressure should occur at each clinical visit due to the narrowing effect of the 5-HT1B receptors on the blood vessels and assess the effectiveness of the drug.
