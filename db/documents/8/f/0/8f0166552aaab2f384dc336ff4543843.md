Axilla crutches are the most common type.

Forearm crutches are better for long-term use. The weight of the user is transferred mainly to their entire upper arms.  The user needs good upper body strength to use these crutches properly.  Individuals with long-term disabilities looking to be more active or participate in sports may choose forearm crutches as an option.

Platform crutches are the least common of the three.  The weight of the patient is transferred mainly to the user’s forearms.  The platform allows the user more stability than the axilla and forearm crutches, but the platform crutch has less maneuverability.   They are intended for long-term use.  Individuals with long-term disabilities from severe neurological impairment of their lower extremities with decreased stability may choose platform crutches as an option.
