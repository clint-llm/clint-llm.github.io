**Operative Versus Nonoperative Management**

The initial management of Achilles tendon rupture is rest, elevation, pain control, and functional bracing. There is still debate surrounding the potential benefits versus risks of surgical intervention. Studies have demonstrated good functional results and patient satisfaction with both operative and nonoperative modalities.

Healing rates with serial casting/functional bracing are no different compared to the surgical anastomosis of the tendon, but return to work may be slightly prolonged in patients treated medically. All patients require physical and orthotic therapy to help strengthen the muscles and improve the range of motion of the ankle.

Rehabilitation is critical to regaining maximal ankle function. While the debate remains regarding the optimal treatment modality, the consensus includes the following:

- Patients with significant medical comorbidities or relatively sedentary lifestyles are often recommended for nonoperative management.

- Chronicity of the injury and soft tissue/skin integrity is also considered.

- The patient/surgeon discussion should include a detailed discussion concerning the current literature reporting satisfactory outcomes with both treatment plans and the following topics:

- Possibility of quicker return to work with operative intervention
- Equivalent plantar flexion strength at long-term followup
- Possibility of an increased risk of re-rupture and re-injury with nonoperative management (compared to operative management)
- Lower complication rates for nonoperative treatment compared to operative management

Several techniques for Achilles tendon repair exist, but all involve the reapproximation of torn ends. Sometimes the repair is reinforced by the plantaris tendon or the gastroc-soleus aponeurosis.

Overall, the healing rates between casting and surgical repair are similar. The debate about an early return to activity after surgery is now being questioned. If a cast is used, it should remain for at least 6 to 12 weeks. Benefits of a nonsurgical approach include no hospital admission costs, no wound complications, and no risk of anesthesia. The most significant disadvantage is the risk of re-rupture, which is as high as 40%.
