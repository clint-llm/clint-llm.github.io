Incidentalomas are detected with increasing frequency due to the widespread use of imaging studies performed for different reasons, the risk of unnecessary diagnostic intervention and treatment increases. This poses the challenge of determining the clinical significance of these findings.

Some palpable nodules will not be radiologically distinct from the surrounding thyroid parenchyma and will therefore not meet the strict definition for thyroid nodules.

US screening for non-palpable nodules in high-risk population groups, such as those previously exposed to radiation, is still controversial due to a lack of compelling evidence supporting this practice. Health-care providers should consider that screening for malignancy is usually supported by

- A clear demonstration that the patient is indeedÂ at risk for such malignancy

- Demonstration that screening will allow for the detection of the disease at an earlier stage

- Early diagnosis will have an impact on the subsequent outcome

There is no current evidence supporting US screening for nonpalpable thyroid nodules in individuals previously exposed to radiation.
