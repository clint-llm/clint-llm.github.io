Most of the AV canal defects are almost always associated with a syndromic abnormality. The syndromes that carry an association with AV canal defects are CHARGE, Down, Ellis-van-Creveld, Ivemark, Kaufman McKusick, Ritscher-Schinzel, Smith-Lemli-Opitz, and 3p. Down syndrome has a very strong association with AV canal defects.
