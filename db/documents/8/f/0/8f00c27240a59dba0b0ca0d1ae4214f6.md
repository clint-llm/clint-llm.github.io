LC is best managed by an interprofessional healthcare team that should include clinicians, oncology specialists, oncology specialty nurses, pharmacists, and hospice and palliative care nurses. The prognosis for most patients is poor, and thus,Â efforts should focus on improving the quality of life. Pain control and support measures should be provided. No aggressive studies or treatments are warranted for most patients as death is usually imminent.

The use of newer biological agents should be used with good judgment as they only prolong life by a few weeks or months; on the other hand, they burden the family with enormous costs of the medications.
