As of now, there is still no standardized method of conducting the pathergy test. Intradermal, subcutaneous, and intravenous methods have all been used. Although intradermal needle prick is most commonly used for pathergy testing, many investigators have also used the intradermal injection of normal saline, monosodium urate crystals, or streptococcal antigens to perform the test.

Although there is no consensus among clinicians, studies have shown that positive rates for the SPT can be increased by making at least two needle pricks on the hairless part of the volar forearm with a large hypodermic needle. The needle is usually inserted with the bevel up at an angle of 45 degrees to a depth of 3 mm to 5 mm.

Furthermore, the diameter of the needle used has also been related to pathergy.
