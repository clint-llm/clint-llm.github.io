Structural differences in the anterior and posterior bellies of the supraspinatus muscle may account for functional differences noted post-injury. If the anterior fibers are spared in the injury, the ability of the individual to elevate the arm beyond 90 degrees may be less impaired than if the anterior belly is involved in the tear. Observation of the two parts of the muscle and structural integrity should be noted during surgery to understand better post-operative recovery and functional ability and facilitate appropriate rehabilitative interventions.

Communication between all segments of the healthcare team will enhance optimal outcomes for the client with a supraspinatus pathology. UnderstandingÂ which part of the muscle is involved in the pathology if the rotator cuff interval is affected or closed surgically, and whether the anterior fibers were involved in the tear and repair are essential for optimal outcomes. Radiological identification, conservative rehabilitation, surgical options, and post-surgical rehabilitation depend on excellent team communication.
