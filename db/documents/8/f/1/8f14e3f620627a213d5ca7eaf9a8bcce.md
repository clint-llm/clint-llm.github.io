Lemierre syndrome (LS) is a rare complication of bacterial pharyngitis/tonsillitis and involves an extension of the infection into the lateral pharyngeal spaces of the neck with subsequent septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein(s). It is associated with anaerobic septicemia and death in young, healthy patients. Due to the high frequency of benign oropharyngeal infections in this population, the diagnosis of LS is often elusive on initial presentation. This can result in treatment delays. This activity describes the presentation of Lemierre syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Lemierre syndrome.
- Review the presentation of a patient with Lemierre syndrome.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for Lemierre syndrome.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of Lemierre syndrome and improve outcomes.
