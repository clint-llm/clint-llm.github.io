Patient education is one of the critical factors that can play a pivotal role in the prevention of chronic liver disease. Most of the causative factors of chronic liver disease damage the liver over a long period; therefore, it is necessary to stop its progression to avoid cirrhosis and its complications.

**Recommendations for Preventive Care in Chronic Liver Disease**

- Avoid various types of alcohol (wine, liquor, mixed drinks, beer).

- Regular screening for hepatitis B and hepatitis C

- Vaccination against hepatitis A and B

- Avoid iron supplementation unless there is an iron deficiency.

- Avoid over-the-counter painkillers (aspirin, acetaminophen) and other hepatotoxic drugs.

- Maintain a good lipid profile to avoid metabolic syndrome and NAFLD.
