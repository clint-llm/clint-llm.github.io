As the name implies, neurocutaneous syndromes are disorders involving the nervous system and the skin. Two of the most common neurocutaneous syndromes also referred to as phakomatoses, are neurofibromatosis (NF) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Neurofibromatosis and tuberous sclerosis complex are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, though the expressivity of these diseases varies. This activity reviews neurocutaneous syndromes, with particular focus on neurofibromatosis (NF) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review features that should prompt consideration of a neurocutaneous syndrome.
- Outline the diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis (NF) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).
- Summarize the treatment of neurofibromatosis (NF) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).
- Explain the need for optimizing care coordination, with particular emphasis on communication between interprofessional medical teams, to enhance prompt evaluation and management of neurocutaneous syndromes and decrease the risk of complications and improve outcomes.
