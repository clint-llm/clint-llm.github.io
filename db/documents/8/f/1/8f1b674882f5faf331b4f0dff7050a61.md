Dorsal nerve roots carry sensory neural signals to the central nervous system (CNS) from the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Anatomically, a dorsal root ganglion (DRG) emerges from the dorsal root of the spinal nerves. They carry sensory messages from various receptors (i.e., pain and temperature) at the periphery towards the central nervous system for a response. The role of DRG in chronic pain has been well established. The earliest technique of anesthetic infiltration of DRG was reported in 1949.

Over the last decade, the DRG is now recognized as a viable option for neuromodulation therapy; electrical stimulation of primary sensory neuron somata is also considered a viable option in treating chronic pain.
