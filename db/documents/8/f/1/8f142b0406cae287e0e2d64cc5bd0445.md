Adult-onset akinesia has no curative therapy, but symptomatic treatment can significantly alter the damage done to the quality of life in these patients. Although a mild variant of akinesia cannot directly lead to death, severe forms of akinetic crises can cause dysphagia, autonomic dysfunction, and aspiration, which can prove fatal.

Fetal akinesia syndrome has been primarily found to be lethal in utero, with 30% of fetuses being stillborn. The ultimate prognosis is dependent on the underlying cause. The majority of live-born infants usually die within the first month of life. This could warrant an offer for the late termination of pregnancy in countries that allow it.
