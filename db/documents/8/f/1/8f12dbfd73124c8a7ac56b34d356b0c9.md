Nalbuphine is a kappa-opioid receptor agonist and a partial mu-opioid receptor antagonist. Analgesic properties are mediated through agonist activity at the kappa-opioid receptor. Because of this unique mixed agonist-antagonist opioid receptor activity of nalbuphine, it provides analgesia with less nausea, pruritus, and respiratory depression when compared to morphine.
