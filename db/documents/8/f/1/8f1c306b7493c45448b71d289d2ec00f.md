Upon presentation, a history is necessary to establish how the injury occurred. Falls and high energy trauma are both causes of tibial shaft fractures. If falls are syncopal, this may require further workup. With high energy trauma, the patient should have a full examination, and the implementation of the Trauma Life Support protocol may be necessary. The extremity should undergo close examination for any other ipsilateral injuries.

SKin examination should look for any lacerations that may communicate with the fracture site indicating an open fracture.

A complete neurovascular exam is also necessary for the affected extremity.
