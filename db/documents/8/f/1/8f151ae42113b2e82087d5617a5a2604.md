The prognosis of hypermagnesemia depends on magnesium values and on the clinical condition that induced hypermagnesemia. Values that are not excessively high (mild hypermagnesemia) and in the absence of triggering and aggravating conditions (e.g., renal insufficiency) are benign conditions. On the contrary, high values (severe hypermagnesemia) expose the patient to high risks and high mortality.
