The complications following a hip fracture are vast, diverse, and multi-factorial. Infection rates following surgical management of fractured hips are between 0.6-3.6%, but these vary depending on the operation type.

Specific complications for arthroplasty include dislocation, loosening, wear, leg length discrepancy, and peri-prosthetic fractures. For fixation devices, the recognized complications are failure of fixation or metalwork, avascular necrosis, and non-union.

Medical complications following a hip fracture present a significant problem. Early recognition and intervention of medical complications are imperative to reduce associated mortality. Below is a list of common medical complications following hip fracture along with their estimated prevalence

- Delirium: 13.5% to 33%

- Pulmonary embolism: 1.4% to 7.5%

- Deep venous thrombosis: 27%

- Pneumonia: 7%

- Myocardial infarction or heart failure: 35% to 42%

- Urinary retention or infection: 12% to 61%

- Acute kidney injury: 11%

- Anemia: 24% to 44%

- Skin pressure damage: 7% to 9%
