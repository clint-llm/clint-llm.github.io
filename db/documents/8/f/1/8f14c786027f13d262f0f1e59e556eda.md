The cervical plexus and phrenic nerve lie posteriorly to the internal jugular vein as it exits the skull through the jugular foramen. The vagus nerve accompanies the internal jugular vein medially in the carotid sheath and lies between the artery and vein, but is slightly posterior. The loop of the ansa cervicalis also typically lies on the superficial lateral aspect of the internal jugular vein.
