Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistent hyperglycemia. It may be due to impaired insulin secretion, resistance to peripheral actions of insulin, or both. Chronic hyperglycemia in synergy with the other metabolic aberrations in patients with diabetes mellitus can cause damage to various organ systems, leading to the development of disabling and life-threatening health complications, most prominent of which are microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) and macrovascular complications leading to a 2-fold to 4-fold increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of DM and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiologies of diabetes mellitus.
- Review the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus.
- Summarize the treatment options for diabetes mellitus.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by diabetes mellitus type 2.
