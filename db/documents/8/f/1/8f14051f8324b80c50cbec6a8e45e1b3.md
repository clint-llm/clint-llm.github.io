Because of nonspecific clinical signs, a high index of suspicion should be made in the existence of risk factors. Biopsy of antral necrotic tissue should be performed immediately after suspicion for histopathological study to confirm the diagnosis. And the correct parallel comparison between clinical and histological features helps in diagnosis. Some clinicians prefer CT scan before biopsy because biopsy may take time.

Investigation of choice in early fungal ball detection is a CT scan. CT-scan shows double density sinuses due to the thickening of mucosa with hyperdense areas. The chronic invasive sinusitis phase shows the opacification of sinuses with bone erosion on CT scan. This helps in manipulating surgical modality. But CT findings are not specific to mucormycosis. A false-positive result may be obtained in other invasive diseases and false negatives i.e., even normal sinus CT may have invasive disease.

Nasal scrapings and fine-needle aspiration cytology performed to give the diagnostic result, which shows fungal hyphae. Blood cultures are not preferred because it is rarely positive. Even swab taken and cultured from sinuses are negative in most of the cases. Spinal fluid findings may be negative and nonspecific. Endoscopic observation of sinuses is beneficial to look for tissue necrosis and also to take a biopsy.
