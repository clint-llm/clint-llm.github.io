Adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder, is an inflammatory condition characterized by shoulder stiffness, pain, and significant loss of passive range of motion. Long-term disability has been reported at ten to twenty percent in patients, and the persistence of symptoms at thirty to sixty percent. Adhesive capsulitis has a prevalence of approximately two to five percent in the general population. The mean age of onset is typically 55 years of age. There is a slightly greater predominance in females (1.4:1). The exact pathophysiology of adhesive capsulitis is unknown. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of adhesive capsulitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe common presenting signs and symptoms of adhesive capsulitis.
- Review how to evaluate a patient for adhesive capsulitis.
- Identify treatment considerations for adhesive capsulitis. 
- Outline interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and outcomes for patients with adhesive capsulitis.
