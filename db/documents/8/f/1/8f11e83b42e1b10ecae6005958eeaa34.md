There can be an average of about 10% variability in TcPO values in healthy individuals. TcPO measurement is sensitive to positioning, e.g., results may be erroneously elevated in the depending and decreased in the elevated position. A supine position is, therefore, suggested for the most accurate assessment. Measurement shortly after exercising may also lead to decreased values of TcPO particularly in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). Finally, a variety of pathological conditions at the site of measurements such as edema, acute infection, inflammation, scar tissue, irradiated tissue, and sclerosis can result in erroneous readings because they may affect the dynamics of oxygen diffusion. The accuracy of TcPO values may further be supported by using a reference electrode placed on the upper front part of the thorax.

For the most reliable and comparable results, the ambient temperature should be between 21 C to 23 C, smoking and caffeine consumption should be avoided before the measurement, the temperature of the electrode, the duration of the measurement, as and the site of measurement, should be documented alongside the measured TcPO values.
