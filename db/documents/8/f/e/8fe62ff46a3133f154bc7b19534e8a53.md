Work up for laryngeal and tracheal anatomy must include a direct laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy in the operating room. Imaging studies such as MRI, CT scans may be required to help diagnose laryngeal lesions that might require stenting or in defining the length of stenosis or malacia in the trachea.

Preoperative preparation for placement of laryngeal or tracheal stents include:

- Requires a tracheotomy to maintain airway during the procedure

- Supplemental materials for neck incision

- Suture material either 4-0 or 3-0 proline to secure the stent

- Stents of different sizes for different airways sizes, availability of fluoroscopy sometimes if stents are placed to correct airway obstruction

Consent for surgery must be obtained, and the risks, benefits, and alternatives must be clearly explained to the patient.
