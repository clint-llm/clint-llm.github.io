The prehospital care report form, for most services, records demographic data (name, address, billing information), vital signs (Glasgow Coma Scale, blood pressure, pulse and respiration rates, pain), a patient assessment, and details of any interventions that the emergency medical services (EMS) provider performed. The care report form can be on paper, electronic device (the ePCR), or sometimes a combination of both.  Prehospital care report forms provide the details of patient care for handoff to other healthcare providers. The prehospital report also provides the documentation necessary for ambulance coders to create a bill to reimburse for treatment provided.  Prehospital report forms are used in legal investigations, trauma registries, CPR registries, research, and quality improvement initiatives.
