**Home Medications and Diet**

A soft or liquid diet with avoidance of food temperature extremes should be recommended to all patients with dental injuries or substantial jaw pain; these patients may also need prescriptions of their standing or home medications in liquid form.

**Follow Up**

Follow up for most traumatic injuries can be managed by a primary care provider, such as a pediatrician. However, some injuries prompt additional specialized aftercare, even if consultations are not needed during the initial evaluation. Oral commissure burns should be re-evaluated by a burn or plastics specialist in the outpatient setting. Injuries to the teeth should be seen in follow-up by a dentist. When follow-up is anticipated and images were obtained (such as CT or x-rays), a copy of the imaging should be provided to the patientâ€™s guardians so that repeat radiography may be avoided when subsequent providers see the patient.
