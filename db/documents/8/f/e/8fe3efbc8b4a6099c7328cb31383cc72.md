The description of the Lown-Ganong-Levine pattern is as an accessory pathway that partially or wholly bypasses the atrioventricular (AV) node resulting in the direct activation of the bundle of His by the sinoatrial (SA) node. Findings associated with a routine history and physical are rather scarce. The diagnosis of LGL requires the use of a resting EKG, where these patients typically display a pattern of short PR interval but normal QRS complex duration.
