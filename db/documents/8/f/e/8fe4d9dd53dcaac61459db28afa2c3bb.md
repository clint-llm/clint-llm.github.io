Each cTTE should be done in a step-wise fashion. The exam steps are typically defined by the institution, providing the interpreter with a stream-lined systematic approach to all cTTE reads. Such a defined systematic approach provides simplicity to interpreting each individual cTTE. Specifically for pediatric cTTEs, importance is placed on the initial recognition of basic anatomy to rule out or rule any CHD. This is done by starting with the subcostal view to identify the apex, ventricles, and great vessels. Once cardiac orientation is established, the sonographer should transition through windows in a sequential clockwise approach.

An fTTE, also known as a bedside TTE, has no specific technique. It is done strictly for rapid evaluation of structural-functional characteristics. Many fTTE machines do not even possess doppler or ECG gating capabilities. The apical and subcostal acoustic windows are most utilized.
