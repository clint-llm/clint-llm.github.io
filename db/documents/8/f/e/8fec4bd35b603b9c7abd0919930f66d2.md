The pathophysiology of manganese toxicity involves complex interactions between exposure and cell protein upregulation and downregulation. Occupational exposure from metalworking, battery manufacturing, mining, consumption of contaminated well water, tap water, infant formula, or TPN leads to excessive absorption and cellular uptake. Specific concomitant metal deficiencies and excess may lead to varying degrees of Mn absorption via the gastrointestinal tract, which preferentially accumulates in the basal ganglia of humans secondary to the location of Mn-specific transporters.

Bodily efflux via biliary and pancreatic elimination may be dysfunctional depending on comorbid disease states or dietary variation. Cellular efflux of Mn then may also be affected, typically via genetic loss-of-function mutations. Alterations in glutamate and glutamine metabolism and use, mitochondrial function, and triggering of cellular apoptosis and necrosis comprise the cellular response to manganism. These biochemical reactions eventually result in the neuropsychiatric manifestations of Mn toxicity. This will be discussed in greater detail in the toxicokinetics section of this article.
