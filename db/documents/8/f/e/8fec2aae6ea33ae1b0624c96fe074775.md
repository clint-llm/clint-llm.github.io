The location of the jugular foramina is at the base of the skull between the occipital bone and the temporal bone. The major venous sinuses that drain blood from the brain meet at an area posterior and medial to the occipital bone called the confluence of sinuses. The transverse sinuses, extend laterally from the confluence of sinuses and become the sigmoid sinuses as they begin to descend toward the jugular foramina. The occipital bone contains bony grooves on each side to accommodate the transverse and sigmoid sinuses. Superior and inferior petrosal veins join the sigmoid sinus as it nears the jugular foramen. As the inferior petrosal vein joins the sigmoid sinus, this now singular structure passes through the jugular foramen and becomes the internal jugular vein. In some cases, the inferior petrosal vein joins the internal jugular vein below the jugular foramen.

In some variants, the posterior meningeal artery can enter the cranium via the jugular foramen. This artery supplies mainly the dura in the posterior portion of the cranium.
