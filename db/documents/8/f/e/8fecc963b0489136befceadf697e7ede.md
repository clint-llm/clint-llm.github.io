# Continuing Education Activity

Salpingitis isthmica nodosa (SIN) occasionally referred to as diverticulosis of the fallopian tube is a common finding in patients investigated for ectopic pregnancies or infertility. Its etiology is still debated, however, it is likely the result of an acquired process. The management of SIN is aimed at restoring and maintaining fertility. This activity reviews the etiological theories, histopathology, history, investigations, and treatment of labyrinthitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the histopathology of salpingitis isthmica nodosa.
- Summarize the epidemiology of salpingitis isthmica nodosa.
- Review the management of salpingitis isthmica nodosa.

# Introduction

Salpingitis isthmica nodosa (SIN), occasionally referred to as diverticulosis of the fallopian tube, has an incidence of 0.6% to 11% in healthy fertile women and is strongly associated with both infertility and ectopic pregnancies.

**Anatomy**

Fallopian tubes typically range from 10 to 14 cm in length and have an external diameter of approximately 1 cm.

# Etiology

Although first being described in 1887 by Chiari, the etiology of salpingitis isthmica nodosa is frequently unknown. There are currently three proposed etiologies: infection, cellular invasion, and congenital malformations.

The most widely accepted of these states that infection during a woman’s reproductive years triggers a chronic inflammatory process within the fallopian tube. Researchers have demonstrated that females who have previous histological signs of salpingitis often have the outer membrane protein of C. trachomatis in the affected fallopian tube and/ or high serum antibody titers.Chlamydia infection and SIN. Another study demonstrated that 89% of women with SIN had evidence of inflammation in the affected tube. They concluded that SIN was either a direct complication of infection during reproductive years or that early infection increases the likelihood of future infections, which ultimately lead to SIN.

The non-inflammatory theory states that SIN results from an overgrowth of the inner layer of the fallopian tube, which eventually invades the mucosal wall.

Finally, the congenital theory, originally formulated by von Recklinghausen in 1896, states that the tube-like glands are, in fact, Wolffian rests. This is explained by the fact that the isthmus is the location where the Wolffian and Mullerian ducts cross during development. Other previously suggested etiologies include chronic tubal spasm and neoplasia.

# Epidemiology

Salpingitis isthmica nodosa has an incidence of 0.6 to 11% in healthy fertile women.

# Histopathology

Macroscopically salpingitis isthmica nodosa causes nodular thickening of the tunica muscularis. However, diagnosis can only be confirmed histologically by the presence of diverticula within a hypertrophic, irregular myosalpin.

There is often surrounding fibrous tissue or hypertrophy of smooth muscle, and there may be endometrial type stroma around the glands. The stromal response is typically minimal, and there is usually no significant atypia. These changes commonly occur in the proximal two-thirds of the fallopian tube. Majmudar suggested a histological classification system grade 1-3, based upon the depth of the lumen within the myosalpinx.

# History and Physical

Unfortunately, there are no pathognomic symptoms of SIN and patients can be completely asymptomatic.

# Evaluation

Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is the first-line investigation for infertility and a reliable diagnostic technique for salpingitis isthmica nodosa.

Laparoscopy of a patient with SIN will inevitably identify nodular swelling and thickening of the isthmus.

# Treatment / Management

**Assistive Reproductive Technology**

Assistive reproductive technology, mainly in the form of in vitro fertilization (IVF), has become the mainstay of management for SIN, due to its immediacy and minimally invasive nature. The success rates have also improved dramatically over the past decade with Wade et al. demonstrating that by the 5th cycle of IVF, the chance of live birth is 80.1%.

**Surgery**

Reconstructive proximal surgery, originally described in the 1890s, was the standard treatment for decades and has been shown to yield relatively high pregnancy rates of 34%.

**Gonadotrophin-releasing Hormone Analogues**

Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRH-a) have been used as a medical treatment for SIN. It is believed that these cause tubular patency by creating a hypoestrogenic environment which shrinks the underlying pathology, similar to the management of adenomyosis.

# Differential Diagnosis

**Carcinoma**

Carcinoma can mimic SIN due to similar gland placement.

**Tubular Endometriosis**

It can be difficult to differentiate tubular endometriosis and SIN when using hysterosalpingography. However, this can be confirmed histologically by the presence of tubal epithelium lining glands in SIN.

# Prognosis

While SIN itself does not directly cause mortality, and it dramatically increases a patient’s risk of having an ectopic pregnancy, which has a mortality rate of 2% in the developing world and 0.2% in developed countries.

# Complications

**Ectopic Pregnancies**

Salpingitis isthmica nodosa has a 10% incidence in females with ectopic tubular pregnancies.

**Infertility**

Karasick et al. found that 8.7% of females undergoing hysterosalpingograms for infertility had SIN.

**Hydrosalpinx**

Hydrosalpinx, dilation of the fallopian tube in the presence of distal obstruction, is a recognized complication of SIN.

# Consultations

Salpingitis isthmica nodosa is most likely to be identified during an HSG or diagnostic laparoscopy with chromopertubation.  If SIN is identified, referral to a reproductive endocrinologist capable of providing IVF or an appropriately skilled surgeon if Fallopian tube reconstruction is desired.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Due to the potential inflammatory/ post-infection cause of salpingitis isthmica nodosa, early identification/ treatment, or ideally prevention of sexually transmitted diseases may reduce the risk of developing SIN and it’s subsequent complications. This is best achieved through comprehensive education.Chlamydia is suspected to be the most prevalent cause of SIN, routine screening in high-risk populations at the time of a pap smear is warranted.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

A knowledgable interdisciplinary team that communicates effectively is key to any patient with SIN receiving optimum care. Firstly, both primary and secondary care physicians should have a comprehensive understanding of the condition so that it is part of their differentials in any patient presenting with infertility or ectopic pregnancy. Radiologists should be familiar with its appearance on hysterosalpingography, whilst, as SIN can only be confirmed histologically, pathologists must have a strong knowledge of its identifying features.

Both ectopic pregnancies and infertility can have a dramatic effect on a patient’s life and relationships. Therefore, the nursing staff is essential in providing emotional and psychosocial support for these patients. Finally, pharmacists are fundamental in advising physicians regarding the most appropriate medical management of the symptoms of SIN and the treatment of non-surgical candidates.
