Each hair follicle is divided into bulb, suprabulbar, isthmus, and infundibular zones. Hair collectively participates in the normal hair cycle of anagen, catagen, and telogen (growth, involution, and quiescence respectively). The anagen phase typically lasts for 3 to 5 years with a growth rate of 1 cm per month.

An anagen hair shaft has 3 layers: the medulla, cortex, and cuticle from the center out. The cuticle interlocks with the inner root sheath cuticle and it is abnormal keratinization of this inner root sheath that is central to loose anagen hair syndrome.

A K6HF mutation of keratin has been described in some families with loose anagen hair syndrome.
