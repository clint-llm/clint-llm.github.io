The social taboo associated with genitourinary symptoms often becomes a challenge in obtaining a complete and accurate history from patients. Some studies have suggested that appropriate treatment of acute Genitourinary infection with a 3-month course of antibiotics can prevent ReA. However, this is highly controversial.

Similarly, from a physician's perspective, identifying the triad of visual, genitourinary, and arthritis symptoms to a pattern of unifying diagnosis are time-sensitive. It is even more so when acute uveitis or iritis sets in, as they can rapidly progress to permanent loss of visual function if not intervened upon in due time.
