Spinal stenosis is a disease process that results from the narrowing of the vertebral spinal canal and the lateral recesses. This often leads to the compression of the structures located within the spinal canal, including the spinal cord, nearby nerve tissue, and cerebrospinal fluid. There are multiple factors that can lead to the narrowing. This includes bulging or protrusion of the intervertebral disc, herniation of the nucleus pulposus posteriorly, epidural fat deposition, hypertrophy of posterior longitudinal ligament, or the ligamentum flavum, and hypertrophy of the facet joints.
