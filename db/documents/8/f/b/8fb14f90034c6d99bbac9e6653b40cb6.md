Patient education should primarily focus on helping the parents of a child with anorectal malformation understand the long-term issues that the child will potentially face surrounding continence. The three clinical features, when combined, can assist in predicting the long term potential for continence include the type of anorectal malformation, the sacral ratio, and the quality of the spinal cord. In terms of the type of anorectal malformation, the further the fistula from the normal anatomic location, the lower the likelihood of continence. A normal sacral ratio is 0.9 and a sacral ratio less than 0.4 is a poor predictor of continence. Urinary tract infections also require tracking in patients with anorectal malformations. In female patients, the onset of menstruation is vital to ensure no Mullerian obstruction exists.Â  Finally, the presence of spinal anomaly such as tethered cord also predicts a lower potential for bowel control.
