If the pituitary becomes large enough, it may impinge on the optic chasm causing visual defects, including problems with visual fields and, ultimately, bilateral hemianopsia. In addition, as described above, patients may also get a paradoxical worsening of their vision with the initiation of treatment with thyroxine as a result of an imbalance of TSH production and release and increase in pituitary size.

There are a few extremely rare complications related to treatment. Pseudotumor cerebri has been described as occurring with the initiation of levothyroxine in some case reports. This highlights the importance of being aware of such complications so that upon follow up of these patients, a neurologic examination and fundoscopic examination should be performed.

IfÂ the pituitary hyperplasia is sufficiently long-standing, it can result in other hormonal deficiencies and, ultimately, hypopituitarism.

Another extremely rare complication of pituitary hyperplasia due to primary hypothyroidism is spontaneous ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Patients with this condition can present in a varied manner depending on the severity with abdominal discomfort, ascites, electrolyte derangements, elevated creatinine, and respiratory distress.
