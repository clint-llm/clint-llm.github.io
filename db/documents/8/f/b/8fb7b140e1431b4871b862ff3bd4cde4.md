A thorough clinical and radiographic evaluation is an absolute requirement when assessing a possible cervical spine injury.

The maintenance of cervical spine stability varies with the age of the patient. As a young child grows, head circumferenceÂ enlarges faster than the chest circumference. When placed on an unmodified spine board, their necks get forced into flexion due to the disproportionate size of their heads.

A methodical sensory and motor exam, including reflexes of the upper and lower extremities, should be performed to identify any neurological deficits or any upper motor neuron signs that may indicate cord compression. Any deficit may also be used to help localize the level of injury in the cervical spine. It is important to remember that in the cervical spine, the numbered nerve root will exit above the associate vertebral body, i.e., the C5 nerve root exits through the foramen between C4 and C5.

A detailed history can help define the mechanism of action of the injury as well as identify any pre-existing conditions that may lead to a higher susceptibility of cervical injury, such as AS or spinal fusion either congenital or surgical.

In the setting of an athletic injury with a cervical spine injury suspected, the player needs to be evaluated and handled carefully. A full neurologic exam is a must. The cervical spine should be immobilized, and the player placed on a spine board.
