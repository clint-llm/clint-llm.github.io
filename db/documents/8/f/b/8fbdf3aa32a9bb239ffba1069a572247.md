Symptomatic superficial insufficiency of veins greater than 3 mm in diameter that is refractory to compression stockings therapy in individuals greater than 18 years of age is an indication for treatment. Usually, this is limited to the GSV and SSV. Perforator veins can be treated if they are greater than 3.5 mm in diameter with greater than 500 milliseconds of reflux, and the perforator happens to run beneath a healed or active venous ulcer.

Symptoms generally include throbbing discomfort, burning pain, pruritus, leg swelling, leg heaviness, fatigue, spontaneous bleeding from varicosities. Advanced venous disease may present as poorly healing ulcers. Chronic venous disease may present with skin changes such as eczema, corona phlebectatica, lipodermatosclerosis, or diffuse hyperpigmentation of the lower legs.

Corona phlebectatica (ankle flare or malleolar flare) is a term that indicates short sized veins occurring in a fan-shaped pattern in the medial or the lateral aspects of the foot next to the malleoli.

Lipodermatosclerosis describes thickened bound skin involving the tissues below the knee.
