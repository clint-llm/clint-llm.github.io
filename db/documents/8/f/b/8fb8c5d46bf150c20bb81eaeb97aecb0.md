**Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)**

**Stage I**

Surgery is the mainstay of treating stage 1 NSCLC. The procedure of choice is either lobectomy or pneumonectomy with mediastinal lymph node sampling. The 5-year survival is 78% for IA and 53% for IB disease. In patients who do not have the pulmonary reserve to tolerate pneumonectomy or lobectomy, a more conservative approach with wedge resection or segmentectomy can be done. The disadvantage is a higher local recurrence rate, but survival is the same. Local postoperative radiation therapy or adjuvant chemotherapy has not been shown to improve outcomes in stage I disease.

**Stage II**

The survival of stage IIA and IIB lung is 46% and 36%, respectively. The preferred treatment is surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. If the tumor has invaded the chest wall, then an en-bloc resection of the chest wall is recommended. Pancoast tumor is a unique tumor of stage II. It arises from the superior sulcus and is usually diagnosed at a higher stage, IIB or IIIA. The treatment of choice in cases of Pancoast tumor is neoadjuvant chemotherapy, usually with etoposide and cisplatin and concurrent radiotherapy followed by resection. Overall survival is 44% to 54% depending on postsurgery presence or absence of microscopic disease in the resected specimen.

**Stage III**

This is the most heterogeneous group, consisting of a wide variety of tumor invasion and lymph node involvement.

In stage IIIA disease with N1 lymph nodes, surgery with curative intent is the treatment of choice. Unfortunately, a significant number of patients are found to have an N2 disease at the time of resection. The current consensus is to perform surgery as planned, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. There is no agreement on treatment for patients with stage IIIA tumors with N2/N3 lymph nodes. If the patient has good performance status and no weigh-loss, then concurrent chemo-radiotherapy affords the best outcome. However, concurrent chemo-radiotherapy is not as tolerated and can cause severe esophagitis. Sequential therapy is better tolerated. Survival is 40% to 45% in the first two years, but five-year survival is only 20%.

T4 tumors are usually treated exclusively with chemoradiation. Surgery may be an option in T4 N0-1 tumors with carinal involvement. The operative mortality of carinal resection is 10% to 15%, and survival is approximately 20%. If a tumor is T4 due to ipsilateral nonprimary lobe nodules with no mediastinal involvement, then surgery alone renders five-year survival of 20%

Stage IIIB tumors are treated the same way unresectable IIIA cancers are treated, with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy. For a select few patients, post-induction chemo-radiotherapy, surgery might be an option. The trials on the survival of patients with IIIB tumors also included inoperable IIIA tumors; therefore, the survival in IIIB patients is unknown.

**Stage IV**

Stage IV disease is considered incurable, and therapy is aimed at improving survival and alleviating symptoms. Only 10% to 30% of patients respond to chemotherapy, and only 1% to 3% survive five years after diagnosis. Single or double drug-based chemotherapy is offered to patients with functional performance status. There is a small survival benefit from chemotherapy.

In highly select patients, non-squamous NSCLC without brain metastasis or hemoptysis might benefit from the addition of bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor.

**Targeted Therapy for NSCLC**

In the early 2000s, researchers discovered that specific mutations encode critical proteins for cell growth and replication. These mutations were named “driver mutations.” It was proposed that blocking these mutation pathways may improve survival in lung cancer patients. The current practice is to check for the following mutations in every advanced NSCLC. Each of these mutations has a specific inhibitor available:

- EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) is a mutation inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib.

- ALK (Anaplastic lymphoma kinase) includes the specific inhibitors crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib. A structurally similar mutation is ROS-1. The FDA recently approved crizotinib for treating cancers expressing ROS-1 mutation.

**Immunotherapy for NSCLC**

Immunotherapy boosts the immune system and helps it recognize cancer cells as foreign, and increases their responsiveness. There are several check-points to decrease autoimmunity and autodestruction of the body’s cells by the immune system. Malignant cells co-opt these check-points and create tolerance in the immune system. Of these check-points, programmed-death receptor 1 (PD-1) has been of particular interest recently. PD-1 plays an important role in down-regulating T-cells and promotes self-tolerance. However, it also renders the immune system less effective against tumor cells. PD-1 interacts with two proteins: PD-L1 and PD-L2. This binding results in the inactivation of activated T-cells. At the moment, there are antibodies approved for PD-1 and its ligand, PD-L1 only. They inhibit the PD-1 receptor directly or bind to PD-L1, thus preventing it from inactivating the activated T-cell.

Nivolumab is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody against PD-1. It is approved by the FDA for squamous and non-squamous NSCLC that has progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy. It can be used in patients with high or low PD-L1 expression status. Pembrolizumab is also an IgG4 monoclonal antibody against PD-1. It is approved for pre-treated metastatic NSCLC with greater than 50% expression of PD-L1 and does not harbor EGFR and ALK mutations. It is also combined with pemetrexed and carboplatin for metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with less than 50% expression of PD-L1. Atezolizumab is an IgG1 antibody against PD-L1. It is approved for use in metastatic, progressive NSCLC during or following treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. It can be used in patients who express EGFR and ALK mutations and fail targeted therapy. Bevacizumab is not considered immune therapy. It is an anti-angiogenesis antibody that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). It is primarily used in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy to treat non-squamous NSCLC. It is contraindicated in squamous cell NSCLC due to the risk of severe and often fatal hemoptysis. It is also used to treat breast, renal, colon, and brain cancers.

**Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment**

SCLC is very sensitive to chemotherapy, but unfortunately, has a very high recurrence rate. Treatment for SCLC is according to the stage of the disease.

**Treatment of Limited-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer**

Stage I limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) is lobectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. These include SCLC presenting as peripheral nodules without mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Care should be taken in completely ruling out lymph node involvement. This is done by PET-CT followed by lymph node sampling by EBUS bronchoscopy or mediastinoscopy even if PET-CT was negative for lymph node size or FDG uptake.

LS-SCLC with mediastinal or hilar lymph node involvement is 4 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is indicated to avoid recurrence since nearly 80% of SCLC will recur locally without radiation therapy. There are multiple approaches to treatment, including concurrent and alternate chemo-radiotherapy or sequential treatments. Concurrent and alternative paths have slightly better outcomes, although they are more toxic than other approaches. Sequential therapy is much better tolerated.

In patients who achieve remission, prophylactic whole brain radiation is also done. This significantly reduces symptomatic brain metastasis and increases overall survival.

**Treatment of Extensive-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (ES-SCLC)**

Extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) includes distant metastasis, malignant pleural or pericardial effusions, contralateral hilar, or supraclavicular lymph node involvement. Treatment is with platinum-based chemotherapy. Up to 50% to 60% of patients show remission and should be offered radiation therapy followed by prophylactic whole-brain irradiation. Median survival from the time of diagnosis of ES-SCLC is only 8 to 13 months, and only about 5% of patients survive two years postdiagnosis.
