Citalopram is available as 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg oral tablets and  10 mg/5 mL oral solution. It is administered by oral route for adults younger than 60 years.

- An initial dose of 20 mg once daily (morning or evening, with or without food)

- Increase the dose to 40 mg after one week (maximum dose of 40 mg daily)

- The maximum dose is 20 mg daily for patients older than 60 years of age or poor metabolizers of CYP2C19.

Patients at risk of significant side effects or overstimulation using citalopram should be started on a lower-end dose. The dose should be increased gradually in 10 mg increments to optimize therapy. Currently, anecdotal reports suggest that higher doses may benefit those afflicted with OCD; however, doses of more than 40 mg daily are not recommended due to the risk of QT prolongation.

**Specific Population**

**Pregnant Women:**It is FDA pregnancy category C medicine. Not an absolute contraindication in pregnancy but is not generally recommended, especially during the first trimester. Clinicians treating women with psychiatric conditions must inform whether these medicines are needed during pregnancy.

**Breastfeeding Women:**According to the safety scoring system, citalopram is acceptable during breastfeeding. If the mother used citalopram while pregnant or other psychotropic drugs have been a therapeutic failure, most experts recommend against changing medicines while breastfeeding. Drugs with lower excretion into breastmilk are generally preferred, especially while nursing preterm infant or newborns. Monitor breastfed newborns for poor feeding, excess drowsiness, restlessness, agitation, and poor weight gain. Extra care should be exercised in a younger and exclusively breastfed infant when a breastfeeding woman is on psychotropic drugs.

**Hepatic Impairment:**According to product labeling dose needs to be reduced to 20 mg per day for patients with hepatic impairment.

**Renal Impairment:**No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Closely monitor patients with severe renal impairment for possible adverse reactions.

**Elderly Population:**Citalopram is listed in Beers Criteria as potentially inappropriate medicine and should be used with caution in patients 65 years and older as it can cause or worsen hyponatremia or SIADH.

**Pharmacokinetics**

- The onset of action for depression is about 1 to 4 weeks. However, the complete response may take 8 to 12 weeks after initiation of treatment.

- Bioavailability is 80%. Tablets and oral solutions are bioequivalent.

- Half-life is 24 to 48 hours (average: 35 hours); however, half-life significantly increases in patients with hepatic impairment, mild-to-moderate renal impairment, in elderly patients (60 years or older), and poor CYP2C19 metabolizers.

- Metabolized by CYP450 3A4 and 2C19; a weak inhibitor of CYP450 2D6.
