A colon transit study may be employed to test for the functionality of the gastrocolic reflex. The gold standard for measuring colon transit time utilizes a radiopaque indicator that is easy to do and relatively low cost. The only downside to this test is that it subjects the patient undergoing radiation exposure. Another test utilized is radionuclide scintigraphy. This is done using a labeled radioisotope and viewed through a specialized camera. The patient swallows a labeled radioisotope, and it gets followed throughout transit through the GI tract; this approach exposes a lesser degree of radiation. Both of these transit studies are usually for research purposes and less often used in clinical practice. Colonic manometry and bead expulsion are more frequently used to assess the contractility and motility of the colon. Colonic manometry is a more common modality in children with colonic dysmotility, encopresis, and abdominal pain. They record various colonic motor contractions and guide the further courses of treatment, including the need for surgical interventions.
