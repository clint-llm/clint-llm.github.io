As part of their preventative care guidelines, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends adults over 50 years old receive herpes zoster vaccination to lower their risk of viral reactivation. There is one vaccine on the market -  an inactivated recombinant vaccine. The inactivated vaccine was approved in 2018 and is administered as a 2-dose series. It has demonstrated 97% efficacy in patients aged 50 to 70 and 90% efficacy in patients older than 70 years.  Patients can still receive the inactivated vaccine despite having previously received the live vaccine. The safety of the inactivated vaccine in immunocompromised patients is still under investigation. While vaccination does not completely protect against herpes zoster, vaccinated individuals tend to have shorter and less severe disease courses. The spread of disease can be mitigated by advising all patients with an active infection to keep the rash covered and perform frequent handwashing. Those with disseminated disease also require airborne precautions. All patients with herpes zoster should avoid contact with pregnant women, immunologically naïve infants and children, and immunocompromised individuals.
