Though specific symptoms are possible, most patients with a ureteral inguinal hernia present no differently than the typical groin hernia. In either type of ureteral inguinal hernia, obstructive uropathy and urological symptoms may be present, regardless of the length of ureter involved. Flank pain, dysuria, hematuria, acute urinary obstruction, double-phase micturition requiring pressure to initiate or terminate voiding associated with an inguinal hernia may signal the presence of a ureteral inguinal hernia. On laboratory investigation, the clinicians may see an acute kidney injury.
