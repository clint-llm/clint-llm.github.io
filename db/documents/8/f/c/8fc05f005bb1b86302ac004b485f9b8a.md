As a means of measuring the physiologic changes during shock, central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), CO, SVR, HR, BP, and O2 saturation are used to describe the severity of shock and help to determine the etiology. Typically, with hemorrhagic shock the CVP and PCWP are noted to decrease, the cardiac output decreases and the SVR increases due to the body’s attempt to compensate for the loss in volume. In septic shock, the CVP and PCWP decrease, but the SVR decreases as well due to diffuse vasodilation, as a result the CO increases as the heart attempts to compensate. In cardiogenic shock, the CVP and PCWP actually increase due to the drop in cardiac function. In addition, the CO decreases and the SVR increases to maintain perfusion pressures. In neurogenic the CVP, PCWP, CO, and SVR are all expected to drop due to the body’s lack of any neurologic stimulation to sustain vasoconstriction or a compensatory increase in CO. Adrenal insufficiency is noted to also follow the same trends as a neurogenic shock.
