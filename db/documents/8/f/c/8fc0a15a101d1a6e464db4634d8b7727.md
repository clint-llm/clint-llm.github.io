The results of a hepatitis panel should correlate with the initial findings in a complete history and physical examination. A thorough review should include essential questions regarding the patient’s age, past medical history (diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac sprue, thyroid disorders, autoimmune hepatitis, acquired muscle disorders, alcohol consumption, medication use, toxin exposure, and family history of genetic liver conditions (Wilson’s disease, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, hereditary hemochromatosis).

A review of systems should also include signs and symptoms of chronic liver disease such as jaundice, ascites, peripheral edema, hepatosplenomegaly, gynecomastia, testicular hypotrophy, muscle wasting, encephalopathy, pruritus, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

A hepatitis panel’s reference ranges can fluctuate amongst different laboratories. Reported values also can vary depending on gender, body mass index, and past medical history. Repeated liver enzymes are typically unnecessary in the workup for elevated transaminase levels.
