Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a bacterial infection resulting in bloody dysentery and an increased risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). EHEC serotype O157:H7 is responsible for global outbreaks of bloody diarrhea and HUS. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical manifestations of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). 
- Describe the evaluation of a patient suspected of having enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). 
- Explain the management of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). 
- The management of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is interprofessional. In general, the primary care provider and nurse practitioner should educate the patient on the prevention of foodborne diseases. This can be achieved most effectively through the application of food safety assurance programs.
