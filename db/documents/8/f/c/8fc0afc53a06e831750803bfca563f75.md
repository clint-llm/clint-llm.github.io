Mild reactions are self-limiting and often resolve spontaneously within 24 hours. The patient should be treated for symptoms and kept under observation. To date, the best evidence from available randomized and controlled trials in the prevention of the JHR has been in support of TNF-alpha antibodies and, in some cases, steroids as well. In one of the studies, there was a significantly lower rise in temperature, blood pressure, and pulse rate when premedicated with TNF-alpha antibody. Additionally, plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 and 8 were significantly decreased. While other premedications such as acetaminophen may mitigate the symptoms or duration of the JHR, the reaction itself is not prevented. The clinician should forewarn the patient about the possibility of a reaction.

Patients must be closely monitored for abnormalities in vital signs, which may indicate intravenous fluids and other support. Treatment of severe leptospirosis-related JHR with crystalloid infusion, corticosteroids, vasopressors, inotropic support, and transient dialysis has been reported.

In pregnant women treated for syphilis, the reaction incidence nears 40%. Fetal monitoring is imperative in these patients as recurrent variable decelerations are often seen. There are, however, various considerations to reduce the risk of reaction and improve outcomes in a patient, such as antibiotic selection (e.g., using azithromycin as a treatment in HIV patients with early syphilis).
