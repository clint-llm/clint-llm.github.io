Superficial thrombophlebitis, increasingly known as superficial venous thrombosis, is no longer considered a benign entity. It is often associated with concomitant deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, potentially due to a more sinister underlying issue. As such, there is limited consensus on treatment, which makes further study of this topic necessary. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of superficial venous thrombosis and highlights the healthcare team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of superficial thrombophlebitis.
- Identify critical elements in the evaluation of patients with superficial thrombophlebitis that predispose patients to concomitant deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
- Outline the management options available for superficial thrombophlebitis.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies to improve coordination of care and communication to advance the diagnosis of superficial thrombophlebitis and concomitant deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and more sinister underlying causes and thereby improve outcomes.
