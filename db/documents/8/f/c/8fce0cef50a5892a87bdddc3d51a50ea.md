**History**

Evaluation should be based on the presentation during the clinic visit. Pes planus is very common in young children and asymptomatic. In rare instances, flat feet can become painful or rigid, which may be a sign of underlying foot pathology, such as tarsal coalition. Through developmental history, past medical history, past surgical history, family history of pes planus, and activity level (sports participation or avoidance) should be documented.

In adults, pes planus may be an incidental finding. In symptomatic patients, there may be complaints of the midfoot, heel, lower leg, knee, hip, and or back pain. Patients with more advanced changes may complain of an altered gait pattern. Patients who typically overpronate will be at high risk for ankle sprains from chronic “rolling of the ankle.” The patient should be asked about the onset of deformity, timing of symptoms, severity of past and current symptoms, history of trauma, family history, surgical history, and past medical history (including hypertension, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, sensory neuropathies, seronegative spondyloarthropathies, and obesity).

**Physical Exam**

The physical exam should consist mainly of inspection, palpation, ROM, muscle strength testing, and gait assessment. A comparison should be made to the unaffected foot.

Inspection: The examiner should evaluate the patient with and without weight-bearing. The flat foot should be apparent on inspection. The flexible flat foot will have an arch without weight-bearing, which will disappear with weight-bearing. The patient will be noted to overpronate. Looking at the patient from the back will show the “too many toes” sign.

Palpation: Examiner should palpate the posterior tibial tendon, lateral rearfoot, and plantar fascia.

ROM: This will differentiate flexible versus rigid pes planus. Flexibility can also be assessed by using the Hubscher maneuver (Jack test) to determine if the deformity is reducible.

Muscle strength testing: The examiner can evaluate muscle strength by having the patient perform a single toe raise. Posterior tibial tendon muscle strength can be evaluated by having the patient invert the foot against resistance.

Gait assessment: The patient may have an antalgic gait. Examiners may notice overpronation with ambulation.
