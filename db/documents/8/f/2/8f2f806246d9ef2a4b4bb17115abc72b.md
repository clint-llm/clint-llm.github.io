Many considerations should be accounted for when performing surgery on the areas, particularly the pelvis. The pelvis is a difficult space to enter as the pelvic bones limit access safely, extensive vasculature and nerve plexuses reside here, as well as organs necessary for reproduction. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is frequently injured in hip replacement procedures; the anterior approach puts the nerve at highest risk for injury. Patient's will have numbness in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. When casting or splinting the lower limbs after surgery, many patients can experience foot drop and loss of sensation on the dorsal aspect of the foot. Wrapping the cast too tight and post-procedural swelling can cause the fibular nerve to be trapped between the cast and the head of the fibula leading to an inability of the nerve to transmit information.
