Erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) is a rare, chronic dermatosis that is characterized by red–violet to red–brown papules, plaques, and nodules that favor the extensor surfaces. Lesions often are asymptomatic, though patients may experience pain or a burning sensation. Extracutaneous symptoms include arthralgia, fever, or other constitutional symptoms. The condition is benign in nature but may be associated with infections, hematologic abnormalities, autoimmune diseases, or other conditions. Spontaneous resolution often occurs after 5 to 10 years.
