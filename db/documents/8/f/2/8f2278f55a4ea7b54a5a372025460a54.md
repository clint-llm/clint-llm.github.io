The incidence of Achilles tendon ruptures vary in the literature, with recent studies reporting a rate of 18 patients per 100,000 patient population annually. Regarding athletic individuals, the incidence rate of Achilles tendon injuries ranges from 6% to 18%, and football players are the least likely to develop this problem compared to gymnasts and tennis players. About a million athletes are believed to have Achilles tendon injuries each year.

The true incidence of Achilles tendinosis is unknown, although reported incidence rates are 7% to 18% in runners, 9% in dancers, 5% in gymnasts, 2% in tennis players, and less than 1% in American football players. Achilles disorders affect approximately 1 million athletes per year.

The incidence of Achilles tendon injuries is increasing in the USA because of more participation of people in sporting activities. The exact incidence of Achilles tendon injuries is unknown outside the USA, but studies from Denmark and Scotland reveal 6 to 37 cases per 100,000 persons.

Achilles tendon injuries appear more commonly in males, probably related to greater participation in sports activities. Most injuries are seen between the third and fifth decade of life. Many of these individuals are only active intermittently and rarely warm up.
