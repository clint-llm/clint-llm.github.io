Lactic acid, the end product of anaerobic glycolysis, is commonly measured in the inpatient setting. Because anaerobic glycolysis predominates when tissue is poorly oxygenated or perfused, lactic acid levels are useful in directing the management of severe sepsis, shock, blood loss, anemia, or heart failure. Hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis are indicative of inefficient cardiac outputÂ and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.
