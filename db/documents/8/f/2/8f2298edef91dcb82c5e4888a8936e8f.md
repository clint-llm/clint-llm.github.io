Functional asplenism is a gradual process that begins with hyposplenism. The process is not well understood. With diseases like sickle cell, researchers believe that entrapment of red blood cells (RBCs) in the spleen followed by splenic infarction leads to hyposplenism. The hyposplenism eventually proceeds to functional asplenism by autosplenectomy. In other hematologic disorders, functional asplenism occurs due to splenic tissue infiltration by a number of mechanisms including infiltration of tumor cells, sarcoid, amyloid deposition or even by a vascular occlusion.
