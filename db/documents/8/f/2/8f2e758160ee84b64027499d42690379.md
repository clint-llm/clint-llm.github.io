Body liposuction requires an astute anesthesiologist to help mitigate any fluid losses and shifts that are incited by the procedure. It has been demonstrated in the literature that approximately 30% of the wetting solution that is infiltrated may be removed during liposuction; however, the remaining wetting solution can shift into the intravascular space postoperatively.

Thankfully, guidelines exist for intraoperative fluid management for our anesthesia colleagues assisting with liposuction.

- If the lipoaspirate remains under a total volume of 4 liters, simple maintenance fluid rates should be adhered to. However, once lipoaspirate volumes exceed 4 liters, then the maintenance fluid rate should be instituted as well as an additional formula replacing 0.25 mL of crystalloid for every 1 mL of lipoaspirate suctioned out after the 4-liter threshold has been crossed. Although unique biomechanics below the head and neck allow for large volume liposuction and its associated large volumes of wetting solution, nevertheless, the surgeon and the anesthesiologist should be astutely observing for any effects of hemodynamic instability or local anesthetic toxicity.
