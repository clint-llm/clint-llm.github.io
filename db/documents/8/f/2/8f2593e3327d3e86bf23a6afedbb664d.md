There is no perfect way to predict when difficult intubations will occur.

Predictors of failed mask ventilation have been reviewed in the Airway Assessment StatPearls article.

Predictors of difficult or failed video laryngoscopy include:

- Obesity

- Clinician inexperience with video laryngoscopy

- Blood, secretions, or vomit in the oropharynx

- Higher Cormack-Lehane grades with direct laryngoscopy

- Limited mouth opening

Predictors of difficult or failed supraglottic airway placement include:

- Obesity

- A small mouth opening

- Upper airway pathology

- Limited neck extension

- Cricoid pressure

Predictors of difficult or failed emergency front-of-neck airway access (eFONA) include:

- Obesity

- Indurated skin changes due to surgery and/or radiation

- Flexed neck deformity

- Displaced trachea

- Female sex

Obesity and especially morbid obesity may make airway management more difficult and contribute to an unsuccessful rescue. Â This may mandate that the best approach might be awake intubation in some cases.

Management strategies for the physiologically difficult airway include:

- Providing supplemental oxygen (low or high flow) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)

- Treating hypotension with intravenous fluids or pressors

- Delaying intubation until the severe metabolic acidosis is improved

- Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to assess the severity of right ventricular dysfunction/failure

- Choice of drugs based on the patient's hemodynamics

- Possibly securing the airway with the patient awake and breathing spontaneously
