Eagle syndrome was named after Watt W. Eagle an otolaryngologist at Duke University, who described the first cases in 1937.  It is a rare condition caused by an elongated or disfigured styloid process, which interferes with the functioning of neighboring structures and gives rise to orofacial and cervical pain often triggered by neck movements. Eagle syndrome is also referred to as a stylohyoid syndrome, styloid syndrome, or styloid–carotid artery syndrome by some authors.
