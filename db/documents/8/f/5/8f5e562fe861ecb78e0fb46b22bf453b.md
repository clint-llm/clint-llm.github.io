**De Quervain's Tenosynovitis**

- Stenosing tenosynovitis in the first dorsal extensor compartment

- Pain, tenderness, and swelling over the lateral wrist

- No sensory disturbance

- Cheiralgia paresthetica itself gives a false positive Finkelstein test. Although, it may be associated with de Quervain tenosynovitis. Up to 50% of patients with cheiralgia paresthetica also get a diagnosis of de Quervain tenosynovitis

**Lateral Antebrachial Cutaneous Nerve Neuritis**

- A lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve provides sensation to the lateral forearm

- Positive Tinel test over the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve may be mistaken for positive Tinel test over the superficial branch of the radial nerve

- The superficial branch of the radial nerve and lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve neuritis may coexist

- The sensory overlap between the superficial branch of the radial nerve and lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve in the dorsoradial hand occurs in 21% to 75% of patients. Cadaveric dissections demonstrated the connection comes from the lateral branch of the superficial branch of the radial nerve.

- Check Tinel's test just distal to antecubital fossa just medial to the brachioradialis where the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve exits deep fascia

- Tinel test may be positive in the course of the superficial branch of the radial nerve when there is a more proximal issue

- Must perform nerve block to lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve before the superficial branch of the radial nerve to rule out a false-positive superficial branch of the radial nerve block if overlap exists

**Thumb Carpometacarpal Joint Arthritis**

- Pain at the in the radial aspect of the wrist

- Pain and weakness with motion, grip, and pinch

- Crepitus with motion

- Positive Grind Test: pain with a circular motion of thumb while applying axial compression

- Possible adduction deformity of the thumb carpometacarpal joint alone or in combination with a hyperextension deformity of the thumb metacarpophalangeal joint (Z-type deformity)

- No sensory deficit

**Proximal Nerve Lesion**

- Spinal cords lesions, nerve root compressions, brachial plexus injuries encompassing the posterior cords, radial nerve palsies, posterior interosseous nerve syndrome, and radial tunnel syndrome.

- Sensory disturbances will likely be associated with strength deficits.

**Intersection Syndrome**

- Pain in the dorsoradial aspect of the forearm

- Crepitus over the intersection of abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis with extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi radialis brevis

- No sensory deficit
