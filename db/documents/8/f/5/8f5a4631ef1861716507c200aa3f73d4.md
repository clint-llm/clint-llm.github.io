Dumping syndrome can occur after a variety of gastric procedures and occurs due to the rapid movement of hyperosmolar chyme from the stomach into the small intestine. Most cases of dumping syndrome are successfully treated with dietary adjustments. Specifically, meals should be divided so that smaller portions of food are consumed with greater frequency, and liquids should not be consumed until 30 minutes after each meal. Additionally, simple sugars and milk products should be avoided and protein and fat calories should be increased to compensate for a decreased carbohydrate intake. Fiber-rich food is encouraged as it promotes a longer transit time in the bowel. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of dumping syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the education and management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of dumping syndrome.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with dumping syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for dumping syndrome.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of dumping syndrome and improve outcomes.
