Adhesive capsulitis (AC), is also known as frozen shoulder an insidious painful condition of the shoulder persisting more than 3 months. This inflammatory condition that causes fibrosis of the glenohumeral joint capsule is accompanied by gradually progressive stiffness and significant restriction of range of motion (typically external rotation). However, the patients may develop symptoms suddenly and have a slow recovery phase. The recovery is satisfying in most of the cases, even though this may take up to 2 to 3 years. This activity examines when adhesive capsulitis should be considered on differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate it, as well as highlighting the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pathophysiology of frozen shoulder/adhesive capsulitis.
- Describe the diagnostic approach for evaluating adhesive capsulitis.
- Review treatment and management options for patients with frozen shoulder/adhesive capsulitis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of frozen shoulder and achieve optimal outcomes.
