The diagnostic test of choice for mononucleosis is the heterophile antibody (monospot) test. This can be occasionally falsely negative in early disease and require repeat testing later in the course of the illness.

The most important entity to exclude from the differential diagnosis is primary HIV infection.

Splenic rupture is a rare complication in mononucleosis but can be potentially life-threatening if not diagnosed in a timely fashion.  Consider it on the differential in the patient with classic mononucleosis, abdominal pain, and anemia. Airway obstruction is another rarely seen adverse outcome that requires immediate treatment and management.
