The initial changes can be observed 2 to 3 hours following radiation and are mainly inhibition of epithelial apoptosis in the crypts. They appear smaller with time as the migration of epithelial cells continues despite continued cell death. With time, the villi cells are lost; this leads to the absence of infectious and fluid barriers of the intestine. Apoptotic fragments consisting of nuclear or cytoplasm fragments and condensation of cytoplasm may also be visible.
