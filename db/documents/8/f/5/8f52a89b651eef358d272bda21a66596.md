Parkinsonism in any form is debilitating. Preventive measures should be taken to reduce future consequences.

- Patients with parkinsonism are at an increased risk of falling, and thus, appropriate measures like installing handles and bars are necessary

- Adequate driving safety should be maintained - if symptoms get worse patients should refrain entirely from driving

- Patients and families can gain assistance by joining local support groups with similar individuals

- A regular follow-up with the speech therapist is essential
