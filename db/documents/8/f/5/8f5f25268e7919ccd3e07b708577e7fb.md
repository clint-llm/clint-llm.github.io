The metacarpophalangeal (MP or MCP) joint, also known as “the knuckle,” is formed by the articulation of the metacarpal head and proximal phalanx. This multiaxial joint allows flexion and extension as well as abduction and adduction motions. The MP joint also dynamically coordinates with the interphalangeal (IP) joint to perform thumb opposition and composite finger flexion. The MP joint has implications in many congenital or acquired deformities, sports-related injuries, and degenerative conditions and sequelae.
