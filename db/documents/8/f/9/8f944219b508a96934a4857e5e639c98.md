As mentioned, the gold standard for diagnosis is a histopathologic examination of tissue samples. Notably, the sensitivity of examined tissue is low, and sensitivity can be increased by utilizing the press-imprint-smear method. Parasite culture tubes with Novy-MacNeal-Nicolle medium can be used but is technically difficult with low sensitivity. Micro-culture technologies have increased sensitivity up to 98.4% and are 100% specific. Serologic studies including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, western blot, or direct agglutination are rarely used due to a poor humoral response by leishmaniasis and therefore low sensitivity. Purified antigen preparations or recombinant antigens increase the performance of these studies. Serum levels of anti-alpha-Gal IgG have been noted to be elevated in individuals infected with L. tropica and L. major. This test may be valuable as a marker of a cure for Old World CL. Intradermal skin tests have been used with good sensitivity and specificity with delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reactions equal to 5 mm is considered positive. A large disadvantage is the inability of skin testing to distinguish between prior or current infection. Polymerase chain reaction and nucleic acid amplification tests are being increasingly utilized and are both sensitive and specific.

For patients with suspected visceral disease, tissue samples may not easily be obtained, and testing with direct agglutination and rK39 dipstick testing may have more of a utility. Direct agglutination among patients with visceral/systemic involvement has a sensitivity of 97-100% and specificity of 86% to 92%. Bone marrow biopsy may be needed and is commonly positive among patients with suspected marrow involvement.
