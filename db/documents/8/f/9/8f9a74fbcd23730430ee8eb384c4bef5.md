Determining the electrical axis on an electrocardiogram can help narrow the differential diagnosis and lead to an efficient diagnostic approach for the patient. This will help decrease the time needed to arrive at the right diagnosis and improve patient outcomes. An interprofessional team of clinicians, nurses, and technicians trained in interpreting an EKG is needed to achieve this goal. An emergency department nurse trained in potential implications of axis deviation can help the clinicians provide prompt and prudent diagnostic and therapeutic care for the patient. A cardiac specialty-trained nurse can assist the clinicians in monitoring patients with acute cardiac pathology to help treat potential complications. A nurse well-versed in interpreting an EKG, especially regarding the electrical axis determination and its significance, should communicate this finding with the clinicians. In doing so, a collaborative interprofessional team of healthcare providers can improve patient care and outcomes. [Level 5]
