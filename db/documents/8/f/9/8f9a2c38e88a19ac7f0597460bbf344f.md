The reported incidence of IAN and LN injuries varies within the literature and depends greatly upon the etiology of the injury. Local anesthetic injection-related nerve injuries are rare, and patients tend to recover nerve function spontaneously (85-94% of the time).

Mandibular third molar extraction is the leading surgical cause of IAN and LN injury, but rates fluctuate with operator experience and technique.

For LN injury, the majority recovered, but 0.5-0.6% had persistent dysfunction.

With respect to non-iatrogenic injuries, the incidence of IAN damage due to traumatic mandibular fracture is 46 to 81%. The rates increase, however, after open reduction and internal fixation (77 to 91%), with permanent dysfunction occurring in 0 to 45% of cases.
