Proteins C- and S-antigen and activity levels are usually performed by collecting a venous blood sample in citrate. These samples are centrifuged in the laboratory to separate the plasma. The plasma is frozen in aliquots and stored at -80^oC until analysis.

The typical volume of plasma required is 0.5 mL per 2.7 mL. The plasma needs to be frozen within four hours of collection.

The patient should discontinue warfarin for at least two weeks before drawing the sample.

It is crucial to perform protein C and S testing several weeks after an acute thrombosis or inflammatory condition to allow serum levels to return to baseline.
