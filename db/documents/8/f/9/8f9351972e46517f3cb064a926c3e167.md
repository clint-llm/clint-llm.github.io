Athletes who experience potential cardiac symptoms, especially episodes of syncope, may be at risk of sudden cardiac death. However, the differential diagnosis for syncope in athletes should always include vasovagal events, heatstroke, dehydration, and blunt trauma. An optimal sports participation evaluation will reassure the athlete that they are not at risk of sudden cardiac death or any predictable severe injury while participating.

**Cardiac Conditions Associated With Sudden Death In Athletes**

- Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy - this is the most common cause of sudden death in young athletes, according to some authors

- Coronary Artery Anomaly - the second most common cause of sudden death in young athletes

- Coronary Artery Disease - is the most common overall cause of death in athletes due to its relatively high prevalence among older athletes

- Arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia - The most common cause of sudden death cited by some authors

- Left Ventricular Hypertrophy - can also occur due to anabolic and peptide steroid use

- Anabolic Steroid Induced Cardiac Disease

- Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia

- Dilated Cardiomyopathy

- Left Ventricular Noncompaction

- Congenital Long QT Syndrome

- Short QT Syndrome

- Brugada Syndrome

- Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome

- Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia

- Early Repolarization Syndrome

- Myocarditis

- Commotio Cordis

Beyond assessing the risk of sudden death, the risk of general harm to the athlete should be considered in the context of their medical history and sport of choice.

- Concussion history - Given the risk of neurological harm and chronic traumatic encephalopathy in contact sports

- Rheumatologic disease - Given the forced stress induced upon an already damaged soft tissue

- Orthopedic injuries - Ensuring optimal recovery of prior injuries before returning to competitive sports

- Hematologic disorders - May lead to internal organ bleeding or significant blood loss in the event of a laceration

**PEDs and Associated Health Risks**

- Anabolic steroids induce a broad range of symptoms and illnesses, which may increase the long-term risk of early mortality

- Peptide hormones may lead to cardiac structural changes that are tied to cardiac arrest and increase the risk of cancers

- Stimulants can lead to long-term cardiovascular damage and increase the risk of both benign and dangerous arrhythmias
