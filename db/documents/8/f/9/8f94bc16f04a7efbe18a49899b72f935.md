Tonometry is a standard procedure employed by ophthalmologists to measure intraocular pressure (IOP) using a calibrated instrument. Devices used to measure IOP are based on the assumption that the eye is a closed globe with uniform pressure distributed throughout the anterior chamber and vitreous cavity. The normal range of intraocular pressure is 10 to 21 millimeters of mercury (mmHg), which is based on the average levels of IOP in normal individuals.

Treatment strategies, be it local IOP-lowering drops, laser, or surgery,

Numerous methods have been proposed since the development of the first tonometer in 1863 by von Graefe.
