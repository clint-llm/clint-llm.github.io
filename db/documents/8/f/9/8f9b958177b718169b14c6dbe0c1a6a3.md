History and examination are often enough to differentiate between neuroma and other conditions, also to distinguish between the types of a neuroma. Where there is doubt, an X-ray can help to differentiate from fracture and establishing a possible connection to bone. Ultrasound, CT, or MRI scans can help distinguish from malignant conditions, although seldom used.

Post excision histopathology examinations are usually undertaken for similar reasons and provide a higher level of ability to identify the nature of the lesion.
