**Stereotactic Radiosurgery**

Stereotactic radiation can be delivered by using a linear accelerator, gamma knife unit, and the use of charged particles.

Treatment planning software uses digital imaging and communication in medicine, and the use of automatic radiation dose balancing algorithms are recent advances introduced with the advent of the gamma knife. The composite dose can be calculated by using a DICOM image and dose file, while the weighing of radiation doses at multiple targets is performed by the automatic dose balancing algorithm blocking of sectors to protect critical structures by the use of dynamic shaping has also been introduced. Prescribed radiation dose and isodose are determined by multiple factors, including target type, target size, and prior radiotherapy or SRS.
