Poland syndrome is attributed to subclavian hypoplasia leading to malformations of the limb during development. It is characterized by unilateral chest wall hypoplasia, symbrachydactyly, and shortening of the central fingers. When a unilateral atypical type cleft hand presents, clinicians should be aware of its association with Poland syndrome and evaluate for deficiency of the pectoralis musculature. In this scenario, patients who require syndactyly release should undergo surgery one digit at a time to avoid any vascular complications, as the underlying deficiency is due to vascular insufficiency during development.
