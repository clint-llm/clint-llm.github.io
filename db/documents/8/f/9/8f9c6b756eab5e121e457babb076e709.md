The first step should be to determine whether the etiology is peripheral or central. It is essential to accurately diagnose the cause of hyperesthesia to provide treatment for any treatable underlying cause.

**Laboratory Tests**

- Routine: Should be considered as part of a standard workup of peripheral hyperesthesia

- 
              
- Complete blood count
              
              
- Comprehensive metabolic panel
              
              
- Fasting blood glucose
              
              
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
              
              
- Thyroids stimulating hormone
              
              
- Vitamine B12

- If indicated, based on clinical suspicion:

- 
              
- Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
              
              
- HIV antibodies
              
              
- Liver panel
              
              
- Lyme antibodies
              
              
- Rapid plasma reagin (RPR), venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL)
              
              
- Urinalysis
              
              
- Urine protein electrophoresis
              
              
- Serum protein electrophoresis
              
              
- Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels
              
              
- Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test
              
              
- Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P-ANCA) test
              
              
- Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) test

- Tests for rare conditions

- 
              
- Paraneoplastic panel
              
              
- Antimyelin associated glycoprotein
              
              
- Antiganglioside antibodies
              
              
- Salivary flow rate
              
              
- Cerebrospinal fluid analysis
              
              
- Genetic testing

**Imaging:**imaging is typically not needed to diagnose hyperesthesia, but it helps diagnose specific conditions.

- Computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging (nerve root compression, herniated disc, myelopathy, tumor in the brain or spinal cord)

- Triple-phase bone scan (can be used to support a diagnosis of CRPS)

**Special Tests:**

- Electrodiagnostics: electromyography and nerve conduction studies (only tests large fibers)

- Punch skin biopsy (identifies small-fiber neuropathy)
