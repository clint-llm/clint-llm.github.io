Doxepin is a unique antidepressant because it produces different adverse effects based on the receptor it antagonizes. Doxepin antagonizes three different receptors, which include: histamine, adrenergic, and muscarinic.

Doxepin blocks histamine H1 receptor and causes sedation and somnolence; therefore, FDA has approved low-dose doxepin, 3 mg, and 6 mg dosages to be used as a first-line agent in depressed patients with sleep disturbances and depression associated with anxiety. Proper education is necessary to prevent patients from self-medicating and overdosing on such pills.

Doxepin also has the potential to cause a significant increase in weight and was assessed in a study of 329 patients treated with doxepin and amitriptyline.

Doxepin blocks alpha-adrenergic receptors and should be carefully monitored in those with cardiovascular disorders because it can cause orthostatic hypotension.

Lastly, doxepin blocks muscarinic receptors and produces anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, dizziness, lightheadedness, tachycardia, and prolonged QT interval.

Patients prescribed an antidepressant, such as doxepin, require careful observation due to the black box warning that states a possible increase in suicidality.

There are significant drug interactions with doxepin which requires dose adjustment, frequency modification, or avoidance for a certain time. Allow 14 days between treatment with doxepin and MAO Inhibitors (selegiline, phenelzine, etc.).
