Risk factors for breaks or tear in the neurosensory retina that can lead to a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment:

- Lattice degeneration

- Peripheral retinal excavations

- Meridional folds

- Enclosed ora bays

- Pathologic myopia

- Previous intraocular surgery

- Trauma

- Previous retinal detachment in the other eye

- Family history

Risk factors for the formation of proliferative membranes that cause tractional retinal detachments:

- Proliferative diabetic retinopathy

- Proliferative vitreoretinopathy

- Sickling hemoglobinopathies

- Trauma

- Retinal vein occlusion

- Retinopathy of prematurity

Risk factors or causes for fluid entering the subretinal space and thus causing an exudative or serous retinal detachment:

- Primary ocular tumors

- Ocular metastases

- Sarcoidosis

- Syphilis

- Toxoplasmosis

- Sympathetic ophthalmia

- Central serous chorioretinopathy

- Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy

- Tuberculosis

- Corticosteroid therapy

- Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome

- Pre-eclampsia, eclampsia

- Organ transplantation

- Optic nerve pit

- Acute retinal necrosis

- Coats disease
