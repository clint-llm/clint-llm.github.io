In general, the etiology of autoimmune diseases is not completely understood. However, most autoimmune diseases are known to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

Autoimmune diseases are characterized by the presence of spontaneous and exaggerated activity of the immune system, which may result in the formation of autoantibodies or by activation of antigen-specific T-cells, which can target autoantigens within different organs.

Autoimmune connective tissue diseases occur when the immune system targets connective tissues. It can also be triggered following exposure to certain environmental factors. Examples of environmental factors include exposure to harmful chemicals, like those found in cigarette smoke, pollutants in the air, and ultraviolet light.

These diseases can have different presentations and may develop rapidly or slowly, and may start with very few abnormalities before exhibiting definitive disease features.

Researchers have tried to investigate the underlying cause of this condition and what can trigger these disease flares. T-regulatory cell populations were thought to be the culprit in starting such a disease. When these cells decrease in their numbers, disease manifestations start to appear, giving a clue about the vital role of these cells in preventing autoimmune diseases. In addition, a further decrease in the number of the T- regulatory cells may, unfortunately, worsen the disease condition and result in the differentiation of undifferentiated connective tissue disease into a differentiated connective tissue disease which carries a worse prognosis.
