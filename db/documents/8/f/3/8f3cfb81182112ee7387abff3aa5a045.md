Selenium is a trace mineral that exists in minimal concentrations in the body but can play an essential role in human health. Food sources high in selenium include Brazil nuts, seeds, mushrooms, fish, seafood, beef, and poultry.

Selenium provides several functions in the human body. It plays a role in enzymatic functions to catalyze thyroid hormone production.

Selenium plays an essential role in treating dermatologic conditions. Selenium sulfide administration is typically done via a topical lotion, foam, or shampoo. The main dermatologic indications include tinea versicolor, seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, dandruff, and hyperkeratosis.

In excessive doses, selenium is toxic, but it is an essential micronutrient in humans. Selenium supplementation is indicated to replete stores in cases of selenium deficiency. However, this is usually secondary to the localized diet versus an individual problem with the patient. Therefore, a common way to reduce selenium deficiency is via biofortification at the agricultural level.

Selenium deficiency is rarely associated with Keshan disease, a cardiomyopathy that ranges from heart failure, cardiomegaly, and electrocardiogram abnormalities to cardiogenic shock and demise. The most common demographic includes children and women of child-bearing age in endemic areas of China.

Selenium deficiency occurs more commonly in patients with malabsorption syndrome, mainly caused by stomach and small intestine surgical resections.

Supplementation for systemic deficiency is FDA-approved as a source of selenium when oral or enteral nutrition is insufficient or not possible.

Selenium is FDA indicated in topical form as selenium sulfate for seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, tinea versicolor, and is used off-label as an adjunct therapy in tinea capitis.
