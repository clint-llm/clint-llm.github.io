Most published literature suggests that the etiology of fungal sinusitis is not well understood. However, there have been increasing cases of fungal sinusitis reported in recent years, possibly due to our increasing use of immune-suppressants and antibiotics, or simply the growing number of chronic diseases that suppress the immune system.

The two main categories of fungi that are responsible for causing diseases in humans are molds and yeasts, although fungal sinusitis is attributed to molds more than it is to yeasts.

The most frequent cause of allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS) and invasive fungal sinusitis (IFS) is Aspergillus.Mucor and Rhizopus, also known as mucormycosis.

Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis is the most common form of fungal sinusitis.
