Tumors in the spine comprise about 15% of all tumors in the central nervous system. They usually are benign and cause symptoms primarily through compression of the spinal cord and nerves. Spinal tumors can be classified into three groups, based on their locations: extradural, intradural-extramedullary, and intramedullary. Extradural tumors are most common, as they occupy the vertebrae body or structures outside the dura. They are most commonly metastatic. Intradural extramedullary tumors are the second most common and come from the leptomeninges or nerve roots. These tumors are located inside the dura but external from the spinal cord, exemplified by meningiomas or neurofibromas. The least common (2 to 5%) are intramedullary spinal cord tumors (IMSCT); these arise from the spinal cord proper, leading to invasion and destruction of the gray and white matter. Ependymomas and astrocytomas are the most commonly encountered intramedullary spinal cord tumors, followed by hemangioblastomas. Other entities include lipomas, germ cell tumors, gangliogliomas, germinomas, lymphomas, and metastases.
