**Risk Factors and Etiology of Heart Failure**

There are many causes of heart failure and the most common of which is coronary artery disease in the United States. The importance of identifying the risk factors for heart failure is that heart failure is preventable.  In recognition of the preventable nature of the condition, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association have modified their classification schemes so that patients currently without any structural abnormalities are identified early and treated appropriately. Treatment of systolic and diastolic hypertension concurrently in alignment with contemporary guidelines reduces the risk of heart failure by approximately 50%.

**Risk Factors for Heart Failure**

- Coronary artery disease (CAD)

- Connective tissue disorders (i.e., rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus)

- Endocrine disorders (i.e., diabetes mellitus, thyroid function disorders, growth hormone deficiency)

- Hypertension

- High-output conditions (i.e.: anemia, Paget disease)

- Valvular heart disease

- Metabolic causes (i.e., obesity)

- Myocarditis (i.e., secondary to HIV/AIDS, medications, or viruses)

- Infiltrative disorders (i.e., amyloidosis, sarcoidosis)

- Peripartum cardiomyopathy

- Stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo)

- Valvular heart disease

- Medications (i.e., amphetamines, anabolic steroids)

- Tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy

- Toxins (i.e., cocaine, alcohol)

- Nutritional deficiency (i.e., L-carnitine deficiency, thiamine)

**Risk Factors and Etiology Acute Heart Failure (ADHF) / Flash Pulmonary Edema**

Acute heart failure is the worsening of heart failure symptoms to the point that the patient requires intensification of therapy and intravenous treatment. Acute heart failure can be dramatic and rapid in onset, such as flash pulmonary edema or more gradual with the worsening of symptoms over time until a critical point of decompensation is reached. For those with a history of pre-existing heart failure, there is often a clear trigger for decompensation.

**Potential Triggers of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure / Flash Pulmonary Edema**

- Arrhythmia

- Acute coronary syndrome (CAD)

- Infection

- Worsening hypertension (i.e., hypertensive crisis)

- Medication non-adherence

- Acute renal artery stenosis

- Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction

- Obstructive sleep apnea

- Stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy
