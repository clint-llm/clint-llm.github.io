The patient should be lying supine on a stretcher with the head of the bed approximately 30 degrees upright. For males, the chest should be completely exposed. For females, the hospital gown can be gathered at the level of the breast and towels tucked around the gown edges to keep it dry from the ultrasound gel. Alternatively, a towel can be draped over this area if the patient is not wearing a gown. For dominant right-hand operators, the ultrasound machine should be positioned at the patientâ€™s anatomic right, plugged in (if applicable), and turned on. The lights should be dimmed if possible.
