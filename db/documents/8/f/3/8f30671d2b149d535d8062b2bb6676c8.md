The prognosis for cow's milk protein allergy in infancy and young childhood is good. Approximately 50% of affected children develop tolerance by the age of 1 year, more than 75% by the age of 3 years, and over 90% are tolerant at 6 years of age.

Children who display an allergy to milk are more likely to develop other allergies to foods. Associated adverse reactions to different foods develop in up to 50% of children, and allergies against inhalants occur in 50% to 80% before puberty.
