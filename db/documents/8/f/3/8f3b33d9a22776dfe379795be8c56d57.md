Acute uterine bleeding is a complication that can be emotionally devastating to the patient as well as life-threatening. Because of the diverse number of causes, it is important that the disorder is managed by an interprofessional team. It is crucial for emergency physicians to involve gynecologists in the management of this disease quickly. Nurses in the emergency department should ensure that the patient has adequate access, is NPO and has the blood work submitted. Resuscitative equipment must be in the room. The patient should be educated about the procedures and protocols for dealing with AUB. The radiologist should be informed about the patient in case a pelvic ultrasound is needed. In addition, the operating room has to be notified in case an emergency hysterectomy is necessary. For stable patients, the pharmacist should discuss the hormonal and non-hormonal treatments available to treat menorrhagia.

The collaborative efforts will ensure a quick resolution to the unstable patient as well as appropriateÂ treatment options for the stable ones. The team approach will not only ensure swift, appropriate care and cessation of the bleeding but will ensure long-term follow-up for prevention of future bleeding episodes. With the team approach to patient care, it allows for a direct transition to the outpatient clinic where discussion and implementation of long-term medical or surgical treatment options can take place.
