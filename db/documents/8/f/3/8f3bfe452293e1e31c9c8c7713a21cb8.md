Primary chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) is diagnosed by taking a thorough history and response to indomethacin. There is not a single imaging or laboratory test that is diagnostic of CPH, rather laboratory and imaging can be used to rule out alternative diagnoses. Cranial imaging is normal in primary chronic paroxysmal hemicrania.Â Imaging with magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography can rule out a structural cause of secondary chronic paroxysmal hemicrania. Serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are elevated in giant cell arteritis and are typically normal in CPH. Secondary paroxysmal hemicrania can occur due to vascular malformation, stroke, tumor, trauma, elevated intracranial pressure, or collagen vascular disease.
