Initial treatment of symptomatic Takayasu arteritis begins with corticosteroids. Immunosuppressive medications have also been used in place, or in combination with corticosteroids. However, studies have not conferred an overall advantage of these medications.

The benefits of revascularization for these conditions are well recognized, but the uncertainty of this disease process had tempered enthusiasm for primary surgical approaches. Thus, traditionally, surgical therapy had been reserved for symptomatic manifestations of arterial occlusive disease refractory to corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive therapy. However, this experience seems to be changing recently as the efficacy and ability of medical management to arrest disease has been called into question. A recent nationwide study revealed that 50% of patients with Takayasu arteritis will relapse and experience a vascular complication less than 10 years from diagnosis. Those most likely to relapse include males and those with elevated C-reactive protein.

Surgical revascularization is now rapidly evolving into a primary treatment choice. Transluminal angioplasty has been studied in the past. However, its overall role is limited in the treatment of patients with Takayasu arteritis. The fibrous nature of the arterial obliteration mitigates any durable long-term benefit

Arterial reconstruction is the other surgical option in patients with Takayasu arteritis. The type of reconstruction depends on where known lesions lie, as well as the patient’s surgical anatomy. In general, Dacron or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) would be used for major aortic reconstructions, while autogenous saphenous vein would be used for extremity or isolated renal or mesenteric revascularization. Caution should be used when using autogenous saphenous vein secondary to its known propensity for aneurysmal degeneration. It is important that both proximal and distal anastomotic sites are free of any inflammatory involvement. Anastomosis onto involved arterial segments is a setup for early graft failure. In a study of 40 patients with TA at the University of Southern California, renovascular procedures were most common

Surgical therapy is usually well tolerated due to the young age of most patients with Takayasu arteritis. Most have dramatic improvements in their symptoms following surgery, whether it be decreases, or even curing, of hypertension following renovascular reconstruction, or resolving of upper limb ischemia following upper extremity bypass for example. These findings suggest that surgical correction of symptomatic Takayasu arteritis will continue to rise.
