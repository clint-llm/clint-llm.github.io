Muscle fatigue and impaired coordination are common factors contributing to gastrocnemius muscle strain. Some research has revealed that impaired vascular supply to the gastrocnemius muscle might result in weakness of the musculotendinous unit. Failure of muscle relaxation also plays a role in causing muscle strain. Due to the inability to fully relax, muscle fibers are more vulnerable to stretching injury.
