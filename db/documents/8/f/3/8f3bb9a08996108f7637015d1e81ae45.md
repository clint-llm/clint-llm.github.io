Among patients with laryngeal dystonia, botulinum toxin injections decrease the mean Voice Handicap Index (VHI) score by 9.6%.

Patients with vocal process granuloma treated with botulinum toxin to the thyroarytenoid have had success rates between 77% to 100%; however, there is a high prevalence of breathiness after injection. Interarytenoid (IA) injections alone have shown promising results, with comparable efficacy to thyroarytenoid injections and a lower prevalence of breathiness. Fink et al. reported complete regression in 55 percent of patients. Hamden et al. report that only 50% of their 8 patients reported breathiness after IA injection.

In treating cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction, botulinum toxin to the CP muscle is both diagnostic and therapeutic. In a study by Schneider et al., 5 of 7 patients with mild to severe dysphagia were effectively treated with botulinum toxin, with a clinically significant reduction in dysphagia.
