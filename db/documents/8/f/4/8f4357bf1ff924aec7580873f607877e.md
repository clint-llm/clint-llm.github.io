Glycogen storage disease type II (GSD2, Pompe Disease) is a recessive metabolic disorder, creating glycogen deposits inside lysosomes within the muscular tissue

This disease is either classified as early (infantile, classic) or late-onset (non-classic). Early-onset has a severe presentation and is likely to feature a fatal outcome, should prompt treatment not be available. A common cause of lethality for both onsets is respiratory insufficiency, which manifests at different ages in late-onset. Another important cause of lethality in infantile-onset is left ventricular outflow obstruction.

Preventive treatment consists of enzyme replacement therapy (alglucosidase alfa)
