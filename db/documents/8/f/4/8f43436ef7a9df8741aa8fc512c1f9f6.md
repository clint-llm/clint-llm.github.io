Due to the risk of anaphylaxis, patients require close observation for an appropriate period after omalizumab administration. Registered nurses or physicians administering omalizumab should be prepared and trained to manage episodes of omalizumab-induced anaphylaxis. Clinics administering omalizumab should have resuscitation equipment available.

Total serum IgE levels are elevated while a patient is on treatment with omalizumab and it remains elevated for up to one year after discontinuation. Therefore, re-testing IgE levels during treatment canâ€™t be used to guide dose determination. However, if the interruptions lasted less than one year, the dose is based on serum IgE levels obtained at the initial dose determination.
