Patient education, including the parents, can help with the management of the primary congenital Brown syndrome. Explanation of the etiology and need for surgical intervention, only when there is no improvement or symptoms, can help reassure patients. If patients are unconcerned by their compensatory head position and do not have diplopia, then conservative management is adequate. Treating the underlying cause of the acquired Brown syndrome, e.g., inflammatory causes, can lead to symptom relief. If surgery is indicated, detailed discussion with the patient regarding risks and benefits, including possible worsening of symptoms, is necessary before proceeding. Patients can also be provided with relevant educational material and directed to support groups, which can be beneficial to their wellbeing and outcome.
