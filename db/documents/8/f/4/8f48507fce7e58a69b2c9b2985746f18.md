Eplerenone is only administered orally without regard to food. It achieves peak plasma concentrations 1.5 hours after oral administration with a bioavailability of approximately 70%. Though some sources state that 25 mg of spironolactone is equivalent to 50 mg of eplerenone, there are no head-to-head clinical trials of these agents.

For patients with heart failure, the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure (HF) recommends a starting dose of 25 mg once daily and titrate to a goal dose of 50 mg once daily after four weeks of treatment, potassium less than or equal to 5 mEq/L and adequate renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR greater than or equal to 50 mL/minute/1.73 m^2).

Due to its shorter half-life of 3 to 6 hours, the 2017 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults, as well as the 2016 Endocrine Society guideline on primary aldosteronism, admonish that twice-daily dosing may be necessary for optimal effect.

Renal dose adjustments are necessary with the use of eplerenone as described below:

For hypertension (manufacturer's labeling)

- Contraindicated in creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 50 mL/minute or serum creatinine greater than 2mg/dL (males) or over 1.8 mg/dL (females)

- HF, post-MI (manufacturer's labeling)

- Use with caution in CrCl 31 to 50 mL/minute or serum creatinine exceeding 2mg/dL (males) or 1.8 mg/dL (females)

- Contraindicated in CrCl less than or equal to 30 mL/minute

According to the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure recommendation for HF (including post-MI)

- eGFR 30 to 49 mL/min/1.73m2 initiate a starting dose of 25 mg once every other day and titrate to a goal dose of 25 mg once daily after four weeks of treatment and potassium less than or equal to 5 mEq/L

- Contraindicated in eGFR below 30 mL/min
