Kleine–Levin syndrome consists of hypersomnia, behavioral or cognitive disturbances, hyperphagia, and hypersexuality. It primarily affects adolescent males. It is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion. No specific etiology has been identified for the disease. However, possible etiologies include a psychologic disturbance, trauma, toxins, infection, serotonergic or dopaminergic neurotransmitter abnormalities, and autoimmunity. Functional neuroimaging, polysomnography, and EEG can help further workup and aid in understanding the neuropathology behind the disease. There is no definitive treatment for Kleine–Levin syndrome, but several psychotropic agents, such as lithium, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, stimulants such as modafinil, have been utilized.
