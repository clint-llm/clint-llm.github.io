The condition is believed to be due to inflammation of the labia in a low-estrogen environment. It is thought to occur in a hypoestrogenic state due to it being very uncommon in the newborn period when there is maternal estrogen influence as well as during the reproductive period when there are adequate estrogen levels. The inflammation can be due to infection as well as to poor hygiene, including stool contamination.

Some studies are against the idea that labial fusion is due to a hypoestrogenic state. A study in 2007 published in "Pediatric Dermatology" that measured the serum estradiol levels of 59 prepubertal females with labial adhesion and 60 prepubertal females showed no statistically significant difference in their estrogen levels.
