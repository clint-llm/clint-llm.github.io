Preoperatively, it is imperative to note if the patient is on anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy. If the patient is on anticoagulants or antiplatelet therapy, it may be necessary to communicate with the patient’s primary care physician (PCP) or cardiologist to ensure patient safety. In accordance with the PCP’s or cardiologist’s recommendations, agents such as warfarin, heparin, and factor 10a inhibitors should be held. A prothrombin time (PT) should be obtained preoperatively in patients on warfarin. A partial thromboplastin time (PTT) should be obtained preoperatively for heparin use.

On the day of the procedure, blood pressure and heart rate should be checked pre-and post-procedure. The patient should be placed in the supine position with the cervical spine extended. The nare(s) should be inspected for potential causes of obstruction such as a deviated septum or neoplasm.
