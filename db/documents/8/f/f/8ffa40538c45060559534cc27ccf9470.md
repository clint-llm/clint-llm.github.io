A 24-hour urinalysis is a timed urine collection used in the metabolic evaluation of several types of kidney disorders. The urine collection is most often done by the nurse for in-patients. The nurse should be familiar with the urine collection and the need to keep it free of contaminants. When the testing is done in an outpatient setting, the patient needs to be educated on how to collect the urine. Accurate collections can detect treatable abnormalities predisposing to nephrolithiasis, glomerulonephritis or the nephrotic syndrome and help monitor treatment progress.
