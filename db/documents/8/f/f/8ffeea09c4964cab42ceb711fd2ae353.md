In 2009, Menko et al. published diagnostic criteria for BHDS. One major or two minor criteria are needed for diagnosis (Table 1). Major criteria include (1) at least five fibrofolliculomas or trichodiscomas and at least one histologically confirmed and of adult-onset, and/or (2) pathogenic FLCN germline mutation. Negative FLCN gene testing does not exclude the diagnosis as up to 40% of patients with negative testing still meet diagnostic criteria. Minor criteria include (1) multiple lung cysts, which are bilateral and basally located, (2) renal cancer before the age ofÂ 50 years, or multifocal or bilateral renal cancer, or of mixed chromophobe and oncocytic histology, and (3) a first-degree relative with BHDS. Multifocal or bilateral renal cancer with hybrid chromophobe and oncocytic histology is a hallmark of BHDS. Furthermore, the mixed pattern of chromophobe cancer and oncocytoma is typical and unique to BHDS.

Chest x-ray and high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) scans are used to assess pulmonary cysts. Abdominal CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to assess the kidneys.
