The evaluation and treatment of microalbuminuria require the involvement of the patient. They should understand the importance of compliance with follow-up visits, screening guidelines, lifestyle modifications, and medication regimens. If a collection of 24 hours of urine is advised, the process should be clearly stated to the patient with clear written instructions.
