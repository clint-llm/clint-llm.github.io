Hirayama is a rare, nonfamiliar,Â monomelic amyotrophy originally described by Dr. Hirayama in 1959.

Although commonly considered a non-progressive and self-limiting disease, this has been noted to cause significant disability for some subsets of individuals. Early intervention has been shown to limit the progression of the disease and minimize the disability. Other names used to describe this entity include benign juvenile brachial spinal muscular atrophy, juvenile asymmetric segmental spinal muscular atrophy, juvenile muscular atrophy of the distal upper extremity, monomelic amyotrophy, and oblique amyotrophy.
