**Patient Screening for LTOT Requirement**

A pulse oximeter is widely available and can be usefulÂ for screening patients who might be indicated for LTOT.

**Follow-up of LTOT Patients**

- Follow-up should occur at three months after initiating LTOT, to ensure LTOT is still necessary.

- Patients receiving LTOT should have follow-up at 6 to 12 months after the first 3-month follow-up.
