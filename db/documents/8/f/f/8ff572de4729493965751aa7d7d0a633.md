**SAA in Pregnancy**

SAAs occur predominantly in multiparous women. The true prevalence of SAA in pregnancy is unknown. Fifty percent of SAAs that occur in pregnancy eventually rupture during pregnancy.

Two-thirds of SAA rupture in the third trimester and typically in the last two weeks of pregnancy. Multiple factors have been linked to increased SAA incidence particularly in pregnant women.

One hypothesis suggests that the increased blood flow and cardiac output in pregnancy may result in increased force against the vessel wall. Another hormonal hypothesis suggests that increased estrogen and progesterone presumably result in medial degeneration of the vessel wall.

Elevated levels of relaxin during pregnancy may enhance the elasticity of splenic artery leading to aneurysmal dilation. Additionally, increased frequency of SAAs rupturing in late pregnancy is presumably linked to an increased mechanical pressure of the enlarging gravid uterus.
