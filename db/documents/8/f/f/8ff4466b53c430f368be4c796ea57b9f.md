For a patient to be a candidate for anti-reflux surgery, preoperative testing should be done. These tests include:

- Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (mandatory): used for the assessment of esophagitis as well as the gastroesophageal junction flap.

- Ambulatory pH monitoring: considered ideal for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease. This test must be done to confirm the diagnosis unless a prior esophagogastroduodenoscopy has shown peptic strictures of Los Angeles class C or D esophagitis which is pathognomonic for gastroesophageal reflux disease.

- Barium esophagram: useful for preoperative evaluation of the gastroesophageal junction anatomy, including the presence of a hiatal hernia and the length of the intra-abdominal esophagus.

- Esophageal manometry: used to detect esophageal motility disorders and can influence the use of a partial or complete wrap. It also measures the lower esophageal sphincter resting pressure.

The indications for LARS are relative. It is generally considered for patients who have severe symptoms attributed to gastroesophageal reflux disease along with one of the following:

- Repeated aspiration pneumonia or asthma related to reflux

- Barrett esophagus (controversial)

- Failed maximal medical therapy

- Unable to take medications due to compliance or side effects

- Younger patients who do not want to take chronic medications in the interest of adverse effects and long-term cost

Anti-reflux surgery may be open or laparoscopic. There is clear evidence for the benefits of laparoscopic ARS regarding morbidity and hospital length of stay. Many different LARS techniques are available. They include Dor fundoplication, an anterior 180-degree wrap; Toupe fundoplication, a posterior 270-degree wrap; and Nissen fundoplication, a total posterior 360-degree wrap.

Choosing the surgical technique is up to clinician preference. A plethora of data is available comparing the partial to the total wrap. The literature reveals mixed results, but the consensus supports fewer postoperative complications and comparable symptom relief. However, there is a higher chance of recurrent symptoms when comparing partial fundoplication and total fundoplication. Less favorable outcomes have been more consistently shown for an anterior partial wrap and are considered a less durable form of repair. These differences seem to be less clinically significant in long-term data for complete and posterior partial wraps. There is no standard LARS and the most common ARS performed in the United States is the Nissen fundoplication.
