As mentioned above, octreotide scanning has a significant role in recognition of various neuroendocrine tumors, assessing their progress and recognition of metastasis, along with a greater scope of recognizing all malignancies with somatostatin receptor positivity and even autoimmune disorders also. Modern oncologic practices call for greater use of octreotide scanning.

It is quite useful in staging as well as recognition of many occult primary tumors also. It is also relatively safe as it avoids the side effects associated with the use of contrast as in CECT. Moreover, radiation exposure is also quite less. Newer studies are demonstrating the role of octreotide scans in different fields like immunology also. More studies are necessary for further utilization of this technique in various other sub-divisions.
