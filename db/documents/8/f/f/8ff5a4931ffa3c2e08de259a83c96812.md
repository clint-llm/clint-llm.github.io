No specific cause of pityriasis alba has been identified. It is not contagious, and no infectious etiology has been reported. It is most common in individuals with a history of atopy, although it may occur in nonatopic individualsÂ as well. In many cases, it is considered to be a minor manifestation of atopic dermatitis. It is thought to represent nonspecific dermatitis with residual post-inflammatory hypopigmentation. Histopathology shows decreased melanin production in the affected areas. Associated findings in some studies include atrophic sebaceous glands, iron-deficiency anemia, and low levels of serum copper. The significance of these findings and their relationship to pityriasis alba is uncertain.
