Approximately 0.5% to 3% of patients who are infected with N. gonorrhoeae develop disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI). There is a paucity of recent epidemiologic data that looks into the incidence of DGI in patients with arthritis, but historical data in the 1980s show that N. gonorrhoeaeÂ were associated with up to 14% of patients who have arthritis. Gonococcal arthritis is more commonly seen in young healthy individuals although it may occur in any age group.
