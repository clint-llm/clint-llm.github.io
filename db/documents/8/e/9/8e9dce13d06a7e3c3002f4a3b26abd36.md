Branch retinal vein occlusion typically has a good prognosis: 50% to 60% of eyes have a final visual acuity (VA) of 20/40 or better even without treatment. One important prognostic factor for final VA appears to be the initial VA. Also, the extent of macular or foveal involvement in acute BRVO is an important factor in determining the prognosis. Patients with retinal ischemia at least 5-disc diameters in size have 36% chances of developing neovascularization of the retina or optic disc. Patients with retinal ischemia at least 5-disc diameters in size have a 60% to 90% chance of developing vitreous hemorrhage if laser photocoagulation is not performed.
