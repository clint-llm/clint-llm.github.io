Patients may demonstrate hypersensitivity to amikacin, other aminoglycosides, or any component of the drug formulation.

Amikacin can pass through breast milk and the placenta. Hence it is not recommended in pregnant women as the drug may cause congenital deafness in the infant. Even though only small amounts pass into breast milk, experts do not recommend breastfeeding while on amikacin.

In general, amikacin is not used in infants. Further, since infants and small children tend toÂ have a large volume of distribution, the drug remains in the systemic circulation for prolonged periods.

Clinicians should not use amikacin in combination with other drugs that have the potential to cause renal and auditory toxicity. The list of medications that should be avoided includes amphotericin B, acyclovir, capreomycin, bacitracin, vancomycin, and cisplatin. Also, amikacin should not be used in patients receiving neuromuscular blockers because it can prolong muscle paralysis and weakness.
