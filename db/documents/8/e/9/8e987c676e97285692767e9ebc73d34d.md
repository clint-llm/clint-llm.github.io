Familial Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy occurs as an autosomal dominant Mendelian-Inherited disorder in approximately 50% of cases. A mutation in the sarcomere protein gene encoding for contractile elements of the heart has been found, with 6 different genes on at least 4 chromosomes being associated with HCM. More than 50 different mutations have been identified. The phenotypic expression may vary according to the mutation involved, with a variability of symptoms and degree of severity of the hypertrophy expressed. Recent data has associated abnormal myocardial calcium kinetics to the cause of inappropriate myocardial hypertrophy and specific features of HCM, especially in patients with diastolic functional abnormalities.
