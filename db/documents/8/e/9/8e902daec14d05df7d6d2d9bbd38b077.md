After a comprehensive history and physical examination, imaging is almost always necessary if a zygomatic arch or ZMC fracture is suspected. Historically, the Waters view plain film was used to evaluate ZMC fractures. A computed tomography (CT) scan is now the gold standard imaging modality. The 3-dimensional reconstruction is particularly useful for preoperative planning. There may also be a role for the intraoperative use of CT to assess the adequacy of fracture reduction, but there is no strong evidence to support the routine use of this practice.

**Classification of ZMC Fractures**

Various classification systems have been used to categorize ZMC fractures further. Below is a widely used system proposed by Zingg

- Type A: an incomplete zygomatic fracture that involves one pillar
- 
- 1: zygomatic arch fracture
- 2: lateral orbital wall fracture
- 3: infraorbital rim fracture

- Type B: all four pillars are fractured (a complete tetrapod fracture) with the zygoma remaining intact
- Type C: a multi-fragment zygomatic fracture, wherein all four pillars are fractured plus the body of the zygoma is fractured
