Dyspnea is the predominant symptom of ARDS, which progressively gets worse within hours and days requiring mechanical ventilation. The inciting condition can be identified by careful history and physical examination. Physical examination usually reveals tachypnea, low blood oxygen saturation, tachycardia, central or peripheral cyanosis. Lung exam may reveal bilateral rales, especially bibasilar, and in severe cases may demonstrate decreased air entry.

Focused cardiac exam such as listening for S3 and gallop rhythm, murmurs, jugular venous distension, hepatomegaly, bilateral ankle edema, ascites had to be done to rule out heart failure as it mimics ARDS closely. Neurological and perfusion status should be carefully evaluated to estimate the effects of hypoxia on organ perfusion. Altered mentation, confusion, cold extremities, and decreased urine output are important examination findings that suggest states of shock from hypoxia or the underlying etiology of refractory hypoxemia.
