Fibroids are composed of monoclonal smooth muscle and fibroblast cells that have transformed at the microscopic level to abnormal cells.

With the endocrinological influence of sex steroid hormones, these cells may grow into clinically detectable fibroids. Histological samples of fibroids demonstrate a significant extracellular matrix (ECM) composed of collagen, proteoglycan, and fibronectin adjacent to the disordered myometrium cells.
