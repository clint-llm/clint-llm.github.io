Milia (singular: milium) are benign and transient subepidermal keratin cysts that present as small firm white papules in various numbers most commonly distributed on the face, but they can also be present on other anatomical areas such as the upper trunk, extremities, and genital area (prepuce).

The classification of milia includes primary and secondary. The vast majority of primary milia accounts for congenital milia that occur spontaneously and are present at birth, mainly over the nose, scalp, eyelids, cheeks, gum border (Bohn nodules), and palate (Epstein pearls). Still, there is another percentage of primary milia that may occur in association with certain rare genodermatoses (inherited genetic skin disorders) in children and adults. Meanwhile, secondary milia manifest in association with underlying skin pathology, medications, or skin trauma.
