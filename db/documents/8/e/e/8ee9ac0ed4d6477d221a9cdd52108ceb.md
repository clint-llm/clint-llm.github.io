Although most cases of amebiasis are asymptomatic, many patients with E. histolytica present with a spectrum of illness. The incubation period from amebiasis is between 2 to 4 weeks.

Symptoms range from mild abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea to severe colitis producing bloody diarrhea with mucus. Young people tend to have a more severe disease compared to older individuals. Fulminant colitis can present with bloody diarrhea in some patients. Risk factors include the use of corticosteroids, poor nutrition, young age, and pregnancy. Toxic megacolon can be a complication and is associated with very high mortality.

A few patients may develop invasive extraintestinal disease. The most common extraintestinal manifestations are an amoebic liver abscess. A liver abscess develops in less than 4% of patients and may occur within 2 to 4 weeks after the initial infection. Liver abscess usually presents with right upper quadrant pain, fever, and tenderness to palpation.

An amoebic liver abscess may rupture into the pleural cavity or pericardium, presenting as pleural or pericardial effusion; however, this is a rare occurrence. Rarely, amebiasis may affect the heart, brain, kidneys, spleen, and skin. One can also develop proctocolitis, toxic megacolon, peritonitis, brain abscess, and pericarditis. Hence, amebiasis is a leading parasitic cause of death in humans.
