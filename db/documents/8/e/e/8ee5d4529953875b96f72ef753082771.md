Enhancing positive outcomes in patients with cystic fibrosis-associated liver disease requires an interprofessional team approach and closed-loop communication by primary care providers, hepatologists, pulmonologists, nutritionists, radiologists, and surgeons at times, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. Besides, the overall clinical management of this chronic liver disease by involved specialists, the prescribed medications should be vetted through a board-certified pharmacist who can collaborate on agent selection, verify dosing and oversee the medication regimen for drug interactions. Nursing staff who have a good understanding of this disease should administer medications, monitor treatment effectiveness, and alert the clinicians to any possible adverse effects from treatment. Such an integrated approach to the care of these patients can help to achieve the best possible outcomes.
