On December 22nd, 2021, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, allowing its use in the treatment of COVID-19.

According to Charlson's comorbidity index, underlying comorbidities associated with severe disease outcomes are chronic pulmonary disease(including asthma), diabetes mellitus, older age, male sex, obesity, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, dementia, liver disease, chronic kidney disease, solid tumor with metastasis, and immunosuppression.

As demonstrated by the EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for Covid-19 in High-Risk Patients) trial, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in these patients within five days of the onset of symptoms reduced the risk of COVID-19-related hospital admission or death by 89%.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report, less than 1% of patients treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir required hospitalization or emergency department care.  The patients who required hospitalization had advanced age(>60 years).
