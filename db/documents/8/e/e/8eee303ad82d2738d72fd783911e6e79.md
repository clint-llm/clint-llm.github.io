In general, a majority of C1 fractures are managed conservatively with some form of immobilization. But the patients should be aware of the need for regular follow-up as advised by the medical personnel and the possibility of needing surgical intervention if the conservative treatment fails. Smoking can prevent fracture healing and should be strictly avoided. Strict compliance with the collar is also recommended for fracture healing.
