Alfentanil toxicity symptoms are similar to that of other opioid-class medication toxicities and include rigidity of the skeletal muscles, cardiac depression, respiratory depression, and narrowing of the pupils.

If signs of toxicity develop, supportive measures should be deployed, including the reestablishment of a patent-protected airway (with ventilation if needed) and oxygen/vasopressors in the case of circulatory shock or pulmonary edema. Naloxone – an opioid receptor antagonist – is typically used for the reversal of alfentanil toxicity. Nalmefene is another antidote commonly used reversal agent in the case of opioid toxicity.
