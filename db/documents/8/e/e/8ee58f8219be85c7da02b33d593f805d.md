The development of the rectus sheath starts with the formation of the somatopleure on the ventral wall. Afterward, at the fifthÂ to sixth week of gestation, myotomes merge with the somatopleure and form the ventral and dorsal wall of the thoracoabdominal wall. These structures are then called the hypomerion and epimerion, respectively. The external abdominal oblique, internal abdominal oblique, and transversus abdominis muscles all arise from the same source, the lateral portion of the hypomerion, along with their aponeuroses. Henle's ligament is thus considered the lateral portion of aponeurosis, formed from the internal abdominal oblique and transverus abdominis, and is a derivative of the hypomerion.
