There are a variety of hyperbaric chamber treatment protocols for decompression sickness. These differences are based on such things as the severity of the insult and the availability of oxygen. There are also in water recompression protocols. The usual US treatment protocol is a US Navy Treatment Table 6 done with oxygen pressurized to 2.8 atmospheres absolute (ATA). In water, recompression is a relatively high risk but is a consideration if there would otherwise be significant delays to treatment, logistical difficulties, or other problems. It requires appropriate training, equipment, and pre-planning. Immediate treatment at the surface with oxygen is beneficial for improving outcomes and decreasing recompression treatments.

Treatment of DCS employing the US Navy Treatment Table 6 with oxygen at 18m is the standard of care. Significant delay to treatment, transportation difficulties, and facilities with limited experience may lead one to consider on-site treatment. Surface oxygen for first aid is shown to improve the efficacy of recompression and decreased the number of recompression treatments required when administered less than four hours post-dive. In-water recompression (IWR) to 9m, breathing oxygen is one option that has shown success over the years. IWR is not without risk and requires certain precautions. IWR would only be suitable for an organized and disciplined group of divers with suitable equipment and practical training in the procedure.
