Fluconazole is a member of the triazole family, one of the most widely used antifungal agents. It is an FDA-approved drug to treat vaginal candidiasis, oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis, urinary tract infections, peritonitis, and systemic Candida infections, including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, pneumonia, and cryptococcal meningitis. Prophylaxis is also known to decrease the incidence of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, dosing, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of fluconazole, so providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes in combating fungal infections.
