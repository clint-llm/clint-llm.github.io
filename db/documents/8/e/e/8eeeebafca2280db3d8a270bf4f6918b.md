In a patient who complains of halitosis, a thorough history is important. Clinicians should try and rule out physiological and transient causes of halitosis. A detailed history should include a complete dietary history and habits like smoking, tobacco, and medications. The clinician should obtain a history of past and present illnesses, including symptoms suggesting upper and lower respiratory infections and gastrointestinal causes like cold and cough, fever, weight loss, dyspepsia, or heartburn. A family history of chronic illnesses like hypertension and diabetes mellitus is to be elicited.
