A prime feature of rapid eye movement behavior disorder is the intermittent loss of atonia during REM sleep, which leads to dreaming-related motor behaviors. Muscle atonia during normal REM sleep is controlled within the pontine tegmentum and medial medulla. Excitatory glutamatergic neurons within the dorsal pre-coeruleus nucleus activate the spinal cord inhibitory interneurons, thereby initiating REM sleep atonia. Animal models and diagnostic imaging of case reports suggesting interruption or disinhibition of these brainstem areas is the pathophysiology of RBD.

The neurodegenerative alpha-synucleinopathies consist of glial cytoplasmic inclusions aggregates of insoluble alpha-synuclein protein.

RBD has also been described as associated with Wilson disease

The pathogenesis of RBD is distinct in cases of narcolepsy as it is linked to orexin deficiency.Â In contrast to idiopathic RBD, in cases of RBD-narcolepsy combination, alpha-synuclein biomarkers are usually not detected.
