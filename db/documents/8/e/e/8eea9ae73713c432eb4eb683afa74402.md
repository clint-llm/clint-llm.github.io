Radiation therapy of the pelvis is used to treat a variety of cancers, for example, ovarian, uterine, cervical, prostate, bladder, and rectal cancers. Radiation damage to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can occur, yet the treatment is beneficial in fighting cancer. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy combats this otherwise difficult-to-treat complication of radiation therapy. This activity describes the pathophysiology of radiation proctitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management with HBO.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of radiation proctitis.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with radiation proctitis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for radiation proctitis.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of radiation proctitis and improve outcomes.
