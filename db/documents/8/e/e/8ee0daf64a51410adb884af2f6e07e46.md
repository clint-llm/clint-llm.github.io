There are no clear evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of Lambl excrescences. The management is primarily based upon cases reported in the medical literature.

Various approaches, both pharmacological and surgical, have been described in the management of Lambl excrescences. Asymptomatic patients are best managed with close observation, and with serial follow-up echocardiograms. When associated with stroke, an exhaustive stroke workup to identify the potential cause of stroke should always be undertaken. This should include carotid duplex ultrasound, hypercoagulable workup, and a complete TEE assessing the ascending, transverse, and arch segments of the aorta. If the workup remains negative without any identifiable cause, then the patients can be treated with antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and clopidogrel/dipyridamole and/or anticoagulation with coumadin. In cases of recurrent strokes, when associated with Lambl excrescences, surgical excision may prove beneficial.

The choice between surgical debridement and conservative management depends on individual cases and their peri-operative risks. The efficacy and mortality benefit of any of these treatment measures have not been established yet.

Due to the lack of consensus, at this time it is difficult to exclude Lambl excrescences as a potential source of emboli in cryptogenic stroke. Medical providers should be aware of Lambl excrescences and at least keep them in the differential diagnosis of a patient with cryptogenic stroke unless evÂ­idence suggests otherwise. A TEE should always be a part of stroke workup in embolic stroke with unknown sources of emboli.
