Alpha-thalassemia is a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders of the blood characterized by the deficiency of alpha-globin chains of hemoglobin. The decreased synthesis of alpha globin chains causes anemia. Early diagnosis of this disease using various laboratory evaluation techniques can play a crucial role in improving the life expectancy and overall general health of the patients. This activity outlines the laboratory diagnosis of alpha-thalassemia and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the classification and pathophysiology of alpha-thalassemia.
- Summarize various laboratory tests used to establish the diagnosis of alpha-thalassemia.
- Outline the interpretation of results to know the difference between iron deficiency anemia and alpha- and beta-thalassemia.
- Explain the importance of regular laboratory monitoring in diagnosed cases of alpha-thalassemia to evaluate treatment outcomes and identify complications timely.
