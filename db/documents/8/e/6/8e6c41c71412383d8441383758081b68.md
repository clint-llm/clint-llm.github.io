Megakaryopoeisis begins with the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) in the bone marrow, which matures into a multipotent progenitor cell, a committed megakaryocyte progenitor cell, an immature megakaryocyte, and finally into a mature megakaryocyte, which gives rise to blood platelets.

The THPO receptor also called the MPL receptor, is found in the bone marrow, liver, spleen, and CD34+cells.

**CAMT**

The c-Mpl gene is located in the 1p34 locus and consists of 12 exons.

It is interesting to note that a homozygous mutation p.R119C of the THPO gene impairs the secretion and function of THPO, producing the same clinical picture of CAMT.

Thompson and Nguyen described a rare variant of CAMT associated with radioulnar synostosis due to mutation in HOXA11, which regulates megakaryocyte differentiation.

**AAMT**

AAMT can be caused by antibody or T-cell-mediated autoimmunity.

Anti-MPL antibodies have been seen with systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis.
