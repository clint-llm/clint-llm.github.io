The mode refers to the most frequently occurring number found in a group of numbers. The mode is determined by collecting data to count the frequency of each result. The result with the highest count of occurrences is known as the mode of the set, which is also commonly referred to as the modal value.Â  If multiple results all have the same high number of counts, then there can be multiple modes in the data set.
