While PE is the most likely cause of pulmonary infarction, there is a myriad of other diagnoses that must be considered. One must consider the variability in clinical presentations and similarities in radiographic results of disease states which mimic PI such as solitary lung nodules. Evidence of a pulmonary infarction on X-ray or CT imaging may be the first indicator the patient has a pulmonary embolism. If warranted, patients require education on tobacco cessation as this further increases the risk of PI.
