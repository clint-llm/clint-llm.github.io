After taking a blood sample, it undergoes analysis by two techniques

- Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF)

- Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

The indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) identifies ANCA by its staining patterns inside the cytoplasm of neutrophils

Testing takes place in two steps. First indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) is done, which detects the presence or absence of these autoantibodies, and if the test comes positive, then it is followed by ELISA.
