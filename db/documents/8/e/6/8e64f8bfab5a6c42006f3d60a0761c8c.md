The majority of presenting patients will be non-toxic and may only require oral rehydration for initial fluid resuscitation. In more severe cases, intravenous (IV) fluids may be needed.

Metronidazole is the first-line treatment for giardiasis.

Other possible regimens include tinidazole, nitazoxanide, mebendazole, albendazole, and paromomycin.Â Paromomycin is poorly systemically absorbed and may be considered if giardiasis needs to be treated in a pregnant patient in her first trimester.

Data appears to be conflicting about the most effective treatment. A systematic review found that albendazole may be as effective as metronidazole with fewer side effects.
