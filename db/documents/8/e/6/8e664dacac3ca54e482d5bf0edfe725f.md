Cardiac stress imaging is a noninvasive modality used in evaluating coronary artery disease, myocardium viability, and exercise capacity. This activity reviews cardiac stress imaging and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo workup for coronary artery disease and other cardiac functional abnormalities.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the screening indications for cardiac stress imaging.
- Describe the classic categorization of chest pain as typical, atypical, or non-cardiac, as it applies to pre-test probability risk stratification for cardiac stress imaging.
- Outline the management considerations for patients needing stress testing, particularly the pros and cons of choosing each stress imaging modality.
- Summarize the stress image findings associated with coronary artery disease and management options.
