Postoperative wound infection is a common healthcare problem. The process of wound infection is complex and involves an interplay between several biological pathways at the molecular levels. Wound infections account for high morbidity and mortality. Current data indicates that surgical site wound infections account for over two million nosocomial infections in patients who have been hospitalized in the United States.

Surgical wound infections are classified as follows by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):

- **Superficial incisional infection**that only involves the skin and subcutaneous tissues. One of the following criteria has to be met: purulent discharge from the wound, isolated organism, at least one symptom of infection, and diagnosis by the surgeon. These infections account for more than 50% of all surgical infections.

- **Deep incisional infections**involve deeper tissues, including muscles and fascial planes. One of the following criteria has to be met: purulent discharge from the wound, dehiscence, or deliberate re-opening of deep incision by the surgeon after suspecting an infection, evidence of abscess formation, or other deep infection diagnoses by the surgeon.

- **Organ/space infection**may involve any organ apart from the incision site but must be related to the surgical procedure. One of the following criteria has to be met: purulent discharge from the drain placed in the organ, isolated organism from the organ, abscess, or other infection involving the organ.

To be classified as a surgical site infection, the wound must:

- occur within 30 days after the surgery (in the case of organ/space infections with an implant in situ this is one year)

- only include the skin, subcutaneous tissues, deep layers or distant organs, and

- have either purulent drainage or organisms isolated from the wound site.

If the surgeon opens the wound for cleaning, it is considered a surgical wound infection. A wound is not considered to be infected if there is only a stitch abscess. The majority of surgical site wound infections are due to endogenous flora that is usually present on the mucous membranes, skin, or hollow viscera. In general, when the microbiological flora concentration is higher than 10,000 microorganisms per gram of tissue, there is a high risk for an infected wound.
