The preoperative management of anesthesia in children differs from that employed in adults, including employing age-group appropriate language, understanding the dynamics of the child's family, and assessing the patient's developmental stage. Children are not small adults. Hence, we must have an understanding of the variability of each child's age and family-specific needs in an effort to develop a customized anesthesia management plan. The anesthesiologist must appreciate the stress the patients and their families may be experiencing. The anesthesiologist must review the child's presenting medical and psychological conditions. In this chapter, the clinical significance and potential strategies for enhancing pediatric healthcare outcomes willÂ be discussed.
