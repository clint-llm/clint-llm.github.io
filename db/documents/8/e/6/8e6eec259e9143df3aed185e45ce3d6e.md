Given the rarity of the condition, patient education in Kikuchi disease is of paramount importance. Reassurance that this is a self-limiting condition can be comforting to patients and family members, especially as initial evaluation includes differentials such as malignancy and serious infection. However, the possible complications and correlation to autoimmune disease should be made clear. Management including symptomatic control with analgesics and antipyretics should be explained to patients and caregivers, and the lack of indication for antibiotics should be emphasized. The importance of follow up for symptom monitoring and resolution is key, and patients should be educated on the importance of following up with their primary care provider and rheumatologist for long-term monitoring.
