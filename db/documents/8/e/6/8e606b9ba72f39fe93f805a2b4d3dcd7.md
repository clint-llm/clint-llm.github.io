Utilization of the Holter monitor has significantly increased, especially in the detection of occult atrial fibrillation as a cause of a cryptogenic stroke. Anticoagulation is always superior to antiplatelet in the secondary prevention of stroke due to atrial fibrillation. So, the diagnosis of occult atrial fibrillation to initiate anticoagulation with the help of the Holter monitor can prevent recurrent strokes.

Patients with LV systolic dysfunction and presumed arrhythmic event as well as those with symptoms supposed to be due to transient second or third-degree heart blocks also form a significant number of people who undergo the test.
