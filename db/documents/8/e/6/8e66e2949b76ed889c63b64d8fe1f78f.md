Many of these randomized clinical trials involving medicinal cannabis consisted of small sample sizes, ultimately leading to low power. Additional trials are understandably needed to further validate the extent of pain benefit. However, the paucity of data may partially be due to cannabis being a Schedule I controlled substance. Controversy remains in the legalization of cannabis in the medical community to date for this reason. Furthermore, ethical, societal, and cultural reasons are implicated with cannabis. As well, it is important to be cognizant of state regulations; the majority of states have approved the recommendation or authorization of medicinal cannabis. However, several states have yet to approve the use of medicinal cannabis.

Not all states have approved both THC and CBD. Some states have only approved CBD in the form of CBD oil.
