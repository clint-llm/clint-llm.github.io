Pertussis, literally meaning "a violent cough," also known as whooping cough or "the cough of 100 days," was first described in the Paris epidemic of 1578. Bordetella pertussis, the causative organism, was discovered in 1906, and a vaccine was developed in the 1940s. Before the pertussis vaccine was developed, pertussis was a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality. This activity describes the presentation and management of pertussis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the treatment of affected patients and families.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pertussis.
- Describe the typical presentation of a patient with pertussis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for pertussis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the care of patients with pertussis and improve patient outcomes.
