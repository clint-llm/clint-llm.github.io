The left renal vein transverses between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta on its course toward the inferior vena cava. The superior mesenteric artery and the aorta typically form a 90-degree angle. However, specific anatomical variants of these arteries can reduce this angle.Â Constriction of the left renal vein between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta leads to compression ischemia in a condition known as Nutcracker syndrome. The normal pressure gradient is 1 mmHg between the renal vein and the inferior vena cava. In Nutcracker syndrome, the pressure gradient can reach as high as 3 mmHg.

The blood supply from the left adrenal vein, left inferior phrenic vein, and left gonadal vein join the left renal vein at various sites along its trajectory before dumping into the inferior vena cava. These contributions may become clinically relevant when obstructed. Varicoceles in males can occur on the left side of the body owing to differences in venous drainage from the left and right gonadal veins. Because the left gonadal vein drains into the relatively high pressure left renal vein at an acute angle, impairment in blood flow due to impingement of the renal vein distally results in venous valve failure, leading to reflux of blood back into the gonadal vein. Venous engorgement transmits blood backward into the scrotum and causes varicocele. A classic example includes the extension of renal cell carcinoma into the renal vein, obstructing venous drainage from the left gonadal vein and causing a left-sided varicocele.
