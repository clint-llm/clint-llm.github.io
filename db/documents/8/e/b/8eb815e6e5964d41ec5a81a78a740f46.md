Following are some different treatment modalities for differing anatomical sites

**Pulmonary Hamartoma**

- Wedge resection is the treatment of choice for patients with pulmonary hamartoma.

- Aggressive lobectomy or total pneumectomy is also an option in some cases.

- An intraoperative frozen section is mandatory to rule out malignancy.

**Hypothalamic Hamartoma**

- MRI-guided stereotactic laser ablation is one of the most effective approaches.

- Others include;  transsphenoidal microsurgery, gamma knife radiosurgery, and thermocoagulation.

- A few other surgical approaches are also options, with varying outcomes.

**Breast Hamartoma**

- For definitive diagnosis and treatment, surgical excision is usually done.

- Although, in most cases, the malignant potential of breast hamartoma is usually the same as normal breast tissue, partial or complete mastectomy is considered in large masses and sometimes for cosmetic and psychological indications.
