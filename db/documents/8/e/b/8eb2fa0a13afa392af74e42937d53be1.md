Testicular cancer is rare and accounts for just 1% of male tumors. In 1992, the incidence was 5.7 in 1,00,000, whereas in 2009 it increased to 6.8 in 1,00,000. The 5-year survival rate has improved. In the 1970s, it used to be 83%, and it has risen to 97% in the 2010s.

Age: 50% burden is in the age group 20 to 34 years. Prepubertal males have a slightly higher risk for sex-cord stromal tumors.

Race and ethnicity: In white men, it’s four to five times more than black & Asian-Americans. Risk amongst American-Indians is in the middle of the Asian & white group. African-Americans have high-grade disease & a worse prognosis than whites.

Body size: Some studies suggest that tall men have a higher risk of testicular cancer, whereas others refute this hypothesis.
