Chronic iron deficiency is a global health problem. It is easy to overlook it as the presentation is often vague and nonspecific. In developing countries, inadequate dietary intake is the leading cause of chronic iron deficiency, whereas hemorrhage is the leading cause of chronic iron deficiency in developed nations. The causes of iron deficiency could be due to a variety of gynecological, obstetrical, metabolic, and gastrointestinal etiologies. The physical exam is often normal, and the cause cannot be determined without lab investigations.

A primary care provider should always be involved in the care of the patient. It is important to consult a hematologist, OB/GYN, or a gastroenterologist as necessary. A dietician can play an essential role in the primary prevention of iron deficiency through diet adjustment. Laboratory technologists have a vital role to play in diagnosing chronic iron deficiency. Pharmacists can help decide the appropriate oral or intravenous iron formulations that best fit the patient's requirements. Nurses not only educate the patients but assist in administering treatment. Effective collaboration and communication between healthcare professionals can ensure optimal outcomes in all patients.
