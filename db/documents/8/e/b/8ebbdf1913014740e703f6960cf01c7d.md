Patient education should focus on the importance of not only adherence to physical therapy and a home exercise program but also activity modifications, such as discontinuing overhead activities until the pain improves. Lifestyle modification such as “living within the window,” wherein movements are restricted to the anterior portion of one’s body in an approximate 2 to 3 feet rectangle, with attempts to minimize reaching overhead or behind the back is benefical.
