Pregnant patients requiring emergency general anesthesia, trauma patients with cervical spine injury with or without concurrent closed head injury, morbidly obese patients, and patients with previous head and neck cancer are some subsets of patients at high risk for difficult or failed intubation.

Failed intubation occurs in about 1 in 390 patients, and maternal mortality is four times higher than in other populations.

In trauma patients with a cervical spine injury, there should be a heightened suspicion for difficult intubation because of a rigid cervical collar for immobilization, higher Cormack-Lehane views of the larynx, and high aspiration risk. Intubation is often required for airway protection, mechanical ventilation, and/or emergency surgery. There may also be a concurrent closed head injury. Avoiding neck movement during intubation attempts and avoiding hypotension, hypoxia, and hypercarbia are all paramount.

Obesity and especially morbid obesity present challenges in all aspects of airway management, from bag-mask ventilation to laryngoscopy to emergency cricothyrotomy.
