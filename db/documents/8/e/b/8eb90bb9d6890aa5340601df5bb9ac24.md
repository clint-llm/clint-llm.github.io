The following are some important and common differentials that need to be considered while establishing the diagnosis of Brown syndrome:

- Inferior oblique palsy

- Orbital fracture

- Superior oblique overaction

- Congenital fibrosis syndrome

- Double elevator palsy

- Adherence syndromes

Superior oblique overaction, with or without inferior oblique palsy,Â will reveal free passive elevation with forced duction testing, and an "A" pattern on upgaze due to superior oblique overaction, in contrast to Brown syndrome. Orbital fractures can cause extraocular muscle entrapment and mechanical limitation of elevation. This can be differentiated from Brown by marked restriction of elevation in both abduction, adduction, and associated findings such as a history of trauma, infraorbital paraesthesia, or enophthalmos. Congenital fibrosis syndromes affect multiple extraocular muscles. The elevator can also be affected resulting in ptosis, which along with elevation deficiencies both in abduction and adduction, help to differentiate from Brown syndrome. Finally, in double elevator palsy (monocular elevation deficiency), the elevation deficiency in abduction is equal to or greater than that in adduction. Forced duction testing can be positive, and is accentuated by proptosis of the globe.
