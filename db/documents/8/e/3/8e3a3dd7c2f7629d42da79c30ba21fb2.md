According to epidemiological data, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is expected to be the third leading cause of death.

Tobacco smoking accounts for most cases of COPD in developed nations. The severity of the disease depends on the number of pack-years smoked and the duration of smoking, leading to progressive lung function loss due to alveolar damage. However, in developing countries, environmental pollutants are the major cause of COPD. Nearly 90% of COPD-related mortality among individuals younger than 70 years of age occurs in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).

Many COPD patients develop acute exacerbation and are admitted to intensive care units (ICU). Many factors affect the outcome, and one of the most important factors is the acid-base disorder in COPD patients. The function and clinical significance of COPD are discussed in this review article. The natural history, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of COPD are discussed in another article.
