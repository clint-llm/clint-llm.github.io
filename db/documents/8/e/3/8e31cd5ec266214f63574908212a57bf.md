The fundamental rationale of epilepsy surgery is the attainment of the seizure-free profile of the patients in the post-operative period. However, this is accomplished in only up to 80% of cases. The automated fiber quantification from the tractography study has identified the following variables contributing to the persistent occurrence of postoperative seizures.

- Diffusion abnormalities in the dorsal fornix

- Diffusion abnormalities in the contralateral parahippocampus and

- Insufficient resection of the uncinate fasciculus.

Diffusion tensor imaging also ensures hemispheric disconnection as well as identify the residual connectome hindering seizure-free status.
