MS presents with a broad range of symptoms reflective of the multifocal lesions of the CNS. The severity and wide range of symptoms are reflective of lesion burden, location, and degree of tissue injury. Symptoms are often not reflective of MRI evidence of active plaques given repair mechanisms and neural plasticity involved in tissue injury.

Typical clinical manifestations noted on history include:

- Vision symptom: includes vision loss(either monocular or homonymous), double vision, symptoms relating to optic neuritis.

- Vestibular symptoms: vertigo, gait imbalance

- Bulbar dysfunction: dysarthria, dysphagia

- Motor: weakness, tremor, spasticity, fatigue

- Sensory: loss of sensation, paresthesias, dysesthesias

- Urinary and bowel symptoms: incontinence, retention, urgency, constipation, diarrhea, reflux

- Cognitive symptoms: memory impairment, impairment of executive functions, trouble concentrating

- Psychiatric symptoms: depression, anxiety

The RR course of MS is observed in a majority of patients and is characterized by exacerbation and relapses of neurological symptoms, with stability between episodes. The following features generally characterize the RR course of MS:

- New or recurrent neurological symptoms

- Symptoms developing over days and weeks

- Symptoms lasting 24 to 48 hours

Symptoms from relapses frequently resolve, however over time, residual symptoms relating to episodes of exacerbation accrue. This accrual of symptoms, generally after 10 to 15 years, results in long term disability over time. Neurologic manifestations are heterogeneous in severity and degree of recovery. The secondary-progressive (SP) course is often noted in patients with RR after 10 to 15 years of onset and is characterized by a more gradual worsening of symptoms with continued progression with or without superimposed relapses. A small proportion of patients demonstrate gradual worsening of disability from onset of disease, described as the primary progressive (PP) course of MS. Myelopathy, cognitive symptoms, and visual symptoms are most frequently the clinical manifestations in this clinical course.

The physical exam mirrors evaluation of the patient's history of present illness and includes:

HEENT:

- Evaluation for optic neuritis, classically manifesting as subacute monocular central vision loss; pain on eye movement is also classically noted.

- Difficulty with adducting in lateral gaze suggesting internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO)

- Nystagmus

- Diplopia

- Hearing loss

- Facial pain

Neuromuscular/neurologic:

- Partial transverse myelitis which is typically unilateral or bilateral and characterized by sensory disturbances

- Brainstem symptoms classically involving diplopia, dysphagia, dysarthria, and ataxia

- L'hermittes sign; often described as a shock-like sensation that occurs with neck flexion

- Hyperreflexia

- Tremor

- Muscle spasms

- Weakness

Genitourinary:

- Urinary incontinence/retension(residual bladder volume evaluation)

- Erectile dysfunction (nocturnal penile tumescenceÂ stamp test if indicated)
