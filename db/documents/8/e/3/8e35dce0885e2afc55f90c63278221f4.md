The thyroid gland is divided into lobules by the septae dipping from the capsule. The thyroid lobules consist of many typical units called **thyroid follicles.****follicular cells**. These follicular cells are the derivates of the endoderm and secrete thyroid hormone. The circulating form of this hormone is**thyroxine,**which is**tetraiodothyronine (T4)**along with a small quantity of**triiodothyronine (T3).**Even though most of T4 later converts to the more active form T3, both affect the target cells with varying degrees of stimulation. These hormones help in regulating the BMR of the body. In between these thyroid follicles or within the wall of the thyroid follicles, we find the small**C cells**, also known as**Parafollicular****cells.**These are derived from neural crest cells and secrete polypeptide hormone known as**calcitonin**. The calcitonin helps deposit calcium and phosphate in skeletal and other tissues leading to hypocalcemia. This function is the opposite of the parathormone.

These thyroid follicles act as storage compartments filled with a substance called theÂ **colloid**. This colloid is thyroglobulin, which is nothing but acidophilic secretory glycoprotein that is PAS-positive. These follicles are held together tightly within a delicate network of reticular fibers with an extensive capillary bed.
