In obtaining the history of a patient with suspected Raynaud phenomenon, clinicians should address the age of onset, the location of affected areas, the presence of symmetry, the presence of digital ulcerations, and severity of the attacks. The presence of other systemic symptoms should be elicited to rule out secondary Raynaud phenomena. Provoking factors should be identified once confirmed to be Raynaud phenomenon. Provoking factors may include exposure to cold temperatures or sympathetic nervous system stimulation from emotional stress or being startled. Certain factors increase the likelihood for increased frequency of attacks, increased severity with worse pain. These include the presence of stress, female gender, low temperature, and the presence of a concurrent connective tissue disease. The later the onset of Raynaud phenomenon, particularly in the 30s and 40s age range, the higher the risk of the development of a connective tissue disorder.

Raynaud phenomena typically affect fingers (distal areas). A Raynaud phenomenon attack is sudden with the development of cold digits and the demarcation of "white" areas also known as skin pallor or white attack. Instead of white attack, there may be cyanotic skin changes, otherwise known as a blue attack. The white or blue attack typically remains for approximately 20 minutes. After the Raynaud phenomenon flare, vascular reperfusion with subsequent rewarming occurs. This results in erythematous areas where the flare occurred. It is known as reactive hyperemia.

A Raynaud phenomenon attack starts out with a single digit and then spreads to other digits symmetrically on both hands. The thumb is typically spared. If the thumb is affected, this may be a sign of secondary Raynaud phenomenon. It may also result in cutaneous vasospasm affecting facial areas, ears, knees, or nipples.

As a result of vasoconstriction, pin and needles sensation, numbness or finger aches or pain are common complaints with Raynaud phenomenon attacks. If the Raynaud phenomenon attack is severe, typically with secondary Raynaud phenomenon, digital ulceration of the tips of fingers and toes may occur due to prolonged vasoconstriction with subsequent tissue ischemia. Eventual gangrene or loss of digits may occur in severe forms of Raynaud phenomenon attacks. In general, Raynaud phenomenon attacks are less severe in primary Raynaud phenomenon compared to secondary Raynaud phenomenon.

Another skin finding seen during a Raynaud phenomenon attack is livedo reticularis. This results in purplish mottling or reticular pattern over the skin due to small blood vessel clots. This finding is reversible with rewarming but is irreversible with secondary causes, such as antiphospholipid syndrome, vasculitis, cold agglutinin disease, or peripheral vascular disease.
