Inamrinone, also known as amrinone, is a drug that increases cardiac output through its positive inotropic and vasodilatory effects. It is prescribed for the short-term management of congestive heart failure, relieving symptoms of CHF such as fatigue, weakness, edema, dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

There is uncertainty regarding the effect of amrinone compared to standard cardiac care with dobutamine on patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) or low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS).****The long-term use of inamrinone has been widely abandoned due to its capacity to induce thrombocytopenia.

While the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States acknowledges that inamrinone has the potential to cause severe adverse effects, it has indicated its use in specific, limited circumstances – it stipulates that indications for short-term inamrinone administration are only if an adult patient's myocardial function (i.e., cardiac output) has not improved sufficiently in response to doses of digoxin, diuretics, and vasodilators.
