The typical treatment for jersey finger injuries is surgery. Early treatment is essential to restore blood supply and function. Flexor tendons nourish themselves from blood vessels located inside the mesotendon (long and short vincula). Conservative treatment has been minimal reporting in cases of high-risk surgical patients.

Surgical Management

- Acute: within 3 weeks after injury.

- Without fracture: direct tendon repair or tendon reinsertion (mini-suture anchor).
- Fracture fragment: calls for open reduction and internal fixation (mini-screws, wires). Currently, suture anchors are being used in cases of bony avulsions as well.

There are multiple, described proven treatment techniques for acute injuries. None of these seem to be significantly superior to the others.

- Chronic: over 3 months after injury.

- Two-stage tendon grafting (if the full range of motion is present).
- DIP joint arthrodesis (if chronic stiffness is present). Joint arthrodesis requires careful discussion with each patient. The distal interphalangeal joint motion may be essential for some patients (occupation and hobbies), and tendon reconstruction may become a valid alternative. Unfortunately, tendon reconstruction requires a significant time commitment from the patient to achieve a successful long-term rehabilitation outcome.
