When the data of the incidence rate of neuroendocrine tumors from 1973 was compared with data from 2012, there was nearly a six times increase in incidence from 1.09 per 100,000 to 6.98 per 100,000. For gastropancreatic sites, the highest incidence was 3.56 per 100,000. On 1st January 2014, the limited-duration prevalence spanning 20 years for neuroendocrine tumors was 171,321 in the United States. The overall survival rates for all neuroendocrine tumors have been increasing when compared between periods of 2000-2004 with 2009-2012. The increase in overall survival rate for distant stage pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, when compared between these two periods, was substantial (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.44-0.70).
