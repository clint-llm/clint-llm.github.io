The pathophysiology of BS is controversial, and the ultimate mechanisms causing the disease have not been elucidated. The histopathological studies reported in a few cases recently provide new insights into the mechanisms behind this condition. The acute inflammatory episodes have been compared to localized angioedema in which an unknown trigger leads to a vascular impairment causing liquid extravasation and the swelling attack.

Repeated episodes of skin stretching would lead to the fragmentation, and eventually loss of the elastic fibers and tissue atrophy. However, the presence of Ig A deposits within the dermis and perivascular inflammatory cells infiltrates, described in several studies, suggest a possible immune reaction as an alternative. Moreover, Kaneoya et al. performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to analyze mRNA expression of elastin in the skin of a patient affected with BS. They found that the elastin mRNA expression was not different in the patient's cultured fibroblast comparing with healthy controls, suggesting that environmental factors or other matrix components of elastic fibers may be involved in the loss of elastic fibers. Blood tests, including cell counts, circulating Ig, C-reactive protein, C3, C4, and C1 - esterase inhibitor, have been reported as normal in these patients.
