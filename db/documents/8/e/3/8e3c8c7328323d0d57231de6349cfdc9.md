Approved by the food and drug administration (FDA) in December of 2019, clinicians can use lemborexant to treat insomnia in adults. Additionally, lemborexant has been demonstrated to be safe for use in patients with mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Lemborexant belongs to a class of drugs called dual receptor orexin antagonists (DORA), most of which are currently under evaluation in clinical trials, except forÂ suvorexant, which was FDA-approved for the treatment of primary insomnia in August of 2014.
