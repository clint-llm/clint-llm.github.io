Angioplasty is a complex procedure requiring a high level of training of the performing surgeon/radiologist/cardiologist. Improved outcomes are observed in physicians trained with a higher procedural volume. Careful patient evaluation andÂ identification of patients at high risk for complications with timely and appropriate management of immediate post-cath complications can significantly enhance outcomes. The choice between the radial vs femoral approach should take into consideration the performing surgeon's level of comfort with the newer radial approach. Individual patient assessment of bleeding and thrombosis risk to determine the duration and choice of antiplatelet agents can reduce the risk for bleeding-related complications.
