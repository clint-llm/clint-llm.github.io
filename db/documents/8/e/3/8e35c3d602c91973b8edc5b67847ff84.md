The majority of people with acute scrotal pain initially present to the emergency department, and thus, the triage nurse should be fully aware of causes that are urgent and demand immediate medical attention and those that are elective. If acute torsion is suspected, the triage nurse must immediately admit the patient to the emergency department and notify the emergency department physician. The nurse should continue to monitor the patient and report increasing pain to the clinician. The nurse should assist in making sure the patient is evaluated quickly as the longer a patient goes with a torsed testicle, the more likely they will lose function. If there is a delay in evaluation or care, the nurse should be diligent in reporting it to the clinical team leader directing the patient's evaluation and care. Patients who have been diagnosed with torsion should be told to avoid sporting activities unless cleared by the urologist, as there is a small risk of recurrence.

Interprofessional team management is crucial to managing acute scrotum pain and salvage affected testicles. Only by having an integrated pathway of best practices can one make the diagnosis of urological disorders and lower the morbidity.
