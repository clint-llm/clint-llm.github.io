The vallecula is a highly innervated region as evidenced by physiological responses such as increases in heart rate and blood pressure with direct laryngoscopy during endotracheal intubation and other procedures like bronchoscopy and upper GI endoscopy. The vallecula receives nerve supply from the ninth cranial nerve (CN IX) or glossopharyngeal nerve.
