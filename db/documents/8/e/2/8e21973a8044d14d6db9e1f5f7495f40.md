The FDA approved phenytoin in 1939 for the treatment of epilepsy. Despite its narrow therapeutic index, the drug has seen robust use in the treatment of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, complex partial seizures, status epilepticus, trigeminal neuralgia, and behavior disorders.

The drug had previously been used as an anti-arrhythmic and treatment of digoxin toxicity and tricyclic antidepressant toxicity but is now obsolete in these settings.
