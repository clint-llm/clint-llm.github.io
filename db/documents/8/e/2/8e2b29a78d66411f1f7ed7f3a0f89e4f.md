There is a growing debate among spinal specialists regarding the availability of one or two specialized spinal surgeons during osteotomy procedures. Regardless, the lead surgeon should be a spinal surgeon well trained and comfortable with complex deformity management. Having a dedicated anesthesia team is also essential. Furthermore, there will need to be a neuromonitoring team that includes a monitoring technician, plus a neurologist (generally off-site). For complex adult cases, proper integration with the medicine or critical care teams is important.

For complex pediatric cases, interprofessional care is vital. This can include spine surgeon(s), primary pediatrician, dietary specialist, physical therapist, cardiologist, pulmonologist, gastroenterologist, child life specialists, and social workers as appropriate.
