A prenatal diagnosis from an ultrasound examination is possible for these lesions. However, the sensitivity is only 20% to 30%.****and is pathognomonic for alimentary tract duplication. Although ultrasound can also be used to diagnose foregut duplications located in the neck, its sensitivity is poor for intrathoracic lesions. Transesophageal ultrasound (TEE) can be used for these lesions, but it is not readily available at all centers, especially in developing countries. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) can be used to localize the lesions in these scenarios. On CECT, these duplications appear as hypoattenuating masses with an enhancing rim. Similar to intrathoracic lesions, it might be difficult to localize and diagnose rectal duplication cysts located deep in the pelvic cavity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides better cross-sectional anatomy in these cases and also helps in the diagnosis of duplication cysts involving the hindgut.

A technetium-99m pertechnetate scan can be done to know whether the cyst contains ectopic gastric mucosa or not. Although it might not change our management, it can help in diagnosing multiple synchronous lesions. It is better to have knowledge about the duplication cysts that will rarely show a positive pertechnetate scan like bronchogenic and rectal duplication cysts. This radionuclide scan can, therefore, be avoided in these cases.
