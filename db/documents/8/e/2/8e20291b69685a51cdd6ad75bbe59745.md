**Vascular Supply**

The blood supply of the palatine tonsils derives from vasculature that branches off several major vessels, all are primarily tributaries of the external carotid artery.  The dorsal lingual artery, ascending palatine artery, the tonsillar branch of the facial artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, and lesser palatine artery all provide oxygen and other nutrients to the palatine tonsils.

Venous drainage of the palatine tonsils occurs by the peritonsillar plexus of veins.  This plexus drains into the pharyngeal and lingual veins, and these veins ultimately drain into the internal jugular vein.

**Lymphatics**

The palatine tonsils drain to the jugulodigastric node, a node of the deep cervical lymph nodes, located inferior to the angle of the mandible.
