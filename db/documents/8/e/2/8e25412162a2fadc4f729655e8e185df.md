The princeps pollicis artery usually branches from the deep palmar arch. The location where the princeps pollicis artery will branch from may vary. The length and site of termination of the princeps pollicis artery also vary. In some rare instances, the princeps pollicis artery is a branch of theÂ superficial palmar arch instead of the deep palmar arch. This anomaly makes the ulnar artery the main blood supply to the princeps pollicis artery.
