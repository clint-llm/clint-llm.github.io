Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) is a relatively common lesion reported to be found in about 5% to 20% of breast biopsies. Although not carcinoma, it is classified as a high-risk precursor lesion due to its association with and potential to progress to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as well as invasive carcinoma.

Atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH), like ADH, is another high-risk breast lesion that has been associated with a four-fold to a five-fold increased lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in either the ipsilateral or contralateral breast.
