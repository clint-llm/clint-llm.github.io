It can occur with a past or present insult, be exacerbated or triggered by emotional states, or occur idiopathically. The prognosis of the allodynia will vary dramatically with the associated underlying disease. Please see the differential diagnosis section for a noncomprehensive list of the primary conditions associated with allodynia.
