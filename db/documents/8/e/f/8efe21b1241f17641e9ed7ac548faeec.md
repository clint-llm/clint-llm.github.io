Alexander disease usually occurs through a mutation of the GFAP gene. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.GFAP gene was identified in the region of chromosome 17q21.GFAP mutations act as a gain of function mutation that disrupts the dimerization of intermediate filaments.

There is also a suggestion of the GFAP accumulation disrupts filament assembly. The most frequent mutations affect exon 1 (54%), exon 4 (31%), exon 8 (7%), exon 6 (4%), exon 5 (3%), and consist of point mutations that bind to an alternative transcript and different mRNAs by transcription start site or by alternative RNA splicing. Of note, despite the genetic homogeneity, there are different clinical phenotypes.
