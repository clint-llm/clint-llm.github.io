Mondor disease is a rare clinical entity with a poorly understood etiology. Many case reports haveÂ linked sclerosing superficial thrombophlebitis and the resulting palpable cord to local trauma, including repetition injury as a tight brassiere, strenuous exercise in the case of bodybuilders, or direct injury associated with surgery.

Mondor disease can affect several different veinous drainage systems. However, it never involves the inner, upper portion of the breast. Symptoms may be found in the groin, abdomen, arm, or axilla. Axillary disease, also known as axillary web syndrome, has been well documented following axillary lymph node dissection and sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer.
