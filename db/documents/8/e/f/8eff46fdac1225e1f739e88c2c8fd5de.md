Methods utilized to assess the effectiveness of a simulation program for ECMO cannulation include but are not limited to pre-. Post-surveys of participants to evaluate their comfort with their role during the simulation, timing of when to decide to place a patient on ECMO to following successful cannulation, testing and timing ECMO specialists to prepare a circuit, and conducting chart reviews of ECMO cannulation times in patients before and after implementation of an ECMO simulation curriculum.
