The World Health Organization has established a modified classification of maternal cardiovascular risk. This is used as a tool to evaluate risk status for pregnant females with various cardiovascular conditions. The classifications are as follows.

- I: No Identifiable elevated risk of maternal morbidity/mortality

- II: Mildly elevated maternal mortality; moderate elevation of morbidity

- III: Substantially elevated risk in maternal mortality; severely elevation of morbidity. For these patients, it is recommended that close follow-up be initiated with cardiac specialists. Cardiac monitoring should continue regularly throughout pregnancy and should also continue after pregnancy.

- IV: Extremely elevated risk of maternal mortality; severe elevation of morbidity. Pregnancy is contraindicated for these individuals. If pregnancy is to occur, termination should be recommended. However, if the individual chooses to pursue pregnancy, she should be monitored closely as class III individuals.

- **WHO Class I Conditions**:
- Uncomplicated or mild

- Patient ductus arterosisi
- Pulmonic stenosis
- Mitral valve prolapse repaired ventricular septal defect


- Repaired atrial septal defect
- Repair ventricular septal defect
- Repaired anomalous pulmonary venous drainage
- Repaired patent ductus arteriosus
- Atrial ectopic beats
- Ventricular ectopic beats

- 
**WHO Class II Conditions:**

- 
              
- Unrepaired atrial septal defect
              
              
- Unrepaired ventricular defect
              
              
- Repaired tetralogy of Fallot

- **WHO II/II based on individual**
- Mild left ventricle compromise
- Repaired coarctation of the aorta
- Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
- Marfan syndrome without aortic dilation
- Bicuspid aortic valve with aorta <45 mm

- **WHO Class III Conditions**
- Mechanical valve
- Fontan circulation
- Unrepaired cyanotic heart defects
- Systemic right ventricle
- Marfan syndrome with aorta dilated to 40 to 45 mm
- Bicuspid aortic valve with aorta dilated to 45 to 50 mm

- **WHO Class IV Conditions**
- Pulmonary arterial Hypertension (any class)
- Severe left ventricular compromise (ejection fraction <30%)
- Prior peripartum cardiomyopathy, especially if remaining impairment
- Severe mitral stenosis
- Severe aortic stenosis
- Marfan syndrome with aortic dilatation >45 mm
- Bicuspid aortic valve disease with aortic dilatation >50 mm

Although heart disease in pregnancy is a high-risk state, successful outcomes are possible and even common in patients that have a regular follow-up. Some conditions of pregnancy carry more morbidity and mortality than others, however.

- Peripartum cardiomyopathy: Peripartum cardiomyopathy occurs in approximately 1 in 2289 live births. About 75% of women with this disease process have a full return of normal ventricular function.

- Congenital heart defects: Regurgitant lesions have improved morbidity over stenotic lesions. Overall, however, mortality is negligible in patients with congenital heart disease, with one study identifying no maternal deaths in an analysis of 90 individuals.

- Acute coronary syndrome: ACS and MI are rare in pregnancy, with some estimates reporting 1 to 2 per 35000 deliveries.
