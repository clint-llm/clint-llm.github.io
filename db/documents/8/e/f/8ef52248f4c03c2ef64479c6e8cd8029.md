Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus results from cellular-mediated autoimmune destruction of the insulin-secreting cells of pancreatic beta cells.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus accounts for approximately 90% of all cases of diabetes. Patients have minimal symptoms, are not prone to ketosis, and are not dependent on insulin to prevent ketonuria.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as any degree of glucose intolerance (i.e., hyperglycemia) with onset or first recognition during pregnancy (i.e., patients who become pregnant after a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus are not included in this category).

Patients with GDM are at significantly greater risk for the subsequent development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which occurs in 15% to 60%. The risk is exceptionally high in patients with marked hyperglycemia during or soon after pregnancy, patients who are obese, and patients whose GDM is diagnosed before 24 weeks gestation.
