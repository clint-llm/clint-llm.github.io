EDH is a relatively common presentation to the emergency department, and if not diagnosed is associated with high mortality. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the emergency room physician, the trauma team, radiologist, neurologist, neurosurgeon, intensivist and the ICU nurses. The condition has been associated with mortality rates in excess of 15%. The key prognostic feature is the level of consciousness at the time of presentation. Both bilateral epidural hematomas and posterior fossa epidural hematomas carry a very high mortality. The key to treating this condition is preventing it in the first place. Healthcare workers should educate the public on the importance of head safety equipment when playing sports or while working.
