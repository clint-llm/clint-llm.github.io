The axillary artery can be accessed surgically by an infraclavicular or deltopectoral incision in the upper arm.

Clamping the axillary artery can be accomplished without harming the arm. Surgical procedures concerning the axillary artery require delicacy due to the proximity of the brachial plexus. In cardiac surgery, the right axillary artery is frequently used as an arterial cannulation site, especially in the repair of aortic aneurysm or dissection.
