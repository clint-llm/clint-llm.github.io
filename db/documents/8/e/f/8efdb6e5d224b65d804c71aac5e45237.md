Microneedling is a procedure used widely in dermatology, plastic surgery, and other aesthetic practices. In addition to its original intended use for skin rejuvenation, it is also gaining traction for novel uses such as transcutaneous medication delivery. Though the risks are minimal and the technique straightforward, it can be an expensive procedure and healthcare providers have an ethical responsibility to inform patients of the limited evidence regarding its efficacy. Despite the limited number of large, well-controlled studies there are many anecdotal reports and small case-series that have demonstrated significant improvement when used for a number of dermatologic conditions.
