**Coronary Anatomy**

The purpose of angiography is to visualize the coronary arteries, major branches, or anomalies. Angiography also studies plaque burden, calcification, thrombus, or aneurysms. The major epicardial coronary arteries are left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCx), and the right coronary artery (RCA). The LAD and LCx arise from the left main coronary artery (LM). The LM and RCA typically originate from the left and right aortic sinus of Valsalva, respectively. The branches of LAD are called diagonals and septals. The branches of the LCx are called obtuse marginals. The RCA usually bifurcates into the right posterior descending artery (RPDA) and right posterolateral artery (RPL). RCA also gives acute marginal branches. These are visualized during an angiogram, and pressure measurement can be performed in these. The cardiac microvasculature is not discreetly visualized during cardiac catheterization.

**Physiology**

The coronary arteries fill during diastole as the vigorous contraction of the heart during systole allows for little driving pressure. Using the principle of Ohm’s law, V = IR (V is voltage difference, I is current, R is resistance), the coronary pressure and flow are directly related, assuming minimal resistance. The pressure gradient in the coronaries is the difference between a distal coronary bed and aortic root pressure. The pressure gradient could be derived by measuring trans-stenotic gradient at rest or hyperemia, a direct coronary flow reserve (CFR) measurement, or the slope of the relationship between mean gradient and coronary flow. The two most commonly used physiological tools are fractional flow reserve (FFR) and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR).
