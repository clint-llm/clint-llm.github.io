Primary assessment of tobacco use is self-report during assesment of social history.Â  Family or significant others may also provide information regarding tobacco use and amount. Self-report may not be reliable; a patient may not understand the amount of tobacco products used; or may deny or minimize the amount when speaking to health care professionals for fear of being chastized for using tobacco.
