Interval symphyseal fundal height is routinely evaluated in obstetric prenatal care to screen for fetal growth. In twin gestation, this metric is not a reliable reassurance against fetal growth restriction; however, it still has a clinical role. Symphyseal fundal height is typically 4 cm of the expected gestational age. An unexpected increase may indicate polyhydramnios driven by a diverse range of etiologies. In monochorionic twin gestations, this may indicate twin-twin transfusion syndrome, especially if the mother gives a history of thirst and acutely enlarging abdominal girth.

Weight gain surveillance is a critical part of the physical examination. The Institute of Medicine recommends 25 to 54 pounds (11 to 25 kg) total weight gain at term for women carrying twins. The lower end of this range is suitable for obese women, the middle of the range is appropriate for overweight women, and the upper end of the range is appropriate for women of normal weight.
