After a myocardial infarction, the risk of sudden cardiac death is highest during the first months due to fatal tachyarrhythmias, re-infarction, or myocardial rupture.

Ventricular fibrillation (VF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) were initially thought to be the most common causes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. More recent studies show pulseless, electrical activity (PEA) and asystole as more frequent. Approximately 50% of patients initially have asystole, and 19% to 23% have PEA as the first identifiable rhythm.

Immediately following OHCA the blood flow to the brain slows to essentially zero and ultimately leading to death.
