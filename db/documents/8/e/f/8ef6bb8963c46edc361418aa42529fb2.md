Thallium-201 is a radiopharmaceutical agent used in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease and parathyroid hyperactivity. Other useful applications for a thallium-201 scan, like tumor diagnosis and olfacto-scintigraphy, are being explored and have shown promising results in various studies. This activity reviews the indications, mechanism of action, administration, adverse effects, monitoring, toxicity, and enhancement of health care outcomes for Thallium-201 as a valuable diagnostic agent in the clinical setting as pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and diagnosis of coronary artery disease and related conditions in patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of thallium-201.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of thallium-201.
- Review the possibility of toxicity with thallium-201.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients receiving thallium-201 for scintigraphy.
