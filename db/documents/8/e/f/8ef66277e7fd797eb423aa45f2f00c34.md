Medical management of intrathoracic goiters should be individualized. Several factors should be considered, such as the clinical presentation, the goiter size and growth rate, and finally coexistence of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Thus, the inability to tolerate full anesthesia in high-risk patients is the main absolute contraindication to substernal thyroidectomy. In that case, conservative management or radioiodine treatment is usually preferred.
