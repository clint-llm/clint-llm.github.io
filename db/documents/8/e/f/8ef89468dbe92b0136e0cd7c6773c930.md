Scars should be thoroughly evaluated using a combination of clinical assessment and patient history to guide the appropriate treatment plan. Scars should be categorized as hypertrophic, keloidal, atrophic, or conventional. History of the scar should be obtained to elucidate the age of the scar, previous scar treatments, and type of preceding trauma, surgery, or inflammatory process. The patient's Fitzpatrick skin phototype should be a consideration.

Pictures and measurements taken before each laser treatment can assist in monitoring progress and response to treatment. Scars should be clinically assessed at each visit, documenting pigmentation, pliability, and height of the scar.

Application of a topical anesthetic (e.g., a cream) to the scar should take place between 30 and 60 minutes before beginning treatment. The treatment area should be cleaned with an antiseptic solution before deliveringÂ laser treatment.
