Obtaining optimum diagnostic quality image is critical while decreasing patient and surgeon dosage during the procedure. We outline some techniques to limit the radiation exposure and scatter, and at the same time, obtain a good image.

The primary beam is the main source of radiation to the patient, whereas the scatter is the source of exposure to the surgeon and operator. Fluoroscopy systems contain variables that regulate the amount of radiation and adjust image quality. For example, the tube voltage is adjusted in kilovolts (kV), the tube current in milliampere, and the pulse duration in milliseconds. A higher kilovolt setting will allow lower current (milliampere) delivery and hence lower radiation exposure. Hence, the equipment includes a variety of options for specific procedures.

The intensifier must be as close to the patient as feasible. This prevents the beam from dispersing and reduces the radiation required for a sharp image. Removal of the anti-scatter grid decreases the total radiation dose but with a slight increase in the amount of radiation scatter. A balance must be attained between the total dosage and the amount of scatter. Pulsed fluoroscopy reduces fluoroscopy time by 76% and radiation dose by 64% compared with continuous fluoroscopy. Decreasing the frame rate further decreases the effective radiation. Collimation must be used whenever feasible.

Magnification increases the radiation dose as well as the scatter. The need for magnification is limited by digital zooming and the use of large displays. An increase of scattered radiation is seen when the gantry position is more than 30 degrees in left or right anterior oblique angulations or 15 degrees in cranial angulation. Additional exposure can be due to incorrect coordination between radiographers and surgeons due to non-standard means of communication. Effective methods of communication with accurate terminology must be developed between the surgical team and C-arm technicians.

**Joint Injections Under Fluoroscopic Guidance**

All joint injections are carried out under strict aseptic precautions and require appropriate draping and preparation. Proper patient positioning before the procedure ensures safe and efficient access to the joint as well as patient comfort. A radio-opaque object is placed on the skin over the target joint to mark the skin entry. Sterile preparation is performed. Local anesthetic is injected into the overlying skin and tract (e.g., 2% lidocaine). The appropriate length and gauge needle is chosen and is advanced into the joint with intermittent fluoroscopic guidance.

Imaging provides a visual reference, but it is necessary to develop a tactile sense of the needle encountering different tissues. The intra-articular position of the needle is confirmed either by air arthrogram, which shows an intra-articular air ring, or by saline distension of the joint. Needle placement is further confirmed when the contrast medium can be injected with little resistance. It flows into the joint recesses rather than clustering around the needle tip if the needle is intra-articular. For diagnostic injections, an iodinated contrast medium is used. Therapeutic injections include steroids such as triamcinolone, hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma, etc.

A summary of commonly used approaches to joint injections is given below:

**Considerations in Individual Joints**

**Shoulder**

The shoulder joint can be approached anteriorly or posteriorly. Anterior approaches are the most commonly used shoulder approaches.

In the rotator interval approach, the target is the upper medial quadrant of the humeral head. The coracoid process is avoided in this position. The needle enters the space between the supraspinatus and subscapularis muscles. The external rotation draws the biceps tendon out of the needle path. It is a shorter distance from the skin and avoids damage to other structures. An unintentional bursal injection is a common problem with this method.

In the Schneider approach, the needle enters the junction of the middle and inferior thirds of the medial humeral head. This may be painful as the needle enters through the subscapularis muscle and risks damaging the labrum. A 22-gauge needle is inserted until it contacts the bone and is slightly withdrawn. The flow of contrast medium and opacification of the joint space and the subcoracoid recess confirm intra-articular positioning. For the posterior approach, the patient can be placed either in a prone position with the arm in a neutral position or a sitting position. In the prone position, the shoulder is elevated with a triangular foam pad placed under the torso. The needle is advanced into the glenohumeral joint through the infraspinatus between the free edge of the posterior labrum and the hypoechoic articular cartilage of the posterior humeral head. With this technique, injury to neurovascular bundles, the suprascapular nerve, and the circumflex scapular vessels may occur if the needle is placed too medially.

**Elbow**

The patient is either prone with arms hanging or seated with the arm in 90-90 over a radiolucent table.

**Wrist**

Injection into the radiocarpal joint is performed to evaluate the triangular fibrocartilage complex and intrinsic ligaments for complete tears. The patient lies prone on the table or sits on a stool with the palm facing down on the table. A dorsal approach is used for all wrist compartments. To improve the profile, a soft towel is placed beneath the wrist to maintain passive wrist flexion.

The mid-carpal compartment injection is done at the confluence of the triquetrum, lunate, capitate, and hamate. This space may communicate with the common carpometacarpal joint but not with the radio-carpal joint.

**Hip**

The hip capsule must be pierced on the anterolateral surface of the femoral head or neck between the acetabular rim and the intertrochanteric line. The patient is supine, and the lower extremity is internally rotated 10 to 15 degrees.

**Fluoroscopic Arthrography in DDH**

Hip arthrography is a dynamic study of the hip joint. It is performed by injecting a radiopaque dye into the hip joint and carrying out a fluoroscopic examination with the patient under anesthesia and is usually performed in conjunction with a closed reduction. Arthrography helps in determining the underlying cartilaginous profile and also the dynamic stability of the hip. Arthrography performed in combination with a closed reduction can assess the adequacy of the reduction. An increased medial joint space, demonstrated by medial pooling of the dye and a rounded or interposing limbus, is indicative of poor results.

**Fluoroscopy in Trauma**

The anatomical reconstruction of joint surfaces, limb alignment, and rotation orientation are crucial in fracture fixation to achieve optimum function and range of motion. With continuing advancements in implants and surgical techniques, high-resolution intra-operative imaging has become imperative in trauma surgery. Without the real-time visualization of the anatomy and the position of implants in relation to the bone and evaluation of the reconstruction of joint surfaces and bony alignment, the rapid evolution of minimally invasive surgery would not have been possible. Intra-operative fluoroscopy aids in continuously controlling these parameters while doing fracture fixation.

Even with complete access to the surgical view in conventional total hip arthroplasty, intra-operative images are performed to confirm the acetabular cup's alignment and orientation and rule out fractures of the acetabulum or the femoral shaft. Standards for axis alignments and patient positioning exist in radiology departments, but the intra-operative settings vary due to the positioning requirement of the surgical procedure as well as patient-related factors such as obesity or limitations in joint movement.

**The Distal Radius**

The joint surface is tilted volar by 5 to 10 degrees in the AP view.

**The Proximal Humerus**

The patient is positioned in the beach-chair position in osteosynthesis of the proximal humerus. Hence, the upper arm is already tilted towards the floor. This is evened out by tilting the C-arm so that the beam is perpendicular to the humeral shaft axis. The standard views are defined as an AP view with a maximum extension of the greater tubercle and a lateral view with 90 degrees external rotation of the humerus. The spherical shape of the humeral head must be considered when assessing screw length. Dynamic fluoroscopy while rotating the arm might be helpful to assess the screw length.

**The Proximal Femur**

A traction table is usually used for fracture reduction, and the contralateral leg is elevated in a leg holder.

**The Ankle Joint**

While positioning the C-arm for osteosynthesis of the ankle joint, the hazard of collision of the device with the patient is less. The lower leg is internally rotated by 15 to 20 degrees to obtain the Mortise view. In this view, the medial and lateral joint space should be equal, and no double contour of the margins of the talus should be seen. For the lateral view, the condyles of the talus must be exactly above each other, and the tibiotalar joint space must be completely visible.

**Spinal Fluoroscopy- Facet Joint Injections**

Facet joints are one of the most common causes of low back pain (LBP). Hence, facet joint interventions like intraarticular steroid injections and medial branch blocks are commonly performed.

**Anatomical Considerations**

Synovial facet joints are simple in the cervical and thoracic regions but very complex in the lumbar region. Engel and Bogduk described three types of lumbar intracapsular structures. The first structure includes adipose tissue pads covered by the synovial membrane. The second is fibro-adipose meniscoid tissue which is also covered by the synovial membrane and projects out from the joint capsule at the superior and inferior poles. The third is the connective tissue rims located along the anterior and posterior margins and are folds of the fibrous layer of the joint capsule. Each lumbar facet joint has space that can accommodate 1 to 1.5 ml of fluid.

**Indications For Facet Joint Injections**

- Average pain levels >5 on a scale of 0 to 10

- Intermittent or continuous LBP causing functional disability

- Somatic or non-radicular LBP and lower extremity pain lasting at least three months

- Failed conservative treatment

- Lack of evidence of either discogenic or sacroiliac joint pain or radiculitis

- Contraindications or inability to undergo physical therapy or inability to tolerate oral medications.

**The Technique of Localization of Facet Joint Under the Fluoroscope**

The fluoroscopic-guided technique of lumbar facet injection is considered the most reliable. The patient is placed prone on the procedure table with the fluoroscope over the target level. A pillow is placed under the abdomen to reduce lumbar curvature, allowing easier entry into the joint. It also allows for the patient's head and face to be supported comfortably. A baseline anteroposterior (AP) fluoroscopic view of the lumbar spine should be obtained, and the C-arm is oriented. The patient is turned slowly so that the side to be injected is off the table till the facet joint is seen in profile and the position is secured. Alternatively, the tube may be tilted. The posterior aspect of the facet joint is further from the midline than the anterior.

During posteroanterior(PA) fluoroscopy, first, the posterior portion of the joint is seen. Over-rotation has to be avoided as it brings the anterior portion of the joint into the profile. This makes needle placement into the joint impossible. The upper lumbar spine requires an obliquity of 30 degrees, while the lower lumbar spine requires up to 60 degrees obliquity. Once localized, the needle is directed vertically into the center of the joint space. Alternatively, the inferior recess is targeted since it lies posteriorly, has no direct neural relations, and is relatively capacious, hence easy to enter.
