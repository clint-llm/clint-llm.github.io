Tapia syndrome results from concurrent unilateral paralysis of the hypoglossal (XII) and the recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus (X) nerve. RareÂ cases of bilateral paralysis of these nerves have also been reported.

Tapia syndrome typically manifests as the unilateral and peripheral form of nerve damage from direct trauma to the hypoglossal and recurrent laryngeal nerve at the base of the tongue and pyriform fossae.

The central type of Tapia syndrome typically forms part of a brainstem syndrome affecting the hypoglossal nucleus, nucleus ambiguus, and pyramidal tract.
