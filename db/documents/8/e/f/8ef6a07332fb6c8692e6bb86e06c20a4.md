**Dosage Formulations:**Permetrin cream (5%), Permethrin lotion (1%), Permethrin rinse (1%)

**Classical Scabies**: 5% permethrin cream is applied topically to cool, dry skin from the patient's head to the patient's toes and under the fingernails.****Scabies rarely infests the scalp of adults, but the hairline, neck, temples, and forehead may be infested in infants and geriatric patients; therefore, the clinician should instruct the caregiver to apply 5% cream to the entire head and neck, including the scalp, temples, and forehead.

**Pediculosis Capitis**: Apply 1% permethrin to dampened hair and wash off after ten minutes with a repeat application one week later.

**Use in Specific Patient Population**

- **Hepatic Impairment:**The manufacturer's labeling provides no information regarding the use in patients with hepatic impairment.

- **Renal Impairment:**The manufacturer's labeling provides no information regarding the use in patients with renal impairment. However, permethrin is primarily metabolized by the liver, so hypothetically it should be safe to use in patients with renal impairment.

- **Pregnancy Considerations:**Permethrin has not been shown to cause human risk and has been in the former FDA pregnancy category B.

- **Breastfeeding Considerations:**Topical permethrin is acceptable in nursing mothers as less than 2% is absorbed after topical application, and permethrin is rapidly metabolized. Extensive exposure, such as agricultural use or malaria control, might have long-term health concerns because residues can be found in breastmilk. Clinicain should instruct the patient to use only water-miscible cream, gel, or liquid products on the breast because ointments may expose the infant to increased concentrations of mineral paraffin via licking. In addition, breastmilk samples from 79 women from a study at the University of California Davis had their breastmilk examined for the presence of trans-permethrin on day 42 postpartum. The mean concentration was in the acceptable therapeutic range.
