Like giant fornix syndrome, many ocular diseases present with chronic conjunctivitis, which may delay the correct diagnosis. Causes of chronic conjunctivitis with similar presentation include but are not limited to:

- Ocular allergies

- Dry eye

- Blepharitis

- Scleritis

- Dacryocystitis (also typically involves S. aureus)

- Canaliculitis

- Nasolacrimal duct obstruction

- Lacrimal sac mucocele

Ocular allergies may be less likely if the patient does not have other chronic allergies such as asthma or eczema. While severe cases of ocular allergies may persist, most would respond to the use of antihistamines.

If a positive culture with a large bioburden is obtained, giant fornix syndrome and dacryocystitis should be considered. Dacryocystitis may be ruled out if patients continue to have symptoms despite patent lacrimal ducts after a successful lacrimal surgery. If the treatment regimen for chronic dacryocystitis does not yield results, the patient may be assessed for GFS risk factors.
