**Relevant Terms and Definitions**

- Immunogen: Protein or carbohydrate that is recognized and sufficiently activates an immune response

- Antigen: A molecule that is recognized by a specific antibody or T-cell receptor (TCR)

- Adjuvant: Prolongs the presence of antigen in tissue and enhances the immune response to an antigen; used in acquired or artificial immunization (vaccinations)

- Dendritic cells (antigen-presenting cells): Facilitate activation of an antigen-specific response by the innate system; present antigens via major histone complexes to activate CD8 and CD4 T cells

- CD4 helper T cells: Facilitate cell-to-cell interactions and cytokine release to activate and control immune and inflammatory responses

- CD8 cytotoxic T cells: Travel throughout the body looking for antigens presented by the MHC I molecules present on all nucleated cells. Activated by TH1-cell cytokine release of IL-2; destroy virally infected cells

- Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I: Found on all nucleated cells, play a significant role in determining “self.” Responsible for presenting intracellular antigens to CD8 T cells

- MHC II: Found on antigen-presenting cells that interact with CD4 T cells; responsible for presenting exogenous antigens

- TH0: The initial role of activated CD4 T cells, promotes cell immunity by activating dendritic cells and stimulating lymphocyte growth; releases cytokines IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma; can develop into TH1, TH2, TH17, or other TH cells

- TH1: The response stimulated by the release of IL-12 from dendritic cells and macrophages; secretes IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-beta; inhibited by IL-4 and IL-10; provides defense against intracellular infections and fungi

- TH17: The early response to bacterial and fungal infections when IL-23 is released instead of IL-12. Releases IL-17, TNF-alpha, and chemokines

- TH2: The response that occurs in the absence of IL-12 and IFN-gamma; promotes systemic antibody driven response; releases IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 cytokines

- Plasma cells: Permanently differentiated B-cells that secrete antibodies

- Memory B cells: Long-lasting B-cells that are responsive to one particular antigen and become activated with re-exposure to the same antigen
