The presence and extent of regional inguinal LN metastases have been identified as the single most important prognostic indicator in determining long-term survival in men with invasive SCC. This prognosis varies depending on the number of positive LNs, the presence of unilateral or bilateral inguinal extension, and pelvic LN involvement. For this reason, evaluation of the groin and pelvis is essential in the metastatic workup of a penile cancer patient and the clinical exam can be crucial for assessing palpability, a number of inguinal masses, unilateral or bilateral localization and mobility or fixation of inguinal nodes or masses.

Patients with inguinal metastases who are untreated rarely survive two years. Patients with stage I or II cancers, still confined to the penis, at time of diagnosis have a 5-year survival rate of around 85% after surgical management. Stage III and IV cancers have a 5-year survival rate around 59%. If cancer has metastasized to distant parts of the body, the 5-year survival rate is 11%. Numerous studies have looked at the extent of inguinal LN involvement as an indicator of survival. Patients with no inguinal node metastases have an 85-100% five-year cancer-specific survival rate. Patients with a single inguinal LN metastasis have a 79% to 89% 5-year survival rate. Patients with bilateral or multiple inguinal node metastases have a 17% to 60% 5-year survival rate. Patients with pelvic node metastases have a zero to 17% 5-year survival rate.
