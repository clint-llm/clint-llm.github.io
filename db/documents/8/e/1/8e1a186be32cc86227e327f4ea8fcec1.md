The complications associated with tricuspid valve repair are very similar, whether intervention is performed via open repair or transcatheter repair. Mortality of tricuspid valve replacement is 3Â to 4 times higher when compared to another single valve open or percutaneous procedures. Surgical intervention for tricuspid disorders can be associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality, with perioperative mortality reaching up to 10% in selected cases.

- Catheter-related complications to access site -hematoma, arteriotomy, dissection, arteriovenous fistula

- Myocardial infarction due to damage or irritation to the right coronary artery

- Arrhythmias and heart blocks

- Prosthetic valve malfunction

- Heart failure

- Perioperative bleeding and resulting blood products transfusion-related complications

- Drug reactions

- Surgical site infections and/or the valve prosthesis

- Sepsis

- Pulmonary complications - pneumothorax, pneumonia, embolisms

- Renal failure - due to concomitant use of contrast dye

- Stroke
