Blocking the deep peroneal nerve will provide anesthesia to the interdigital cleft between the first and second toes of the foot. While it does not provide a large amount of sensory innervation, it is still important for patients who are undergoing foot or ankle procedures, such as a bunionectomy. The increased prevalence of ultrasound has also allowed easy visualization of the nerve and increased the success rate of onset to ankle block. While blocking the deep peroneal nerve and the other nerves of the ankle during surgery, it has been shown this nerve block can improve outcomes in the patient's pain postoperatively. This nerve block can also be performed successfully using the extensor hallucis brevis musculotendinous junction as an anatomical landmark.
