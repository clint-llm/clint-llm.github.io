The differential diagnoses of inverted urothelial papilloma of the urinary bladder include

- Florid proliferation of Von Brunn nests

- Invasion of Brunn's nest by urothelial carcinoma

- Exophytic papilloma

- Urothelial carcinoma with an inverted (endophytic) pattern of growth

- Papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential

- Cystitis glandularis

- Other rarer differential diagnoses include:  nephrogenic adenoma, paraganglioma, carcinoid tumor, cystitis cystica

Inverted urothelial papilloma may have overlapping gross and histopathologic features. However, urothelial cancer will show focal or diffuse invasive nests of cells with irregular borders and desmoplasia around the nests. Additionally, urothelial cancers may have lymphatic and vascular invasion along with cellular atypia along with nuclear pleomorphism, necrotic changes, and mitoses.

Immunohistochemistry is a useful tool for distinguishing urothelial cancer from inverted urothelial papilloma. Inverted urothelial papillomas will have a low Ki-67 positivity due to the low cellular proliferation, and are CK20 negative, unlike urothelial cancers.
