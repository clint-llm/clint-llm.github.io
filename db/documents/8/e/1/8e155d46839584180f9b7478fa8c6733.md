Since the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approval for nasal sinus use in 2005, balloon sinuplasty (BSP) has continued to grow in popularity among otolaryngologists as a minimally invasive way to treat patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

The description of chronic rhinosinusitis in the literature as the inflammation of nasal mucosa and the surrounding sinuses lasting more than 12 weeks.

Recently, there has been a push to perform BSP under local sedation in an in-office setting, which avoids the use of general anesthesia in patients with concomitant comorbidities and provides cost savings to the patient and the physician.
