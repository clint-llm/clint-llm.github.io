The medial meniscus is a crescent-shaped fibrocartilaginous band that articulates inferiorly with the medial condyle of the tibia and superiorly with the medial condyle of the femur, occupying approximatelyÂ 60% of the contact portion of the medial compartment.

The primary function of the meniscus is to distribute load across the knee joint, which consequently decreases the stress placed on the joint.
