Because of the wide array of chemicals that workers may be exposed to on the job, it may be difficult to determine the offending chemical and subsequent treatment strategies. A recent analysis of 12 professions highlighted this by reporting that as many as 685 different disinfectants are not made for human use, with 152 active ingredients and 763 insecticides with 97 active ingredients used in the industry currently.

Two other analyses showed that chemical exposures had been reported with 200 to 308 different chemicals across multiple professions.

Past analyses have shown that the most common chemical exposures, most of which were in the workplace, were corrosive liquids and flammable gases.

Certain hospital personnel is more likely to work with these chemicals than others, so exposure to chemicals commonly used within their job description should be higher on the differential diagnosis. Additionally, just as employees working with radiation sources like fluoroscopy must monitor their exposure, steps should be taken to monitor both individual exposure and ambient levels to chemicals of interest to reduce overall chemical exposure.

Secondary exposure is a topic of concern when treating patients with chemical exposures. A recent analysis of over 120,000 chemical incidents showed that only nine secondary exposure cases were experienced by hospital personnel when treating a patient with chemical exposure.Â The most common mechanism of secondary exposure was inhalation. They concluded that standard personal protective equipment, including gloves and a gown, is sufficient to protect hospital personnel when treating these patients. Further equipment is only necessary when treating highly toxic like sarin.

One of the most underrepresented problems associated with hazardous chemical exposure is the long-term sequelae. People exposed to hazardous chemicals may not present with acute health problems and therefore may not be further concerned. However, the pathogenesis of disease states like cancer may take many years to develop after the exposure and depend on the nature and duration of the exposure. For people who have acute exposure to a hazardous chemical like an accidental spill or inhalation, long-term monitoring should be performed to identify any signs of disease.
