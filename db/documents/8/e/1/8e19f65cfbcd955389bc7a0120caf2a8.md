Many patients will present with a need for a medical forensic examination with the collection of evidence. Many professionals will be involved in the care of these patients; clinicians, nurses, advanced practice nurses, forensic nurse examiners, and other healthcare providers. The healthcare provider should have advanced training in the care and overall assessment of the patient. Ongoing education and training are important due to the ever-changing advances in treatment and technology and can be achieved by attending conferences, reviewing published research studies, and using current guidelines and recommendations. Each healthcare provider is an important member of the team to accomplish the best outcome for the patient and assist with future follow-up care and resources. Many patients will have law enforcement involved for investigative purposes and possible legal proceedings. The healthcare provider may be required to testify in a court of law at a later date, usually years later. A thorough examination must be performed, documentation completed, and the evidence collected at the time of the examination must be complete, accurate, and concise.
