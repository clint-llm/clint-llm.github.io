Patients should receive education regarding the limitations of screening and appropriate follow-up intervals. Annual well-woman exams should be recommended even if cervical cancer screening is not performed at the visit.

Protection from cervical cancer is the primary goal of screening. However, patients should receive counsel about other methods of prevention. Patients should be counseled on the risks factors, smoking cessation, safe sex practice to limit exposure to sexually transmitted infections and HPV vaccination. Administration of the HPV vaccine will not affect the frequency of screening and patient should be educated to return for age-based screening.
