Charcot is a rare but serious complication of peripheral neuropathy that can mimic many other disease processes common in the foot of a patient with diabetes. Correctly diagnosing Charcot osteoarthropathy is imperative due to the risk of permanent foot deformity that can be at risk for ulceration and amputation. For the acute phase, treatment endorses non-weight bearing with immobilization of the affected limb to prevent permanent deformity as the disease progresses through the Eichenholtz stages. However, total non-weight bearing and immobilization cannot always be achieved. Common reasons for nonadherence include the length of time required for non-weight bearing, lack of physical ability, and employment restrictions. Alternative treatment options to total non-weight bearing include the administration of offloading ambulating devices. Many offloading ambulating devices exist, such as the controlled ankle motion walker with an offloading insole, total contact cast, or assistive devices like knee scooters.
