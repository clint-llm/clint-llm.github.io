As this test is not without procedural morbidity, patients should be screened for suitability by the performing clinician on a case-by-case basis. The patients’ co-morbidities and general fitness to undergo an invasive procedure should be factored into assessment alongside specific contra-indications. Doing this reduces procedure-related morbidity and improves patient outcomes. Contraindications to EBUS are similar to fibreoptic bronchoscopy and include:

- Myocardial infarction within the previous four weeks. Known severe coronary artery disease should prompt discussion with a cardiologist.

- Uncorrected deranged physiological parameters, i.e., significant hypoxia, hypotension, or tachycardia/bradycardia, as the introduction of the scope of delivery of sedative medications and a topical anesthetic may destabilize the patient.

- Coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis (values vary by both operator and the clinical context due to a lack of consensus agreement, but an international normalized ratio <1.5 or a platelet count >50,000/ml is generally recommended).

- Patient factors such as inability to give informed consent, drug sensitivity to anesthetic medications, and dental or spinal issues which would prevent safely passing the scope should be considered.
