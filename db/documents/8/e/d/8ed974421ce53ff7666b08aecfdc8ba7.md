Smoking is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the human population and is one of the most modifiable risk factors for preventing human disease. More than 400,000 individuals die prematurely each year in the United States from cigarette use. This statistic represents almost one of every five deaths in the United States. The major diseases caused by cigarette smoking include premature atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, aortic aneurysms, chronic airway obstruction, malignancies, and sudden infant death syndrome. It is a preventable risk factor that clinicians can modify through counseling and pharmacotherapy to decrease the burden of disease caused by smoking impacting the human population. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring, of varenicline so providers can direct patient smoking cessation therapy as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of varenicline.
- Describe the potential adverse effects associated with varenicline therapy.
- Review other factors that can increase the success of varenicline therapy.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who can benefit from therapy with varenicline.
