In the United States, cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of mortality, morbidity, and increased healthcare cost. According to the AHA, in 2018, 16.5 million people over 20 years of age have coronary artery disease. Mortality rates due to ischemic heart diseases are decreasing in developed countries like the United States and the United Kingdom. This decline is attributable to increased awareness of disease prevention. Guidelines are available for primary and secondary prevention and are actively implemented; however, there are still some barriers in different aspects of implementation â€” awareness among healthcare providers critical and part of an ongoing process to improve cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. This activity addresses the evaluation and treatment of coronary artery disease and highlights the role of the healthcare team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the risk factors associated with coronary artery diseases. 
- Outline the pathophysiology of coronary artery diseases. 
- Explain the modifiable factors for coronary artery disease. 
- Review the role of the interprofessional team in improving outcomes for patients either with or at risk for coronary artery disease.
