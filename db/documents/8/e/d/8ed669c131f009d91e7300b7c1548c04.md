While the AJCC does not offer a formal TNM staging system for acoustic schwannomas, the Koos grading system has been utilized. It is based largely on the extracanilicular extension and degree of brainstem compression. An alternative system is the Hanover Grading system which uses a T stage with a similar classification to Koos. Both the Koos and Hanover systems have been validated in reliability studies.
