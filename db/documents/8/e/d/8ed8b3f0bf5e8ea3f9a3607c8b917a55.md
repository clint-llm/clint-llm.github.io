The incidence of ileus varies greatly, often dependent upon the type of surgery, the amount of bowel manipulation, and preoperative comorbidities. Lower abdominal surgery, especially with large open incisions and increased intestinal manipulation, is associated with a higher risk of ileus. On the contrary, laparoscopic surgery with minimal bowel manipulation, such as in a cholecystectomy, confers a lower risk. The literature shows about a 10-20% chance of ileus occurring depending on the procedure.
