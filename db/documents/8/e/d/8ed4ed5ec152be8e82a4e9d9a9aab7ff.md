Liver transplantation is indicated in acute and chronic end-stage liver disease where medical therapy has failed. Patients who develop hepatic decompensation, such as hepatic encephalopathy, variceal hemorrhage, or ascites, should receive medical therapy, and a comprehensive liver transplantation evaluation should be initiated in potential liver transplantation candidates.

The Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD score), initially developed to predict survival after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure, was found to predict survival among patients with cirrhosis. It was well recognized as a tool to prioritize organ allocation for liver transplantation.

**Specific Indications for Liver Transplantation**

- **Graft failure**is an important indication for liver transplantation. Hyperacute rejection causing hepatic artery thrombosis, and graft failure occurs immediately in the post-operative phase. Although re-transplantation can be done, the outcomes are worse than the primary transplant.

- **Chronic hepatitis C**resulting in cirrhosis was the most common indication for liver transplantation until the year 2015. Decompensated cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C infection became the third most common indication for liver transplantation since 2016, replaced by alcohol-related liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

- **Hepatitis B**infection previously resulted in increasing numbers of chronic liver disease, but with the use of Hepatitis B Immunoglobulins (HBIG) and the introduction of antivirals, hepatitis B has resulted in decreased rates of liver transplantation.

- **Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)**can lead to liver cirrhosis and failure, even with long-term corticosteroids and immunosuppression therapy. Liver transplantation is indicated in acute liver failure secondary to autoimmune hepatitis or cases of chronic decompensated cirrhosis due to autoimmune hepatitis.

- **Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC**) patients with decompensated cirrhosis or severe pruritis refractory to other medical interventions require liver transplantation. Over the years, the need for liver transplantation has decreased with the use of Ursodeoxycholic acid to treat PBC, which slows disease progression.

- **Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC);**since there is no effective medical therapy for PSC, liver transplantation is considered an effective treatment modality among patients with the decompensated disease or those who develop perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (within certain criteria) or recurrent bouts of bacterial cholangitis.

- **Alcohol-related liver disease**is currently the most common indication for liver transplantation.

- **Acute liver failure (ALF)**patients rapidly deteriorate and develop severe liver dysfunction, elevated bilirubin, aminotransferases, encephalopathy, and coagulopathy (INR above 1.5). Acetaminophen is responsible for almost half the cases of ALF in the United States.
- ICU admission
- On ventilatory support
- Requiring hemodialysis
- Elevated INR above 2
- Development of hepatic encephalopathy within a period of 8 weeks from the onset of symptoms
- It is important to note that compared to liver transplantation due to chronic disease, the one-year survival in liver transplantation due to ALF is worse, but with higher survival rates following the first year.

- Patients with**hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)**must meet the Milan criteria to be eligible for liver transplantation:
- One tumor less than 5 cm in diameter, or 3 tumors each having a diameter less than 3 cm that must be confirmed by CT or MRI
- Without any metastasis documented by chest CT and bone scan
- Absence of major vessel involvement
- An unresectable tumor
- Patients with HCC usually have a normal liver function, and their MELD score is usually normal or low. Therefore they undergo MELD exception to get a score that allows them to be prioritized on the waiting list for liver transplantation.

- Liver transplantation is considered in the management of patients with early-stage **cholangiocarcinoma**with nonresectable perihilar lesions (<3 cm in diameter) or underlying parenchymal liver disease such as PSC with cirrhosis. In addition to the tumor criteria, liver transplantation should be done in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens to ensure higher survival rates than liver transplantation done previously without neoadjuvant therapy.

- **Nonalcoholic steatoHepatitis (NASH)**is considered among the top indications for liver transplantation.

- Liver transplantation is indicated in patients with acute liver failure due to **Wilson disease**or in cases of decompensated cirrhosis that failed all medical therapies.

- Other cirrhosis-related complications such as hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension are also indications for liver transplantation.

- **Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency**is usually diagnosed in adults without any previous history of liver disease. Liver transplantation is considered the main and only treatment modality for decompensated liver disease secondary to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

- Liver transplant is indicated in decompensated cirrhosis or in patients with HCC who have **hereditary hemochromatosis (HH)**. Cirrhosis, due to HH, accounts for the highest risk of developing HCC among all other causes of cirrhosis.

- Liver transplant has proven effective in**familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP)**due to a mutation in the transthyretin gene. It is most effective in patients less than 50 years because liver transplantation neither improves nor reverses neurological symptoms but rather prevents disease progression.

- **Primary hyperoxaluria type I**is an autosomal recessive defect that results in a deficiency of alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase in the liver, impairing the metabolism of glyoxylate in the liver and leads to overproduction of oxalate.

- **Other metabolic liver diseases**that have indications for liver transplantation include cystic fibrosis and glycogen storage diseases.
