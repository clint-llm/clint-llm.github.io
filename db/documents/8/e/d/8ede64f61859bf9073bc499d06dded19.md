An interprofessional healthcare team is vital to the prompt recognition of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.Â The nursing staff is critical for recognizing reactions during a blood transfusion, which, if acted on, can prevent TRALI. Pharmacists can have an active role in those being prescribed opioids and salicylates and can recognize the rare adverse effects of these drugs as the development of pulmonary edema. ARDS can more promptly be diagnosed in the ICU with the care team cooperation between the intensive care physician, respiratory therapy, and nursing staff. Interprofessional communication at all levels plays a key role in case management and directing optimal outcomes. [Level 5]
