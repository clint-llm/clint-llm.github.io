Linezolid is available in tablets, suspension, and injection. The dosage of intravenous (IV) and tablet formulations are interchangeable (there is no need to make dose adjustments). Renal dosing is not required. Invert gently to mix before administration, and do not vigorously shake oral suspension. Administer without regard to meals (food delays the rate but not the extent of oral absorption).

Administer linezolid IV infusion over 30 to 120 minutes. Do not mix or infuse with other medications. When using the same IV line for sequential infusion, flush the line with D5W, normal saline, or lactated Ringer's solution before and after infusing linezolid. The yellow color of the injection may intensify with time without affecting potency.

Depending on the indication, the recommended dose is between 400 and 600 mg IV or orally every 12 hours for 10 to 28 days.

Absorption is rapid and extensive. Linezolid has excellent tissue penetration into the lungs and central nervous system and exhibits 100% oral bioavailability.

Linezolid use may result in a suboptimal clinical response when treating organisms with a MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) of 4 mcg/ml or greater and warrants a complete ID re-assessment and change in drug therapy.
