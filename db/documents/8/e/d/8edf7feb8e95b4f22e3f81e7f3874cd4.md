Skin biopsy is an important diagnostic procedure that is commonlyÂ performed in dermatology practice.

Biopsies can be categorized as incisional, in which only a portion of a lesion is sampled, or excisional in which the physician removes all of the visible lesion. An incisional biopsy can be performed as a shave, scissor, curettage, or punch specimen. Excisional biopsy is usually done with a full-thickness scalpel excision or with a deeper oblique (shave or scoop) excision.
