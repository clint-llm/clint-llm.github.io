Colonization and infection in neonates largely correlate with maternal colonization at the time of delivery. Vertical transmission from colonized mothers to their neonates occurs in approximately 41% to 72% of cases (mean, approximately 50%). However, about 1% to 12% of colonized infants (mean, 5%) are born to non-colonized mothers.

Before the widespread use of intrapartum prophylactic antibiotics, reported attack rates of early-onset neonatal GBS infections ranged from 1.8 to 4.0 per 1000 live births. Early-onset disease (onset within the first six days of life) accounted for approximately 80% of cases or about 7600 cases annually. Following the 2002 guidelines for universal screening of pregnant women at 35 to 37 weeksâ€™ gestation and administration of prophylactic antibiotics to colonized women, the incidence of early-onset disease has decreased to approximately 0.25 cases per 1000 live births, a finding representing a decline of nearly 85% from 1990.

However, the incidence of late-onset disease (onset from 7 through 89 days of life) was not changed through maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, remaining at approximately 0.27 per 1000 live births.

In the past two decades, twofold to fourfold increases in the incidence of GBS disease have occurred in nonpregnant adults, mostly those who have underlying medical conditions or are 65 years of age or older.****Residents of nursing homes have a markedly higher incidence of invasive group B streptococcal disease than community residents.
