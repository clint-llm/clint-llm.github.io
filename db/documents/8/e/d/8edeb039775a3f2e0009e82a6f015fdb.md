Pigment showers and deposits in PDS/ PG are due to mechanical friction and rubbing between the pigmented iris epithelium and the zonules and lens structures. Eyes with PG, which tend to be bilateral, predominately male, myopic, and with a deep AC, are more prone to irido-lenticular touch, reverse pupillary block, and backward posterior bowing.
