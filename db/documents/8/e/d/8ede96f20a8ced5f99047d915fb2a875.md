Gaucher disease is the most common autosomal recessive disease in the Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jewish population with a carrier frequency of 6% compared to 0.7% to 0.8% of the non-Jewish population. Cystic fibrosis (4% carrier frequency) and Tay-Sachs Disease (3.7% carrier frequency) are also common in the Ashkenazi population.

The most common form of Gaucher disease is type 1 which has a very variable phenotype ranging from early childhood symptoms to no symptoms throughout life but typically does not have a neurological component. In contrast to type 1, both type 2 and 3 are rare and do affect the central nervous system. Both type 2 and the perinatal lethal typically result in neonatal death whereas type 3 results in mid to early adulthood death.
