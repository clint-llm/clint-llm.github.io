In the 1950s, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) wereÂ among the first drugs to be utilized as antidepressants in clinical practice.

That said, due to their broad adverse effect profile and multiple drug-drug and drug-food interactions, MAOIs are not first or second-line drugs in the management of depression.

In addition to the indications mentioned above, selective MAO-B inhibitors (MAOBIs) have shown some effectiveness in the symptomatic treatment of mild Parkinson disease (PD) early in its course. Patients with early PD symptoms given MAOBIs show reductions in motor symptoms and a lower need for levodopa without a substantial increase in morbidity or mortality.
