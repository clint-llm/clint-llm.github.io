When there is an error in anticoagulation dosing, the result can be eitherÂ hemorrhage or thrombosis. Hemorrhage is most common in the gastrointestinal tract and can be profuse. Often the site is a prior peptic ulcer, angiodysplasia, or AV malformation. The thrombosis usually results in an ischemic stroke, mesenteric ischemia, or an acutely cold leg. These diagnoses are made from imaging studies, and histopathology is not required to confirm the diagnosis.
