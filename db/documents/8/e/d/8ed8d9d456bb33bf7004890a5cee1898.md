# Introduction

The cingulate cortex is a fascinating area of the human brain that has been the subject of neuroanatomical and therapeutic investigation owing to its role in various functions and pathologies. It is a paired structure that resides within the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere and is perhaps most well-known as part of the limbic system. It is involved in many vital neural circuits, which include other structures such as reward centers, amygdala, lateral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, motor areas, spinal cord, hippocampus, and limbic regions.

# Structure and Function

The cingulate cortex is made up of the cingulate gyrus and the cortical gray matter lining the superior and inferior borders of the cingulate sulcus. As the Latin translation of "cingulate" would suggest, the cingulate gyrus wraps around the corpus callosum like a "belt." It begins beneath the rostrum of the corpus callosum, curves around the genu, and projects above the superior surface of the body of the corpus callosum, reaching its posterior end where it terminates at the isthmus of the cingulate gyrus. The isthmus is continuous inferiorly to the parahippocampal gyrus in the temporal lobe. The cingulate gyrus is separated from the corpus callosum inferiorly by the callosal sulcus and from the superior frontal gyrus superiorly by the cingulate sulcus.

The cingulate cortex divides into four functionally distinct regions: the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), midcingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and retrosplenial cortex.

The PCC houses BA 23, 29, 30, and 31. The thick granular layer IV of the PCC marks a clear histologic distinction from the thin agranular layer IV of the ACC. The PCC consists of the posterior cingulate cortex proper (ventral and dorsal PCC), which is responsible for visuospatial orientation. Although contained within the PCC, the retrosplenial cortex is considered a distinct region of the cingulate cortex. It is implicated in imagination and the formation and consolidation of episodic memory.

The cingulum, or cingulum bundle, is an important white matter tract that connects the orbitofrontal cortex to the temporal pole, nearly forming a near-complete ring that lies beneath the cingulate gyrus

As seen from the extensive neural pathways it shares with other brain regions, the cingulate cortex can be considered, in a sense, a connecting hub of emotions, sensations, and action. Some of these pathways are those involved in motivational processing, which is apparent through the connections with the orbitofrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and insula, which together make up the reward centers of the brain. Also, the cingulate cortex projects pathways to the lateral prefrontal cortex, which is involved in executive control, working memory, and learning. Pathways between the cingulate cortex and motor areas, like the primary and supplementary motor cortices, spinal cord, and frontal eye fields, suggest an important role in motor control. Moreover, the cingulate cortex and frontal and parietal lobes comprise a neural network for orienting attention, and expectedly, injury to any of these areas is known to cause hemineglect. The neural circuits cingulate cortex shares with the hippocampus and amygdala suggest a role in consolidating long-term memories and processing emotionally relevant stimuli, respectively.

# Embryology

During embryonic development, the prosencephalon (forebrain) gives rise to the telencephalon and diencephalon at around week 6. The telencephalon differentiates into the two cerebral hemispheres, which include the cingulate gyrus on their medial surface.

During early life and adolescent development, the functional connectivity of the cingulate cortex undergoes significant adaptive change. Interestingly, it appears that different functions ascribed to this anatomical area mature at different rates, with motor control and simple cognitive controls (e.g., inhibition and attention) maturing in early childhood, in contrast to more complex emotional behaviors such as social cognition, which may mature as late as adolescence.

# Blood Supply and Lymphatics

The anterior cerebral artery supplies the majority of the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere, including the cingulate gyrus. As a direct continuation of the anterior cerebral artery, the pericallosal artery travels within the callosal sulcus and gives off many small cortical branches that supply the rostrum of the cingulate gyrus. The callomarginal artery, the largest branch of the anterior cerebral artery, runs within the cingulate sulcus and supplies the portion of the cingulate gyrus underlying the paracentral lobule. Posteriorly, the precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus receive vascular supply from the precuneal artery, a branch of the pericallosal artery.

# Physiologic Variants

Some of the normal anatomic variations of the cingulate gyrus include a single cingulate sulcus or double parallel cingulate sulci. MRI-volumetric studies on normal brains showed no significant volume asymmetries between the left and right hemispheres, except in the cingulate gyrus, which was larger on the left. Pujol et al. studied the brains of 100 healthy subjects and found larger right ACC to be more frequent in females than males.

# Surgical Considerations

Bilateral anterior cingulotomy is a neurosurgical procedure that can be performed for chronic refractory depression, pain, or obsessive-compulsive disorder. It involves stereotactic ablation of the bilateral anterior cingulate gyri, thus severing the supracallosal fibers of the cingulum.

In the context of the treatment of refractory depression, a better clinical response was observed in patients who had relatively anteriorly placed lesioning of their ACC, in line with neuroimaging studies demonstrating that patients with major depression have anatomical abnormalities compared to the healthy population in the rostral part of the cingulate cortex.

In the context of the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, the target is the dorsal part of the ACC, and better clinical results have been found following lesioning of the superior part of the cingulate cortex here, as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) score.

# Clinical Significance

**Subfalcine Herniation**

Owing to the anatomical organization of the brain within a fixed compartment (the bony cranium) and subdivided by dural reflections (the falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli), it is vulnerable to damage from an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP).

The most common brain herniation syndrome is subfalcine herniation, in which raised ICP forces a cerebral hemisphere to the opposite side of the cranium, forcing the cingulate gyrus beneath the free edge of the falx cerebri.

**Schizophrenia**

Given the complexity of higher cognitive functions and the extensive connections of the cingulate cortex with other brain regions, it is not surprising that it plays a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, a finding which has been confirmed in post-mortem anatomical studies.
