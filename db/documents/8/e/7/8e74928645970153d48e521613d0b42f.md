Repaglinide is an insulin secretagogue, meaning it binds to receptors on pancreatic beta cells and stimulates insulin release. Repaglinide binds to an ATP-dependent potassium channel on beta cells, known as SUR1, bringing about its closure. This mechanism of action is similar to that of the sulfonylureas, and as a result, the concurrent use of these therapies is contraindicated.

Repaglinide demonstrates a concentration-response relationship in the presence of glucose, with a maximal secretory response of approximately 10 nmol/L. Studies suggest repaglinide reduces postprandial glucose in the order of around 5.8 mmol/L and fasting glucose around 3.1 to 3.4 mmol/L.

Repaglinide is rapidly absorbed, with a half-life of fewer than 60 minutes. The fast onset and short duration of action of repaglinide have made it one of the most appropriate therapies for managing postprandial glucose spikes, and as such, it is recommended approximately 30 minutes before an intended meal.

In the body, repaglinide binds to albumin at around 98% concentration and is associated with a more significant reduction in glycated albumin than sulfonylureas.

Repaglinide is inactivated and excreted via the liver, and as such, concomitant use of other therapies associated with liver metabolism should be considered.
