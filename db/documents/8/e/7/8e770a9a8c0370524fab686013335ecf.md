Feeding tubes are tubes mainly inserted into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to provide a patient with a route for enteral nutrition, though they can also be used for decompression of the GI tract. Tubes come in a variety of sizes, lengths, and materials, depending on the longevity of the tube, placement method, and location. When a patient is unable to intake any or adequate caloric nutrition by mouth, severe malnutrition may result, which will ultimately inhibit healing and contribute to critical illness. A feeding tube is an excellent option to provide the patient with enteral nutrition and can be accomplished in many ways.
