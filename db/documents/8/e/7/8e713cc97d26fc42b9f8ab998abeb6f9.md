Two interrelated explanations exist for aplastic anemia: extrinsic immune-mediated suppression of hematopoietic stem cells and intrinsic abnormality of marrow progenitors.

Damaged hematopoietic stem cells mature into self-reactive T-helper cells (T1) that release cytokines interferon-? (IFN?) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to propagate a cytotoxic cascade to kill and suppress other hematopoietic stem cells. The exact antigens T1 cells target are unclear, but one appears to be the glucose phosphate inositol (GPI)-linked protein on cell membranes (the mechanism behind pancytopenia in PNH). Also, the genes for apoptosis and death pathways are upregulated. Moreover, immunosuppressive therapy targeting T-cells leads to a response in two-thirds of patients with idiopathic aplastic anemia, and patients with graft-versus-host disease develop aplasia in the setting of healthy bone marrow progenitors.

In the second theory, stem cells with inherent defects lose the capacity to differentiate and proliferative. Their inability to dedifferentiate can lead to clonal evolution into hematologic neoplasms, for example, myelodysplastic syndrome. This is common in patients with Fanconi anemia. Partial defects in telomeres, the component of DNA intertwined with cell division, lead to premature hematopoietic stem cell exhaustion and marrow aplasia as well. Shortened telomeres are present in cells of half the patients with aplastic anemia.
