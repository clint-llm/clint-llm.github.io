The pineal gland is a small endocrine gland (10Â to 14 mm) located in the midline of the brain, at the superior aspect of the posterior border of the third ventricle. In the coronal view, the gland is located below the splenium of the corpus callosum and above and posterior to the tectum of the midbrain.

The principal cells of the pineal gland are the pinealocytes (pineal parenchymal cells). Multiple pathologies are associated with this region due to the variety of cells and structures located adjacent to the pineal gland. Tumors of the pineal gland are classified into those arising from the pineal parenchyma, germ cell tumors, and lesions arising from adjacent structures.

Important anatomical structures adjacent to the pineal gland include:

- Anteriorly: third ventricle (pineal recess)

- Anterosuperiorly: habenular nuclei

- Superiorly: internal cerebral veins, the vein of Galen (posteriorly), stria medullaris, splenium of the corpus callosum and velum interpositum

- Posteroinferiorly: superior cerebellar cistern

- Inferiorly: superior colliculi of the midbrain

- Anteroinferiorly: posterior commissure
