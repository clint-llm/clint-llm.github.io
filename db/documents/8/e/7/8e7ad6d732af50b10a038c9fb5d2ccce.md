The equipment necessary to perform this regional blockade in a safe and standard monitored environment usually includes labeled premedication drugs, resuscitation supplies easily identifiable, and all the equipment to perform the block readily available ideally in an induction room. It is crucial a well-trained assistant present handle medications, help with the position of the patient, and during the injection of the local anesthetics. This figure should be properly familiar with CPR and resuscitation protocols if it becomes necessary in the block area.

Different monitors are available to decrease the risk of complications related to regional anesthesia, such as intraneural injection or needle-nerve damage. One of them may be an expendable in-line pressure-monitoring mechanism for controlling the pressure while injecting the local anesthetic in the site of the regional block, and it can be documented. Documentation of every stage of this procedure is essential in every institution performing currently regional anesthesia for ensuring an effective and safe practice.
