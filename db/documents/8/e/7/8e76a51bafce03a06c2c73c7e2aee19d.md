While most abortions are straightforward, there are some which are associated with complications, which can be life-threatening. Because of the high morbidity of abortion complications, an interprofessional team that includes an obstetrician, radiologist, general surgeon, urologist, and an infectious disease expert is recommended. All patients who develop an abortion-related complication need to be closely monitored to ensure that there are no missed injuries.

Over the past 3 decades, the mortality rates associated with abortions have significantly dropped in the US. However, outside North America and Europe, septic abortions continue to be associated with high rates of maternal mortality, chiefly because of illegal abortions performed in unsanitary environments. According to the WHO, each year nearly 70,000 women die globally from septic abortions. The risk of septic abortions is markedly increased with advanced gestational age.
