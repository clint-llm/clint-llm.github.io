Patients should be counseled on preventing re-injury by not repeating the same mechanism, which led to the insult initially. The importance of physical rehabilitation should be emphasized to increase the chance of recovery.Â Patients should also be urged to follow up as scheduled to ensure that their treatment plan can be adjusted as necessary, especially in cases where early surgical intervention is warranted. It is also important for patients to continue following up regularly in cases where the prolonged delay to recovery may necessitate late surgical exploration and intervention.
