Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) was considered a very rare disorder 30 years ago, but recent epidemiological studies show an astonishingly high prevalence. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) ranged from 0.1% to 13%, but most studies demonstrated a frequency between 1% and 4%. Moderate to severe OSA has been found in up to 50% of men and 25% of women in the middle-aged population as defined by an apneaâ€“hypopnea index (AHI) greater than or equal to 15. Over the past 30 years, obesity levels have risen dramatically, partly explaining the increase in OSA prevalence.
