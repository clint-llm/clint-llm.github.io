The prognosis of Morel Lavallee lesions depends on various factors. Small acute lesions heal themselves without the requirement of operative management and hence have an excellent prognosis. On the other hand, larger lesions pose as an independent risk factor for postoperative surgical site infection for the associated bony injuries, but they may also dictate the timing of surgical management and the surgical approach chosen for the orthopedic injuries. As the lesions become chronic, the formation of the pseudocapsule prevents reabsorption of the contents, leading to undesirable sequelae providing a poor prognosis.
