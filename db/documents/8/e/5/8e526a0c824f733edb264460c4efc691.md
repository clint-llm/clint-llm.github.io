Mipomersen is a second-generation novel agent identified as an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100). It is indicated in the management of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

**FDA Approved Use**

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves Mipomersen as an adjunct to current lipid-lowering therapy and diet modifications to limit low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB), and non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in patients diagnosed with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).

A combination of therapies may be utilized for patients unable to achieve their target low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels.
