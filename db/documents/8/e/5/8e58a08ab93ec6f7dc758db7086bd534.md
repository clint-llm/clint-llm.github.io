The pathophysiology of muscle cramps is not always clear and depends on the patient's pathological condition. To give an example, in healthy and sporting subjects there is no direct relationship between the depletion of fluids and the alteration of electrolyte balance as a definite cause of cramps.

Despite the depletion of electrolytes during treatment in patients with dialysis, there is no direct relationship between the presence of cramps and dialysis. Despite this, the phenomenon of cramps is very common in this population of patients.
