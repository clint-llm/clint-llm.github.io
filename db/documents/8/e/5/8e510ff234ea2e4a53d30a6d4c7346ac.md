**Surfactant**

Surfactant is a key component within alveoli that prevents end-expiratory collapse by decreasing alveolar surface tension at the air-liquid interface SFTPA, SFTPB, SFTPC, and SFPTD

**GM-CSF**

GM-CSF is a crucial cytokine involved in host defense of pulmonary bacterial, viral, and fungal infections

In 1994, researchers discovered that GM-CSF is important in the pathophysiology of PAP when GM-CSF knock-out mice demonstrated PAP-like disease

**Autoimmune PAP**

GM-CSF levels are normal in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in autoimmune PAP

**Secondary PAP**

In secondary PAP, it is believed that the underlying hematological disease causes either a reduction in the number of alveolar macrophages or a reduction in the functional quality of these macrophages

**Congenital PAP**

In congenital PAP, surfactant accumulation is a consequence of a genetic mutation resulting in dysfunctional GM-CSF receptor activation CSF2RA and CSF2RB respectively CSF2RA have been reported in young children (newborn to 9 years) with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance CSF2RB are less common and have been reported from newborns up to 36 years old SLC7A7 mutations lead to dysfunctional arginine transport and dysfunctional alveolar macrophages SLC7A7 is a target of GM-CSF, which upregulates it, the GM-CSF pathway does not seem to be altered in this disease or lead to PAP

Whatever the inciting factor, all of these pathways lead to the same end: accumulation of lipoproteinaceous material in the alveoli due to dysfunctional clearance by alveolar macrophages or type II epithelial cells.
