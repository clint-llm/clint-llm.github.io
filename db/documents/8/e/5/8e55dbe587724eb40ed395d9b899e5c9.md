Renal angiomyolipomas are rare kidney tumors that account for only 0.3 to 3% of all renal neoplasms.

Renal angiomyolipomas tend to occur in females more than males, possibly due to estrogenic effects.

At least 50 to 75% of patients with tuberous sclerosis will be found to have renal angiomyolipomas.
