Evaluation is done through laboratory studies and imaging studies.

**Laboratory Findings**

- Thyroid Function Tests:  TSH levels are suppressed, and T3 and T4 are elevated.

- Complete Blood Count, Liver Function Tests are required, especially if one plans to start methimazole or PTU (propylthiouracil)

- Antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and antithyroglobulin antibodies

- Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulin

**Imaging Studies**

- Ultrasonography: Ultrasound is used to determine the number of nodules and their sizes. Color Doppler helps in assessing nodule vascularity.

- Thyroid scintigraphy: It is done by nuclear medicine using radioactive iodine-123 or technetium-99m. Plummer disease has a patchy uptake of radioactive substance.

- FNAC: Fine needle aspiration cytology is used to exclude malignancy on cold nodules on thyroid scintigraphy.

- CT and MRI: These investigations give anatomical detail of thyroid enlargement but are not first-line investigations. They are useful in the assessment of retrosternal and recurrent thyroid enlargement.

- Laryngoscopy:****It is used to check the trachea's patency and mobility of vocal cords for medicolegal reasons more than clinical use. It is done or ordered by surgeons to document the presurgery status of vocal cords if surgery is planned.
