Epidurals are useful for surgical anesthesia of thoracic surgery, major intra-abdominal surgery, or spine surgery, granted that muscle relaxation is not needed. This technique may also be for intra-op or post-op pain management. It may decrease the surgical risk and morbidity of certain patient populations, for example, patients with ischemic cardiac disease. It also has been shown to decrease post-op lung complications and increase the intestinal return of function after abdominal surgery.
