Sildenafil is a safe therapeutic option for erectile dysfunction and PAH that has been available on the market for over two decades. Some barriers to successful sildenafil therapy in the treatment of erectile dysfunction include cost and social stigma surrounding erectile dysfunction.

The use of sildenafil in the management of erectile dysfunction can significantly impact patient quality of life. ED is associated with depression, anxiety, and loss of self-esteem. A small placebo-controlled 12-week study performed on 512 men with erectile dysfunction used the Self Esteem and Relationship (SEAR) questionnaire to assess the impact of sildenafil treatment on patients. The trial results revealed that sildenafil had improved the patients' depression, anxiety, and self-esteem.

Current guidelines for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults call for closely coordinated collaboration between the patient's local healthcare team and the providers with expertise in the management of PAH. Sildenafil plays a secondary role as an alternative for patients who demonstrate acute vasoreactivity in WHO functional class II to improve their 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) and those in functional class III to improve 6MWD and improve the functional class.
