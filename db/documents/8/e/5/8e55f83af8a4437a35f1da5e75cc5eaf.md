Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacteria that cause a wide variety of clinical diseases. Infections caused by this pathogen are common both in community-acquired and hospital-acquired settings. The treatment remains challenging due to the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains such as MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus). S. aureus does not normally cause infection on healthy skin, however, if it is allowed to enter the internal tissues or bloodstream, these bacteria may cause a variety of potentially serious infections. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of Staphylococcus infections and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with these diseases.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of S aureus infections.
- Describe the workup of a patient with staphylococcus infection.
- Summarize the treatment options for staphylococcus infections.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to educate patients about hand hygiene to prevent transmission of infection to others.
