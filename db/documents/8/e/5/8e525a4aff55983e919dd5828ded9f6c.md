Atypical ductal hyperplasia is a pathology finding, usually found incidentally on biopsy of the breast. The diagnosis by itself is not a precancerous or cancerous lesion. It is, however, a high-risk lesion, indicating the presence of ADH on pathology flags the patient as one who is fivefold more likely to develop breast carcinoma - in any area of the breasts - in the future. For this reason, the nuance of the cancer risk of the finding of ADH on pathology is more challenging to communicate with the patient.

Regardless of lesion excision, there is still an increased risk to the patient of developing breast carcinoma that will require continued monitoring and screening. The patient may also benefit from tamoxifen therapy as a breast cancer prevention agent, depending on if ER+ and if the patient is suitable for tamoxifen given the side effect profile. (Level I)

It is also crucial that surgeons know the appropriate surgical management of this finding. ADH on core needle biopsy will require needle or seed localized excisional biopsy to rule out nearby breast carcinoma. However, if ADH is found on excisional biopsy to be ADH only - even if margins are positive - the patient is surgically complete. [Level 2]
