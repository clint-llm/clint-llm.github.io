The North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society has released guidelines for the management of midgut neuroendocrine tumors. The guidelines emphasize an interprofessional approach for optimal outcomes. While surgery is the ideal treatment for patients with localized lesions, recent studies reveal that cytoreductive surgery with heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy may improve survival in some patients with metastatic peritoneal disease. Because these tumors have unpredictable behavior, lifelong surveillance is recommended. With expert care, many patients can have a good quality of life or even be cured.
