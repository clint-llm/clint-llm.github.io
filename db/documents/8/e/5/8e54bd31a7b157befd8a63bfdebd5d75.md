Due to the large conspicuous nature of a shark, rarely will there be any diagnostic uncertainty regarding a shark bite. A history of an encounter with the animal will often be communicated by the patient, EMS personnel, or a bystander. In the case of an unwitnessed shark trauma in which a patient is unable to provide any history due to barriers such as altered mental status, and if unable to obtain collateral history, one must consider trauma from other marine lifeforms. Additionally, a provider should consider the potential complications associated with such traumatic injuries. Though not comprehensive, a starting point is listed below:
