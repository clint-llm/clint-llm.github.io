Small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) is a laser refractive surgery that has become increasingly popular for the correction of myopia and myopic astigmatism. SMILE has been associated with similar safety, efficacy, and predictability outcomes as laser in situ keratomileuses (LASIK), with the advantages of increased patient satisfaction and decreased postoperative dry eye. This article reviews the surgical technique, complications, and visual outcomes associated with SMILE, and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo SMILE.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the indications and contraindications for small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE).
- Describe intraoperative techniques during small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) that may reduce the likelihood of postoperative complications.
- Review the various enhancement procedures available following small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE).
- Identify the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to maximize visual outcomes and satisfaction of patients undergoing small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE).
