Patient education entails both preventative measures as well as early identification of signs and symptoms.

Though there is no vaccine currently available for La Crosse encephalitis, there are certain measures that can be implemented to help reduce the risk of exposure. In endemic areas such as Midwestern states, increased outdoor activity in the summer can put patients at increased risk of exposure. Methods, including the use of insect repellants, protective clothing with long sleeves, and pants, have shown to be effective in reducing the risk of exposure. Furthermore, to avoid the risk of exposure to mosquitoes at home, screened windows, proper ventilation, and prompt discarding of waste materials may be considered.

Patients and especially parents of young children should be made aware of maintaining a high index of suspicion for La Crosse encephalitisÂ when symptoms such as confusion, headaches, or fever develop after recent exposure to mosquito bites. Even in the absence of known mosquito bites, recent travel and outdoor exposure to endemic areas such as midwestern states should raise suspicion for La Crosse encephalitis, and the development of symptoms should prompt medical evaluation.
