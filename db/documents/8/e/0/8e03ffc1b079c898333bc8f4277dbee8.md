Myopic foveoschisis, also known as myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) or myopic macular schisis, is a relatively rare entity that affects eyes with pathological myopia (-6.00 diopters or more of myopia).

Foveoschisis was first described by Takano and Kishi in 1999, as aÂ split in the layers of retina at the fovea, in eyes with posterior staphyloma.
