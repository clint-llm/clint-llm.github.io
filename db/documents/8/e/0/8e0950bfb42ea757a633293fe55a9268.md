Vaginal delivery is a major and ubiquitous procedure that can be associated with serious morbidities and potential mortality to the mother and the neonate due to a number of intrapartum and postpartum complications related to the procedure. Maternal complications include, but are not limited to, placental abruption, uterine rupture, postpartum hemorrhage, endometritis, amniotic fluid embolism, and neonatal complications include sepsis, meningitis, shoulder dystocia, and brachial plexus injuries. Responsibilities of the healthcare team include minimizing these complications via proactive management of the patient during vaginal delivery.

While some women opt for home births, pregnant women are unable to confirm the rupture of membranes, check for cervical dilation or effacement, and the healthcare team's goal is to ensure safe progression through labor and to lead to the successful delivery of the baby. Nurses and midwives are needed to help the patient get ready and motivate her through labor, and even facilitate the delivery of the baby, physicians are responsible for monitoring the fetal and maternal well-being while being cognizant of possible complications and treating those.

A collaborative effort between the patient, her support system, the nurses, technicians, and physicians is required for successful vaginal delivery to minimize morbidity and mortality.
