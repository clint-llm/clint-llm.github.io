Uveitis glaucoma hyphema (UGH) syndrome is a relatively rare clinical condition characterized by chronic postoperative inflammation, high intraocular pressure, and hemorrhage in the anterior chamber in an eye that has undergone cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. The condition was described in association with the closed-loop anterior chamber intraocular lenses, but the condition has also been described in eyes with modern intraocular lenses. The cause of inflammation is usually the IOL causing irritation to the iris and other intraocular structures. This activity reviews the cause and mechanisms of the development of UGH syndrome, with a detailed review of required medical and surgical management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of UGH syndrome.
- Review the clinical features found in the evaluation of UGH syndrome.
- Summarize the different management options of UGH syndrome.
- Outline the role of interprofessional collaboration to improve the outcomes in UGH syndrome.
