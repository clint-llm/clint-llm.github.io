The liver is grossly black in appearance and on light microscopy; the architecture of the liver is normal, but there is the accumulation of dark, coarsely granular pigment in the centrilobular hepatocytes; this feature is not seen in Rotor syndrome. On electron microscopy, the pigment appears to be within the lysosomes. Based upon the pigment's histochemical staining and physicochemical properties, it appears thatÂ it is related to melanin.
