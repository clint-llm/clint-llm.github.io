Celecoxib has numerous indications, both FDA approved, and non-FDA approved.

The FDA recommends celecoxib and other NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), along with acetaminophen, as first-line analgesics for patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Celecoxib also has an FDA indication for the management of acute pain in adult women and primary dysmenorrhea. Furthermore, the FDA also recommends using celecoxib as an adjunct therapy in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis to reduce the number of colorectal polyps.

Off-label, celecoxib can be used for a wide variety of musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions, including ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and gout. It is also being used increasingly in hospital protocols as part of a multimodal perioperative pain management regimen, frequently given pre-operatively along with adjunct pain medications, including acetaminophen and/or pregabalin.
