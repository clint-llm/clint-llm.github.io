Vertigo is a common presenting complaint in primary care and emergency departments. It is a symptom of vestibular dysfunction and has been described as a sensation of motion, most commonly rotational motion. It is important to differentiate vertiginous symptoms from other forms of dizziness, such as lightheadedness, which is most often associated with presyncope. This activity describes the evaluation and management of vertigo and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.
