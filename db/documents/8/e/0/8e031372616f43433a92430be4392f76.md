The normal swallowing mechanism includes laryngeal elevation, posterior deflection of the epiglottis, inhibition of respiration, and closure of the vocal cords to prevent aspiration.

The thyrohyoid membrane connects the thyroid cartilage to the hyoid bone and facilitates the superior movement of the larynx during swallowing. It is separated from the hyoid body by a bursa that facilitates this upward movement during swallowing.

The thyrohyoid membrane also provides cranial support and suspension.
