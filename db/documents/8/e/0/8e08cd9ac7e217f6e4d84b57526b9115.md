Neuroanatomically, the amygdala is classically associated with provoking a fear response when stimulated. The amygdala and other fear-related neurocircuitry may share a similar neuroanatomy to anxiety neurocircuitry.

The activation of fear neurocircuitry, with presumed anxiety neurocircuitry overlap, involves the release of various neurochemicals that lead to sympathetic stimulation. Classically characterized as a "fight-or-flight" reaction, this sympathetic response evolved to be adaptive and for a prompt behavioral response to avoid actual or perceived danger.
