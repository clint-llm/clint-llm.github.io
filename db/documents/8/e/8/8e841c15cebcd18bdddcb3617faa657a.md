Currently, no objective tests exist to diagnose exploding head syndrome. Diagnosis is on clinical grounds based on the ICSD-3 criteria.

Polysomnography:

- Normal sleep duration and architecture.

- Events are most apt to occur during the transition from wake to N1 and N1 to wake, but research has also documented it during awakenings from N2.

- In one study, despite the perception of sleeping, patients had predominantly alpha waves during events with interspersed theta activity.

- No epileptiform activity.

- One study found additional oscillatory activity co-occurring with the alpha waves during events, but differing in source and frequency.
