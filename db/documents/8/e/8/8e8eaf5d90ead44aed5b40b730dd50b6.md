Mural thrombi with myxoid stroma is a major differential diagnosis for atrial myxoma. The two conditions share a similar histopathological appearance, which makes immunohistochemistry testing unhelpful. The calretinin marker, which is specific for myxomas, can help differentiate them from mural myxoid thrombi.
