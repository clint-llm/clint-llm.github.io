The embryologic formation of the mitral valve is not well understood. It appears that the development of the most rudimentary valve starts after the tube heart has just developed after the second week of gestation.

The heart develops myocardial and endothelial layers that form an extracellular matrix. At the end of week 4 of fetal life, the extracellular matrix forms the basic four chambers, and by week 5, the outer part of the myocardial layer is compacted to form trabecular structures that will become the left ventricle. At this time,Â  the common atrioventricular canal and the cardiac cushions (lateral, superior, and inferior) can be detected.

At week 5 of fetal life, the inferior and superior cushions fuse to divide into two portions, left and right, the common atrioventricular canal. When the superior and inferior cushion are fused, the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve forms and the left lateral cushions form the posterior leaflet.

The left ventricle trabecular bridges develop between weeks 8 to 10, and the lateral and medial papillary muscles are formed by week 10 and are observable in the left ventricle cavity, both muscles are attached to leaflet forming cushions. Between week 11 through week 13, papillary muscled continue to grow and develop chordae. Mitral valve apparatus (leaflets, chordae, and papillary muscles) complete development by week 15 and keep growing until all the demands of the organism are complete.
