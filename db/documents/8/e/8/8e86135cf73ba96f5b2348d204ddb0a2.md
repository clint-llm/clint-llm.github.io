Untreated, eumycetoma shows a slow but inevitable progression. When this condition is not recognized early or treatment is not available or not affordable; initially, painless eumycetomas can progress to limb destruction and amputation. Longer duration of therapy and lack of relapse in patient history are positive prognostic factors in studies that reviewed multiple cases of eumycetomas. Size of mycetomas from 5Â to 10 cm or > 10 cm, using a combination of medical and surgical treatment were significant predictors of a good outcome.
