# Continuing Education Activity

One of the most common inherited disorders affecting connective tissue, Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant condition with a reported incidence of 1 in 3000 to 5000 individuals. There is a broad range of clinical severity associated with MFS, ranging from isolated features of MFS to neonatal presentation of severe and rapidly progressive disease involving multiple organ systems. The syndrome is associated with classic ocular, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal abnormalities, although involvement of the lung, skin, and central nervous system may also occur. Decreased life expectancy occurs primarily due to aortic complications. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of Marfan syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its evaluation and management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Marfan syndrome.
- Review the cardiovascular alterations in Marfan syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment options in patients with Marfan syndrome.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by Marfan syndrome.

# Introduction

One of the most common inherited disorders affecting connective tissue, Marfan syndrome (MFS), is an autosomal dominant condition with a reported incidence of 1 in 3000 to 5000 individuals.FBN1 gene of chromosome 15, which produces fibrillin, a connective tissue protein.

The patients with MFS display multiple deformities of the skeleton including dolichostenomelia (long limbs compared to trunk), arachnodactyly (abnormally long and thin digits), thoracolumbar scoliosis, and pectus deformities (excavatum and carinatum).

# Etiology

Although Marfan syndrome (MFS) has an autosomal dominant inheritance, rare case reports have described recessive fibrillin 1 gene (FBN1) mutations.(FBN1) encoding the connective tissue protein fibrillin-1.FBN1 is a large gene (65 exons) located at chromosome 15q-21.1. Fibrillin-1 is a matrix glycoprotein that is the main constituent of elastic fibers.FBN1 is identifiable, likely due to complete allele deletion or altered regulation of the FBN1 gene. In patients with atypical presentations reminiscent of MFS, a mutation in a gene encoding for transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TGFBR) may be the cause. Some individuals with TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 mutations have clinical features consistent with MFS, while others have features of one of two other syndromes: Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) or familial thoracic aortic aneurysm (FTAA) syndrome.

# Epidemiology

Approximately 1 in every 3000 to 5000 individuals is affected.

# Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of aortic dilatation in Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a complicated process. Fibrillin-1 is a regulator of TGF-beta bioavailability, which in turn leads to inflammation, fibrosis, and activation of specific matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMP-2 and MMP-9.

# Histopathology

Histologic features of the medial layer of the aortic root in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) include cystic medial necrosis, fibrosis, and loss of smooth muscle cells.

# History and Physical

History and physical for patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) encompass various organ systems. Of primary concern is cardiac pathology. Aortic root disease, leading to aortic regurgitation, aneurysmal dilatation, and dissection, is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in MFS, in up to 60% to 80% of patients.

**Revised Criteria for Patients with MFS**

- Aortic root dilatation

- Family history of aortic root dilatation

- FBN1 mutation previously associated with aortic root dilatation

Dilatation may also involve other segments of the thoracic aorta, the abdominal aorta, the root of the pulmonary artery, or even the carotid and intracranial arteries, although this is much less frequent than observed in LDS.

As recommended in the 2010 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/American Association for Thoracic Surgery (ACC/AHA/AATS) thoracic aorta guidelines, echocardiography is recommended at initial diagnosis and six months to assess the aortic root and ascending aorta in patients with Marfan syndrome.

Aortic dissection and rupture are preventable in patients with MFS by replacement of the ascending aorta. Prophylactic surgery is recommended when the diameter of the ascending aorta at the level of the aortic sinuses reaches 5.0 cm. Patients with an aortic diameter of less than 2.75 cm/m2 are considered to be at low risk of dissection, those with 2.75 to 4.24 cm/m2  are at moderate risk, and those with greater than 4.25 cm/m2 are at high risk. A family history of dissection, increased rate of aortic dilation (greater than 2 mm per year), severe aortic valve regurgitation with left ventricular dilation, and relative feasibility of aortic valve-sparing surgery are also indicators for early surgical intervention.

Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is identified in 40% to 54% of patients with MFS.

Patients with Marfan syndrome have excess linear growth of the long bones and joint laxity. Some have reduced joint mobility, particularly of the elbow and digits. Individuals with MFS are taller than the general population.

Patients present with findings diagnostic for scoliosis, including a vertical difference of equal to 1.5 cm between the ribs of the left and right hemithorax, and a Cobb angle of at least 20 degrees. If scoliosis is absent, exaggerated kyphotic thoracolumbar spinal curvature can be taken into account to aid in the diagnosis of MFS. Radiographic findings of MFS scoliosis are indistinguishable from those of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Scoliosis associated with MFS is less responsive to a brace; therefore, a brace is only utilized in skeletally immature patients with scoliotic curves less than 25 degrees.

An acetabular protrusion, or protrusio acetabuli, can be diagnosed by the medial protrusion of the acetabulum equal to 3 mm beyond the ilio-ischial (Kohler) line. This reflects one of the main causes of osteoarthritis in patients with MFS. Degeneration of the hip joint is secondary to ligamentous laxity combined with this bony abnormality. Thakkar et al.

Dural ectasia results from enlargement of the spinal canal secondary to vertebral bone enlargement, most commonly in the lumbosacral region.

Patients with MFS develop lung bullae secondary to emphysematous pulmonary changes predominantly in the upper lobes, predisposing them to spontaneous pneumothorax. Patients may exhibit skin striae, or striae atrophicae in MFS, owing to the disease as long as they are not associated with pronounced weight loss or pregnancy. Recurrent or incisional herniae and a high arched palate may occur but are not included in the systemic score since these features are considered nonspecific clinically.

# Evaluation

In 1996, criteria for the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome (MFS) were originally proposed, known as Ghent nosology. These criteria relied on major and minor clinical manifestations of the syndrome. Aortic root dilatation and ectopia lentis are cardinal features of the disease, and other systemic features involving the skeletal and cardiovascular organ systems, ocular, and vertebral anomalies support the diagnosis. Major criteria included: ectopia lentis, aortic root dilatation involving the sinuses of Valsalva or aortic dissection, and lumbosacral dural ectasia by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, family or genetic history, and four of eight typical skeletal manifestations. These criteria underwent revision in 2010 due to various limitations, including insufficient validation, limited applicability to children, and an inability to exclude syndromes such as LDS and SGS. The 2010 revised Ghent nosology puts greater weight on aortic root dilatation/dissection and ectopia lentis as the cardinal clinical features of MFS and testing for mutations in FBN1.

**Systemic Score**

The revised Ghent nosology includes the following scoring system for systemic features

- Wrist and thumb sign: 3 points

- Wrist or thumb sign: 1 point

- Pectus carinatum deformity: 2 points

- Pectus excavatum or chest asymmetry: 1 point

- Hindfoot deformity: 2 points

- Plain pes planus: 1 point

- Pneumothorax: 2 points

- Dural ectasia: 2 points

- Protrusio acetabuli: 2 points

- Reduced upper segment/lower segment ratio and increased arm span/height and no severe scoliosis: 1 point

- Scoliosis or thoracolumbar kyphosis: 1 point

- Reduced elbow extension (equal to 170 degrees with full extension): 1 point

- At a minimum, 3 of the following five features: Dolichocephaly (reduced cephalic index or head width/length ratio), enophthalmos, down-slanting palpebral fissures, malar hypoplasia, retrognathia): 1 point

- Skin striae: 1 point

- Myopia greater than 3 diopters: 1 point

- Mitral valve prolapse: 1 point

- A systemic score equal to 7 indicates significant systemic involvement.

In patients with no family history of MFS, the presence of one of any of the following criteria is diagnostic for MFS:

- Aortic criterion (aortic root dissection or diameter Z equal to 2) and ectopia lentis*

- Aortic criterion (aortic root dissection or diameter Z equal to 2) and a causal FBN1 mutation

- Aortic criterion (aortic diameter Z equal to 2 or aortic root dissection) and a systemic score equal to 7*

- Ectopia lentis and an identified causal FBN1 mutation in an individual with an aortic aneurysm

In patients with a family history of MFS, the presence of one of any of the following criteria is diagnostic for MFS:

- Ectopia lentis

- A systemic score equal to  7 points*

- Aortic criterion (aortic diameter Z equal to 3 below 20 years old, Z equal to 2 above 20 years, or aortic root dissection)*

For criteria with an asterisk (*), the diagnosis of MFS can be made only in the absence of discriminating features of Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, or vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and after TGFBR1/2, collagen biochemistry, or COL3A1 testing if indicated. Later data suggest that additional gene mutations should also be excluded, including those in SMAD3, TGFB2, and SKI.

The revised Ghent nosology recommends the following categories for individuals younger than 20 years old with features of MFS who do not meet diagnostic criteria for MFS:

- Nonspecific connective tissue disorder applies if the systemic score is less than 7 or aortic root measurements are borderline (Z less than 3) in the absence of an FBN1 mutation.

- Potential MFS applies if an FBN1 mutation is identified in a sporadic or familial case, but the aortic root Z-score is less than 3.

# Treatment / Management

The use of beta-blockers, noninvasive monitoring, restriction of vigorous physical exercise, and elective repair of the aorta has a greatly improved prognosis. In 1968, Bentall and De Bono introduced the Bentall procedure as the standard surgical approach for patients with MFS. A polyethylene conduit is attached to a mechanical aortic valve, which then replaces the dilated ascending aorta and aortic root.

Patients require lifelong anticoagulation secondary to mechanical valve replacement. For patients in whom anticoagulation is not the recommendation, valve-sparing techniques have been adopted, including the Yacoub technique and the valve reimplantation or David technique. With the Yacoub technique, the sinuses of Valsalva undergo resection and replacement with a vascular graft and coronary artery reimplantation; optimal patients have sinus or aortic dilation without annular dilation. The David technique involves reimplantation of the native aortic valve into the graft and is for patients with annular involvement.

The 2010 ACC/AHA/AATS guidelines for the thoracic aortic disease include recommendations for MFS. Patients should have echocardiography performed at the time of diagnosis and six months later to determine aortic root and ascending aortic diameters, as well as their rate of growth.

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the primary modality in the diagnosis of MFS, although transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is utilized in situations of suspected dissection to measure the maximal dimension of the aortic root with the parasternal long-axis view. The leading-edge-to-leading-edge technique in diastole is implemented in adults, while the inner-edge-to-inner-edge technique in systole, is utilized among pediatric cardiologists. For MFS, aortic diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva is the key measurement since this is at greatest risk for aortic dissection, and monitoring is via echocardiography. A greater length of aortic dilation is associated with a worse prognosis.

In a retrospective analysis of 140 patients with MFS with FBN1 mutations who had undergone routine thoracoabdominal CT or MRI as part of their follow-up, about one-third had incidental findings of peripheral vascular aneurysms, with 55% of these patients requiring intervention.

When ascending aortic dimensions are stable, and there is no identified aortic disease, cross-sectional imaging is repeated every three to five years and prior to elective operation, and annually if the aortic diameter is less than 45 mm. However, if the aortic diameter is 45 mm or is enlarging, more frequent imaging is suggested, up to twice annually, and may indicate the need for surgery. More frequent imaging is also prudent if the aortic diameter shows a rapid change (equal to 0.5 cm per year) or if the heart or valve function is circumspect.

As noted in the 2010 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/American Association for Thoracic Surgery (ACC/AHA/AATS) thoracic aorta guidelines, beta-blockers are recommended in adults with MFS and aortic aneurysm to lower the rate of aortic dilatation.

Beta-blocker therapy is also recommended for children with MFS and aortic aneurysm, though data in children is inconclusive. In an observational study, 44 children and adolescents with MFS were followed for almost four years.

While data are limited, the addition of an angiotensin 2 receptor blocker as tolerated to beta-blocker therapy may slow the rate of aortic root dilation in patients with MFS, as evidenced in the 2010 ACC/AHA/AATS guidelines. Renin-angiotensin system blockers may alleviate the clinical manifestations of MFS by blocking TGF-beta signaling.

A randomized trial comparing losartan with atenolol in 608 children and adults with MFS and aortic Z-scores greater than 3.0 found no significant difference in the rate of aortic root dilation between the two treatment groups over three years.

Both animal and human data suggest that calcium channel blocker therapy may increase the risk of aortic complications.****Marfan mice treated with calcium channel blockers demonstrated aneurysm expansion, rupture, and premature death. Patients with Marfan syndrome and other forms of thoracic aortic aneurysm taking calcium channel blockers have an increased risk of aortic dissection and the need for aortic surgery.

Elective replacement of aortic root disease in advance of critical enlargement has been shown to be integral as illustrated in a series of 675 patients with MFS from Johns Hopkins in which the 30-day mortality for elective, urgent (within 7 days of surgical consultation), or emergency repair (within 24 hours of consultation) was 1.5%, 2.6%, and 11.7%, respectively.

There is conflicting data on the safety profile of pregnant women with MFS. The 2010 thoracic aortic disease guidelines urge pregnancy avoidance if the aortic root diameter exceeds 40 mm and further recommend prophylactic aortic root replacement in women who will attempt pregnancy. The European and Canadian guidelines report an aortic root diameter of 45 mm to be considered safe. In a 2012 study, there was a significantly higher rate of aortic growth documented during pregnancy than at baseline.

# Differential Diagnosis

While assessing a patient with Marfan syndrome following differentials should be considered:

- Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS)

- Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS)

- Mitral valve prolapse syndrome

- Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA)

- Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS)

- Ectopia lentis syndrome (ELS)

- Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection syndrome (FTAAD/FTAA)

- FTAAD with bicuspid aortic valve

- FTAAD with patent ductus arteriosus

- Homocystinuria

- Arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS)

- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vascular type)

- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (cardiac valvular subtype)

- Stickler syndrome (hereditary arthro-ophthalmopathy)

- Klinefelter syndrome

- Congenital bicuspid aortic valve disease with associated aortopathy

- Aortic coarctation with associated ascending aortic enlargement

- Congenital bicuspid aortic valve disease with associated aortopathy

- Aortic coarctation with associated ascending aortic enlargement

- Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm or aortopathy

# Prognosis

The lifespan of untreated patients with the classic Marfan syndrome (MFS) was approximately 32 years in 1972 but has markedly increased to 72 years in 1993.

# Complications

Marfan syndrome (MFS) has multisystem complications. These include:

- Aortic aneurysm and dissection

- Mitral valve prolapse

- Mitral regurgitation

- Aortic regurgitation

- Lens subluxation (ectopia lentis)

- Cataract, glaucoma, and retinal detachment

- Spontaneous pneumothorax

- Inguinal hernias

- Scoliosis

# Consultations

Consultation with a cardiothoracic surgeon should be scheduled in patients whose aortic diameter is more than 4 cm. Genetic counselor consultation is also beneficial. Patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) who are pregnant should consult a high-risk obstetrician. Ophthalmologic consultation is a strong consideration in patients who have a cataract, glaucoma, lens subluxation (ectopia lentis), and retinal detachment.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Marfan syndrome (MFS) may create a substantial mental and physical burden on the patient, with different areas of concern for each person. According to Rao et al.,

# Pearls and Other Issues

- The basis of a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome (MFS) is upon the presence of characteristic manifestations, particularly aortic root dilatation/dissection and ectopia lentis, skeletal findings, mitral valve prolapse, dural ectasia, pneumothorax, and skin striae.

- Over 90% of patients with MFS have had FBN1 mutations identified.

- Application of diagnostic criteria to individuals younger than 20 years old can be challenging because not all clinical features may exhibit themselves.

- The aortic root Z-score is used to identify aortic dilatation in association with body size.

- First-degree relatives of patients with a gene mutation associated with aortic aneurysms and/or dissection (e.g., FBN1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, COL3A1, ACTA2, MYH11) should undergo counseling, genetic testing, and potentially aortic imaging.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Marfan syndrome is a serious chronic disorder with no cure. A significant number of patients do develop life-threatening complications like aortic aneurysms and dissections, retinal detachment, aortic regurgitation, and pectus deformities.

Management of MFS and its related complications involves an interprofessional team including the patient's primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and with appropriate referrals to a cardiologist, cardiothoracic surgeon, ophthalmologist, and orthopedics. Care coordination should take place between the different providers as well as with the nurses taking care of these patients so that they can quickly report any potential complications. Pharmacists should be aware of medications that should require avoidance in patients with MFS. Physical therapists should be involved in guiding patients with MFS on appropriate exercise activities, which should not include high-intensity exercises.

The key is close follow-up and monitoring for complications. The interprofessional team members should communicate with each other so that the patient is provided with the optimal standard of care treatment.

The lifespan of untreated patients with the classic MFS was approximately 32 years in 1972 but has markedly increased to 72 years in 1993.
