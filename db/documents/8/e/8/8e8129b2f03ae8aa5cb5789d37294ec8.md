Neuroectoderm gives rise to the neural tube. The dorsal horn of the spinal cord forms from the alar plate of the neural tube, which gives rise to the dorsal column medial lemniscus pathway and is responsible for the sensory input from the body. The ventral horn of the spinal cord forms from the basal plate of the neural tube, which is responsible for the motor control of the body.
