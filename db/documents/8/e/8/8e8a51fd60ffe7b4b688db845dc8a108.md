Because DIC is a complication of other medical diagnoses, the prevalence of DIC remains greater in higher acuity settings as opposed to lower acuity settings. Almost invariably, a severe or life-threatening diagnosis is associated with the disease. A 1996 study in Japan found that a diagnosis of DIC complicated about 1.0% percent of admissions to university hospitals. Similarly, a 1992 study showed DIC complicated 12% of cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia before starting chemotherapy, and DICÂ was detected in 78% of cases during remission induction. Furthermore, HELLP syndrome was associated with DIC in approximately one in five cases, according to a 1993 study.
