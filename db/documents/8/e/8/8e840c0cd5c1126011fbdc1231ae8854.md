The acronym LASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. At their core, lasers use electromagnetic radiation to excite electrons, causing the electrons to emit photons during the return from their excited state back to a resting state. The energy produced in the form of light travels along a wavelength. Wavelengths that fall within the visible spectrum lie between 400 and 700 nanometers, but various lasers exist which travel on wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that exist outside of the visible spectrum.

Since debuting in a medical capacity in the 1960s, medical lasers have become increasingly adaptable to various fields of medicine. The ability of lasers to target specific colors through the use of specific laser wavelengths has assisted in placing lasers at the forefront in the treatment of pigmented lesions, such as vascular lesions of the skin and mucosa, unwanted tattoos, and pigmented nevi.

It is critical to have a working understanding of laser function, terminology, and safety before treating pigmented lesions. Of equal importance is an understanding of these pigmented lesions, so that the appropriate laser can be selected for use. This article strives to provide a foundation for such recognition.
