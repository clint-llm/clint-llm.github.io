Cherry hemangiomas are diagnosed clinically by appearance.Â Optical coherence tomography, which is a low energy light-based imaging device, can be used to evaluate cherry hemangiomas before treating them with laser therapy. This imaging study determines the extent and depth of these lesions, which is useful in predicting the response of these lesions to laser therapy.

Although cherry hemangiomas are diagnosed clinically by appearance, their histopathologic findings are essentially the same as true capillary hemangiomas.

In addition to these findings, collagen fibers between blood vessels appear to be homogenous and show edematous changes. The epidermis may be atrophic, as characterized by loss of rete ridges. The epidermal collarette is similar in appearance to pyogenic granuloma. In addition, immunohistochemical staining demonstrates no abnormality in the expression or distribution of alpha-smooth-muscle actin and type IV collagen on the capillaries of cherry hemangiomas that have undergone proliferation. The dilated and congested vessels demonstrated through immunohistochemical staining may be responsible for the bright ruby-red appearance of cherry hemangiomas.
