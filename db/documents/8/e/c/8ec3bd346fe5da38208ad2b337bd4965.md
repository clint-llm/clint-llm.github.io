Vertebral artery variants

- The most common variant is for the left vertebral artery to originate off the aortic arch between the left common and left subclavian artery with a prevalence of 2 to 5 %.

Artery of Adamkiewicz variants

- 75% of the time the artery inserts into the dura and ASA at the level T9-T12.

- 15% of the time the artery inserts into the dura and ASA at the level T5-T8.

- 10% of the time the artery inserted into the dura and ASA at the level L1-L2.

- There are two variants of ASA and AKA junction. The first variant seen describes a small caliber ASA which when joining with a larger caliber AKA forms a large ASA descending from that level. This variant is considered an AKA dominant circulation and disruption of the AKA in patients with this circulation could lead to severe neurological damage. Type 2 variant is where the ASA and AKA are the same calibers and upon joining together, the caliber of the ASA does not increase. In patients with type 2 circulation, the AKA is non-dominant, and thus disruption of the AKA in these patients might not lead to neurological damage right away.
