CML staging is determined by the phase of the disease, which includes a chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast phase.

The chronic phase has less than 10% blasts, asymptomatic to mild symptoms, and responds to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines accelerated phase CML as having one or more of the following criteria:

- Persistent or increasing high white blood cell count (greater than 10 x 10^9/L) unresponsive to therapy

- Persistent or increasing splenomegaly unresponsive to therapy

- Persistent thrombocytosis (greater than 1000 x 10^9/L) unresponsive to therapy

- Persistent thrombocytopenia (less than 100 x 10^9/L)

- Greater than or equal to 20% basophils in peripheral blood

- 10-19% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow (without extramedullary blast proliferation)

- Additional chromosomal abnormalities in Philadelphia chromosome-positive cells at diagnosis

- Any new clonal chromosomal abnormality in Philadelphia chromosome-positive cells during therapy

The WHO also considers resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors as provisional criteria for determining accelerated phase CML.

Blast phase CML is defined by greater than or equal to 20% blasts in the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow or extramedullary blast proliferation.
