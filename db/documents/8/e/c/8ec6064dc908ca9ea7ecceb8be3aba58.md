Toxoplasmosis is caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular protozoan. Although many people are infected worldwide, the disease is uncommon, as most infections in humans are asymptomatic. This organism does, however, have the potential to cause significant disease in infants and immunocompromised individuals through primary infection or reactivation of latent infection. Transmission of infection often occurs through the ingestion of tissue cysts via improperly cooked/raw meat, or ingestion of oocysts via contaminated food and water. Vertical transmission and transmission through organ transplantation can also occur. Treatment is indicated in all immunocompromised patients as well as immunocompetent patients with severe symptoms. The combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine is the preferred regimen for the therapeutic management of toxoplasmosis.
