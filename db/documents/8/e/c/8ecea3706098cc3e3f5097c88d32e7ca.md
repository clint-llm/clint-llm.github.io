The mnemonic DIAPPERS can be used as an aid to develop a differential diagnosis for reversible causes of urinary incontinence:

- Delirium, dementia, or other cognitive impairments

- Infection (urinary tract infection)

- Atrophic vaginitis or urethritis

- Pharmaceuticals or substances (e.g., diuretics, caffeine, alcohol)

- Psychological disorder

- Excessive urine output (e.g., diabetes, diabetes insipidus)

- Reduced mobility or reversible urinary retention

- Stool impaction

Other conditions to consider include:

- Neurologic conditions such as spinal cord injuries, cauda equina syndrome, multiple sclerosis, cerebral vascular accidents, normal pressure hydrocephalus, spinal stenosis

- Renal or ureteral calculi

- Intraabdominal or pelvic mass

- Anatomic abnormalities such as urogenital fistulas, diverticula, and ectopic ureters (though these are less common)
