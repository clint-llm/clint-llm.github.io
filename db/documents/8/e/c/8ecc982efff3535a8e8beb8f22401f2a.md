Colostomy creation is one of the most common surgeries performed by a general surgeon and is done for diversion or decompression of the remaining bowel or to protect a distal anastomosis. The most common type of colostomy is an end colostomy after a Hartmann procedure. Colostomy care is done through an integrated multidisciplinary team approach. It involves preoperative stomal marking and psychosocial counseling, colostomy creation, early postoperative stomal management for ileus and stomal edema, and application of colostomy bags. Furthermore, it is advisable to teach patients and their relatives about proper bag application and disposal and looking out for stoma related complications by the patient and the entero-stomal therapist in the late postoperative period.

The surgeon must call the patient for regular follow up to assess the condition of the stoma and look for any complications and also assess the disease process for which the colostomy was made and also plan for colostomy closure in case of temporary colostomies.
