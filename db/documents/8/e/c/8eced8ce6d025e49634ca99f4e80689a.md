The forearm is the region of the body spanning from the elbow to the wrist. It consists of several muscles and an extensive neurovascular network encased in three compartments. These include the anterior compartment, posterior compartment, and the mobile wad. The compartments of the forearm are separated by an interosseous membrane found between the radius and ulna in addition to a lateral intermuscular septum.

The muscles found in the posterior compartment primarily function to extend the wrists and digits. The muscles are further broken down into deep and superficial groups. The superficial group includes the extensor digitorum communis, extensor digiti minimi, extensor carpi ulnaris, and anconeus. The deep group includes the supinator, abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis brevis, extensor pollicis longus, and extensor indicia. The mobile wad consists of three muscles: the brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis longus, and extensor carpi radialis brevis. The anterior compartment contains muscles that act to flex the wrist and digits. The muscles are separated into deep, intermediate, and superficial groups. The superficial compartment contains the pronator teres, the flexor carpi radialis, and the flexor carpi ulnaris. The intermediate compartment contains the flexor digitorum superficially. The deep compartment of the contains the flexor digitorum profundus, flexor pollicis longus, and pronator quadratus.
