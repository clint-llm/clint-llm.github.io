The irreversible complications of taxane therapy are rare. The combination of doxorubicin and paclitaxel is associated with a higher risk of congestive cardiac failure, which could be persistent. Similarly, there are reports of scleroderma-like cutaneous syndrome with taxanes, particularly docetaxel.

The rare sequelae of long-term therapy could also lead to pneumonitis. A recent study noted that, save for neutropenia, Taxane toxicity was generally manageable with premedications, monitoring, and close reactive care.

Discontinuing a chemotherapy agent with significant potential benefit to the patient over an "event" was generally viewed with disdain.
