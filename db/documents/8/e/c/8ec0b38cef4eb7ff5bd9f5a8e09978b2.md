The most common presenting symptoms are exertional dyspnea and a decline in exercise tolerance. Other infrequent symptoms are cough, episodic hemoptysis, atypical chest pain, and palpitations.

During the early stages of CTEPH, physical examination of the patient may not reveal any notable findings. With the progression of pulmonary hypertension, a tricuspid regurgitation murmur, pedal edema, jugular venous distention, and other symptoms of right ventricular failure appear.

Classic signs of pulmonary hypertension that are present in CTEPH are an S4 gallop, a tricuspid regurgitant murmur, and a precordial right ventricular heave. The presence of pulmonary flow murmurs signaling turbulent flow across narrowed segments of large pulmonary arteries over lung fields is a unique finding in CTEPH. This finding gets described as subtle bruits, high pitched, blowing quality, accentuated on inspiration, and usually heard on holding breath.
