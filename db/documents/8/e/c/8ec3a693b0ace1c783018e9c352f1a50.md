Botulinum toxin A is considered the first-line treatment.

For refractory cases, myectomy with tightening of the levator tendon that elevates the eyelids (also called aponeurotic ptosis repair) and blepharoplasty can be considered. Myectomy of fibers of orbicularis muscle in the central portion of the eyelid can be performed if botulinum toxin does not produce good results. Frontalis suspension is performed as a last resort, by placing a suture between the forehead muscle and the eyelids.
