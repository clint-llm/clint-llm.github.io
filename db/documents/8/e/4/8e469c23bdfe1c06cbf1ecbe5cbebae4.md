There are no specific ancillary tests to provide a definitive diagnosis of the illness. All patients with chorea need a detailed neurologic and cardiac evaluation. Routine blood tests should include complete blood count (CBC), complete metabolic panel (CMP), liver function test (LFT), B12 (deficiency in children can lead to chorea), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and drug screens. Anti DNAse-B titers may be elevated up to one year after group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Due to the latency between the initial pharyngeal infection and the onset of the chorea, there is a limited utility of acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, rheumatoid factor, and antistreptolysin-O titers. Echocardiograms are indicated to evaluate for carditis, as up to 80% of patients with SD have a concurrent cardiac disease.

Brain MRI and CT scans typically are normal, although there may be an occasional reversible hyperintensity in the basal ganglia.  In children, obtaining MRI is of questionable use given requirements for sedation, and careful consideration should be made on a case by case basis. PET scans and SPECT imaging have demonstrated hypermetabolism and hyperperfusion of the basal ganglia in case reports; whereas, other chorea disorders are associated with hypometabolism.
