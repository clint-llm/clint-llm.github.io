An issue of great concern to the osteopathic community is the minimal collection of peer-reviewed clinical research regarding the physiology and presence of Chapman's points. Currently, much of the information about Chapman's points are anecdotal and based heavily on the clinical observations of a limited number of physicians. As of yet, there is no evidence confirming the presence of Chapman's points in tissue biopsies, but there exists a few studies demonstrating that sympathetic and endocrine alterations occur after rotatory manipulation of Chapman's points. The findings of these studies support the hypothesized physiology and presence of Chapman's points, as will be explained further in successive sections.

Despite the minimal research into their physiology, Chapman's points are included in the curricula of osteopathic medical schools. Education of future osteopathic physicians of Chapman's points fosters the opportunity for future research that may ameliorate some of the allusiveness of these nodules.

Dr. Chapman left no written legacy regarding the reflex point interpretation system, but his brother-in-law, Charles Owens, D.O., and his wife, Ada Hinchley Chapman D.O., published the only existing text on this topic.
