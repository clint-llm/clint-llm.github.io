No significant differences were observed between approaches taken for the anatomical stabilization (anterior-only, posterior-only, and 360 degrees) with the pattern of ASIA recovery seen among the patients.

The prime goals in managing these patients are early anatomical fixation with spinal decompression, followed by the strategies to survive, revive, and thrive in these cohorts of patients through:

- Specific care bundle approaches in minimizing secondary complications and

- Swift implementation of the strategic long-term rehabilitative processes

Diagnosis and management of these injuries require the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team that includes clinicians, specialists (orthopedic and/or neurologic), nurses, and physical therapists. Clinicians must obtain an appropriate specialist referral when these patients present. Many of these patients will first be seen in the ED. Nurses can assist with evaluation, follow-up monitoring, assisting during surgery, and administering pain medication. Physical therapists will play a critical role in both non-surgical and post-surgical cases. Open communication channels between all team members are crucial to implementing a coordinated team effort. This interprofessional approach will yield optimal patient results. [Level 5]
