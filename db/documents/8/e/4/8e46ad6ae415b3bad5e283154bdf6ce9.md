The clinical course of acetaminophen toxicity is divided into four stages.

- During the first stage (30 min to 24 hours), the patient may be asymptomatic or may have emesis.

- In the second stage (18 hours to 72 hours), there may be emesis plus right upper quadrant pain and hypotension.

- In the third stage (72 hours to 96 hours), liver dysfunction is significant with renal failure, coagulopathies, metabolic acidosis, and encephalopathy. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms reappear, and death is most common at this stage.

- The fourth stage (4 days to 3 weeks) is marked by recovery.
