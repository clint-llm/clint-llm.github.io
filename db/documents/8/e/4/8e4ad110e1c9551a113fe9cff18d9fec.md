Ophthalmomyiasis can be treated efficiently and effectively if identified in time. Usually, the patients are from the countryside, and the earliest point of contact is vision center optometrists. The prompt identification of symptoms in high-risk groups should be referred appropriately to the ophthalmologists.Â Open communication between these professionals facilitates early identification and treatment of the condition and spreads awareness.

Awareness among healthcare workers serving in the areas with more commonly reported cases is the only way to mitigate the impact of the disease. Synchronized activity between sensitized health care workers and ophthalmologists can decrease morbidity significantly. Better communication between a parasitologist and the treating physician helps make an accurate diagnosis and can also help formulate a customized treatment depending upon the species identified.
