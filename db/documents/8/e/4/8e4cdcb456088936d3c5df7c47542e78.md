After three weeks of development, the nervous system divides into three primary brain vesicles: the forebrain (prosencephalon), midbrain (mesencephalon), and hindbrain (rhombencephalon). The nervous system then becomes a five-vesicle stage with the forebrain splitting into the cerebral hemispheres, thalamus, and hypothalamus. Following the formation of the different regions of the brain, there is a proliferation of neurons and migration of these neurons from the periventricular zone to the cortex in an inside out manner to its final 6-layered cortical cytoarchitecture.Â The upper motor neurons originate from layers 5 and 6 of the cerebral hemispheres, specifically the primary motor cortex.
