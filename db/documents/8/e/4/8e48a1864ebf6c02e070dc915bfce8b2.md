Temporal bone fractures are often seen in the emergency department, but their management requires an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, specialty nurses, trauma surgeon, neurosurgeon, otolaryngologist, and intensivist. Most of these fractures are associated with concomitant injury to the face, spine, and chest; appropriate specialists for these injuries should be involved. The trauma and critical care services monitor patients and notify the other specialists of clinical developments. Besides the injury to the facial nerve, other complications include CSF leak, meningitis, and cholesteatoma formation. The prognosis for non-displaced temporal bone fractures is good, but displaced fractures with nerve involvement may require surgical decompression. Surgery may be associated with complications, and recovery is often protracted.

ALl interprofessional team members must carefully follow and monitor that patient's condition and progress, noting their observations in the patient's permanent health record so that all team members can access the same up-to-date data. Additionally, any status changes must promptly be communicated to the appropriate interprofessional team members so additional therapeutic interventions can be implemented if necessary. This interprofessional interaction will help drive optimal patient outcomes for these injuries. [Level 5]
