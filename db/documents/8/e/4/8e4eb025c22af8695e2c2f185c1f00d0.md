Oxidation of fatty acids occurs in multiple regions of the cell within the human body; the mitochondria, in which only Beta-oxidation occurs; the peroxisome, where alpha- and beta-oxidation occur; and omega-oxidation, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Beta-oxidation is a significant source of metabolic energy during interprandial periods and high energy demand states, such as exercise.
