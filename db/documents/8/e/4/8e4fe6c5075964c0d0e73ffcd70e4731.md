The vallecula is not a muscular structure but is adjacent to several muscles of the oropharynx as well as the larynx.Â  The vallecula is located just superior to the level of the hyoid bone, and this landmark makes approximating the level of the vallecula easier. The muscles of the tongue including geniohyoid and genioglossus are superior to the vallecula, and the stylopharyngeus is just lateral to the vallecula running vertically.

The pharynx at the level of the vallecula is surrounded by the middle pharyngeal constrictor posteriorly and the hyoglossus laterally.
