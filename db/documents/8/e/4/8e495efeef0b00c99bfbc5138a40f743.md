The most common adverse reactions seen with ixazomib are thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, rash, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral edema, and back pain. These effects occurred in more than twenty percent of patients in the TOURMALINE MM1 study, with the most common severe side effects being thrombocytopenia and diarrhea.

Different eye disorders were also seen in some patients taking ixazomib and included blurred vision, dry eyes, and conjunctivitis.

In relation to nausea and vomiting that occurs with ixazomib, it was seen primarily in the first three months of treatment during the first cycle during the drug approval study. Antiemetics wereÂ added to the regimen in some cases, and some patients also received prophylactic antiemetics. The first instance of diarrhea was also highest during the first three months of treatment, and the occurrence decreased as time went on. Antidiarrheal medications were given to some patients, loperamide being the most common. In terms of constipation that occurred in some patients, the use of opioids as a possible cause due to bone pain cannot be ruled out. Rashes that occurred using ixazomib were commonly erythematous, macular, and/or papular lesions or generalized eruptions. Like nausea and diarrhea, the emergence of rashes was highest during the first three months of treatment and was managed with antihistamines, steroids, or dose reduction.
