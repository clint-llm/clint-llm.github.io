Chemotherapy with single-agent doxorubicin or paclitaxel is the treatment of choice for advanced regional or metastatic disease. Promising studies have shown that bevacizumab acts as a tumor stabilizer and may aid in decreasing the progression rate of the disease. Isolated reports have shown successful outcomes with thalidomide therapy. Even in cases of early surgical intervention, prognosis remains poor, with a high rate of local recurrence and metastasis.
