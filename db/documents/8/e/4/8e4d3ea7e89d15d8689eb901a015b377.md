The potential for hair regrowth remains since the inflammatory process does not destroy hair follicles, especially stem cells. However, induction of regrowth by current treatments seems to be difficult to achieve.

Up to 34-50% of patients may recover spontaneously within one year, although most patients will experience multiple episodes of alopecia, and 14-25% of patients will progress to alopecia totalis or alopecia universalis, from which full recovery isÂ infrequent (<10% of patients).

The extent of hair loss and patient age when first diagnosed appears to be a prognostic factor, being a less favorable prognosis with childhood-onset alopecia areata and ophiasis, and a later stage of onset correlates with less extensive alopecia.
