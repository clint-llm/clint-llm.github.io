As stated, the origin of the phrase "nightstick fractures" originates from injuries obtained from patients who were struck by a police truncheon in the forearm while protecting their head. More generally, these fractures are caused by any direct blow to the medial forearm, butÂ can also be seen with excessive pronation or supination of the forearm.
