**Nonopioid analgesic agents**

- **Acetaminophen (paracetamol)**: The recommended dose for adults is 650 mg to 1000 mg every 4 to 6 hours, a maximum of 4 grams/day. In children, the recommended dose is 15 mg/kg every 6 hours, up to 60 mg/kg/day.

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: Currently, more than 20 different NSAIDs are commercially available. The choice of the agent depends upon several factors (eg., comorbidities, risk of bleeding). Also, the response to different NSAIDs vary between patients, and the mechanisms for these distinct responses are only partially understood. Thus, doses depend on the specific drug, and the recommendation is to prescribe the lowest effective dose for each patient for the shortest period. Listed below are various commonly known NSAIDs with their respective doses for analgesia and anti-inflammation:
- Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid): Is dosed 325 to 650 mg every 4 to 6 hours. The maximum dose is 4000 mg/day. Aspirin is available for oral (caplet, capsule, tablet) or rectal (suppository) administration.
