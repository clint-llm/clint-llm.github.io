Subluxation is an essential entity of traumatic subaxial cervical spinal injuries. There is a varying degree of slippage of the body of one vertebra relative to the adjacent vertebra, owing to ligamentous injury and the jumped facets, with, therefore, a high predisposition for injury to the spinal cord. Road traffic accidents have been mostly implicated in the majority of cases of cervical subluxations. One study found motor vehicle collisions accountable in 51% of such cases, followed by fall-related injuries in 41% of this cohort. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of the traumatic subluxations of the cervical spine and highlights the role of the healthcare team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of traumatic subluxations of the cervical spine.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of subluxations of the cervical spine.
- Outline the treatment options available for the traumatic subluxations of the cervical spine.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the traumatic subluxations of the cervical spine and improve outcomes.
