There had been a steady increase in the incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) since 1975 that has slowed in the past few years. This increase is attributed to the detection of asymptomatic and early cases due to advances and extensive use of imaging techniques. Over half of the RCC cases are detected incidentally.

Overall 5-year relative survival in the US is 93% for patients diagnosed in the early stages of the disease. Early disease patients make up about two-thirdsÂ of all the cases diagnosed with renal cancer. The overall survival rate for kidney and renal pelvis cancers is 75%.
