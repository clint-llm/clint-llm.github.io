Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) results from a bacterial infection that causes rapid deterioration of the kidney function due to an inflammatory response following streptococcal infection. PSGN most commonly presents in children 1 to 2 weeks after a streptococcal throat infection, or within 6 weeks following a streptococcal skin infection. When symptomatic, PSGN typically presents with features of the nephritic syndrome such as hematuria, oliguria, hypertension, and edema, though it can also present with significant proteinuria. This activity reviews the etiology, pathogenesis, evaluation, and management of PSGN and explains the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.
- Review how to evaluate a patient for poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes for patients affected by poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.
