The symptoms seen from snake envenomations are mainly due to the toxic components in their venom. The exact composition ranges from species to species and can vary significantly from localized tissue destruction to profound coagulopathies. The clinical effect on humans isÂ related to both the potency and the volume of the toxin released during the snake bite. The venom released by the inland Taipan from Australia is the most potent in the world with a lethal dose of only 0.01 mg/kg with an average envenomation of 44 mg. Their envenomations have greater than 80% mortality.
