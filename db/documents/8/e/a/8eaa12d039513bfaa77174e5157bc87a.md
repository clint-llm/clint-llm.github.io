Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in pregnancy has been associated with many complications, including low birth weight, miscarriage, and displacement of the placenta. Therefore SWL is contraindicated in pregnancy.

Patients with an aortic aneurysm are at increased risk of bleeding and rupture if they undergo SWL.

Patients who have a bleeding diathesis, or are on antiplatelet, antithrombotic, or anticoagulant drugs are at increased risk of bleeding.

Severe or untreated hypertension is a significant risk factor for bleeding and perinephric hematoma after SWL and is an absolute contraindication.

Patients with infected stones, untreated urinary tract infections, or even bacteriuria are at an increased risk of pyelonephritis, bacteremia, and sepsis if they undergo ESWL.
