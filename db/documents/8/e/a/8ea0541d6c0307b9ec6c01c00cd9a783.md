Rheumatic heart disease is a systemic immune condition that occurs as a complication of rheumatic fever. This occurs after a beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection of the throat. Rheumatic heart disease is a critical form of acquired heart disease in children and adults worldwide. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of rheumatic heart disease and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the aberrant immune response to Streptococcus pyogenes infection in the pathophysiology of rheumatic heart disease.
- Outline the patient history associated with rhematic heart disease.
- Summarize the echocardiographic criteria for the diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to stress the importance of strict follow-up to improve outcomes in those with rheumatic heart disease.
