The clinical morphology of a melanoacanthoma can mimic that of another benign skin tumor, a seborrheic keratosis. However, for many of the patients in whom this epithelial neoplasm has been described, the initial impression was a melanoma. Therefore, the patientâ€™s primary health care professional, either physician (such as a family practice doctor or internist) or nurse practitioner, should consider performing a complete skin check of the patient, especially those over 60 years of age.

The detection of a new or progressively enlarging asymptomatic black lesion should prompt the primary health care professional to refer the patient to a dermatologist or surgeon for evaluation, including biopsy, of the lesion.

Appropriate postoperative care, after the biopsy has been done, should be initiated to promote healing of the wound without infection. This management may involve either the personnel in the office where the biopsy was performed or visiting nurses or both.

Periodic follow up by the clinician to confirm healing and ensure that there is no persistence or recurrence of the melanoacanthoma. [Level 5]
