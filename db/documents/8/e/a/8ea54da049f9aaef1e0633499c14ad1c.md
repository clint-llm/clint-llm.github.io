The etiology of anemia depends on whether the anemia is hypoproliferative (i.e., corrected reticulocyte count <2%) or hyperproliferative (i.e., corrected reticulocyte count >2%).

Hypoproliferative anemias are further divided by the mean corpuscular volume into microcytic anemia (MCV<80 fl), normocytic anemia (MCV 80-100 fl), and macrocytic anemia (MCV>100 fl).

**1) Hypoproliferative Microcytic Anemia (MCV<80 fl)**

- Iron deficiency anemia

- Anemia of chronic disease (AOCD)

- Sideroblastic anemia

- Thalassemia

- Lead poisoning

**2) Hypoproliferative Normocytic Anemia (MCV 80-100 fL)**

- Anemia of chronic disease (AOCD)

- Renal failure

- Aplastic anemia

- Pure red cell aplasia

- Myelofibrosis or myelophthisic processes

- Multiple myeloma

Macrocytic anemia can be caused by either a hypoproliferative disorder, hemolysis, or both. Thus, it is important to calculate the corrected reticulocyte count when evaluating a patient with macrocytic anemia. In hypoproliferative macrocytic anemia, the corrected reticulocyte count is <2%, and the MCV is greater than 100 fl. But, if the reticulocyte count is > 2%, hemolytic anemia should be considered.

**3) Hypoproliferative Macrocytic Anemia (MCV>100 fL)**

- Alcohol

- Liver disease

- Hypothyroidism

- Folate and Vitamin B12 deficiency

- Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)

- Refractory anemia (RA)
- Refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RA-RS)
- Refractory anemia with excess blasts (RA-EB)
- Refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation
- Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)

- Drug-induced

- Diuretics 
- Chemotherapeutic agents
- Hypoglycemic agents
- Antiretroviral agents
- Antimicrobials
- Anticonvulsants

**4) Hemolytic anemia**Hemolytic anemia (HA) is divided into extravascular and intravascular causes.

- **Extravascular hemolysis:**red cells are prematurely removed from the circulation by the liver and spleen. This accounts for a majority of cases of HA
- Hemoglobinopathies (sickle cell, thalassemias)
- Enzyemopathies (G6PD deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency)
- Membrane defects (hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis)
- Drug-induced

- **Intravascular hemolysis:**red cells lyse within the circulation, and is less common.
- PNH
- AIHA
- Transfusion reactions
- MAHA
- DIC
- Infections
- Snake bites/venom
