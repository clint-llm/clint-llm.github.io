The method in which OCT-A images are obtained allows for the tandem viewing of correlating en face and cross-sectional B-scans, allowing for the evaluation of anatomical features with microvascular features visualized on OCTA.

The clinical significance of OCT-A continues to mature as the usage of the technology grows. Three areas that have shown evidence for the utility of OCT-A is with glaucoma, uveitis, and various retinal pathologies. Diabetic retinopathy is associated with extensive effects on the retinal vasculature.

Evaluation of changes in choriocapillaris flow, analysis of choroidal neovascular membranes, and detection of retinal changes in age-related macular degeneration can also be aided by OCT-A. Furthermore, management of other retinal diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy, macular telangiectasia, vascular occlusion, and choroidal neovascular membranes have been shown to have potential benefits with the usage of OCT-A.
