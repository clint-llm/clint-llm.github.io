For infants with just an isolated PDA, the prognosis is good. In premature infants, the prognosis is dependent on other comorbidities. After closure of the PDA, most children have a normal life expectancy. Spontaneous closure of the PDA is rare. With the use of indomethacin, close to 80-90% of infants will have successful closure of the PDA. In adults, a surgical closure is always required provided the patient has not developed fixed pulmonary hypertension.

The morbidity and mortality are linked to the volume of blood flow via the PDA. If left untreated, pulmonary hypertension can develop which will lead to premature death. Premature infants with PDA may develop respiratory distress syndrome. Surgical complications of the PDA include injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, occlusion of the descending aorta, injury to the pulmonary artery and phrenic nerve and death.
