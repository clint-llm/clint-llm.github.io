Injuries to the bile duct are almost universally iatrogenic and occasionally are due to trauma. The most common procedure leading to bile duct injury is the laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Prior to the advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, open cholecystectomy was used and was associated with a 0.1 to 0.2 percent risk of bile duct injury. With the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the incidence has increased to 0.4 to 0.6 percent. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of bile duct injuries and the types of repair available and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who undergo bile duct repair.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy of the biliary tree.
- Review the types of bile duct repair procedures available.
- Explain the classification of bile duct injuries.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients undergoing bile duct repair.
