MRI is one of the most sensitive and specific modalities for evaluating the lumbar spine. Moreover, there are no side effects of radiation. It provides information about the vertebral bodies, disc spaces, spinal canal, including the meninges, spinal cord, conus, cauda equina, and exiting nerve roots. Multiple sequences are obtained in different planes, each of which helps in evaluating various pathologies. The most common sequences include sagittal and axial T1 and T2 and a sagittal STIR (short tau inversion recovery). Post-contrast T1 weighted sequence is useful for evaluating spinal infections, postoperative complications, vascular malformation, primary spinal tumors, and metastases. Prostate metastasis, which is frequently visible in the lumbar spine, can also be assessed on MRI. Complications associated with metastatic disease, such as cord compression, can also be diagnosed on MRI. STIR sequences are beneficial in assessing marrow edema, which produces an increased signal on these sequences.
