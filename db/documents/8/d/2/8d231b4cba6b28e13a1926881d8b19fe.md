The spread of infectious disease and health-care-associated infections is a major public health concern. In a healthcare setting, especially areas with exposure to blood and body fluids, the risk of transmission of HIV, HBV, and HCV are indisputable. These diseases are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore prompt reporting of exposure is essential. Timely medical evaluation and follow-up are equally critical, as prophylaxis or treatment measures for HIV, HBV, and HCV are highly effective when administered in the appropriate clinical timeframe. Occupational clinicians are an important part of the communication strategies and follow-up procedures designed to keep health care workers safe.
