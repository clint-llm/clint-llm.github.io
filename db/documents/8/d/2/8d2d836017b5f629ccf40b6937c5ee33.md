Several conditions may be confused with inflammatory breast cancer. Extreme caution should be used as this may lead to potentially preventable delays in diagnosis and treatment.

- Ductal ectasia- This is a benign condition in a middle-aged woman, related to the collection of skin debris and swelling of the ducts. It improves without treatment.

- Infectious mastitis and breast abscess- Infections of the breast in a lactating mother is associated with fever and leukocytosis, typically improves with antibiotics, but can have a similar examination and mammographic findings.

- Noninflammatory breast cancer- It is difficult to differentiate inflammatory breast cancer from noninflammatory, locally advanced breast cancer that involves the skin. Skin dimpling, nipple retraction, satellite skin nodules, edema of the skin, ulceration alone without other diagnostic criteria do not qualify as inflammatory breast cancer.

- Other malignancies like breast lymphoma or leukemia may also present similar to inflammatory breast cancer. They can be differentiated with biopsy and histologic findings.
