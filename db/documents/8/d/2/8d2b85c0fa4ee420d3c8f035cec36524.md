In the evaluation of DLE, the dermatologist should take a directed history, perform a cutaneous examination looking for signs of possible systemic disease. The diagnosis of DLE is made based on clinical features, but histology may be required to confirm the diagnosis.

Autoantibodies to SSA/Ro, SSB/La, U1RNP, histones, and ssDNA, are common in patients with SLE, but they are not disease-specific. There are no other specific autoantibodies to differentiate the subtypes of CLE that are routinely used in practice. One further possibleÂ target of auto-antibodies is annexin 1, which has been suggested to play an important role in preventing autoimmune diseases. A recent study found a significantly higher level of anti-annexin 1 antibodies in DLE patients, suggesting that anti-annexin 1 antibodies might be a new diagnostic marker for DLE. Anti-annexin 1 antibodies level in the serum did not correlate with DLE activity.
