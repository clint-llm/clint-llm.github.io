Management of a flail chest should include these areas of concern; maintaining adequate ventilation, fluid management, pain management, and management of the unstable chest wall. Ventilation should be maintained with oxygen and non-invasive ventilation when possible. Invasive mechanical ventilation is used only when other methods fail and extubation should be attempted as early as possible.

The judicious use of fluid is recommended in most trauma settings and is important in the flail chest because of the almost ubiquitous lung contusion.

Pain management should be addressed early and aggressively. This may include nerve blocks or epidural anesthesia. There should also be a focus on excellent pulmonary toilet and steroids should be avoided.

Internal pneumatic stabilization has been used successfully to treat complicated cases.
