The International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG) is the reference classification for assessing prognosis in patients with advanced non-seminomatous germ-cell tumors. Three risk classes are identified, as shown in the following table.

Postpubertal-type teratomas have a less benign prognosis. Adults with pure mature teratoma have metastases in over 40%, but the overall survival is close to 100% after 5-year when the disease is localized.In metastatic somatic-type malignancies, patients do not respond well to conventional chemotherapy used for metastatic germ cell tumors, so that the overall survival drops.Teratoma, even the mature form, has an unpredictable behavior, being locally-invasive and bearing the possibility of malignant transformation into somatic tumors such as sarcoma (commonest type, especially rhabdomyosarcoma) or carcinoma.

The presence of teratoma is associated with a higher cumulative incidence of disease-related death.
