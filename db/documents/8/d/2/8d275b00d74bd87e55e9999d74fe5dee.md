Many of the etiologies causing anterior cord syndrome result from preventable disease processes. Educating patients about primary disease prevention is important in the avoidance of this syndrome. Aortic surgery is the most common cause of anterior cord syndrome, which can be a result of many pathologies, including aortic aneurysm or dissection. Atherosclerosis leading to thrombosis, as well as an embolus, are also common causes. Preventable risk factors for these diseases include hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and smoking.

Patient education should focus on smoking cessation and the development of a healthy lifestyle through exercise and proper nutrition habits. If primary prevention fails and patients do develop these risk factors, secondary prevention is needed through further lifestyle guidance as well as medical management to maintain these conditions in a well-controlled state. If patients do develop cord infarction, continued strict management of these conditions can help prevent reoccurrence or continued functional decline. Ultimately, physical and occupational therapy, as well as psychiatry, play a significant role in the patientâ€™s return to functional independence in regards to motor function, social health, and quality of life.
