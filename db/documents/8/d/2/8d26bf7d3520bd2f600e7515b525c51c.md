Hyperparathyroidism is a condition mainly due to adenomas of the parathyroid that are overactive. Most cases of hyperparathyroidism go unnoticed because they are clinically silent. When symptomatic, the patient usually requires a referral to an otolaryngologist that will decide if surgery or medical intervention would better benefit the patient. If surgery is the option chosen, the patient will undergo imaging and a parathyroidectomy. Imaging is used to locate the parathyroid glands since these structures are notorious for being ectopically placed along a median line. If the clinical signs of hyperparathyroidism continue post-operatively, these serve as clues to the head and neck surgeon that there may be remaining tissue in the parathyroid, a parathyroid ectopically placed, or supernumerary parathyroids. Positive labs for continued primary hyperparathyroidism include hypercalcemia and high levels of PTH.
