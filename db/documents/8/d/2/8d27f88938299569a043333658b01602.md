Cervical traction is a simple procedure, performed by physical therapists and physicians.Â  It constitutes several modalities of practice depending on the pathology being treated. The established efficiency of this technique in cervical fractures, facet joint dislocations, and other orthopedic diseases makes it a useful tool for medical practitioners. However, its role in chronic cervical spondylosis is uncertain. For this purpose, the design of randomized controlled trials on adequate population samples, comparing cervical traction to sham traction, would provide the scientific community with information of great importance about the use of cervical traction in spinal cord spondylosis.
