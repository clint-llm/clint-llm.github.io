As previously noted, the insula remains one of the least understood cortical structures of the human brain. Given its deep location and involvement in many neural circuits, there is an impetus to continue improving our understanding both through clinical and translational studies. New and improved diagnostic technologies such as EEG, fMRI, DTI, machine learning, and brain-computer interfaces (BCI) may elucidate the anatomic and functional characteristics of the insula to improve outcomes for patients.

Depending on the pathologic entity, a patient may present to their primary care physician or the emergency department. Coordinated interprofessional care should subsequently involve neurology, neurosurgery, physiatry, occupational and physical therapy (OT/PT), and dedicated nursing care.
