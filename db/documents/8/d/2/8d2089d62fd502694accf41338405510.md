The ability to perceive accurate and specific afferent sensory information from the external world is vitally important to human function, and there is a range of peripheral nerve fibers that perform this role. These specialized peripheral nerve fibers are classified into four subclasses according to their fiber diameter, conduction velocity, and extent of myelination. C-type fibers are unmyelinated fibers that form one of these groups, and they are involved in the afferent transfer of temperature, burning pain, and itch from the periphery to synapse, principally in lamina I and II of the dorsal spinal horn.
