Daunorubicin cause both dose-limiting and non-limiting adverse effects. Some of the common and most serious dose-limiting adverse effects include bone marrow suppression and cardiotoxicity. Bone marrow suppression usually occurs in all patients given the therapeutic dose of daunorubicin; therefore, it should be used cautiously in patients with pre-existing bone marrow suppression. It usually manifests as severe infections or hemorrhage.

Daunorubicin can cause potential cardiac toxicity, especially in children and the elderly. Pre-existing heart disease and concomitant treatment with other cytotoxic agents or radiotherapy involving the field of the heart can enhance the risk of developing daunorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. It usually presents with new-onset congestive heart failure, although rarely it can present as myocarditis or pericarditis. In adults, the cardiac toxic effects are usually seen after a cumulative dose exceeding 400 to 550 mg/m^2, although it may also occur on doses as low as 200 mg/m^2.

Other more common dose non-limiting adverse effects include reversible alopecia, mucositis, nausea, vomiting, and local skin necrosis, cellulitis, or induration due to extravasation of the drug into the tissues.

Rarely it causes secondary leukemias, hypersensitivity reactions, urticaria, local dermatitis, tumor lysis syndrome, and hyperuricemia.
