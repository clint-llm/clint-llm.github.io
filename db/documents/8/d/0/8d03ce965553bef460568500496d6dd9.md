Patients with clear cell acanthomas may present to their primary care clinician, urgent care clinic, or directly to a dermatologist. When the diagnosis is uncertain, and a biopsy performed, the provider should communicate with the pathologist to ensure evaluation of the lesion for the presence of atypia or malignancy. Various providers can treat these lesions within their level of comfort. Referral to the appropriate specialist is necessary if treatment is outside the comfort or experience of the provider. All caregivers involved should be aware of the diagnostic and treatment options, and an interprofessional team approach including various medical specialties (pathologist, surgeon, oncologist, etc.), and nursing to facilitate care, should be employed for optimal patient outcomes.

Even though it is not malignant, clear cell acanthoma requires an interprofessional team approach, including primary clinicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and when needed, pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level 5]
