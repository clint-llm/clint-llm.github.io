Epidermoid tumors are congenital lesions that arise from ectodermal cells misplaced during the closure of the neural tube in the process of embryogenesis. They start to form during the very early stages of the development of the embryo during the closure of the neural tube where epithelial cells are trapped. They have a benign nature and slow growth rate. Epidermoids consist only of ectodermal germ cells, while dermoids contain both ectodermal and mesodermal germ cells. They can also be called central nervous system epidermoid cyst, intracranial epidermoid cyst, and epidermoid brain cyst.

These tumors were initially described by French pathologist Cruveilhier as the “most beautiful tumors of all the tumors” based on their pearly nature.
