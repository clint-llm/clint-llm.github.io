The most common symptom of bullous myringitis is acute ear pain.

The classic sign of bullous myringitis is the presence of blisters (bullae) on the tympanic membrane, often accompanied by fever, thickening, and erythematous appearance of the tympanic membrane, decreased or absent light reflex, and decreased mobility. In true bullous myringitis, the bullae are confined to the tympanic membrane. If bullae or vesicles are seen in the ear canal or external ear, other diagnoses should be considered such as Ramsay-Hunt syndromw or any of the bullous dermatidities. Conductive hearing loss may occur in the presence of effusion.Â Over half of the patients with bullous myringitis demonstrate sensorineural hearing changes. However, the mechanism of this is poorly understood.

Diagnosis is clinical, with its basis on the presence of one or more blisters on the tympanic membrane, irrespective of other findings such as AOM.
