In the vast majority of cases of folliculitis, histopathology is not needed for diagnosis as this condition is a clinical diagnosis. However, in the case of eosinophilic folliculitis skin biopsy should be done for confirmation of the diagnosis. These biopsies would show perifollicular infiltrates that include lymphocytes and eosinophils predominantly around the area where the sebaceous gland and duct meet follicle. Uncommonly, the clinician may need to perform a skin biopsy to differentiate folliculitis from a condition that may mimic it. In cases of bacterial folliculitis, a biopsy would show a neutrophilic invasion of the hair follicle.
