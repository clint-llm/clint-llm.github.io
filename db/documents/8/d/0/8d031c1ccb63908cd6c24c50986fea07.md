In development, the mammillary bodies form from the ectoderm layer. The ectoderm layer forms the neural tube that closes at six weeks of gestation. The neural tube differentiates into the forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord. The forebrain section develops into the telencephalon and diencephalon. The hypothalamus, mammillary bodies, and posterior pituitary form from the diencephalon.
