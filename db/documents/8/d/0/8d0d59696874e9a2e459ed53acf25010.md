Lisfranc joint injury are best managed by an interprofessional team that also includes an orthopedic nurse. The diagnosis of Lisfranc joint injury is not always simple. Clinicians need to know that proper imaging studies are vital. When a Lisfranc injury is suspected, anteroposterior, 30-degree oblique, and lateral weight-bearing radiographs should initially be obtained. Compliance with weight-bearing films is as difficult as it is essential. Both the patient and radiography technician should be educated on the importance. While more obvious in boney injuries, in purely ligamentous injuries, an axial force during the radiograph is needed to illustrate the injury better. If proper x-rays are not obtained, the patient's disorder remains undiagnosed leading to more morbidity.
