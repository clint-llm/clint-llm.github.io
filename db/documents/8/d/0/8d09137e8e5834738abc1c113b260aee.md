The patient should be instructed on the proper and effective use of compression stockings, emphasizing compliance and the use of the optimal tension gradient. Compression stockings alone may ease discomfort, edema, and venous distention, aid venous ulcer healing and prevent recurrences. In addition, the patient should be instructed to preserve skin integrity by regularly checking the skin for breakdowns or infections and diligently applying moisturizer to prevent fissuring. Also, patients should be advised to elevate their legs to minimize swelling. Finally, avoid extended periods of standing or sitting.

Patients should be encouraged to maintain ideal body weight and identify any obstacles that hamper losing weight, such as psychiatric illnesses such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, medications causing weight gain, or mobility issues such as knee osteoarthritis. Address these concerns accordingly by an appropriate specialist referral or patient education. In addition, patients should be made aware that chronic venous disease is a long-term health concern. Hence regular follow-up with the providers and compliance with medical treatment plans areÂ essential for preventing its consequences.
