Posterior myocardial infarction (PMI) accounts for a substantial number of cases of acute coronary syndrome (ACS); however, true PMI is often under-recognized, potentially leading to delays in treatment. PMI, like other acute myocardial infarction, is a true medical emergency with significant morbidity and mortality and requires urgent reperfusion therapy. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of posterior myocardial infarction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review etiology of posterior myocardial infarction.
- Explain the diagnostic findings of posterior myocardial infarction
- Summarize the management of posterior myocardial infarction.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients with posterior myocardial infarction
