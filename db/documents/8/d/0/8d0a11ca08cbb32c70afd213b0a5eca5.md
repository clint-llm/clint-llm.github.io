As a distal part of the lower limb, the navicular initially emerged as a portion of a limb bud that developed within the fourth week of gestation. By the fifth week, undifferentiated mesenchymal cells migrate from the progress zone (PZ) in the process of outgrowth and become differentiated mesodermal cells. Chondrification of these mesenchymal cells started within the sixth week of gestation and reached the navicular primordial by the seventh or eighth week. The navicular is the last tarsal bone to undergo ossification; the endochondral ossification of the navicular occurs during the third year of life. The ossification center appears at the central or lateral third of the cartilaginous navicular and terminates at the medial aspect. Occasionally within the embryogenic state, the navicular bone happens to have a secondary ossification center leading to a supernumerary bone called the accessory navicular bone.
