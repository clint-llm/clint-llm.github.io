The lumbar spine pathology is myriad but can be classified anatomically into lesions of the bone, disc, meninges, spinal cord, or paraspinal region. Choosing an appropriate imaging modality provides sufficient information based on the etiology (trauma, congenital, degenerative, infective, vascular, and neoplasm). The more common conditions are discussed below.

**Degenerative Disc Disease (DJD)**

DJD is the most common etiology for back pain and increases with age. Mechanical stress and trauma are also significant contributors. A healthy disc is hyperintense on the T2 weighted sequence. Aging produces changes in the disc space signal. There are also associated changes in the endplates termed Modic changes.

- Modic type I: Linear edema signal along the endplates, which is hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2 sequences

- Modic type II: Linear fat signal along the endplates, which is T1 and T2 hyperintense

- Modic type III: Linear sclerotic signal along the endplates, which T1 and T2 hypointense

Changes in the disc, along with facet arthropathy, leads to spinal stenosis. Disc herniations have been explained under the section heading of anatomy. However, spinal stenosis can also occur from a variety of other etiologies, including congenital narrowing of the central canal from shortened pedicles, epidural masses, traumatic fractures, and deposition of fat in the epidural space (epidural lipomatosis).

**Discitis Osteomyelitis**

It is an infection of the intervertebral disc and the adjacent vertebral bodies. Hematogenous spread is the most common etiology followed by post-operative complications or following trauma. Clinically, patients can present with long-standing low back pain along with fever. MRI is the appropriate modality for evaluating spinal discitis or osteomyelitis. There is an abnormal signal within the involved disc along with marrow edema and endplate irregularity in the adjacent vertebral bodies. Post-contrast MRI will accurately delineate the extent of disc involvement and its extension into the adjacent vertebral bodies, paraspinal region, and spinal canal. It will also characterize the spinal canal extension into epidural, intradural, leptomeningeal involvement. 3D reconstructions from CT may be useful for surgical hardware placement if required. The clinician can drain the paraspinal abscess with the help of CT or ultrasound. Occult spinal infections can be better evaluated with WBC-tagged nuclear medicine imaging.

**Spinal Canal Masses**

These classify from the inside out as intramedullary, extramedullary-intradural, and extradural masses. MRI with contrast is the most appropriate imaging for spinal canal mass evaluation. The most common masses in each category are listed below.

The common intramedullary mass lesions are tumefactive demyelination, tumors, and vascular malformations. Most tumors will expand the spinal cord and have edema, hemorrhage, and an enhancing component. WHile tumefactive demyelination may have a similar appearance to masses on initial imaging, it will improve after appropriate treatment. Serpegenous flow voids and sometimes subarachnoid hemorrhage may appear in the case of vascular malformations. MRA of the spine and 3D MR sequences will help localize and plan intervention and angiograms in vascular lesions. However, conventional angiography is the diagnostic imaging of choice for evaluating the origin of the arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and dural fistulas.

The extramedullary-intradural masses are usually comprised of meningiomas, schwannomas, intradural lipomas, epidermoids, arachnoid cysts, and metastases. These are seen external to the cord but within the dura. On axial images, there is the widening of the subarachnoid space with the displacement of the cord. Most of these lesions have typical imaging characteristics on MRI.

Extradural lesions include epidural abscess, epidural hematoma, tumors of the adjacent vertebral bodies, and epidural lipomatosis. The dura lifts off from the vertebral body or lamina attachments, and multiplanar images from MRI best characterize these lesions.

**Trauma**

Elaborate thoracolumbar spine injury classification systems exist which classify vertebral body fractures and dictate the treatment algorithm. Traditionally,  vertebral body fractures are classified based on the number of columns involved. The 3 column model describes

- The anterior column comprises the anterior longitudinal ligament and the anterior half of the body.

- The middle column consists of the posterior half and the posterior longitudinal ligament.

- The posterior column consists of the supra and interspinous ligaments, ligamentum flavum, and facet joints.

Fractures involving two or more columns are termed unstable. CT is the imaging modality of choice in acute trauma to delineate the bony abnormalities and MRI to evaluate ligamentous injuries. Additionally, MRI in spinal trauma will provide information on epidural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cord compression, and cord transections. Any neurological deficits associated with spinal trauma should undergo an evaluation with MRI. When lumbar spine fractures are detected, the clinician should also assess for visceral injury, including the peritoneum and retroperitoneum. Approximately 51% of patients with transverse fractures also have a concomitant abdominal visceral injury.

**Postoperative Lumbar Spine Imaging**

With an increasing number of spine surgeries, imaging of postoperative complications has also become very common. Complications classify as early and late complications. Early complications include hardware malpositioning, hematoma, infection, and CSF leakage. Late complications include recurrent disc herniation, failure of fusion, hardware failure, infection (discitis, osteomyelitis, prevertebral, paraspinal, and epidural abscess), epidural fibrosis, and arachnoiditis.

In conclusion, the lumbar spine is assessable on multiple modalities, and these modalities are complementary to each other. Choosing appropriate modalities wisely leads to better patient care and proper diagnosis and improved healthcare costs.
