The examiner watches for dorsiflexion (upward movement) of the big toe and fanning of the other toes. When this occurs, then the Babinski reflex is present. If the toes deviate downward, then the reflex is absent. If there is no movement, then this is considered a neutral response and has no clinical significance.

The presence of the Babinski reflex is indicative of dysfunction of the CST. Oftentimes, the presence of the reflex is the first indication of spinal cord injury after acute trauma. Care must be exercised in interpreting the results because many patients have significant withdrawal responses to plantar stimulation. When this occurs, one of the variations on eliciting a Babinski sign can be utilized.

In comatose patients, one may witness a triple flexion response. In this case, one observes flexion of the thigh, leg, and dorsiflexion of the foot. The triple flexion response represents profound dysfunction of the CST, with a spread of the reflex to the L3 and L2 myotomes. Care must be made to distinguish this from a withdrawal response. The triple flexion response is very stereotyped, whereas the withdrawal response can vary with each stimulation.
