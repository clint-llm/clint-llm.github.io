Due to the association of cherry hemangioma with certain chemicals, patients should be advised to avoid topical nitrogen mustard therapy, bromides, or other chemicals.

Cherry hemangiomas have been found in increasing numbers in middle-aged to older adults. The numbers of these lesions tend to increase in number as a patient’s age increases. Most often, these lesions develop after the third decade of age. They are found in only 5% of adolescents, but 75% of adults over 75 years of age. In addition, multiple cherry hemangiomas have been reported in nursing home patients with a strong association with infections.
