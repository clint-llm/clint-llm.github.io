Both history and physical examination can yield useful information. If there is a positive family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, constructing a family tree is useful. Also asking about secondary causes such as smoking, diabetes, dietary intake of total calories, saturated, and trans fats, physical activity, drug therapies, and symptoms of CV disease (angina pectoris, intermittent claudication, transient ischemic attacks) is also important. On physical examination look for features of hypothyroidism (bradycardia, dry skin, delayed reflexes) Nephrotic syndrome (edema, ascites), cholestasis (jaundice, hepatomegaly).

In patients with hypercholesterolemia, palpitate all pulses and elicit carotids and femoral bruits. Also, carefully examine the tendon xanthoma (Achilles tendon and extensor tendons on the dorsum of the hand), xanthelasma, and arcus senilis if the patient is younger than 50 years old. In suspected familial hypercholesterolemia patients, a careful examination of the heart for supra-valvar aortic stenosis due to atheroma deposition is warranted.
