Brachioradial pruritus lacksÂ characteristic histopathological features. Microscopic findings include actinic elastosis and decreased density of epidermal and dermal nerve fibers. Actinic elastosis correlates with a history of extensive UVR exposure. A decrease in the density of nerve fibers is seen with phototherapy treatments and would be consistent with UVR-induced brachioradial pruritus exacerbations during the sunny summer months.
