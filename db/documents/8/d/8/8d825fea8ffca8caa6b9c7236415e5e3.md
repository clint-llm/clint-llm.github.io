A diagnosis of diverticulosis is suspected based on clinical presentation (e.g., a history of painless rectal bleeding or unexplained abdominal pain and cramping, altered bowel movements) and may be confirmed by colonoscopy or an X-ray following a barium enema. If the patient presents with extreme abdominal pain, however, the test of choice is typically a CT of the abdomen to avoid the risk of intestinal rupture in the setting of intestinal infection or inflammation.

Colonoscopy in a prepped colon remains the best test to identify the source of bleeding if blood is present in the stool. If a colonoscopy is inconclusive, as with the acute or severe bleeding, angiography, CTA, or radionuclide scanning may be considered to locate the source.

Patients presenting with acute diverticulitis may require additional treatment. Uncomplicated diverticulitis is treated non-operatively, with either intravenous (IV) or oral (PO) antibiotics. Complicated diverticulitis (e.g., with an associated fistula, abscess, obstruction, or perforation) may, in addition to antibiotic therapy, require hospitalization and/or surgery to treat the associated complication.
