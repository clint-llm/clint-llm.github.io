When notifying the family members of patients who died suddenly, it is necessary to provide complete, correct information about the death. An accurate death notification may diminish the tendencies for survivors of the deceased to develop complicated health conditions, such as prolonged grief disorder (PGD) or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Proper death notification protocols are not only vital for family members but may also reduce adverse physiological and psychological responses experienced by clinicians in such stressful situations. Faced with delivering the difficult news of a patientâ€™s death under their care, clinicians and nurses commonly experience the following: excess cortisol upset and irregular heart rate, combined with feelings of sadness and disappointment resulting in insomnia. This hindrance to attention and concentration will negatively affect the high quality of care expected.
