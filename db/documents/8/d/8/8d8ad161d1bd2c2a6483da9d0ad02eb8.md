Monitoring depends on the setting of drug administration. If the clinician is giving the drug to increase systemic vascular resistance, then the patient should be maintained on continuous telemetry with ideally continuous monitoring of central venous pressure and arterial pressure. During a period of acute illness, the patient and will likely be under close monitoring in general; special consideration is necessary for cardiac rhythm and blood pressure.  If being given for anaphylaxis, the patient should be monitored in a hospital setting for at least ten hours, as anaphylaxis can have a biphasic onset related to the metabolism of the epinephrine.
