The World Health Organization (WHO) performed a large multinational study to determine gender distribution and infertility etiologies. In 37% of infertile couples, female infertility was the cause; in 35% of couples, both male and female causes were identified; in 8%, there was male factor infertility.

- Ovulatory disorders - 25%

- Endometriosis - 15%

- Pelvic adhesions - 12%

- Tubal blockage - 11%

- Other tubal/uterine abnormalities - 11%

- Hyperprolactinemia - 7%

Each of these causes will be further investigated in later portions of this paper. Male and unknown factors are outside the scope of this paper and will be discussed elsewhere. Even though these factors are not discussed here, it is important to realize that male factor infertility represents a substantial portion of the identifiable factors causing infertility.
