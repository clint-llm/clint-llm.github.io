A number of complications are associated with PLDs and PLFDs. Acute median neuropathy via acute carpal tunnel syndrome is common and requires a surgical release. Median neuropathy has a prevalence of 22–33% and is most common in stage IV injuries, in which the lunate dislocates from the lunate fossa into the carpal tunnel. Studies have shown various prevalence ranges from 29 to 45% in all comers of PLDs and PLFDs.
