Pancuronium, as with other non-depolarizing NMBDs, is a competitive inhibitor at the postjunctional nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor; normally, the postjunctional ACh receptor in skeletal muscle functions as a ligand-gated ion channel which binds ACh to allow passage of sodium ions to cause depolarization of the cell membrane leading to skeletal muscle contraction. The nicotinic ACh receptor has five subunits; alpha subunits are two of the five subunits and serve as the binding site for ACh and NMBDs. Pancuronium is a steroidal molecule that contains ACh-like moieties, facilitating binding to the alpha subunit. The binding of pancuronium to at least one of the alpha subunits causes a conformational change in the ACh receptor and causes the ion channel to remain closed, preventing ion passage and depolarization. Additionally,Â due to its large molecular size when compared to ACh, pancuronium may physically occlude the ion channel and prevent ion passage; this mechanism of ACh receptor blockade becomes more significant with an increased number of molecules present.

Pharmacokinetically, pancuronium is a highly ionized and water-soluble compound at physiologic pH. Because of the poor lipid solubility of pancuronium, it does not cross the blood-brain barrier to exert central nervous system effects, renal tubular reabsorption is minimal, and does not traverse the placenta with minimal fetal effects. Owing to the pancuronium's poor lipid solubility, the volume of distribution is nearly equivalent to circulating plasma volume. Redistribution and diffusion away from the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) contribute significantly to the clinical characteristics of the drug. Pancuronium gets cleared from the plasma primarily through renal excretion (80%). Hepatic degradation (10%) and biliary excretion (10%) play minor roles in the clearance of this drug. Hepatic deacetylation leads to several inactive metabolites and 3-desacetylpancuronium, which exhibits half to two-thirds of the potency of pancuronium at the NMJ; the effect of this metabolite can be clinically significant in renal impairment.

Pharmacodynamically, several drugs and clinical situations may either potentiate or diminish the clinical effect of pancuronium.

Drugs and clinical syndromes which potentiate neuromuscular blockade:

- Aminoglycoside antibiotics

- Local anesthetics

- Myasthenia gravis

- Duchenne muscular dystrophy

Drugs and clinical syndromes which diminish neuromuscular blockade:
