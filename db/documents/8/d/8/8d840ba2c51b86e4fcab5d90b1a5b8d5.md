In a retrospective analysis of patients presenting for cataract surgery to a tertiary care center, fifty patients had lens-induced glaucoma. They constituted 2.4 % of the 12,004 patients who underwent cataract surgery between 2005 and 2011. Thirty-nine (78%) of these patients had phacomorphic glaucoma, and 11 (22%) patients had phacolytic glaucoma. More than 40% of the patients had a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/200 or worse after cataract surgery.

Postoperatively, retained lens material or nuclear fragments may cause lens-induced uveitis after cataract surgery.

Phacogenic uveitis is an uncommon occurrence due to improvements in cataract surgery techniques. The diagnosis of lens-induced uveitis is also often retrospective. Only six cases were clinically recognized in a retrospective analysis of 144 eyes diagnosed histopathologically as phacoanaphylactic endophthalmitis or lens-induced uveitis.
