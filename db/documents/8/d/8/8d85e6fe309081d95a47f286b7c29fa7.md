Treatment of oligomenorrhea mainly depends on the underlying cause;

**Lifestyle Changes**

Oligomenorrhea, when caused by low basal metabolic index and stress levels, can be dealt with behavior modification, diet, psychotherapy, and stress reduction techniques. Anovulation, when caused by obesity, can be managed with weight reduction.

**Hormonal Therapy**

Birth control pills are often used to restore the regularity of the menstrual cycle, especially in Polycystic ovarian disease. They are safe to use, especially when the patient does not desire pregnancy.

**Treating The Underlying Medical Conditions**

If hyperthyroidism is the cause, then it is treated with antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy. If the etiology is Cushing syndrome, then it is treated with medication that blocks excess cortisol overproduction example, ketoconazole, mitotane, and metyrapone. Prolactinomas, if small, can be treated with dopamine agonists example, bromocriptine, and cabergoline.

**Surgical Management**

- Surgery may be necessary in the case of adnexal and adrenal tumors.

- Thyroidectomy may be necessary for hyperthyroidism.

- If prolactinoma is large enough to produce compressive symptoms, it may require surgical removal.
