**Primary Cardiac Tumors**

**Benign Tumors**

**Myxoma**

- Surgical removal of the myxoma is necessary due to the high risk of embolization secondary to the friable structure.

- It is important to have margins free of the tumor after the resection to prevent recurrence.

**Lipomas**

- In the absence of symptoms or arrhythmias, there is no need to intervene.

**Papillary Fibroelastoma**

- Left-sided papillary fibroelastomas should undergo surgical resection in patients with large mobile mass or with evidence of embolization.

**Rhabdomyoma**

- Most of these tumors regress spontaneously after birth, and resection rarely is necessary, except in cases of obstruction or arrhythmias.

**Fibroma**

- Complete surgical resection when is feasible is the recommendation.

**Cardiac Sarcomas**

The majority of sarcomas have an overall poor prognosis; some studies have found an increase in survival rate with complete surgical resection of the sarcoma compared with patients without surgical management. Surgical removal after diagnosis is the recommendation.

**Secondary Cardiac Tumors**

Treatment of the underlying malignancy will help with cardiac invasion, but very frequently, cardiac invasion or metastasis is a poor prognosis factor.

Management of pericardial effusion is via pericardial drainage, and if re-accumulation occurs, one can perform a pericardial window.
