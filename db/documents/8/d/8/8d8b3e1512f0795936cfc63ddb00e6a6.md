Scuba divers and freedivers are at risk for mask squeeze. Most are inexperienced. Swimmers wearing goggles or a mask that only covers

the eyes but not the nose may suffer injury from descending below the surface as well.

Data is limited to the number of annual injuries reported for this sub-type of dive-related barotrauma. Estimates that at least 500 dive-related barotrauma injuries occur each year in the U.S., but many cases go unreported as the injury is often mild. The Diver Alert Network (DAN) provides a reporting system and is the largest database of injuries reported.
