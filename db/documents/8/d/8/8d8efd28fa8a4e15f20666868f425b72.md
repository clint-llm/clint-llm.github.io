As mentioned in the introduction, MET primarily serves to improve range of motion and to reduce pain.

A handful of metanalyses have been performed to assess the effectiveness of MET in the treatment of various conditions, particularly of low back pain. While some yielded mixed results, there is an apparent consensus on the positive effects of MET on low back pain, with insufficient and inconsistent evidence to support its use inÂ other circumstances.
