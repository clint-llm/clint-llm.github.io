When using mifepristone to terminate a pregnancy or conception, caution is necessary to test out the patient populations with contraindications to mifepristone. Patients who have had a hypersensitivity reaction to mifepristone in the past or to prostaglandin therapy should not have mifepristone therapy. Hypersensitivity reactions include symptoms of anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, hives, and pruritis.

The use of mifepristone in Cushing syndrome patients is contraindicated in patients taking simvastatin, lovastatin, and CYP3A substrates (i.e., cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, sirolimus, and tacrolimus). Additionally, mifepristone is contraindicated in pregnant patients for the control of hyperglycemia.Â If the patient has a history of unexplained vaginal bleeding, endometrial cancer, or endometrial hyperplasia with signs of atypia, they should not receive mifepristone. Physicians need to be watchful for symptoms of abdominal pain, infection, sepsis, and vaginal bleeding after starting this medication. If these symptoms develop, the clinician should stop mifepristone immediately.
