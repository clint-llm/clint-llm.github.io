Hadad and Bassagasteguy’s description of the nasoseptal flap in 2006 is a landmark publication in anterior skull base surgery. The flap is now regarded as the workhorse of anterior skull base reconstruction and is by far the most versatile option for the endoscopic skull base surgeon, especially when combined with other local flaps. Utilization of the nasoseptal flap has significantly decreased morbidity for patients who would otherwise require free flap reconstruction or external approaches for other craniofacial-based local flaps.

Perhaps the greatest clinical significance of the nasoseptal flap lies in its reduction of CSF leak. In the early days of endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA), CSF leak was reportedly as high as 24%; however, recent studies suggest that with the nasoseptal flap, CSF leaks resulting from EEA are as low as 3%.

The indications for this flap are ever-expanding as more surgeons and specialties begin to utilize it. Reconstruction of the palate and pharynx are strategies that have only yet to be explored and combined with other local pharyngeal, palatal, and buccal flaps.
