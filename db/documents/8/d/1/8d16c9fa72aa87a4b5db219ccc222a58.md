Moyamoya disease (MMD) is an isolated chronic, usually bilateral, vasculopathy of undetermined etiology characterized by progressive narrowing of the terminal intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery and circle of Willis. Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) corresponds to the same moyamoya phenomenon but occurring in the background of either neurological or extra-neurological conditions, either inherited or acquired. A fragile network of abundant collateral vessels as a reaction to chronic brain ischemia develops predominantly at the base of the brain known as moyamoya vessels. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of moyamoya disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of moyamoya disease.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with moyamoya disease.
- Summarize the management options for moyamoya disease.
- Review the importance of enhanced coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by moyamoya disease.
