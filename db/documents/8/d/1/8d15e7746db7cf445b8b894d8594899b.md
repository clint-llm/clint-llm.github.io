Patients with late dumping syndrome can present autonomic or neuroglycopenic hypoglycemia symptoms months to years after the surgery, usually 1 to 3 hours after a meal. The consumption of large meals rich in simple carbohydrates exacerbates symptoms.

The autonomic symptoms can be anxiety, sweating, tremors, and palpitations. Neuroglycopenic symptoms include confusion, fatigue, light-headedness, slurred speech, blurred vision, and disorientation. Seizures or a coma may occur in severe cases.

Postprandial hypoglycemia is seen more commonly after RYGB, whereas meal-independent hypoglycemia occurs more commonly after Sleeve Gastrectomy.

Some individuals with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia may develop hypoglycemia unawareness defined as the development of symptoms of neuroglycopenia before the onset of autonomic warning symptoms.

There are no physical exam findings specific to this condition.
