The chief complaint of patients with cervical disc injury is neck pain with or without radiation to arm and fingers. Practitioners should obtain a thorough pain history that includes the severity, onset, duration, and characteristic of the pain. Other important information includes relieving, aggravating, and associated factors. Other symptomology includes muscle spasm, a decrease in mobility, and associated numbness or radicular pain.

A detailed physical examination of sensory and motor neurological examination should be performed. The doctor should assess the range of motion (ROM). The severity of pain, spasms, or degeneration affects flexion, extension, right and left rotation, and lateral flexion.
