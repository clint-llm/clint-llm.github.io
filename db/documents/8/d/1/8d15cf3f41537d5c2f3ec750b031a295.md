Due to the clearly defined anatomy of the fascial compartments of the male perineum, several clinical presentations are identifiable. In case of a traumatic injury to the penile urethra or penile fracture, if the Buck’s fascia remains intact, the extravasated blood is confined within the penile shaft, resulting in ecchymoses that are commonly described as an eggplant deformity. Traumatic rupture, secondary to straddle injuries that lead to the rupture of Buck’s fascia and the deep perineal fascia can cause the urine and blood to leak into the subcutaneous perineal pouch. The resulting hematoma and urine spread into the scrotum and the anterior wall, but it limited halfway between the pubic symphysis and the umbilicus due to the membranous layer of the superficial fascia of the anterior abdominal wall. The posterior spread is limited by the attachment of the Colle’s fascia to the perineal body.

The same anatomic pathways account for the progression of necrotizing fascitis - Fournier gangrene within the perineal region. The Buck fascia and the Colles fascia account for limiting the further progression of the fascitis beyond and beneath their attachments, which is secondary to obliterative endarteritis of the arteries supplying the region due to endotoxemia. The treatment of a case of Fournier’s gangrene is a surgical emergency and requires urgent surgical excision of the dead and infected tissue.
