Technical factors, such as seasonal variations in room temperature, time from specimen collection, tube orientation and inclination, and vibration, can affect the results.

A blood sample allowed to sit too long before starting the test will cause RBC sphering and decrease the ESR value. The test should be run within two hours of collection.Â A clotted blood sample will inhibit rouleaux formation and decrease the ESR.
