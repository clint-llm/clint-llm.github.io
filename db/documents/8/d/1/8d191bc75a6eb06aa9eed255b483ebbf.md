AMI is a life-threatening disorder and is very difficult to diagnose. The disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a radiologist, general surgeon, internist, emergency department physician, and a gastroenterologist. If time allows, the patient should be seen by a stoma nurse, because if the bowel is found to be necrotic, most patients end up with the colostomy/ileostomy.

The outcomes for patients with this disorder are guarded. Many patients are elderly with other comorbidities. Every effort should be made to adequately resuscitate the patient prior to surgery.
