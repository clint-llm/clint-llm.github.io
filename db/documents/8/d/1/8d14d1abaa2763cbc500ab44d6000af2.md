This condition is primarily a degenerative overuse process of the extensor carpi radialis brevis and the common extensor tendon. Aside from degenerative changes, the histological findings include granulation tissue, micro-rupture, an abundance of fibroblasts, vascular hyperplasia, unstructured collagen, and a notable lack of traditional inflammatory cells (macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils) within the tissue. The term has been previously described as angiofibroblastic dysplasia based on multiple histologic studies describing its microscopic appearance and characteristics.
