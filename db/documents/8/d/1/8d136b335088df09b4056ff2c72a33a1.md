The term "hyperglycemia" is derived from the Greek hyper (high) + glykys (sweet/sugar) + haima (blood). Hyperglycemia is blood glucose greater than 125 mg/dL while fasting and greater than 180 mg/dL 2 hours postprandial. A patient has impaired glucose tolerance, or pre-diabetes, with a fasting plasma glucose of 100 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of hyperglycemia, its presentation, complications and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the causes of hyperglycemia.
- Review the history and physical exam findings expected in a patient with hyperglycemia.
- Summarize the treatment options for hyperglycemia.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by hyperglycemia.
