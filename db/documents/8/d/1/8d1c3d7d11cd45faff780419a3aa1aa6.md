The definitive therapy for Lp-X induced dyslipidemia is to treat the underlying cause.  For instance, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can be used for treating obstructive cholestasis. Cholesterol-lowering medications, such as statins and ezetimibe, are unnecessary when Apo B100 is below 90mg/dL because this suggests that dyslipidemia is caused by Lp-X formation. In fact, statins are not effective because Lp-X does not undergo LDL receptor-mediated hepatic clearance.

Cholestasis also could lead to the accumulation of toxic levels of statins because bile excretion is affected. Ezetimibe is also not effective because of how the medication functions. It works by helping to reduce intestinal cholesterol absorption.
