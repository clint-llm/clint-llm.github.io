Salmeterol is a highly selective, long-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonist indicated in the treatment of asthma, maintenance of airflow obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB).

Following the approval in 1994 of salmeterol xinafoate, the FDA approved fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/SAL) as a fixed-dose combination therapy for the treatment of asthma and COPD. Fluticasone/salmeterol combination provides sustained bronchodilation, prevention of exacerbation, improved lung function, and reduced rescue medicine use.

Salmeterol is ten times more potent than its chemical analog albuterol. Additionally, it has a much higher beta-2/beta-1 selectivity ratio than albuterol, with a ratio of 50,000 to 1 vs. 650 to 1.

A head-to-head study comparing the use of salmeterol and salbutamol (albuterol) revealed clinically superior results of inhaled salmeterol, providing sustained bronchodilatation and better prevention of the symptoms of asthma than salbutamol. These results measured pulmonary function, peak expiratory flow, the need for a supplemental bronchodilator, frequency of nocturnal awakening, and the occurrence and severity of daily symptoms of asthma.

Salmeterol is used for prophylaxis of mild to moderate asthma and COPD and should never be used to treat acute bronchospasm.
