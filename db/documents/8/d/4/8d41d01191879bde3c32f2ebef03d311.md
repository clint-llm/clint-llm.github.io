Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a developmental anomaly of the vascular system, consisting of tangles of poorly formed blood vessels in which the feeding arteries are directly connected to a venous drainage network without any interposed capillary system. AVMs can occur anywhere in the body, however, brain AVMs are of special concern because of the inherent high risk of bleeding of the abnormal blood vessels that can cause neurological damage. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, presentation, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of AVMs in the brain.
- Outline the presentation of brain AVMs.
- Describe the treatment and management options available for brain AVMs
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with brain AVMs.
