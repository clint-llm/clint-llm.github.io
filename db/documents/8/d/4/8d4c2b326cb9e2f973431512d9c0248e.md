According to recent studies (meta-analysis), Cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC are associated with morbidity and mortality of approximately 33% and 2.8%, respectively.

Particular complications associated with the procedure are prolonged intestinal atony, increased fluid movement over the abdomen, delayed wound healing, and prolonged hospitalization.

Cases of intrathoracic chemotherapy have been described in cases of major surgery with diaphragm perforation.

Have been identified as risk factors for this procedure's serious complications: the general condition of the patient, age, the extent of peritoneal carcinoma, duration of the intervention, number of peritonectomy procedures, number of anastomoses, the quality of cytoreduction, and the dosage of intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

Other complications have been observed which are not related only to theÂ HIPEC but are well associated with cytoreduction: Pancreatitis, fistula, Pulmonary embolism, and thrombosis.
