Distributive shock is very common in clinical practice and carries high morbidity and mortality.Â  To improve outcomes, the distributive shock is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes ICU nurses, internists, and physicians from many specialties. The majority of these patients require ICU care and thus the role of the nurse cannot be overstated. The key is to maintain a perfusion pressure of at least 65 mmHg. Fluids are usually the first choice treatment followed by the use of vasopressors. The primary cause of distributive shock must be identified and treated if the outcome is to be improved. Nurses have to monitor the patient for urine output, hemodynamic stability, oxygenation, ventilation and provide prophylaxis against DVT and stress ulcers. The dietitian should be involved early as evidence shows that early enteral nutrition results in better outcomes. The infectious disease consultant and nurse should make recommendations on antibiotics and control of sepsis. The pharmacist should ensure that the patient is on the right antibiotics; in addition, drugs that harm the kidney should be avoided. Clinical rounds must be made by the interprofessional team on a daily basis to make goal care plans and communicate any problems with others.
