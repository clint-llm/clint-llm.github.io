Most infectious Disease specialists advocate obtaining bone culture from the site of the infection in order to treat with culture directed therapy.  Bone is sometimes visible or palpable in chronic wounds and can easily be obtained in the clinic using a rongeur.  For deeper wounds or if there is no way to obtain bone in the clinic, patients will need referral either to surgery or interventional radiology to obtain a specimen for gram stain, AFB and culture and sensitivity.
