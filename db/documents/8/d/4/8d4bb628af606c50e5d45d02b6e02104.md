Treatment of fine motor disability is dependent on the underlying etiology. Below is a non-exhaustive list of interventions for different causes of fine motor disability to highlight the variation in management.

Surgical intervention- Anterior/posterior decompression for cervical myelopathy for example

Noninvasive brain stimulation- Using noninvasive magnetic pulses in stroke patients has been shown as a potential novel treatment to improve manual dexterity

Deep brain stimulation- For patients with Parkinson disease and other acquired movement disorders

Musical training- Has been shown to increase manual dexterity in stroke survivors

Pharmacological intervention- For example, targeting movement disorder pathways (carbidopa/levodopa in Parkinson's)

Physiotherapy and occupational therapy in stroke and other neuropsychological etiologies of fine motor disability
