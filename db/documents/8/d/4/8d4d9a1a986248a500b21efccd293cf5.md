**False positive test results:**

1. Helicobacter heilmannii also has urease activity and can produce positive results in UBT.

2. Patients with achlorhydria can also have false-positive UBT results.Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freunii, and Staphylococcus aureus has been reported to cause false positive UBT.

3. Some of the oral flora have urease activity, and contamination with oral flora could also result in false positive results.

**False negative test results:**

1. Recent use of medications which interfere with H. pylori such as antibiotics, bismuth compounds, and, PPIs.

2. Similarly, following the H. pylori eradication, the UBT should be done at least four weeks after the completion of treatment. If done earlier, the result could be falsely negative.

3. In patients with H. pylori infection predominantly in the body (corpus) of the stomach, data shows a higher proportion of false negative results with 13C-UBT.
