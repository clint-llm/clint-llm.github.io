Adrenergic drugs are a broad class of medications that bind to adrenergic receptors throughout the body. These receptors include: alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2, beta-3. Adrenergic drugs will bind directly to one or more of these receptors to induce various physiologic effects. Adrenergic drugs must be classified based on the specific receptors they bind. This activity examines the pharmacology, various therapeutic effects, and adverse events that class members can exert, which covers a wide variety of clinical manifestations.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the various actions of adrenergic medications based on the receptor to which they bind.
- Describe the various adverse effects of adrenergic drugs based on the binding site.
- Review the contraindications to various adrenergic drugs based on their preferred binding sites.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team leading to improved patient care when using adrenergic agents.
