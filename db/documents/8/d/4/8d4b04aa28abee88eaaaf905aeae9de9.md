Fresnel prisms are used to relieve diplopia. These can be used in fourth and sixth nerve palsies, restrictive motility secondary to thyroid-related orbitopathy, and convergence insufficiency. Only some patients better accept these in comparison to conventional prisms. These are also used in patients temporarily before surgery. This helps confirm the deviation in prism dioptres and better surgical planning. After surgery, Fresnel prisms play an essential role in avoiding postoperative diplopia.

Flanders et al.Â shared their clinical experience among 141 patients prescribed Fresnel prisms. They reported that 90% of 127 patients received Fresnel prisms over the non-dominant eye. Of the patients, 80% had a successful outcome, with relief of double vision. There was a dropout of 6%; eight patients discontinued prism because of decreased vision with prisms, persistent double vision, torsion, or optical aberrations.
