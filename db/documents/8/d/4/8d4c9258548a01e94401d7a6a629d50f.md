A well functioning efficient interprofessional team is necessary to execute the appropriate clinical measures needed to treat patients with sepsis because time management is critical in predicting the overall outcomes. A well-established consensus committee of 55 international experts, representing 25 international organizations, formulated the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines with the most recent iteration developed in 2016. In the guidelines, recommendations are made concerning the hospital-derived analytical processes that should be implemented to assess the effectiveness of each institution's sepsis protocol. The proposals include target metrics to monitor goal attainment, data collection, and ongoing feedback criticizing the effectiveness of the program. These recommendations are made based on the meta-analysis of 50 observational studies, illustrating that performance improvement programs had a direct correlation with a significant increase in compliance with the study's guidelines, thus a reduction in mortality. It is not enough to simply mandate compliance with an established sepsis protocol; there must be a recognized method by which adherence, efficiency of execution, and overall outcomes can be analyzed.
