Two approved forms of administration exist for megestrol: tablet form and concentrated oral suspension form. In addition, a newly synthesized nanocrystal oral suspension form is currently under investigation for improving bioavailability in the fasting state and optimizing bioavailability and delivery. The tablet form is available as a 20 mg or 40 mg tablet, while the concentrated oral suspension form is available at 40 mg/1mL or a more concentrated form of 125 mg/1mL. The 40 mg oral tablet is usually prescribed four times a day as a starting dosage until a maximum dosage of 800 mg. In contrast, the liquid form is prescribed for once-daily administration.

Literature has indicated that dosages can vary from 100 mg to 1600 mg/day for appetite stimulation. Megestrol demonstrates a positive dose-response effect for improving appetite. Megestrol is typically recommended for a minimum of six weeks. The dosage ranges from 480 to 600 mg/day for the treatment of neoplastic disease. The most common dosages for endometrial cancer or atypical hyperplasia are 160 to 400 mg daily. The initial adult dosage of the oral suspension form for HIV patients is 800 mg/day.

**Specific Patient Population**

**Patients with Hepatic Impairment:**No information regarding the use of megestrol in patients with hepatic impairment is provided in the product labeling. However, the metabolism of megestrol is primarily hepatic by cytochrome P450 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs). Therefore, clinicians should exercise caution when prescribing megestrol to patients with hepatic impairment. CYP3A4 may also metabolize megestrol; drug interaction can occur with other CYP3A4 substrates.

**Patient with Renal Impairment:**Megestrol is significantly excreted by the kidney, so dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with impaired renal function. Additionally, geriatric patients are more likely to have impaired renal function. Consequently, clinicians should closely monitor renal function and adjust the dose accordingly.

**Pregnancy Considerations:**Megestrol is categorized as a Category-X drug (FDA category), making it an absolute contraindication during pregnancy. Women of childbearing age should use effective birth control and notify the prescribing physician immediately if they become pregnant during treatment. If the patient becomes pregnant while receiving megestrol, the clinician should inform the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus.

**Breastfeeding Considerations:**According to the product labeling, there are potential adverse effects on the newborn when megestrol is used during breastfeeding; consequently, breastfeeding should be stopped if megestrol is required.
