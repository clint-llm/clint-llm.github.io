Corneal disease ranks as the fifth leading cause of blindness in the world.

**History of Corneal Transplantation**

Modern corneal transplantation techniques represent the culmination of centuries of ideas, experimentation, and perseverance. The French surgeon Pellier de Quengsy was the first to suggest the use of a transparent material to replace an opaque cornea in 1789.

**Recent Developments**

Scientific advances in immunology, surgical technique, and tissue banking have shaped corneal transplantation into the field it is today.

Gerrit Melles described a posterior lamellar keratoplasty (PLK), whereby only a portion of the cornea was transplanted. Following an incision at the limbus, the endothelium, Descemetâ€™s membrane (DM) and posterior stroma were dissected out and replaced by a donor button consisting of the same corneal layers that were held in place by an air bubble.

A selective keratoplasty technique that relates to the anterior cornea is the deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK), whereby a donor button replaces the epithelium, Bowman's layer, and stroma.
