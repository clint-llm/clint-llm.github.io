Patients with hibernomas are often asymptomatic. Occasionally patients present with a "pressure" type of pain or discomfort related to mass effect. Hibernomas are also typically mobile and pliable.

- Rapid subjective growth of a soft tissue mass

- Associated axillary or inguinal pain indicating associated lymphadenopathy

- Known personal history of malignancy or family history of malignancy

- Unexpected weight loss

Physical exam also has a limited role in evaluating hibernomas. Hibernomas are often warm to touch owing to their vascularity, otherwise, the physical exam features of these neoplasms are nonspecific. A clinician should evaluate for the following when evaluating a subcutaneous mass:

- Size of the neoplasm

- Fixed or mobile nature of the mass on palpation

- Overlying ulceration of the skin

- Associated lymphadenopathy

- Evaluation for additional subcutaneous neoplasms
