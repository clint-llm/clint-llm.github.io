Surgical procedures in the arteries of the posterior fossa require a great fund of anatomical knowledge. Understanding anatomical variations are the first step in carrying out successful procedures. For example, the position (proximal or distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery) and nature of an aneurysm (ability to maneuver micro-catheter into an aneurysm) are important factors that determine if surgery or endovascular treatment will be used. With a proximal anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms, a skull base surgery is mostly used with an aneurysm being clipped or trapped and resected.

Endovascular treatment is mostly used in distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms and has been discouraged in proximal anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms.
