Follow-up care is a matter of personal preference and will depend on the type of repair performed. If a distal ureteral injury is repaired with reimplantation into the bladder, and a cystotomy is required, a Foley catheter should be left in place postoperatively for 7 to 10 days. Sources vary on the length of time a ureteral stent should be left in place. Some sources recommend keeping the stent in place for up to 6 weeks; others advocate removal after 14 days. This is up to the discretion of the practitioner. At the time of stent removal, an RPG can be obtained to document healing without leakage or stenosis. Continued follow up with renal ultrasounds to ensure no restenosis of the ureter occurs is recommended.
