As discussed in previous sections, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an important role in maintaining cell homeostasis. Changes in this process can lead to the formation of tumors and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, pharmacological treatments targeted at the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway provide potential opportunities to treat tumors and neurodegenerative disorders. For example, the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 plays an essential role in regulating P53 stability, and research is focusing on developing an inhibitor that disrupts this interaction. However, creating therapeutic targets against a specific ubiquitination enzyme is challenging because multiple ubiquitin E3 ligases ubiquitinate one protein, and targeting one enzyme may not be adequate. Proteasome inhibition is the only validated therapeutic target of the ubiquitin system. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, was approved in 2003 by the FDA to treat relapsing and refractory multiple myeloma.

Ubiquitin immunohistochemistry has played a crucial role in understanding the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and aiding in diagnosing these disorders. Inclusions (protein aggregates) containing ubiquitinated proteins are present in Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease.
