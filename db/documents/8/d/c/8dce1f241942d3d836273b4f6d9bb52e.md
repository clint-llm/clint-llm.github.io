The spinal cord receives both longitudinal and segmental blood supply.  The vasculature is highly complex and anastomotic, which ensures adequate delivery to the entire structure.  Longitudinally, the anterior spinal artery (ASA) and a pair of posterior spinal arteries (PSAs) are the predominant supply of the spinal cord.  The three arteries branch from the distal vertebral arteries at the base of the skull.  The three vessels connect circumferentially around the cord as the vaso-corona to supply the entire periphery of the cord.
