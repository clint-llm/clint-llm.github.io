Neonatal cases of COVID-19 infection are mostly due to horizontal transmission. Vertical transmissions have been reported.

Even though the exact etiology of MIS-C is speculative, it is postulated that MIS-C occurs due to a hyperinflammatory response after symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection rather than direct cell injury from the virus. Hence, there are a few possible etiologies:

- Maternal covid-19 infection and transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies

- Transplacental transfer of maternal infection and endogenous production of antibodies

- Neonatal COVID-19 infection and post-infectious immune response.
