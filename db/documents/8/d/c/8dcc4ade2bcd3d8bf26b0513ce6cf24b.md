The definitive management of complete atrioventricular canal defect (CAVCD) is the surgical correction of the defect as early as possible. However, overall management can be divided into three parts. Initial medical management, definitive surgical correction, and long-term follow-up care.

The timing of correction is preferably before 6 months of age, as the risk of developing the pulmonary vascular disease is directly related to the duration of the disease.

**Complete AVCD**

1. Balanced lesion

Primary complete repair

- Single-patch

- Double-patch

- Modified single-patch

2. Unbalanced lesion

Palliative intervention: Single ventricle palliation (usually done for HLHS and tricuspid atresia)

**Partial and Intermediate AVCD**

Primary surgical repair

- Patch closure

- Mitral valvuloplasty

**Long-term Follow-up Care**

Annual cardiologist evaluation is recommended to check for and prevent complications in uncorrected individuals and due to surgery. Children with AVCD are at risk for neurological impairment; hence routine screening for neurological and developmental disorders is advised. The other general measures that have to be taken care of are infective endocarditis prophylaxis and risk assessment during pregnancy.
