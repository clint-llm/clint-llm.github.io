**Immobilization:**patients should be immobilized; the recommended period varies from 3 to 10 weeks.

**Weightbearing status:**Patients can be allowed partial weight bearing while immobilized.

**Outcome measures:**In assessing the functional outcome of the repair, several scoring systems can be used. Some scoring systems are tailored specifically by surgeons, as inÂ Siwek and Rao and Rougraff et al., who introduced their own functional assessment.

- The Lysholm score

- Isometric evaluation

- Manual evaluation of muscular strength

- Isokinetic evaluation of muscular strength
