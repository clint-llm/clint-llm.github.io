The management of type 1 diabetes mellitus entails replacing the actions of the beta cells of the pancreatic islet to detect the need for insulin and to have insulin administered according to the requirements of the patient's body. This activity reviews the indications for the use of insulin, its mechanism of action, routes of administration, contraindications, adverse effects, monitoring its blood concentrations, and toxicity. It also describes in detail how insulin leads to shifts of electrolytes between the intracellular and extracellular compartments. Also, this activity summarizes the cellular production of insulin and its function via its receptor and the numerous effects on carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the action of insulin on glucose metabolism.
- Review the synthesis of insulin in pancreatic beta cells.
- Outline the relationship between insulin and potassium and its importance in the management of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication about the use of insulin to enhance outcomes for patients affected by diabetes mellitus.
