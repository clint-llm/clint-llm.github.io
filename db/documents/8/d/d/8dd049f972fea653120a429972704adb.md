The clinical significance of the infratemporal fossa involves neoplastic and infectious processes that can either arise from this area or spread to it. Pathology found in this region tends to spread posteriorly due to anterior, medial, and lateral bony barriers present in the infratemporal fossa. Symptoms experienced from pathology present in this region include trismus and any manifestation of mandibular nerve compression including paresis of mastication muscles, numbness or loss of taste sensation from the tongue, anesthesia of the gums, or speech articulation difficulties.

Neoplastic tumors that have been documented in the infratemporal fossa are numerous and include rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma, meningioma, hemangioma, and peripheral nerve sheath tumors arising from any of the nerves in this region. Schwannomas and neurofibromas are typically found between the pterygoid muscles due to the location of the lingual and inferior alveolar nerves in this region. Hemangiomas arising from the pterygoid venous plexus can also be seen in this area often between the lateral pterygoid and temporalis muscles.

The infratemporal fossa also provides a space into which tumors originating from other regions can spread. Tumors found in the nasopharynx and sphenoid sinus are known to spread to the infratemporal fossa. Meningiomas can spread to the infratemporal fossa through the foramen ovale and often push the lateral and medial pterygoids apart. Due to the continuity of the infratemporal fossa with the inferior parapharyngeal space, larger neoplasms have the potential to spread to this region.

Although rare, infectious processes including abscesses can be seen within the infratemporal fossa. As previously mentioned, infections in the infratemporal can spread to the cavernous sinus and cause cavernous sinus thrombosis. Due to the complex anatomy of the infratemporal fossa, a multidisciplinary team-based approach involving otolaryngology and oral-maxillofacial surgery is often employed to treat these issues surgically.
