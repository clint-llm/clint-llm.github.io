It is critical to determine the extent of disease before initiating treatment because the approach is different for localized versus disseminated germinoma. Neuroimaging with MRI and lumbar puncture for CSF cytology is essential for the staging of the tumor. Imaging can demonstrate the extent of central nervous system (CNS) involvement by the tumor. The presence of neoplastic cells in the CSF indicates metastatic disease, and patients are treated more aggressively with CSI for better outcomes. Direct visualization of the third ventricle can also be utilized in determining the involvement of the suprasellar region, not evident on initial imaging.

There are no recommended TNM based staging guidelines for intracranial tumors. However, the modified Chang system for medulloblastoma can be employed.

- **M0:**No evidence of metastatic disease

- **M1:**Tumor cells detected on CSF cytology

- **M2:**Intracranial metastases

- **M3:**Spinal metastases
