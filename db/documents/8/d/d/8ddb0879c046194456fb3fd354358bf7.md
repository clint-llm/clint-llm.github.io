Due to the nature of this injury, a full neurovascular assessment is crucial during the initial presentation. This evaluation should include documentation of radial and ulnar pulses with nerve function (radial, ulnar, median, and anterior interosseous).

Plain radiographs should be obtained, including anteroposterior, lateral, and internal oblique views of the affected elbow. Because the fractured fragment will frequently lie posterolaterally, an internal oblique view is often useful in detecting minimally displaced fractures (<2 mm).

Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in assessing the integrity of the articular cartilage.

Multiple classifications have been suggested for pediatric lateral humeral condyle fractures. The classification by Milch et al. distinguishes between a type I and a type II pattern. Type I is characterized by a fracture line lateral to the trochlear groove. Because it does not extend to the trochlear groove, this is considered a stable fracture. Type II extends medially into the trochlear groove, thus creating a potentially unstable elbow.

A second classification by Jakob and then Weiss divides fracture patterns into three types according to displacement and congruency of the articular cartilage. Type I has less than 2mm displacement. Type II has ≥2mm displacement but intact articular cartilage. In type III, there is also ≥2mm displacement but associated disruption of the articular surface.
