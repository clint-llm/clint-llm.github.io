Pericardial calcification in the absence of symptoms does not require any treatment. Subacute cases of constrictive pericarditis with underlying inflammation may respond to anti-inflammatory therapy (such as colchicine, corticosteroids, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).

Diuretics have been used in the early stages of constrictive pericarditis to improve pulmonary and systemic congestion. These must be used cautiously because any drop in intravascular volume may cause a corresponding drop in cardiac output.
