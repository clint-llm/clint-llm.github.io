CAP leads to pericardial effusion, tamponade, cardiogenic shock, myocardial infarction, and even death. Hence the necessity of understanding the type and severity of perforation. Ellis classification is the most common system used in classifying CAPs. Based on the coronary angiographic findings, these are divided into three types, as follows

**Type I:**Presence of extraluminal crater without extravasation

**Type II:**Presence of pericardial or myocardial blush without contrast jet extravasation

**Type III:**Presence of contrast jet extravasation through frank perforation (â‰¥1 mm)

**Type III (CS):**Presence of contrast jet extravasation into the cavities like a cardiac chamber or coronary sinus
