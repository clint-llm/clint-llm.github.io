Lightning carries with it a tremendous amount of energy.  A bolt of lightning can carry a voltage exceeding 10 million volts with a massive current typically between 30 thousand to 110 thousand amperes. The temperature of a lightning bolt is also extremely hot, reportedly as high as 30 thousand Kelvin.  Lighting can be both negatively and positively changed, and can take the form of both direct and alternating current.  A victim’s exposure typically last from 1/1000 to 1/10 of a second. Not all lightning injuries occur during the same manner with injuries being classified as a direct strike, side splash, contact injury, or ground current.  Direct strikes are rare, accounting for 5%, and occur when a person is directly struck by lightning creating an uninterrupted connection between the person and the bolt.  Contact injuries occur by touching an object that is struck.  Side splash accounts for one-third of injuries and happens when the current jumps or "splashes" from a nearby object then following the path of least resistance to an individual. Ground current is the most common mechanism of injury, accounting for one-half, and occurs when lightning strikes an object/ground near an individual and then travels through the ground to an individual.
