Over the years, paying special attention to the technical approach of ECMO has led to its refinement. As it is necessary to have a vast composition of interprofessional teams, every member needs to be on board and have direct lines of communication when involved in the day-to-day clinical course. Effective teamwork must involve every healthcare team member, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs) of all specialties, nurses, pharmacists, perfusionists, respiratory therapists, technicians—plays an invaluable role. Each patient has their own individualized management when initiating and weaning ECMO. This interprofessional approach will drive improved patient results. [Level 5]

Weaning trials should begin as soon as the patient has sufficiently recovered from their disease process and is hemodynamically stable. However, being prepared means that contingency plans are discussed beforehand and that all necessary personnel is accessible in case there is a need to go back onto full ECMO support. Being prepared also means acknowledging morbidity and mortality is inevitable. After all, ECMO is often utilized as a last resort to restore life in extremely sick children. Despite the delicacy and potential for adverse outcomes, there are decades of ongoing support for ECMO as a mainstream salvage therapy for neonatal and pediatric patients experiencing severe, medically refractory cardiorespiratory failure.
