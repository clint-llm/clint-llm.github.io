Emergency department providers must ensure the seamless transfer of medical records, including relevant labs and imaging, to outpatient clinics for appropriate follow-up. In the outpatient setting, convenient scheduling of frequent appointments is critical, as well as clear instructions for patients on when to present to the clinic versus emergency department for persistent symptoms. Finally, although the medical aspects of miscarriage management can be complicated, the psychological well being of the patient and her family cannot be neglected.
