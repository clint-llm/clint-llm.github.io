Chemical peeling, also known as chemexfoliation or chemical exfoliation, is a procedure where a chemical substance applied to the skin causes controlled destruction of the epidermis with or without part of the dermis, leading to skin regeneration and remodeling. Chemical peels can be used to treat various skin conditions, such as acne vulgaris, photodamage, pigmentary disorders, and scars.
