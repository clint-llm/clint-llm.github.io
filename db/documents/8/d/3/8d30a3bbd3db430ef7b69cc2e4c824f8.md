Multiple questionnaires have been developed to aid in the evaluation of sleep paralysis. Some examples include the Sleep Paralysis Experiences and Phenomenology Questionnaire (SP-EPQ), The Unusual Sleep Experiences Questionnaire (USEQ), and multiple questionnaires that assess for the risk factors of sleep paralysis, for example, Beck Depression Inventory, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, Clinician-Administered PTSD scale, Hamington Anxiety Rating Scale, and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale.
