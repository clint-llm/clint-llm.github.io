It is crucial to solidify an accurate diagnosis before starting treatment and establish a follow-up plan.  Topical corticosteroids are the standard treatment for anterior uveitis; however, they can increase intraocular pressure (IOP).  Consequently, the patient must have ophthalmology follow up to monitor for resolution and to monitor IOP.  Prolonged or undertreated intraocular inflammation can lead to pathological changes in the eye resulting in permanent vision loss.  These complications include cataracts, posterior synechiae, epiretinal membrane (ERM), cystoid macular edema (CME), band keratopathy, hypotony, glaucoma, and optic nerve edema.
