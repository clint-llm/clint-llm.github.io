The diagnosis and management of central cord syndrome are with an interprofessional team consisting of a neurologist, physiatrist, emergency department physician, neurosurgeon, trauma physician, intensive care unit nurses, physical therapist, internist, and neurology specialty nurses. Once diagnosed, high-dose corticosteroids are theÂ first-line treatment if indicated. Surgery may be an option for select patients.

Most patients show recovery with physical therapy, but the recovery is not always complete. Recovery typically begins with lower limb function, then the proximal arms, and finally, hands and bladder/bowel function. Besides, the recovery may take months or even years, and these patients are prone to pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, urinary tract infections, and muscle wasting. The key is to have the surgeons involved early in the care because, in some cases, surgical decompression may help boost recovery.
