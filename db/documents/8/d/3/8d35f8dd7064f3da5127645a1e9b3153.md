Warfarin toxicity is assessable through signs and symptoms of bleeding, as well as the determination of a supratherapeutic INR level. The risk of bleeding is significantly greater with increased INR, especially above 5.0. When managing warfarin toxicity, the initial step would be to discontinue warfarin and then administer vitamin K (phytonadione). The vitamin K may administration can be either via the oral, intravenous, or subcutaneous route. However, the initial administration of oral vitamin K is often preferable in patients without major bleeding or extremely elevated INR. A reduction in INR should occur within 24 hours of administration. After that, the recommendation is for intravenous vitamin K administration if necessary. Subcutaneous vitamin K is often not recommended for warfarin toxicity or reversal due to erratic and unpredictable absorption. Administering agents like prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and activated Factor VII may be considered for cases of significant bleeding.
