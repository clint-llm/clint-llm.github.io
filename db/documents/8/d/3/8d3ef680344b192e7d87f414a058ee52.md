Patients with Cushing syndrome have suppressed hypophyseal pituitary axis (HPA) and should have glucocorticoids administered once adrenalectomy is done until the HPA has recovered, which may take a few months.

Patients with hyperaldosteronism should receive mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in preparation for adrenalectomy and alsoÂ get repleted with potassium. Postoperatively, improvement of blood pressure may take a few weeks to months.
