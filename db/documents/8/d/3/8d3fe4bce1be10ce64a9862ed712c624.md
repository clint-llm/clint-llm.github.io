Epididymitis if not treated properly or promptly can lead to the following complications:

- Infection of the epididymis can lead to the formation of an epididymal abscess

- Progression of the infection can lead to the involvement of the testicle, causing epididymo-orchitis or a testicular abscess

- Sepsis is a potential consequence of severe infection

- Bilateral epididymitis may result in sterility due to occlusion of the ductules from peritubular fibrosis
