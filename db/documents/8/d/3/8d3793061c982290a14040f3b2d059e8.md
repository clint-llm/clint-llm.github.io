Photomicrographs of histological sections of various sample cartilages have previously been stained by Alcian blue or with specific antibodies against proteoglycans (decorin, biglycan, and aggrecan) chondroitin (chondroitin-6-sulfate, chondroitin-0-sulfate, and chondroitin-4-sulfate), and keratan sulfate, or type I and II collagen. Researchers have also used the SAM (significance analysis of microarrays) technique to mark the chondrocytes sample with low chondrogenic capacity. These samples displayed higher levels of catabolic genes (aggrecanase 2, matrix metalloproteinase 2, etc.) and insulin-like growth factor 1. High chondrogenic capacity holding chondrocytes displayed high levels of cell-matrix or cell-cell contacting genes (CD49f, CD49c, etc.). According to flow cytometry analysis, CD44, CD49c, and CD151 showed significant distribution in higher chondrogenic capacity holding chondrocytes. The analysis further indicated that CD151 and CD44 hold the capability to detect more chondrogenic clones. Chondrocytes put under brighter CD49c or CD44 signal expression yielded tissues with higher amounts of GAG/ DNA (1.4-fold max) and type II collagen mRNA (3.4-fold max) than did non-brightened cells.
