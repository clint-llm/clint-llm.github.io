Perinatal evaluation should include a search for the additional central nervous system (CNS) and extra-CNS malformations. Mega cisterna magna was initially evaluated by ventriculography which is rarely employed. Mega cisterna magna may now be evaluated with ultrasonography in the fetus or newborn before fontanelle closure.

Following fontanelle closure, the mega cisterna magna is best evaluated by computed tomography (CT) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain with and without contrast as the gold standard to rule out similar appearing pathologies. Radiographically, the mega cisterna magna appears as a prominent retrocerebellar CSF appearing space measuring greater than 10 mm on mid-sagittal images with a normal cerebellar vermis and ventricular caliber.

It is critical to exclude ventriculomegaly and cerebellar hypoplasia before diagnosing mega cisterna magna. Additionally, there should be a lack of associated enhancement. Clinically, a neuropsychiatric evaluation could be considered if there is any clinical concern.
