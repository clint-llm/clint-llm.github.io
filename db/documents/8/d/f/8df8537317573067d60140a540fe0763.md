Multiple genes impacting the cohesin pathway's function have been the target of study in patients with CdLS.

Concerning mutations, they can involve different genes, including NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, BRD4, HDAC8, RAD21, ANKRD11. The mutation is associated with different clinical expressions of the syndrome. Of note, there is proof of mosaicism in up to 20% of individuals with typical CdLS features.

**Autosomal Genes Involved**

- **NIPBL**(Nipped-B-like protein of chromosome 5): The mutation is associated with the classical CdLS phenotype.

- **SMC3**(structural maintenance of chromosomes 3, 10q25): It is associated with atypical CdLS forms featuring predominant mental retardation.

- **RAD21**(human homolog of Schizosaccharomyces pombe radiation-sensitive mutant 21): It is rarely observed and associated with a non-classic CdLS phenotype.

- **BRD4**(Bromodomain-containing protein 4): There are few cases reported to describe the precise phenotype. Research into this form has described mosaicism.

- **ANKRD11**(ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 11): It is associated with a non-classic CdLS phenotype.

**X-linked Genes**

- **HDAC8**(histone deacetylase 8): Although individuals display a non-classic phenotype, some individuals show classic CdLS features.

- **SMC1A**or**SMC1L1**(structural maintenance of chromosomes 1A, Xp11.22-p11.21): It is associated with a non-classic phenotype.
