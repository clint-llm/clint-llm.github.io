**Clinical Presentation**

As mentioned previously, approximately 4% of the general population have an elongated styloid process. Although the majority of these individuals are asymptomatic,Â a small percentage of those with an elongated styloid process show symptoms and can present with one of two types of Eagle syndrome.

The second type of Eagle syndrome is known as stylocarotid artery syndrome, which occurs when the styloid process impinges upon the internal or external carotid artery and the nerve plexus accompanying them. It presents as pharyngeal pain, eye pain, or parietal cephalgia, resembling a migraine or a cluster headache. Compression of the internal carotid artery might present with symptoms of internal carotid vascular insufficiency such as weakness, visual changes, or syncope exacerbated with head movement. The elongated styloid process might also pose the risk of carotid artery dissection leading to a transient ischemic attack or stroke.

Studies analyzing the possible correlation of styloid process length and severity of symptoms have so far been inconclusive.

**Diagnosis**

Diagnosis of Eagle syndrome depends on the patient's clinical presentation, radiological investigation, and lidocaine infiltration test.

**Management**

Management of Eagle syndrome can be conservative or surgical, depending on severity. However, initial conservative management is recommended.
