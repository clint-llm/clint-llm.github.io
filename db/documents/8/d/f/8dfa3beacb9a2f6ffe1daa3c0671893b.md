In early 2015, the US Dept of Health and Human Services acknowledged the expanded use of naloxone among healthcare professionals to counter the opiate overdoses in the nation. Now, pharmacists, emergency medical personnel, and physicians can all play an active role in the prevention of opiate overdose. In addition, the current recommendations also suggest co-prescription of naloxone to the patients who are prescribed opiates. Several studies are showing that patients who had been prescribed naloxone at the same time as an opiate, have fewer opiate-related emergency room visits than those who did not receive naloxone. Today, some healthcare workers have started to prescribe naloxone to patients who are prescribed high doses of opiates.

Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration also approved the use of a hand-held auto-injector that can be prescribed to caregivers or family members for managing a person who is suspected of having an opiate overdose. In addition, all over the country, numerous naloxone organizations have cropped up to fight the opiate overdose epidemic.

In some states, there are now programs that permit pharmacists to prescribe naloxone to prevent the epidemic of opiate overdose. Recent data indicate that patients have started to acquire naloxone rescue kits, but there are no long-term data to determine their role in preventing opiate toxicity.
