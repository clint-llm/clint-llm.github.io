Hypertrophic scarring presents as an area of increased induration and often dyspigmentation over the site of a wound, especially in areas of increased wound tension. Keloids present as marked hypertrophy of dermal tissue and they often feature dyspigmentation. As mentioned above, keloid scars extend beyond the margin of the original wound, as this is the defining feature to distinguish them clinically from hypertrophic scars. Hypertrophic scars and keloid scars also differ in the time it takes for them to develop, especially after burn injury. Hypertrophic scars develop in 1 to 2 months after injury, whereas, keloids develop months to years after the initial injury.

Hypertrophic scars and keloids often cause irritation, pruritus, and even neuropathic pain. Severe hypertrophic scars or keloids over a large area can cause contractures that may be disabling.
