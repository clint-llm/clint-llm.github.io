Radical cystectomy with urinary diversion is a complex major abdominal operation commonly performed on older patients with cancer and frequently with diabetes, renal and cardiopulmonary comorbidities.

Prolonged ileus can be seen in approximately 20% of cases.

Ureteroenteric stricture rates between 3% and 17% have been reported, with increasing rates described with longer follow-up.

In the longer term, stones have been found to form in 4 to 6% of neobladders and up to 42% of continent cutaneous diversions.

Rates of metabolic acidosis vary from 5 to 15% for ileal conduits, 6-13% for orthotopic neobladders, and 26 to 45% for continent cutaneous diversions in recent series.

The terminal ileum is the site of vitamin B12 absorption, and patients with diversions that use this intestinal segment are at risk of B12 deficiency. Symptoms of vitamin B12 depletion are non-specific and include lethargy, extreme fatigue, weakness, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, extremely pale skin, neuropathy, visual disturbances, mouth ulcers, and mood changes. The depletion of B12 can take 3 to 4 years to manifest.
