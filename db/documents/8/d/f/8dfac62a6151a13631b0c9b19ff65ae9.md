Despite the good prognosis of this condition, many issues trouble the patient and family members, such as the cosmetic disfigurement caused by the papules, persistence of lesions and modest-to-poor response of treatments tried until date for acrokeratoelastoidosis of Costa. Thus, patient and family education about the benignity of the condition constitutes a much more critical component of management than suggesting treatment for cosmetic improvement of the lesions (vide supra).

Although AKE is a simple clinical diagnosis, it may be logical to get a skin biopsy done followed by re-affirmation of the condition's benign nature. The general perception in the mind of patients of  'biopsy is suggestive of an ominous disorder like a malignancy' is convincingly contradicted with the biopsy report of AKE revealing benign features. Of course, the treating dermatologist's counseling skills constitute an essential part of adequate patient education.
