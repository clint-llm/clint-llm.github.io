TAPVC and PAPVC comprise a wide spectrum of congenital heart diseases. Neonates and infants can present with non-specific signs and symptoms such as respiratory distress, cyanosis, and feeding intolerance. A high index of suspicion is necessary for prompt diagnosis and evaluation of these patients. An interprofessional team of specialists including a primary pediatrician, cardiologist, cardiovascular surgeon, radiologist, nurse, and pharmacist isÂ vital for the delivery of appropriate care and follow up of these patients.
