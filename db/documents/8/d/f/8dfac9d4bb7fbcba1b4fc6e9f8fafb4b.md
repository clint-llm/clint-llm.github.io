The follow-up management is not well-standardized. However, since adrenocortical carcinomas are aggressive tumors, patients should be followed every three months after initial treatment. When the patient has a recurrence free-time of 2 to 3 years, the follow-up may increase to every six months for a total of five years. After five years of disease-free survival, the surveillance can be done every 1 to 2 years, because, although rare, some patients can have a late relapse.Â Patients should undergo a hormonal investigation, comprehensive imaging work-up, including chest and abdominal CT scan, and complete physical examination. An [18F]FDG-PET can be a consideration, even if it is not regarded as mandatory in the follow-up of ACC patients.
