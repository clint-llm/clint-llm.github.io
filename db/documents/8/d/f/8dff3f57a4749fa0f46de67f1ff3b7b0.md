Approximately one-third of patients initially diagnosed with a stroke are ultimately diagnosed with a non-ischemic stroke mimic. This activity reviews the features that assist in making this distinction and describes the evaluation and management of stroke-like conditions. It also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with stroke-like conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of strokes and stroke mimics. 
- Identify the physical examination features to distinguish stroke mimics from true cerebrovascular events. 
- Summarize the differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with acute neurological symptoms. 
- Outline care coordination strategies to improve resource utilization by the interprofessional team in patients with stroke mimics.
