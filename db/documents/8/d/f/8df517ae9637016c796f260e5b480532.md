Ziconotide is a relatively new drug approved for the treatment of severe refractory chronic pain. The drug can only be administered intrathecally as it does not penetrate the BBB. The drug is chiefly used by pain specialists and anesthesiologists. However, monitoring of the patient is done by ICU nurses. Ziconotide is a non-opioid analgesic that provides another approach to the treatment of severe chronic pain. Adverse events are generally not life-threatening and resolve upon discontinuation of the medication. If serious adverse events occur, ziconotide may be stopped immediately without any concern for the development of withdrawal symptoms. All healthcare workers, including nurses, must be familiar with the drug and its indications. The drug can cause severe hypotension, and hence a peripheral intravenous line must be inserted in case the patient required fluid.
