Pneumatoceles are common among infants, children, adolescents, and immunocompromised individuals, e.g., AIDS

Traumatic pneumatoceles are most often seen in children and young adults. They are rare, developing in less than 3% of patients with pulmonary parenchymal injuries. A tertiary center in Milan, Italy, reported 10 cases over 9 years. Swank and Wolf reported a case of pneumatocele in 1977 in a revolving restaurant.

The incidence of pneumatoceles was 9.5% in a Brazilian study. The high incidence was attributed to the high level of undernutrition in those children. It was hypothesized that undernutrition delayed development of Kohn’s pores and undernourished children would then have lungs similar to a newborn. When valvular obstruction occurs, air continues to enter with no way out due to the absence of Kohn’s pores, thus forming pneumatocele.

Traumatic pneumatoceles occur primarily in children and young adults. They are usually caused by non-penetrating chest trauma, mostly resulting from car accidents or by continuous positive airway pressure during mechanical ventilation.  In literature, 85% of patients were younger than 30 years. Children and adolescents have a more compressible bony thorax than adults, and the elastic recoil of the lungs results in increased negative intrathoracic pressure leading to laceration of lung parenchyma. Only 20% of patients have associated rib fractures. The formed cavities filled with fluid, blood, or air continue to increase in size until a balance of lung pressures is achieved between the cavities and the surrounding tissue.

A survey result of 10,229 trauma admission showed that 204 children had a pulmonary contusion, 25 of whom (12.3%) were diagnosed with a pneumatocele. Their mean age was 13 years (3 to 17). Seventy-six percent were male. The most common mechanism of injury was a motor vehicle collision (10), followed by falls (6), and sports (5). The pneumatocele was identified on chest CT alone in 15 (60%), on chest CT and chest radiograph in 3 (12%), the upper portions of an abdominal CT in 6 (24%), and chest X-ray alone in 1 (4%). Seven patients were found to have a solitary pneumatocele, and 18 patients had 2 or more. The largest pneumatocele was 3.7 cm in diameter. No child underwent intervention specific to the pneumatocele. Seventeen (68%) patients were seen in follow-up in the clinic from 1 week to 6 months after injury and showed spontaneous resolution.

A case report after treatment of recurrent metastatic cervical cancers with pulmonary metastasis treated with palliative paclitaxel results in the regression of pulmonary nodules and transformation into multiple pneumatoceles.

H7N9 influenza pandemic follow-up study at 12 months in survivors showed that 9.8% (4/41) population develop pneumatocele, which was evident on chest X-ray.
