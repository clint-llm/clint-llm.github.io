Lateral knee injuries should be examined closely due to the large differential.

- ACL/PCL tears: often confused with LCL injury due to the common nonspecific features of swelling, acute onset pain, and instability. Tests such as anterior/posterior drawer tests should help differentiate the injuries.

- Lateral meniscus tear: often confused with LCL injury due to the common nonspecific features of swelling, bucking, and lateral joint line pain. A lateral meniscus tear can be differentiated by a positive McMurray test, not seen in LCL tears.

- Popliteal injury: a proper history is essential. Popliteal tendinopathy commonly presents as posterolateral knee pain (distal to lateral femoral epicondyle) worse with downhill walking. Popliteal pain can be differentiated by a positive Garrick test (flex knee and externally rotate the tibia as the patient resists), which is not present in LCL injury.

- Bone contusion: often, these injuries, depending on location, may present as LCL tears. It is imperative to palpate the lateral joint line and stress the knee. Varus stress will not affect lateral bone contusion pain.

- IT band syndrome: diagnosis is made via history. IT band presents as a gradually developing chronic pain at the lateral distal femoral epicondyle. Pain should not be reproducible via varus stress.
