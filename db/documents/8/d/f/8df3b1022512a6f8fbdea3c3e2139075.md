Upper extremity nerve blocks can complement general anesthesia and are effective as surgical and postoperative analgesia. Using nerve blocks to target the brachial plexus reduces intraoperative and postoperative opioid requirements and decreases opioid-related adverse effects like respiratory depression, oversedation, and nausea and vomiting. Ultrasound guidance has become the standard of care when performing the interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and axillary blocks. This multimodal pain management has also been shown to increase both patient and surgeon satisfaction.
