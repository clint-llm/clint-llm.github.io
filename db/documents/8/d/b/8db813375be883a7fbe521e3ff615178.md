Hydrogen peroxide naturally occurs in the body as a byproduct of cellular respiration. As a chemical, it is used in bleaching, cleansing, and disinfecting processes in households and industries. Household concentrations generally range from 3 to 9% and are most commonly found at 3%. Industrial concentrations can be as high as 70%, most commonly ranging between 27.5 to 70%.

Home hydrogen peroxide is often used for cerumen removal, mouthwash, surface or fabric cleansing, and hair bleaching.

As a disinfectant, it rapidly oxidizes, and the resultant free radicals damage proteins, DNA, and cell membrane lipids - both bacteria/viruses and tissue.
