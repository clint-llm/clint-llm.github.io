Snapping hip syndrome (dancerâ€™s hip or coxa saltans) is a clinical condition characterized by a palpable or audible snapping sensation that is heard during the movement of the hip joint. This is most commonly an overuse phenomenon, but may be brought on by trauma, including intramuscular injection into the gluteus maximus and surgical procedures. Approximately 5-10% of the population is affected by snapping hip with the majority experiencing painless snapping. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of snapping hip syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanisms of injury behind snapping hip syndrome and the accompanying pathophysiology.
- Review the necessary elements for an examination to assess for snapping hip syndrome, including necessary imaging studies.
- Summarize the treatment options available for snapping hip syndrome including both conservative and possible surgical care.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team in enhancing the delivery of care for those with snapping hip syndrome.
