Surgery and acute illness are stressors that alter homeostasis and lead to hyperglycemia. Stress conditions raise counter-regulatory hormones such as glucagon, epinephrine, cortisol, and growth hormones. This process leads to insulinÂ resistance, increased hepatic glucose production, impaired peripheral glucose utilization, and relative insulin deficiency.
