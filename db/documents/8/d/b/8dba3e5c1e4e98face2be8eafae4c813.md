**Vestibular neuritis:**This has a similar presentation to labyrinthitis but without hearing loss.

**Meniere disease:**This also causes hearing loss and vertigo; however, the episodes are usually intermittent.

**Benign positional vertigo:**This causes dizziness but not hearing loss, and patients will have a positive Dix-Hallpike test.

**Posterior fossa CVA:**If a patient presents with any neurological signs, ataxia, hoarseness, dysarthria, or dysphagia, a CT/MRI head should be requested immediately to rule out a CVA.

**Acoustic neuromas/ vestibular schwannomas:**These can be visualized using a GdMRI.

**Inner ear malformations:**e.g. (missing crura of the stapes, atresia, abnormal incus): This typically presents with progressive hearing loss and can be diagnosed using CT or MRI imaging.

**Temporal bone fracture:**This should be considered if there is a recent history of head trauma and can be confirmed with CT imaging.

**Inner ear hemorrhage:**Commonly associated with trauma and easily demonstrated on MRI.

**Temporal bone neoplasm:**Usually presents with cranial nerve deficits or facial paralysis and should be investigated with MRI and/or CT.

**Multiple sclerosis:**This is more likely to present alongside other systemic symptoms such as spasticity or signs of optic neuritis.
