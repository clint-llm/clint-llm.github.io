The diagnosis of the medical condition via electrophoresis is optimally performed and used with an interprofessional team that includes internal medicine, biochemistry, and laboratory medicine experts, along with nurses and laboratory technicians.

Clinical correlation of a patient’s history, examination, and other investigations with the electrophoresis pattern can help the clinician to narrow down to the specific diagnosis. Specific diagnosis of the clinical condition helps the treating clinician to develop a treatment plan according to underlying pathology.
