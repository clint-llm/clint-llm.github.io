Both glanders and melioidosis can be cultured in a lab. Burkholderia pseudomallei can be diagnosed by blood culture, sputum culture, urine culture, and a throat swab; however, blood cultures are rarely positive in cases of Burkholderia mallei. Cultures of these diseases must be performed under BSL-3 precautions. Indirect hemagglutination, latex agglutination, and direct immunofluorescence tests are available in some countries. Diagnosis of melioidosis cannot be made by imaging; however, CT or ultrasound of the abdomen is recommended to assess for abscesses of the liver, spleen, or prostate that may not be clinically apparent. Chest X-ray is also routinely performed and may show consolidations, cavitary lesions, effusions, empyemas, and multiple lung abscesses.
