- Simulation-based education and technology-enhanced learning need to be integrated into the surgical training curriculum.

- Simulation-based proficiency should be incorporated into formative assessments to guide traineesâ€™ level of competence and level of autonomy in the OR.

- Employing simulation to enhance the trainee experience has the potential to improve trainee and public confidence as well as restore public trust.

- Trainers should be suitably qualified in delivering simulation and technology-enhanced training to ensure high-quality training is delivered.

- Provision of structured and timely feedback in all aspects of surgical training is fundamental to trainee development; tools such as the BID model should be considered in all clinical settings.
