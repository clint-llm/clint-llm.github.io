With the commonality of cross-sectional imaging of the abdomen and pelvis performed for a variety of reasons, radiologists should note incidental ureteral involvement with an inguinal hernia. The surgeon should also look out for these findings. Adjunctive studies are not routinely performed during the work-up of an inguinal hernia, although they are beneficial in the case of a ureteral inguinal hernia. Surgeons should be acutely aware and knowledgeable of a ureteral inguinal hernia to avoid potential urologic damage.
