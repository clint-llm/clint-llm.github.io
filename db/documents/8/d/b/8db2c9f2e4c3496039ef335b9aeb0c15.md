There have been relatively few publications regarding epidemiologic data for DISH.

In an autopsy study, evidence of DISH was present in approximately one-fourth of the specimens, with a mean age of 65 years (minimum 50 years).

A 2016 study out of Japan reported discord between DISH prevalence rates diagnosed via computed tomography (CT) scans compared to radiographic imaging alone.  The prevalence in the general population in Japan was 17.6% and 27.2% as reported from radiographs and CT imaging, respectively.
