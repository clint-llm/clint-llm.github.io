The accumulation of skin in the middle ear can cause many problems and damage nearby structures. One of the most common problems is hearing loss due to the erosion of the middle ear bones. The cholesteatoma causes an inflammatory reaction that releases lytic enzymes, growth factors, and cytokines which can recruit osteoclasts to initiate destruction of bone. Cholesteatoma, if left untreated, can also erode the bony confines of the middle ear and extend to adjacent areas such as the face,Â brain, and the neck. When cholesteatomas become infected, they can grow faster and cause more bony erosion. They can also cause a chronically draining ear, which is often foul smelling.
