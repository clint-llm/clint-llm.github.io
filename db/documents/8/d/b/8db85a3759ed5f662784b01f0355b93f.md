Management of polypharmacy and mild cognitive impairment requires a team approach. Involving patient, family, home-care nurse, primary care physician, geriatrician, pharmacist should be a part of the team in managing this complex health situation. Every drug should be assessed for indication, interactions with other medications. All short and long-term adverse events should be thoroughly discussed and then be prescribed appropriately. A close follow-up on daily living and cognition should be assessed periodically and communicated with the care providers.
