The prevalence of sarcoidosis varies from region to region due to differences in case definition, asymptomatic nature of the disease, limited population screening, and ascertainment bias. In the United States, the age-adjusted incidence is reportedly three times higher in Blacks than Whites.

In a recent study by Baughman et al., the incidence of sarcoidosis in the United States ranged from 8.1 per 100,000 in White race individuals to 17.8 in African Americans.

The usual age at presentation of sarcoidosis is 20 to 50 years. However, sarcoidosis is an important cause of uveitis after 60 years of age. Sarcoidosis accounts for around 10% of all uveitides.

Children with age less than five years (early-onset sarcoidosis) have a triad of skin disease (rashes), uveitis, and arthritis and usually do not have lung disease. Older children have a multisystemic involvement similar to adults with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and lung involvement.
