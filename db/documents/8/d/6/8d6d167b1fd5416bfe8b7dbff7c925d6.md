In over a century in cytogenetics, there have been many new techniques developed for chromosome testing.

**Karyotyping**

Traditionally, karyotyping is considered the definitive method for detecting chromosomal abnormalities because of the accurate identification of fetal aneuploidies, structural rearrangements, and duplications and/or deletions of size greater than 5 Mb.

Unfortunately, this technique requires cells situated in the metaphase stage. Only 24% to 36% of embryos produce metaphase cells of sufficient quality for accurate quantification of chromosomes, and less than 25% of these cases are sufficient for complete cell analysis.

**Fluorescent in-situ Hybridization (FISH)**

This method uses fluorescent-labeled DNA probes to assess the presence, location, and copy number of the complementary DNA sequence of interest in an individualâ€™s genome by hybridization.

Finally, remember that some chromosome abnormalities can be detected with cytogenetic diagnostics but are not associated with clinical defects.
