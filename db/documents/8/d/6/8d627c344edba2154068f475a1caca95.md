Inhalation of numerous gases, aerosols, fumes, or dust may cause lung injury, asphyxiation, or systemic effects. The use of industrial chemicals that could be sources of toxicity is on the rise. The National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES) estimates that more than one million U.S. workers to be at risk for pulmonary irritants each year.

Silo filler's disease is an occupational disease that occurs due to the inhalation of nitrogen oxides. Nitrogen oxides form when filling agricultural grain silos with organic matter, typically corn or other grains. The most significant risk of overexposure occurs within the first month after the silos are filled. Oxides of nitrogen are heavier than air and gather on top of the silage. Exposure occurs when a worker enters a silo or opens the hatch without proper respiratory protection. It is worth noting that silo filler's disease is an entirely preventable illness with proper workplace controls and personal protective equipment. As such, a case of silo filler's disease may require reporting to local public health authorities in some jurisdictions.
