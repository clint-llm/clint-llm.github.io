Postoperative or postpartum patients 1 to 2 weeks out from pelvic surgery or obstructed labor with a complaint of abnormal vaginal fluid leakage should be properly evaluated to determine the accurate diagnosis, and the clinician should have a high index of suspicion for a vesicovaginal fistula. The diagnosis is traditionally established utilizing clinical evaluation and tampon dye testing. A high creatinine level of the vaginal fluid can confirm the discharge is urine, but the clinician should be cautious in interpreting this as other types of urinary incontinence can also result in the urine collecting in the vagina. Office cystoscopy and imaging studies are also often utilized on the evaluation. The differential diagnosis of postoperative or postpartum abnormal vaginal fluid leakage includes infection, inflammation, malignancy, urgency or stress urinary incontinence, or other urogenital abnormalities.
