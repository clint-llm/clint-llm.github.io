Electrical injuries, a relatively common form of mechanical trauma, can occur as a result of lightning, low-voltage, or high-voltage injury, and are often associated with high morbidity and mortality. Almost all electrical injuries are accidental and often, preventable. If not instantly fatal, the damage associated with electrical injuries can result in the dysfunction of multiple tissues or organs.

There are four main types of electrical injuries: flash, flame, lightning, and true. Flash injuries, caused by an arc flash, are typically associated with superficial burns, as no electrical current travels past the skin. Flame injuries occur when an arc flash ignites an individual’s clothing, and electrical current may or may not pass the skin in these cases. Lightning injuries, involving extremely short but very high voltage electrical energy, are associated with an electrical current flowing through the individual’s entire body. True electrical injuries involve an individual becoming part of an electrical circuit. In these cases, an entrance and exit site are usually found.
