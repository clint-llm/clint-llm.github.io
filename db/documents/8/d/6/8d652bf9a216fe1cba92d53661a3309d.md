The concept of modeling and simulation (M&S) has long been an integral part of war-fighter military training dating to before World War II when pilots and infantry soldiers would train with simulators and mockups to prepare for battle. Army and Navy aviators would practice flying in simulated cockpits. It was not until the turn of this century that M&S saw application in healthcare. The most recent wars involving the United States and coalition partners have created the need for more training and practice in life-saving procedures on the battlefield and in the hospital. Therefore, in the 1960s, simulation was accepted as a successful addition to the preparation of medicalÂ personnel.
