The pathophysiology of endometriomas is the same as endometriosis in general since endometriomas are a subset of this more extensive medical condition. The pathway for this disease process occurs with the hormonal response of the ectopic endometrial tissue. This tissue responds to the cyclical hormonal changes of a womanâ€™s menstrual cycle in the same way that the intrauterine endometrium does. It will become proliferative, secretory, and slough just as it would if it were within the uterus. With these fluctuations comes varying concentrations of cytokines and prostaglandin molecules.

Cytokines and prostaglandins are signaling molecules for creating an inflammatory response and thus generate inflammation in the area of the endometriotic implantation. This inflammatory response then lays the foundation for the production of new vascularization and new fibrous tissue formation. This snowball effect then creates the adhesions and pain commonly associated with this disease process. These issues also lead to the main complications of this disease, such as infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Patients with endometriomas have a more severe disease state and typically experience this on a more significant scale than those with stage one or two endometriosis.
