Perforating dermatoses are characterized by a papulonodular rash with transepidermal elimination of dermal components. Traditionally, four classic forms of primary perforating dermatosis have been described: Kyrle disease, reactive perforating collagenosis, elastosis perforans serpiginosum, and perforating folliculitis. The secondary form of this condition is known as acquired perforating dermatosis. This term describes all perforating dermatoses affecting adults with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure and rarely, other systemic diseases. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with acquired perforating dermatosis and highlights the importance of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the diagnostic criteria for acquired perforating dermatosis.
- Describe the histopathological features of acquired perforating dermatosis. 
- Summarize the common complications of acquired perforating dermatosis. 
- Explain how the interprofessional team can work collaboratively to prevent the potentially profound complications of acquired perforating dermatosis by applying knowledge about the presentation, evaluation, and management of this disease.
