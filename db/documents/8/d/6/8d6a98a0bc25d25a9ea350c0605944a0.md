Many factors may lead to the instability of the lower eyelid. The most common etiologic factor of lower eyelid ectropion is involutional change, caused by horizontal eyelid laxity and disinsertion of the lower eyelid retractors. This typically occurs from aging changes of lower eyelids and can be worsened by eye rubbing. Paralytic ectropion may occur with facial nerve palsy. With decreased innervation of the orbicularis muscle, the eyelid can become lax and floppy and can lead to poor protection of the globe. Cicatricial ectropion may be caused by scarring and shortening of the anterior lamella of the lower eyelid skin, which may also occur with aggressive lower eyelid blepharoplasty. Chronic sun exposure may also lead to these changes. Mechanical ectropion may be caused by a mass, such as a tumor, herniated fat, or edema of the lower eyelid, weighing down and pulling the lower eyelid outward.
