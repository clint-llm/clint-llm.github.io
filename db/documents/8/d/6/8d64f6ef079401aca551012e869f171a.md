Endovascular and open surgery are currently the only two evidence-based treatment options for AAA repair. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is the preferred approach for elective or emergent repair but requires favorable patient anatomy including a 1.0 cm to 1.5 cm aneurysm neck, a neck diameter less than 3.2 cm, aortic angulation less than 60 degrees, and access vessels amenable to endograft delivery. Open surgical repair (OSR) is typically reserved for the emergent repair of ruptured AAAs, aneurysms within 1 cm of or involving the renal arteries, and for patients with anatomy unfavorable to endovascular repair. Fenestrated and branched grafts are alternative endovascular approaches for aneurysms with renal artery involvement.
