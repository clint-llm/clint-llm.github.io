As sound waves increase in frequency and decrease in wavelength, spatial resolution increases, and the ultrasound beam is more easily attenuated. Therefore, lower frequency transducers (2.5 to 3.5 Mhz) with less attenuation should be used for deeper structures, such as renal or iliac arteries.

An ultrasound machine capable of both B-Mode (‘B’ standing for 'Brightness') and Doppler should be used to quantify stenosis. The B-Mode US helps in the evaluation of anatomy, including vessel caliber and morphology.
