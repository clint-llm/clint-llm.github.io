For mild psoriasis, topical corticosteroids are first-line treatment.

For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy is first-line treatment as monotherapy or in combination. This includes phototherapy with broadband or narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) and photochemotherapy with ultraviolet A (UVA) following psoralen ingestion or application (PUVA). Broadband UVB is the best phototherapy option for guttate psoriasis, in contrast to plaque psoriasis, which is better treated by narrowband UVB. Excimer laser (308 nm) can be used for localized psoriatic plaques.

Currently, there are several biologic treatment options indicated for plaque psoriasis. However, they have not been well-studied for guttate psoriasis. At this time, targeted biologic therapy is best reserved for the 40% of guttate lesions that progress to plaque type.
