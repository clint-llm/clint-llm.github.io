The round ligament of the uterus is fibro-muscular connective tissue. It appears like a round band of rope. One side of the round ligament is attached to the superior and lateral aspect of the uterus. This attachment with the uterus is at the cornu of the uterus. From the cornu of the uterus, the round ligament crosses the pelvis through the deep inguinal ring which then traverses the inguinal canal and then enters the labia majora, where it terminates with its fibers blending into the mons pubis. There are 2 round ligaments, one on each side of the uterus. Each round ligament is about 10 to 12 centimeters long. The round ligament is covered by folded peritoneum and comprises the superior margin of the broad ligament on each side of the uterus. The medial side of the broad ligament is attached to the lateral side of the uterus on each side. It fans out to the pelvic sidewall. The broad ligament contains the round ligament, the fallopian tube, arteries, veins, lymphatics, nerve fibers and loose connective tissue.
