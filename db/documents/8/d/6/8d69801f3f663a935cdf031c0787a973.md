Cancer is a very complex disease state that requires interprofessional communication between a multitude of healthcare workers. The administration of pegfilgrastim in cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy is only a small part of the patient's entire treatment regimen; however, it still requires exceptional patient-centered care when being given to the patient. Some examples of the roles of each interprofessional health care team member are:

- Clinicians must monitor the patient carefully for any signs of adverse events, especially in the case of accidental overdose.

- Nurses must appropriately administer pegfilgrastim if given in the pre-filled syringe. They must also attach the on-body injector properly when using this option.

- Pharmacists must help ensure that the patient is receiving the right dose of pegfilgrastim to prevent an accidental overdose as well as the side effects associated with an overdose. Pharmacists must also help educate patients on why they are receiving pegfilgrastim.

Each member of the healthcare team plays a vital role in the patient's overall well-being while being treated for cancer. The entire team must work together at each step throughout the patient's treatment to ensure that they are receiving appropriately directed care and achieve the best outcomes possible. [Level 5]
