Potential complications as follows:

- Iatrogenic joint infection (1 to 2 per 25,000 arthrocenteses)

- Soft tissue and surrounding structure damage (tendon, nerves, and blood vessels)

- Inability to successfully obtain access to the desired joint (ensure adequate necessary analgesia). Success may improve with the use of ultrasound guidance.
