Few factors interfere with the quality of imaging and hence make interpretation challenging. These are:

- The decubitus position negatively affects the outcome and can show a picture of a mismatch.

- The change in the position from upright in the ventilation scan to supine during the perfusion scan.

- Inadequate distribution of the injectable agent when administered through a central line.

- Blood clotting during the injectable administration, which appears as a hot spot on the scan.

- The presence of obstructive lung disease interferes with scan accuracy; thus, a bronchodilator should be used before the procedure.

- Heart failure decreases scan accuracy.
