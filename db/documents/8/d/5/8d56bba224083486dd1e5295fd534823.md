**Myopia and Ocular Development**

Refractive error results from a long, complex process of ocular development; hence myopia cannot be attributed to a single trait. Many factors contribute to the development of childhood myopia, including the gain and effectiveness of emmetropization during the early years of life, environmental influences, genetic factors, and changes in axial length and lens power during the adolescent phase.

The development of myopia occurs at the same age at which hyperopia corrects. Early-onset myopia is usually associated with higher errors and results in progressive thinning of the choroid, staphyloma, and pathological retinal degeneration.

**Emmetropization**

Emmetropization is a process where the refractive components (corneal curvature and lenticular curvature) come in balance with the eyeball's post-natal development resulting in the nullification of refractive errors. The child at birth is hyperopic, with an average refractive error of  +2D to +3D.

The axial length at birth is 16 to 18 mm, increasing to 23 mm by three years. After three years of age, the axial length growth rate reduces.

**Sclera and Myopia**

The sclera is the outermost coat of the eye and is composed chiefly of collagen types I and III.

During emmetropization, the development of the eye is governed by the accurate regulation of the growth and remodeling of the scleral extracellular matrix.

- **Embryonic Development of Sclera:**Sclera develops in the sixth week of prenatal life from the cells of the neural crest (neuro-ectoderm) and mesoderm.

- **Emmetropization and Scleral Remodeling:**The remodeling of the extracellular matrix of the sclera is regulated by several growth factors, including insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1 and IGF-2).

**Choroidal Modulation**

The choroid is a highly vascular middle coat of the eyeball. It provides nutrients and oxygen to the outer retinal layers and sclera. Various animal models have demonstrated the importance of the choroid in myopia development and emmetropization. The choroid regulates its thickness to adjust the retina to the focal plane of the eye, a term known as  'choroidal accommodation.'

The choroid also delivers growth-stimulating factors to the sclera, thus regulating the scleral extracellular matrix and the axial length.

With the advent of non-invasive techniques like enhanced depth spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT), choroidal imaging is possible now. Choroid in highly myopic patients is usually associated with thinning on OCT. A thinner choroid on OCT suggests a poorer prognosis and is generally associated with thinner retinal layers.

**Lens Curvature Changes in Childhood**

The lens at birth has a spherical contour and flattens eventually.

The thickness of the lens reduces from 4mm at birth to 3.3mm by adolescence.

**Factors Affecting Myopia Development and Progression**

**Family History**

It has been suggested in various studies that the risk of early-onset myopia development

**Birth History**

Low birth weight and premature birth associated with retinopathy of prematurity have been suggested to be associated with myopia development.

**Excessive Near Work**

Excessive near work is associated with myopia progression resulting from the accommodation lag. Accommodation lag differs between the accommodative stimulus (demand) and the accommodative response.

**Higher Intelligence Quotient**

Myopia development may be associated with higher cognitive functions, better education, and a higher intelligence quotient.

**Outdoor Activities**

Outdoor activities in various studies have been found to reduce myopia progression. It has been hypothesized that the wavelength of radiant sunlight is 550nm, the same wavelength focused on a normal observer's retina.

An experimental study found that the spatial features of the indoor environment are similar to the artificial spatial features created by diffuse filters that induced myopia in animals.

**Increased Screen Time**

Increased screen time can lead to myopia development and can be attributed to the increased time spent indoors.
