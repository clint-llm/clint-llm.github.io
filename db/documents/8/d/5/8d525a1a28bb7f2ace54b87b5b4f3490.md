Histologically, BP is characterized by acanthosis with full thickness epidermal atypia, known as Bowenoid dysplasia. Multiple metaphase mitoses are usually visible above the basal layer as well as scattered dyskeratotic and multinucleated keratinocytes with pleiomorphism. Histopathologic findings may also show parakeratosis and hypergranulosis. The integrity of the basement membrane is preserved. The dermis contains superficial infiltrate of lymphocytes with perivascular accentuation. Induction of the focal epidermal hyperplasia and dysplasia is viral. Moreover, immunohistochemistry for p16 protein reveals strong in BP. Staining with an antibody to p16 protein has high specificity and sensitivity to detect this disease.
