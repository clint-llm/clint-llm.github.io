Tufted hair folliculitis is a rare condition. ItÂ has been reported most often in adults, primarily in individuals in the fourth and fifth decade of life. However rare cases of tufted hair folliculitis have been reported in younger patients, among them, two were seen in Gobello Nevus syndrome. Extreme ages reported ranges from ten to 68 years. There is no racial predilection for tufted hair folliculitis, but a male predominance is observed with a male to female ratio of 2.7:1.
