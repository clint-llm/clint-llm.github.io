Clinicians draw blood from the vein of a patient by standard phlebotomy technique. Blood is collected in a citrate-containing collection tube, usually light blue. The citrate binds calcium inhibiting clotting in the tube. This allows for a whole blood sample and effective extraction of plasma for testing. For patients on continuous unfractionated heparin, infusion blood is drawn every 6 hours to facilitate dosing adjustments.
