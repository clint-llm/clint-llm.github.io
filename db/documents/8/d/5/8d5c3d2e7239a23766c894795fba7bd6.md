When considering the diagnosis of POP, assessment for infection, hematuria, and incomplete bladder emptying are necessary. If the patient has significant voiding symptoms, a urodynamic evaluation is recommended to assess bladder and sphincteric function.

Detrusor dysfunction with high post-void residual is a common problem in patients with severe prolapse. Reduction of the prolapse during the urodynamic evaluation will help to properly assess sphincteric function and unmask stress urinary incontinence by unkinking the urethra, which is commonly associated with severe prolapse that would have been otherwise missed. Imaging of the kidney and the ureter by computed tomography (CT) urogram is indicated in women with severe procidentia as the pelvic anatomy, especially the right ureter, might be distorted by the descent of the bladder, pulling down on the ureters, causing obstruction and hydronephrosis.
