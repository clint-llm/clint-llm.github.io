No established staging system is specific for tracheal cancers. Some investigators employ the tumor, nodes, and metastasis (TNM) staging system for disease staging. However, due to the low incidence of these tumors, no set tumor, nodes, or metastasis TNM staging exists for tracheal tumors. A recent study performed in 2022 showed prognostic differences in patients who were distinguished based on TNM classification. The study showed the benefit of early diagnosis and the extent of the tumor in aiding with the treatment based on tumor resectability.
