An embolism is a differential diagnosis of thrombosis. In the later, the clot is formed in a location, causing the narrowing of vessels. In embolism, the clot travels from a primary site to a different location. For instance, in patients with deep venous thrombosis, the clot can get dislocated to the lungs ending up forming pulmonary embolism. Septic emboli should be considered in patients with risk of systemic infection, IV drug abuse history, or those with suspected or confirmed bacterial endocarditis. Chronic peripheral vascular disease can lead to similar symptoms in the extremities, and patients should have vascular surgery evaluation if suspected.
