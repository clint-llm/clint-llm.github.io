Pneumoconiosis starts with an inflammatory response to foreign particles that the patient inhaled. The inhaled dust trigger macrophages, lymphocytes, and epithelial cells. These cells then release interleukin-1 beta, TNF-alpha, matrix metalloproteinases, and transforming growth factor-beta. Fibroblasts then become stimulated to replicate and grow and surround the dust forming nodules. These nodules then lead to massive fibrosis, as seen in coal workers' lung disease and silicosis.
