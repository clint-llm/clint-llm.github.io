Stroke prevention is the responsibility of all healthcare workers. Besides physicians, nurses and pharmacists can also help educate patients on how to reduce their risk of a stroke. The pharmacist's prime responsibility is educating the patient on drug compliance with statins, anticoagulants, and antihypertensive medications. The pharmacist can also play a role in smoking cessation and encouraging a healthy lifestyle.
