Intravascular ultrasound of a coronary artery allows for identification and delineation of the lumen and the 3 layers of the arterial wall: the inner tunica intima, the muscular tunica media, and the outer tunica adventitia.  The smooth muscle cells comprising the tunica media does not reflect ultrasound waves and appears dark in the gray-scale cross-sectional image, permitting easy identification.  Intravascular imaging with IVUS characterizes and quantifies plaque. IVUS assessment can distinguish between calcified plaque, lipid, and neointimal proliferation. IVUS allows for the identification of calcified plaque that may be undetectable from angiography alone.
