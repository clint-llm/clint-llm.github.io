The diagnosis and management of Eales disease are quite complex, and prompt diagnosis can help save the vision of the patient. Healthcare workers need to initiate immediate treatment of the patient when required. The goal is to cause the regression of neovascularization and save the vision of the patient.

Eales disease carries a good prognosis with proper treatment. Severe vision loss is rare, and blindness is usually caused by retinal detachment and neovascular glaucoma.
