Orchitis is the inflammation of the testis, and isolated acute orchitis is a very rare phenomenon.

- The primary route of the spread of infection to the testis is blood-borne dissemination.

- Viruses are implicated as significant pathogens.

Common risk factors include a preexisting history of epididymitis, unprotected sexual contact, multiple sexual partners, long-term use of foley catheter, bladder outlet obstruction, structural abnormality, and lack of immunization with MMR vaccination (vaccination reduces the risk of developing orchitis after mumps).
