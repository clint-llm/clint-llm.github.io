All clinically relevant tissue-based biomarkers use FFPE tissue retrieved from a surgical specimen or biopsy as starting material. Fresh frozen tissue is known to be superior for extracting nucleic acids and downstream molecular analysis, but there are practical hurdles in relying on the latter for routine clinical use.

Irrespective of the starting material for testing, it is mandatory to adhere to all necessary and recommended quality control protocols regarding specimen preparation, storage, and transport for these molecular assays to provide reliable results.
