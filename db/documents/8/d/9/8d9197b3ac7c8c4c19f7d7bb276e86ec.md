The patient is usually draped and prepped in a sterile manner similar to that for pacemakers with the pectoral region exposed, and the procedure is generally performed under local anesthesia along with conscious sedation.

The device is implanted in a subcutaneous pocket usually made in the pectoral region where the device generator is placed, the leads are then hooked to the generator at one end, and the other end of the lead is then advanced, via the subclavian vein, and positioned in the respective cardiac chamber. While there is no consensus regarding defibrillation threshold testing (DFT), some operators perform DFT after putting in the device to check for defibrillation thresholds and device optimization and then close the pocket after DFT.

The procedure typically takes up to 90 minutes.

Although it is a daycare procedure, patients are usually retained over the night and are discharged the next day after device interrogation and obtaining a plain chest radiogram to check for lead placement.
