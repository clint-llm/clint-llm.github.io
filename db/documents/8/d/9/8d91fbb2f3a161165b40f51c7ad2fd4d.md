Palatal cysts (Epstein pearls and Bohn nodules) are small painless, white-yellow, firm, non-fluctuant papules of 1 to 3 mm in diameter. They frequently appear in groups of two to six lesions, but they can also present as an isolated cyst.

Gingival cysts of the newborn appear as smallÂ 2 to 3 mm in diameter, isolated or multiple whitish papules on the crest of the alveolar ridge of newborns.

Cleft children appear to have palatal cysts in the identical distribution pattern as non-cleft children except for those with a cleft palate which are located at the margins of the palatal shelves instead of the midline.

Epstein pearls resemble the equivalent of milia (white papules produced by retention of sebum and keratin in the hair follicles), which are frequently seen on the faces of neonates.
