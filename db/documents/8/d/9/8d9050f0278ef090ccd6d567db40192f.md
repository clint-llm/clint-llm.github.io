As a patient with a foot injury, including probable metatarsal fracture, presents to the clinic/ emergency, proper evaluation should be done. The radiological evaluation involves certain stress/ regular views of the foot; the radiology technician should be well aware of the positions of the foot in which various x-ray views need to be obtained. In cases with open injuries and neurovascular injuries, the services of a plastic surgeon may be required. Besides, in stress fractures occurring in elderly patients, thorough workup needs to be done by an endocrinologist as well as a geriatric medicine expert. As these injuries sometimes lead to foot and ankle stiffness, appropriate physiotherapy advice should be sought.
