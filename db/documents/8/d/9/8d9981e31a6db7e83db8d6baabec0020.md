The pes anserine describes a region where tendinous structures of the semitendinosus, gracilis, and sartorius muscles join to insert at the medial knee. The pes anserine bursa is sandwiched between the proximal medial tibia and the insertion point of the three tendons. Pes anserine bursitis is a clinical entity associated with pain at the medial knee and upper tibial region. A more generic term, pes anserine pain syndrome, has been applied to refer to medial knee pain, which may or may not include inflammation of the bursal sac. This article focuses on the clinical entity of pes anserine bursitis unless otherwise specifically stated. This activity describes the evaluation and management of pes anserine bursitis and highlights the interprofessional team's role in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy of the pes anserine and its bursa.
- Identify underlying risk factors for developing pes anserine bursitis.
- Outline limb-threatening conditions that may mimic pes anserine bursitis.
- Explain a well-coordinated, interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by pes anserine bursitis.
