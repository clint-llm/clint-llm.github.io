Managing liver cancer requires an interprofessional team that includes an oncologist, hepatobiliary surgeon, pathologist, radiologist, gastroenterologist, palliative care nurses, dietitian, and an internist. Unfortunately, the majority of patients are not candidates for surgery. Many local treatments are available but they only increase life span by 6-18 months. Biological agents are available but most are prohibitively expensive and do not affect survival significantly. Most patients may benefit from palliative care and it is important to involve the team early on. The surgeon and radiologist may be consulted to manage some of the complications of metastatic liver disease. The overall outlook for patients with liver cancer is very poor.
