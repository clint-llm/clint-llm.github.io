There are no absolute contraindications, but certain patients are not good candidates for surgery. These include:

- Patients with unrealistic expectations

- Patients with psychiatric problems (body dysmorphic disorder, psychosis, mania, and major depression)

- Heavy smokers whoÂ do not stop smoking at least one month before surgery

- Patients who are medically unfit for surgery

- Patients who are on certain drugs like isotretinoin, which may lead to poor wound healing

- Patients with significant changes along the jawline and jowls, and those with midfacial ptosis
