Disorders involving vWF can present on a spectrum of severity, described in more detail below. Relevant testing to assess the specific defect or degree of deficiency can further delineate qualitative versus qualitative platelet or coagulation disorders.

- Complete blood count

- 
              
- Platelet count
              
              
- Red blood cell count
              
              
- Peripheral smear

- Bleeding time

- Coagulation tests

- Prothrombin time (PT/INR)
- Partial thromboplastin time (PTT)

- vWF assays (quantity and activity)

- vWF antigen
- vWF-collagen-binding
- vWF-ristocetin cofactor activity
- vWF-factor VIII binding
- vWF genotyping

- Factor VIII assays (quantity and activity)

- ADAMTS13 assays (quantity and activity)
