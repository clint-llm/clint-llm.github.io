Provocative discography is an invasive diagnostic spine procedure that involves the administration of contrast into the nucleus pulposus of an intervertebral disc to determine if the disc is the origin of a patient's chronic spine pain. The test is based on the premise that an intervertebral disc can be a source of spine pain, that the pain is experienced when the disc is mechanically loaded, and that therefore, similar pain will be experienced when the disc is pressurized with injected contrast. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and technique involved in performing provocative discography and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe pathophysiology associated with intervertebral disc injury. 
- Describe the classic presentation of discogenic lower back pain.
- Outline the indications for provocative discography.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for provocative discography.
