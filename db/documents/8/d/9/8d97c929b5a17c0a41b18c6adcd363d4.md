The prognosis of hemolytic uremic syndrome typically depends on the prompt initiation of treatment. Acute complications like acute renal injury, coma, and death, as well as progression to chronic renal failure, can be prevented with timely intervention. Overall mortality from HUS is less than 5%, while long-term renal complications occur in 5 to 25% of the children with HUS.
