Renal cysts are the most common lesion of the kidney and are seen in approximately 40 percent of patients that undergo imaging studies involving the anatomical region of the kidneys. Renal cysts can be benign or malignant, focal, multifocal, unilateral, or bilateral, and congenital or acquired, though the acquired form is more common. This activity reviews how to properly evaluate a patient with renal cysts and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of renal cysts.
- Summarize the classification of renal cysts using the Bosniak classification system versus the Potter classification system.
- Outline the etiology-dependent management of renal cysts.
- Describe the need for an interprofessional team approach to evaluating and caring for a patient with renal cysts.
