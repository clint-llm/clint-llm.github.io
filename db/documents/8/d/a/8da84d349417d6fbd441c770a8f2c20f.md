The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) defines pica as eating nonnutritive, nonfood substances over a period of at least one month. The term is derived from "pica-pica," the Latin word for the magpie bird, because of the bird's indiscriminate gathering and eating a variety of objects for the sake of curiosity.

Although pica is seen in children, it is also a common eating disorder in patients who are intellectually impaired. In women, it is most often seen during pregnancy. In some parts of the world, the consumption of non-nutritive substances is culturally accepted. Pica usually occurs as an isolated disorder but there are instances when it may co-exist with schizophrenia, OCD, and trichotillomania.

It is important to understand that in order to diagnose pica, the individual must be at least 2 years of age. It is not unusual to notice that younger children are frequently eating nonnutritive substances.
