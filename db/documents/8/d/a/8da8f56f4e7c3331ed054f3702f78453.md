100% oxygen can be tolerated at sea level for about 24-48 hours without any severe tissue damage.  Lengthy exposures produce definite tissue injury.  There is moderate carinal irritation on deep inspiration after 3-6 hours of exposure of 2 ATA, extreme carinal irritation with uncontrolled coughing after 10 hours, and finally, chest pain and dyspnea ensue.  In a majority of patients, these symptoms subside 4 hours after cessation of exposure.
