The acute episode of hereditary fructose intolerance can present similarly to sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, infectious hepatitis, toxin ingestion, and genetic and metabolic diseases.

Dietary fructose intolerance is a distinct clinical entity from hereditary fructose intolerance. It shares the clinical features of nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain following the ingestion of fructose. The dysfunctional fructose transporters cause dietary fructose intolerance in the gut. It is characterized by the presence of fructose in the stool in contrast to the fructose that is seen in the urine in hereditary fructose intolerance.
