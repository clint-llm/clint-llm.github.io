The chorda tympani branches off at the mastoid segment of the facial nerve; however, there are anatomical variations in which portion of this segment the branching can occur. In most cases (approximately 70%), it is located at the mid-third of the mastoid segment. In about 20% of individuals, it arises in the proximal third, and in about 10% of individuals, it leaves the facial nerve at the distal third of the mastoid segment.
