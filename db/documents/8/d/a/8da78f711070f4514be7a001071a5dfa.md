Complications will depend on the underlying etiology. Heat-related illnesses are the mostÂ grave complications of anhidrosis. Children are more vulnerable because their core body temperature rises faster than adults and their heat loss mechanism is less efficient. Heat-related illnesses are:

- Heat cramps

- Heat exhaustion

- Heatstroke

The most feared complication, no matter the underlying etiology, is heatstroke.
