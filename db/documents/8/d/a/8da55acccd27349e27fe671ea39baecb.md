A thorough understanding of the pharmacological effect and the adrenergic receptor activity of sympathomimetic agents renders their adverse effects as the logical extension of excessive or unwanted adrenergic receptor activity, which can be fatal. Following a comprehensive literature review, the following is a brief survey of sympathomimetic agent adverse effects. Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activity-predominant sympathomimetics such as phenylephrine or norepinephrine are associated with hypertension (with the possibility of hypertensive emergency), reflex bradycardia, piloerection, and urinary retention. Vasoconstriction may lead to ischemia and necrosis of the digits of the distal appendages.

Beta-1 adrenergic receptor activity-predominant sympathomimetics such as dobutamine are associated with tachycardia and arrhythmias. In patients with coronary artery disease, these adverse effects of beta-2 adrenergic receptor activity-predominant sympathomimetics may lead to acute coronary syndrome.

Indirect sympathomimetics such as amphetamines, cocaine, or ephedrine are associated with anorexia, weight loss, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, mesenteric ischemia, motor tics, and seizures. Cardiovascular complications of indirect sympathomimetics similar to the direct agents may also include hypertension with reflex bradycardia, aortic dissection, tachycardia, myocardial infarction, and strokes.
