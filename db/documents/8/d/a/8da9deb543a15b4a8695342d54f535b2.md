Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is one of the most commonly encountered pathology by a vitreoretinal surgeon. The surgical approaches for RRD treatment are pneumatic retinopexy, scleral buckling (SB), and pars plana vitrectomy. Vitrectomy has gained popularity over the last couple of decades due to its better ergonomics and recent technological advancements. On the contrary, the number of SB procedures has drastically reduced worldwide. However, SB continues to be an extremely useful surgery, especially in certain situations. This CME activity reviews the principles, relevant surgical anatomy, indications, and contraindications, the required surgical instruments used by the interprofessional team, nuances of the surgical technique, and various intra- and post-operative complications of SB.

**Objectives:**
- Summarise the pathogenesis of formation RRD and principles of SB.
- Describe the relevant surgical anatomy required to understand the principles and procedure of SB.
- Outline the nuances of the surgical technique of SB.
- Review the various intra- and post-operative complications of SB.
