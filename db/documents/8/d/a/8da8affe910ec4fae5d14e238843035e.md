C. burnetii is ubiquitous, with outbreaks of Q fever reported from all over the globe, except for New Zealand. Due to its high infectivity, aerosol transmission, and environmental stability, it has the potential of being used as a biological weapon. Humans usually acquire this infection by inhalation of aerosols from the reservoir animals (cows, goats, and sheep) and their products.C. burnetii is the tick. Sheep, goat manure, ovine manure, wild animals, and pets (cats and dogs) have been reported as the sources of outbreaks. Human to human transmission is uncommon and has been reported via blood transfusion and by coming in contact with infected parturient women.
