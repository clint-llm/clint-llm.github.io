Redo CABG is a major encounter for both the patient and the team involved. More patients will need redo revascularization. The complexity of coronary artery disease is on the rise as the population ages.

Redo sternotomies carry significant mortality and morbidity and require meticulous preoperative assessment, thorough investigation, and experience of the surgeon and the team.

The importance of preoperative CT chest is emphasized, and this is usually coupled with a CT aorta to review the peripheral vessels for cardiopulmonary bypass access.

The surgical strategy should be communicated by the surgeon with the team, including the anesthetist and the perfusionist. This includes a plan to deal with issues during anesthetic induction, early exposure of femoral vessels to allow emergency cannulation if required, appropriate instrument availability and number and type of grafts to be used for particular targets.

Although this is normally the routine practice with any cardiac procedure, proper planning with such complex cases provides the team with the confidence to deal with any complications should they arise.
