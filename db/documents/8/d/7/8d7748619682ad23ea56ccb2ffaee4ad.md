Mammary duct ectasia is a benign non-proliferative breast disease. It affects the large duct system. The exact cause is still unknown, but it may be considered a developmental ageing process characterized by elongated, convoluted weakened duct wall that presents with nipple discharge or palpable mass. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of mammary duct ectasia and highlights the main role of the caring physician to exclude breast malignancy, and the role of interprofessional teamwork to provide an individualized best treatment option for this condition.

**Objectives:**
- This activity describes the histopathologic changes seen in the mammary duct ectasia (MDE).
- It outlines the various clinical presentations of the cases of mammary duct ectasia.
- It describes the typical imaging findings associated with mammary duct ectasia.
- It explains the importance of collaboration among the interprofessional team of surgeons, radiologists, and histopathologists to provide the best treatment for patients with mammary duct ectasia.
