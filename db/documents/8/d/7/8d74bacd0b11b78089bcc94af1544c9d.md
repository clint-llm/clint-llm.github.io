The spinal cord forms from the neural plate. Peripheral nerves derive from neuroepithelial cells. These nerves help create the neurons, support cells, and axons that contribute to the peripheral nervous system.

Morphology remains similar when comparing structures from a fetal lumbar plexus to an adult lumbar plexus. Specifically, nerve thickness, length, and spinal nerve branching are observed to remain the same throughout development.
