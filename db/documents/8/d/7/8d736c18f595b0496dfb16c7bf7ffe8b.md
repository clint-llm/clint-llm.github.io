Intraductal papillomas, when solitary, may present as bloody or clear nipple discharge. They are usually centrally located behind the nipple and most commonly seen in perimenopausal patients. However, it may also be seen incidentally with ultrasound in younger asymptomatic patients. Intraductal papillomas when multiple typically arise from the TDLU. They are less frequently presented with nipple discharge and more often as a palpable mass.
