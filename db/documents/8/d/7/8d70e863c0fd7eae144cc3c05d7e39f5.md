A joint is a point where two bones make contact. Joints can be classified either histologically or functionally. Histological classification is based on the dominant type of connective tissue, and functional classification is based on the amount of movement permitted. Histologically the three joints in the body are fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial. Functionally the three types of joints are synarthrosis (immovable), amphiarthrosis (slightly moveable), and diarthrosis (freely moveable). The two classification schemes can be correlated: synarthroses are fibrous, amphiarthroses are cartilaginous, and diarthroses are synovial.

Joints, comprising bones and connective tissue, are embryologically derived from mesenchyme. The bones either develop directly through intramembranous ossification or indirectly through endochondral ossification. Each specific joint has a unique vascular supply and innervation scheme; patterns do exist. Muscles provide stability to joints, and there is a direct correlation between muscle strength and joint stability, particularly with synovial joints.

Many pathophysiological conditions affect joints, and again, patterns exist by histological class. Because diseases that affect the joints are common across the lifespan, a thorough understanding of joint structure and function is of great clinical significance.
