Visual field confrontation test is the most commonly used screening tool to assess for visual field defects. Typically, the patient will cover one eye and be asked to look at a stationary object (the wall or instructorâ€™s finger) while noting the number of fingers visible in their periphery. These tests, however, are instructor dependent and have low sensitivity. Another option is the automated or manual (Goldmann, tangent screen) perimetry test. This test provides information not only on the field loss but also on the size and form of the deficit.

In addition to identifying the field deficit, all patients experiencing homonymous hemianopsia should undergo further imaging, such as an MRI, to identify the cause of such symptomatology.
