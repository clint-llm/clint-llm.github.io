Ankle splinting is an excellent way to immobilize and stabilize the ankle joint in the acute setting of fractures or dislocations. It serves to prevent further damage to the bones, cartilage, and surrounding neurovascular structures. Splinting allows for soft tissue swelling due to the non-circumferential nature of the splint and can be easily removed by the clinician to evaluate any wounds beneath. It is an excellent way to temporize ankle injuries until definitive treatment can be performed.

After placement of the splint, it is important to educate the patient on proper splint care. The splint needs to remain clean and dry. If the splint gets wet, the plaster loses its strength and the padding beneath will not dry. This can lead to maceration and breakdown of intact skin. Furthermore, if there is an open wound beneath the splint, it can lead to infection. In instances where the splint becomes wet, the patient should return to the place where the splint was placed. The patient should be instructed to avoid removing the splint, especially if the splint was applied for a dislocation. Removal in this instance can cause re-dislocation or persistent subluxation of the joint. Most importantly, should the patient develop new-onset numbness or tingling of the foot or toes he or she first should elevate the leg and, if it does not resolve, return to the place of splint application or emergency department for further evaluation.
