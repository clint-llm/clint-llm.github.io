The effective and timely management of malnutrition complications following bariatric surgery necessitates the collaboration of an interprofessional healthcare team comprising various disciplines. Key healthcare providers involved in the process include dietitians, bariatric surgeons, and general practitioners, who should provide preoperative counseling and assessment to patients. Mental health professionals also play a crucial role in patient-centered education and promoting compliance with supplementation and follow-up care.

Additionally, for female patients planning to undergo or who have already undergone weight loss surgeries and wish to conceive, preconception counseling by obstetricians is essential to address their specific needs.

Clinicians specializing in bariatric patients should familiarize themselves with the clinical presentations of deficiencies and appropriate monitoring protocols to ensure early diagnosis. When patients present with severe complications from deficiencies such as neurological, dermatological, or hematological disorders, a careful history and an organized effort by an interprofessional team of physicians, mid-level practitioners, pharmacists, clinical dieticians, and nursing staff are critical to ensure optimal outcomes. Earlier diagnosis can improve morbidity and mortality. [Level 2]
