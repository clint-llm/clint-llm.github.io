Bedbug bites are seen in equal distribution between both genders and through all ages. However, there is a prevalence noted in persons that live in population concentrated areas such as apartments, those who travel more frequently and stay in hotels, and those with lower socioeconomic conditions. Bedbug infestations are transmitted by active spreading from one living space to another through power outlets and air ducts, or colonies can be spread passively by transport in used furniture, luggage, and book bags. Skin-to-skin and direct clothing-to-clothing transfer are rare in bedbug infestations, unlike most other pests, due to the nocturnal nature of the bedbugs and the fact that they avoid moving hosts.
