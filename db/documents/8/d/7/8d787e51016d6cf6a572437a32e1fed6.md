Stroke

The postcentral gyrus is at risk of damage due to strokes. The two major arteries that supply the postcentral gyrus are the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Sensory deficits can often help to determine which artery is affected and the location of the infarct. For example, ischemic stroke in the anterior cerebral artery will affect the medial postcentral gyrus and may present with sensory deficits in the contralateral leg. A stroke in the middle cerebral artery may show a contralateral sensory loss in the face or upper extremity, depending on the location of the infarct. Cerebral infarctions to these arteries will often have accompanying motor deficits, aphasia, and visual deficits depending on the location of the occlusion.

Pain Modulation

Nociception pathways can be suppressed by ascending and descending modulating pathways. The pain perception circuit in the brain includes the primary somatosensory cortex, insula, anterior cingulate gyrus, prefrontal cortex, and thalamus.

Descending pain modulating pathways appear to originate in the periaqueductal grey and rostroventral medial medulla.
