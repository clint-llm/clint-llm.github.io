Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is death due to a cardiovascular cause that occurs within one hour of the onset of symptoms. A sudden cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops beating or is not beating sufficiently to maintain perfusion and life. This activity examines the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of sudden cardiac death and the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of sudden cardiac death.
- Describe the evaluation of a survivor of cardiac arrest.
- Summarize the treatment options for cardiac arrest.
- Explain how enhanced coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid detection of cardiac abnormalities and subsequently enhance the detection of potentially fatal pathology and allow for treatment when indicated.
