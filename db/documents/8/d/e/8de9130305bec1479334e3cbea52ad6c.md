Microdontia may present an esthetic or functional challenge for patients, depending on the severity and extent of the condition. Underlying syndromes usually cause more difficulties for the patient than the microdontia itself.

In the anterior maxilla, macrodontia often presents with an esthetic challenge for patients. Macrodonts towards the posterior of the dental arch may lead to further crowding and difficulty with the eruption of teeth. Radiographs should be utilized to monitor for abnormal eruption patterns.

As previously discussed, taurodontism presents several restorative, prosthodontic, endodontic, and surgical complications. Beyond the complications associated with dental interventions, patients are typically unaware of this condition.

Fusion can pose an aesthetic concern due to the altered shape and size of the tooth. With their abnormal presentation, these teeth can have a high risk for decay and periodontal disease and can potentially complicate endodontic therapy.
