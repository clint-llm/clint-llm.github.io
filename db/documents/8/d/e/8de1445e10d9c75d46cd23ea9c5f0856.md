Short-term memory (STM), also referred to as short-term storage, or primary or active memory indicates different systems of memory involved in the retention of pieces of information (memory chunks) for a relatively short time (usually up to 30 seconds). In contrast, long-term memory (LTM) may hold an indefinite amount of information. The difference between the two memories, however, is not just in the 'time' variable but is above all functional. This activity illustrates the features of short term memory, describes the causes of short term memory impairment, and highlights the role of the an interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the pathophysiology of short term memory impairment. 
- Summarize the clinical features of patients affected by short-term memory impairment. 
- Review potential therapeutic approaches for enhancing memory tasks in subjects affected by short term memory impairment. 
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by short term memory loss.
