Rome IV defines functional constipation separately for infants and children greater than 4 years of age.

**In Infants Up to 4 Years**

Must include 1 month of at least 2 of the following or 2 or fewer defecations per week

- History of excessive stool retention

- History of painful or hard bowel movements

- History of large-diameter stools

- Presence of a large fecal mass in the rectum

In toilet-trained children, the following additional criteria may be used:

- At least 1 episode/week of incontinence after the acquisition of toileting skills

- History of large-diameter stools that may obstruct the toilet

**For Children Greater than 4 Years**

Must include 2 or more of the following occurring at least once per week for a minimum of 1 month with insufficient criteria for a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome:

- 2 or fewer defecations in the toilet per week in a child of a developmental age of at least 4 years

- At least 1 episode of fecal incontinence per week

- History of retentive posturing or excessive volitional stool retention

- History of painful or hard bowel movements

- Presence of a large fecal mass in the rectum

- History of large diameter stools that can obstruct the toilet

After appropriate evaluation, the symptoms cannot be fully explained by another medical condition.

Children with history and exam consistent with functional constipation may not require any specific testing. Children who do not respond to treatment, who have an atypical history, or concerns on physical exam may require additional information or referral to a specialist. A TSH can screen for hypothyroidism, and a lead level can be helpful if lead intoxication is a concern. Hirschsprung disease is always a consideration, especially in very young, persistent, or atypical cases. A contrast enema can help with the diagnosis, and referral for a possible biopsy is also an option that will more definitively exclude the diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease.
