Informed consent in sexual assault examinations is an ethical dilemma for several vulnerable populations that are unable to consent to the examination. In the pediatric population, young children may not have the capacity to discuss what occurred or to consent to a forensic examination. Additionally, it may be difficult for young children to comply with a physical examination that causes them pain or discomfort.

Care for patients should be inclusive and tailored to support patients of all gender identities and sexual orientations. The US Department of Justice reports that rates of sexual assault are higher for LGBT individuals. There are too few guidelines on the delivery of gender-sensitive care in sexual assault health services considering these patients are experiencing a higher rate of sexual assault. One study suggests that the lack of an integrated and equitable approach to sexual assault examinations limits these patients' access to the standard of care.
