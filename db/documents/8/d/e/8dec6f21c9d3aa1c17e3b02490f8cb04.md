Pitfalls and pearls of the diagnosis and treatment of lymphadenopathy include:

- There is no substitute for a thorough history and careful physical examination in the workup of lymphadenopathy.

- The majority of both localized and generalized lymphadenopathy have a relatively benign treatable cause.

- All generalized lymphadenopathy merits careful evaluation and workup.

- The gold standard for diagnosis of lymphadenopathy remains tissue diagnosis of the node by incisional biopsy.

- A careful review of the patient's epidemiological and personal medical history provides daily clues as toÂ when lymphadenopathy can be safely observed for change or resolution over the period of 2 to 4 weeks.

- Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is almost universally indicative of underlying thoracic or abdominal malignancy.
