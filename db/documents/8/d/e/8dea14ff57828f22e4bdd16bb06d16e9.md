Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has fairly minimal absolute contraindications. DBS is contraindicated in patients who cannot properly operate the neurostimulator. Once implanted, patients with deep brain stimulators should not undergo full-body magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRIs), transcranial magnetic stimulation, and diathermy.
