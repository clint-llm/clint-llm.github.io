Camper's fascia originates from the mesoderm. The mesoderm also forms bones, muscles, other connective tissues of the skin, some organs, including the heart, the urogenital system, and blood cells. Specifically, it is the dorsal mesoderm that forms sclerotomes (skeleton), myotomes (skeletal muscles and appendage buds), and dermatomes. The dermatome derivatives contribute to the connective layers of the skin that result in the formation of Camper's fascia.
