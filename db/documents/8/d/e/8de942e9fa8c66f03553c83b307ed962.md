While the diagnosis of cutaneous mastocytoma/mastocytosis can be made on the physical appearance of the lesions, especially if Darrier's sign is present, histology and molecular tests are required to differentiate from mast cell hyperplasia or reactive conditions. WHO classification involves the presence of both clinical and histologic findings and exclusion of systemic disease before the diagnosis of cutaneous mastocytosis/mastocytoma is made. A Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy of the lesion is sufficient to diagnose mast cell proliferation. However, surgical biopsy may be required to fully differentiate as cells can vary from well-differentiated to poorly differentiated. The disease is staged into four stages based on WHO criteria.

Dermatoscopy findings are non-specific. Baseline serum tryptase level and CBC should be performed before therapy. Elevation of serum tryptase and bone marrow involvement is generally not seen in pediatric cutaneous disease but may be present in adult patients. Pediatric cases with systemic symptoms, abnormal CBC, failure of symptomatic therapy and elevation of tryptase can also be evaluated for bone marrow abnormalities. Abdominal ultrasound can be performed to exclude organomegaly.
