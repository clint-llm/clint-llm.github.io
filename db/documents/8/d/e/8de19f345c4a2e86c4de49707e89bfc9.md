The foot can be divided into a dorsal and plantar aspect, each containing unique musculature, blood supply, and innervation. The foot's dorsal aspect contains the extensor hallucis brevis and extensor digitorum brevis muscles and receives its innervation from the deep fibular nerve. The plantar aspect of the foot can be divided into four layers, each containing different muscles and tendons. The most superficial layer (1st layer) contains the abductor hallucis, flexor digitorum brevis, and abductor digiti minimi muscles. The second layer includes the flexor hallucis longus tendon, flexor digitorum longus tendon, quadratus plantae muscle, and four lumbrical muscles. The third layer contains the flexor hallucis brevis, adductor hallucis (oblique and transverse heads), and the flexor digiti minimi brevis muscles. The deepest layer (fourthÂ layer) contains the fibularis longus tendon, tibialis anterior tendon, tibialis posterior tendon, and the interosseous muscles (three plantar interosseous muscles, four dorsal interosseous muscles).
