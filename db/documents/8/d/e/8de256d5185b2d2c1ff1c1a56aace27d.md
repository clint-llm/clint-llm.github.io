The greater superficial petrosal nerve, per some authors, divides into four anatomical areas. The first portion is the intrapetrosal portion; the second concerns the suprapetrosal portion; the third anatomical area involves the foramen lacerum, ending with the fourth portion at the level of the pterygoid canal â€” about 17.5% of the nerve forms anastomoses with the glossopharyngeal nerve.
