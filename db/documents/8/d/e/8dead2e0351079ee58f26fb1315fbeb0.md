No equipment is needed to perform the Bekhterev-Jacobsohn reflex. A practitioner can use his or her hand/fingers to tap the patient's wrist; however, he or she can also use a reflex hammer if it is convenient. There are many different types of reflex hammers, all of which can be used for this test. There should be a seat or bed where the patient can comfortably sit, so his or her arm is fully relaxed when the reflex is performed.
