Prompt identification and differentiation from other common exertional injuries are essential to caring for an athlete with EAH. Healthcare providers should suspect EAH when athletes present during or within 24 hours following intense physical exertion, such as marathon running, cycling, triathlon, hiking, backpacking, or prolonged military field training or combat operations. The likelihood of EAH is increased if the exertional event occurred over a period greater than 2 hours or in hot weather.

Presenting symptoms range from asymptomatic, to mild, to severe. Mild symptoms include lightheadedness, malaise, fatigue, irritability, generalized weakness, headache, nausea, and sluggish urine output.

Diagnosis of EAH is further supported by the absence of signs of symptomatic heat illness or dehydration, such as thirst, postural dizziness, dry mucous membranes, orthostatic hypotension, and elevated core temperature.Â Differentiating EAH from exercise heat illness and dehydration is critical, as isotonic fluid administration that would be given for the empiric treatment of either heat illness or dehydration could be life-threatening if the true diagnosis is EAH.

On physical examination, patients with mild EAH may demonstrate mild hyperthermia, tachycardia, flushing, diaphoresis, and lethargy. Patients with severe EAH may demonstrate altered sensorium ranging from inattentiveness to complete obtundation, loss of sweating, hypotension, and abnormal limb movements.
