A peripheral blood smear should be studied when there is concern for hemolysis. One would look for abnormal red blood cells such as schistocytes, spherocytes, or bite cells.

RBC shape is crucial in diagnosis. A distinctive blood smear may even be sufficient for the diagnosis of a type of hemolytic anemia. This can be seen in cases such as hereditary elliptocytosis or Southeast Asian ovalocytosis.

However, other hemolytic anemias may have similar features such as red cell fragmentation, as seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and mechanical hemolytic anemia from leaking prosthetic valves.

Oxidant damage produces specific types of red blood cells, therefore, aiding in the diagnosis from a blood smear. Keratocytes or "bite" cells, "blister" cells, and irregularly contracted cells must be differentiated from spherocytes as it will alter one's diagnosis.
