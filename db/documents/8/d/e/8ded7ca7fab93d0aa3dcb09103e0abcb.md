There is currently no antiviral therapy approved for treating hantavirus infection, thus supportive careÂ remains the mainstay of therapy. Early admission to the intensive care unit is warranted as the disease is likely to progress and mechanical ventilation, as well as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, may be warranted in some patients. While hantavirus infection is systemic and viral nucleic acid is found in other organs on immunohistochemistry, the clinical picture is dominated by the pathology in the lung. Due to rapid fluid shifts, close attention must be paid to fluid and electrolyte balance in intensive care units.
