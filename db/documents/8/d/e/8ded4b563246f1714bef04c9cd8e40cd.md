Paralysis of the gluteus maximus does not affect walking on a plane (perfectly flat) surface. The gluteus maximus only contracts during a part of the stance phase of ambulation. This stance phase occurs from when the heel strikes the ground to when the foot is flat. The gluteus maximus works by resisting further flexion of the hip and initiating extension. The gluteus maximus actively functions when climbing up a flight of stairs or lifting from a seated position.
