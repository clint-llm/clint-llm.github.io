The common adverse reaction to monitor is the effects of nNMB induced histamine release. Studies have shown that benzylisoquinolinium nNMBs (atracurium, mivacurium) have the highest incidence of all nNMBs to induce histamine reactions in the perioperative setting. The effects of histamine reaction include hemodynamic instability (tachycardia, hypotension), bronchospasm, and urticaria.

The primary drug interaction to monitor is the co-administration of nNMBs and inhaled anesthetics (desflurane, sevoflurane, isoflurane, enflurane, halothane, NO). Inhaled anesthetics augment nNMB activity so that the dosing of nNMB must be reduced to accommodate. If there is no reduction in dosing, then the risk of a residual blockade and ensuing pulmonary distress increases.

- Augments: antibiotics (aminoglycosides, clindamycin, tetracycline), antiarrhythmics (quinidine, calcium channel blockers), dantrolene, ketamine, local anesthetics, magnesium sulfate

- Resistance: anticonvulsants (phenytoin, valproic acid, carbamazepine), cholinesterase inhibitors (neostigmine, pyridostigmine)
