Erythema ab igne is mostly a clinical diagnosis that raises suspicion, given the relevant history and characteristic skin manifestations. Long-standing disease in the presence of ulcerations, hyperkeratosis, or bullae should prompt further evaluation by a dermatologist, as this finding can be associated with the malignant transformation of squamous cell carcinoma.

In ambiguous cases, a biopsy should be considered, particularly as this may mimic or mask underlying skin cancer, such as basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma; it may even mask cutaneous metastases of internal malignancy, like colonic adenocarcinoma.
