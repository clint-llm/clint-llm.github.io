Treatment of thoracic outlet syndrome can be via scalenectomy for upper thoracic outlet syndrome, and a first rib resection is an option for lower thoracic outlet syndrome. Both procedures can also be done simultaneously for the best results. Regardless, these are done to give the vasculature and nerves wider access to the rest of the upper extremity.

During the procedure, the scalenus anterior and medius muscles are identified and divided before the first rib is excised; however, using an interscalene approach, it is also possible to complete this without the division of the scalenus anterior.
