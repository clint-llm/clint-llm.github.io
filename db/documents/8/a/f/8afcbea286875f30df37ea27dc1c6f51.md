The main predisposing factor for galactocele development is mammary duct obstruction in the lactating breast, most likely due to trauma, inflammation, nipple abnormalities, or a tumor in rare cases. Distal obstruction of the terminal duct lobular unit causes proximal focal ductal dilatation, forming a galactocele.

Transplacental passage of prolactin does not explain the development of galactocele in male infants, who present with a new-onset breast swelling after a period of dormancy of a few months after birth. To explain this phenomenon, it is hypothesized that neonates develop small retention cystsÂ which remain silent, and their secretory activity eventually ceases with time normally. However, trauma precipitates an inflammatory reaction which leads to galactocele formation.

The hypothetical contributory factor behind galactocele is the wrong breastfeeding technique, for example, breastfeeding intermittently or in a lying position.
