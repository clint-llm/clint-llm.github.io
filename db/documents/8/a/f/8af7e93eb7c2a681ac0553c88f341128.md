PTX exposure, and resulting toxicity via coral, is mostly associated with inhalation of vapors during cleaning, scrubbing, or eradicating the coral from home/public aquariums. Due to the rapid growth of zoanthids, it requires regular removal from specific unwanted areas of the aquarium. The removal process is mostly by boiling in water and/or scrubbing out from rocks. This process may result in inhalation of steam or aerosolized droplets. Also, instances of dermal absorption from prolonged and unprotected handling of PTX containing coral have been reported. It can occur via both intact and broken skin.

PTX toxicity can occur due to the consumption of seafood capable of producing PTX or seafood contaminated with corals. Also, reports of corneal toxicity have been reported caused by PTX.
