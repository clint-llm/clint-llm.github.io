The herald patch is a round to oval erythematous patch or plaque with central clearing and peripheral scale trailing behind the margins of the erythema. The herald patch typically measures 2 to 10 cm. However, rare reports of very large herald patches have been described, with one case nearly covering the entire trunk of an 18-month-old female child. Most herald patches appear on the trunk, neck, or proximal extremities, although in rare cases they have appeared on the face, genitalia, scalp, and acral surfaces. Most lesions are asymptomatic but some may be pruritic. A few days to 2 weeks after the appearance of the herald patch, patients develop the more diffuse eruption of pityriasis rosea. It is accompanied by smaller lesions resembling the herald patch following the Langer lines in a “Christmas tree” pattern, with truncal predominance. Most patients experience prodromal symptoms including a headache, fever, arthralgias, and malaise either before or around the time the herald patch appears.
