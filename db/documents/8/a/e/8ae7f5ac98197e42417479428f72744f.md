NC develops shortly after birth in about half of patients, and most patients develop the lesions before the age of ten years. The most common affected sites are the face, neck, upper arms, chest, and abdomen. Sites such as the scalp are affected quiteÂ rarely. Other rare but reported sites of involvement include the palms and the glans penis. The usual presentation is in the form of a single group of dilated and plugged follicular ostia in a honeycomb pattern. Other patterns seen include linear, segmental, or Blaschkoid. The lesions may rarely be bilateral. Two specific subtypes have been described: (1) a non-pyogenic type and (2) a type associated with the formation of cysts, pustules, and abscesses. Nevus comedonicus can occur in isolation or in combination with systemic abnormalities in the central nervous system, skeletal system, another skin manifestation, or ocular and dental abnormalities. Combination subtypes are known as nevus comedonicus syndrome.
