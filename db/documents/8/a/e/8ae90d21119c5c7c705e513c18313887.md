An ultrasound B-scan can be useful if the fundal view is blocked, for example, by dense longstanding vitreous hemorrhage.

In certain situations, more specific investigations may be necessary. An ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) may be useful in traumatic cataracts to detect and assess occult zonular defects.

Specular microscopy may be helpful in epithelial downgrowth. It may show a demarcation line between the epithelial membrane and the corneal endothelium in the setting of a retrocorneal epithelial membrane. However, its use requires a relatively clear cornea and will not be useful in the presence of corneal edema.
