The three main types of kyphosis usually seen in individuals are postural kyphosis, Scheuermann disease, and congenital deformities. Postural kyphosis usually starts to show up in adolescents, with more females being affected compared to males. The slouching posture increases the forward curvature, which will, in turn, stretch the extensor muscles of the back and the posterior ligaments of the spine, thereby weakening it over time.

Scheuermann disease, also known as juvenile kyphosis, is a structural deformity of the thoracic/thoracolumbar spine that usually occurs before puberty. It is thought that the discordant mineralization of the vertebral endplate and ossification during growth and development causes an anteriorly wedged vertebral body.

Congenital kyphosis is an uncommon cause of hyperkyphosis but can be severely disabling, rapidly progressive, and is more commonly associated with neurological complications compared to the other causes of kyphosis.

In addition to the three causes listed above, there are many other causes, such as an increase in age, injuries inflicted on the spine, osteoporosis, slipped disc, infections in the spine, and malignancies.
