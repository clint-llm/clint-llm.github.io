Paramyxoviruses are enveloped, single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm.  Diseases caused by these viruses continue to produce high mortality and morbidity across the world.

The family Paramyxoviridae contains two subfamilies that are relevant to humans: Pneumovirinae and Paramyxovirinae. The subfamily Pneumovirinae gives rise to the genus Pneumovirus (respiratory syncytial virus).  The subfamily Paramyxovirinae gives rise to the genus Morbillivirus (measles virus/ rubeola), to the genus Respirovirus (para-influenza viruses 1 and 3), and to the genus Rubulavirus (mumps virus and para-influenza viruses 2 and 4).

Measles and rubella are targeted for elimination in five different World Health Organization (WHO) regions by 2020.
