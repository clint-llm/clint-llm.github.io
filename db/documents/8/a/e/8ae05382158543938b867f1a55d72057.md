Sensory integration therapy (SIT) is mainly performed by occupational therapists to help children improve their processing and integration of sensory inputs to gain appropriate adaptive response to everyday stimuli.

Sensory integration is mainly an intervention for children with developmental and behavioral disorders. The activities included in SI provide vestibular, proprioceptive, auditory, and tactile stimuli, which in turn organize the sensory system. Such stimuli are provided in play using brushes, swings, trampolines, balls, and other equipment used to elicit proprioceptive, tactile, and vestibular challenges.

ASI interventions are founded on neuroplasticity, aiming to malleate the nervous system through experience. Guided involvement in sensorimotor activities incorporated in play can promote neuroplastic changes leading to adaptive behaviors as a result of the experiences directed during the intervention. This practice has its basis in the idea that neural networks form as a result of experience.

Sensory deficits are measured through the sensory profile,Â which consists of interviews with parents, a review of child evaluation reports, and observation of behaviors. After the assessment of data, goals are created to target areas of concern.
