The function of vibratory receptors is to make us aware of different frequencies of external stimuli. Meissner corpuscles detect frequencies between 30 and 50 Hz; Pacinian corpuscles are sensitive to frequencies between 100 and 400 Hz. The dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway appreciates fine touch, 2-point discrimination, and vibration sensations from all the body excluding the head.
