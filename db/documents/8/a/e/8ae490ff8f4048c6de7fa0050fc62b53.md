Pulmonary eosinophilia is a syndrome of elevated eosinophils greater than 25% in BAL or significant peripheral eosinophilia with pulmonary infiltrates. Bronchoscopy with BAL is the most commonly used approach to make a diagnosis of PE.

The diagnostic approach would be based on history, physical, laboratory testing, and imaging. If the patient has exposure to an endemic parasitic area, then consider simple/tropical pulmonary eosinophilia. If there is a prior history of uncontrolled asthma, then consider ABPA. If multiple organs are involved, such as the heart, skin, and nerves, with vasculitic changes then consider EGPA. If acute ARDS is pictured, then consider AEP. If chronic bilateral peripheral pulmonary opacities are found, then consider CEP. If no obvious cause is found, then it can be drug-induced. There can be significant overlap in the presentation of CEP and EGPA.

Corticosteroids are the main choice of treatment in most pulmonary eosinophilic pneumonias such as AEP, CEP, ABPA, EGPA, and HES. Anti-parasitic agents are used for parasite-induced pulmonary eosinophilia. CEP and ABPA frequently return and need recurrent therapy.
