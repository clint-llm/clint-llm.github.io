Pemphigus is a group of vesiculobullous autoimmune diseases. The most common type of pemphigus is pemphigus vulgaris, characterized by mucocutaneous bullae. Among the many types of pemphigus, the rarest clinical variant is pemphigus vegetans. It distinguishes itself from pemphigus vulgaris by the formation of vegetative plaques in intertriginous areas and oral mucosa. Thought to be a subtype of pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus vegetans represents 1 to 2% of all pemphigus. This activity highlights the presentation and diagnosis of pemphigus vegetans, a rare variant of autoimmune pemphigus and emphasizes the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pemphigus vegetans.
- Explain the history and physical exam of a patient with pemphigus vegetans.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for pemphigus vegetans.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance pemphigus vegetans and improve outcomes.
