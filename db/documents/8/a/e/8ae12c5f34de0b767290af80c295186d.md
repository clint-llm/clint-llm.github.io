Both radiation therapy and chemotherapy have long-term complications in survivors of testicular cancer. With post-therapy life estimates being approximately more than 40 years in these young individuals, the morbidity of long term complications can be very significant.

- Chemotherapy related neurotoxicity: Peripheral neuropathy is a common adverse event of platinum chemotherapy. About 20 to 40% of patients will develop neurotoxicity, which can be painful and also cause permanent sensory abnormalities.

- Cardiovascular complications: There can be up to a seven-fold increased risk of developing a cardiac event in survivors of testicular cancer who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

- Infertility and hypogonadism: Chemotherapy and the use of radiation to seminoma affected scrotum can result in oligospermia and infertility. Thus, sperm banking must be offered to all patients before undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The risk of infertility is directly proportional to the intensity and duration of the treatment. Hypogonadism or testicular dysfunction is a common sequela among survivors of testicular cancer.

- Ototoxicity: Cisplatin can cause permanent, sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus.

- Secondary neoplasms: Both chemotherapy and radiotherapy can increase the risk of secondary malignant tumors in survivors. Etoposide can cause treatment-related leukemia, and risk is proportional to the total dose administered.
