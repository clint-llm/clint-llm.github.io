Deterrence and patient education on CBS mainly relate to inquiring about visual hallucinations in those experiencing vision loss. Additionally, providing education on the condition from a primary prevention standpoint is also vital, given that many patients fail to report hallucinations due to the fear of being seen as mentally ill.

Studies have shown that education on CBS before the onset of hallucinations reduces negative symptoms such as fear or stress-related hallucinations impacting daily activities.Â For those who report hallucinations and meet diagnostic criteria, it is crucial to provide reassurance that CBS is primarily a transient condition unrelated to dementia or being mentally ill.
