There is now more importance placed now on neuroimaging in cases of catatonia as there has been a noted decrease in functioning in the motor regions of the parietal and frontal cortexes of the cerebrum. Blood chemistries, blood count, serum iron, and even lumbar puncture for autoimmune antibodies for more severe cases of catatonia may be indicated.

The best way to evaluate for symptoms of catatonia is via the Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BCFRS).

A benzodiazepine challenge is warranted to reveal a positive diagnosis. Often 2 mg of lorazepam is given PO or IV to a patient, and remission of symptoms can be seen in 10 minutes. Studies have shown at least a 60% change in symptom presentation.
