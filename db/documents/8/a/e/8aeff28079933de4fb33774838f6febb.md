The management of metabolic acidosis should address the cause of the underlying acid-base derangement. Because there are many causes, the electrolyte disorder is best managed by an interprofessional teamt that also includes nurses and pharmacists. For example, adequate fluid resuscitation and correction of electrolyte abnormalities are necessary for sepsis and diabetic ketoacidosis. Other therapies to consider include antidotes for poisoning, dialysis, antibiotics, and bicarbonate administration in certain situations.

The outcomes depend on the cause, patient morbidity and response to treatment.
