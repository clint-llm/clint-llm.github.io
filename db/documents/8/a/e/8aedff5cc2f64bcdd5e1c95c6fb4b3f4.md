**Mechanical Ventilation**

Following intubation, known techniques with proven benefits over the years should be instituted to allow for the best outcomes. Berlin et al. summarize the ventilation strategy in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 with an approach to prioritize lung-protective ventilation (LPV).

**Avoiding Alveolar Overdistension**

Alveolar overdistension is one of the commonest forms of ventilator-mediated injury. Since alveolar distension is directly related to the amount of tidal volume applied and depends on the lung compliance at a given time, it is important to follow a low tidal volume approach. In COVID-19 ARDS, there is a significant amount of damage to the lung due to direct viral injury, alveolar leakage and edema, and atelectasis. This leads to a reduction of the aerated lung volume, and a low tidal volume strategy can prove extremely beneficial.

The Acute Respiratory Syndrome network (ARDSnet) conducted a landmark trial in the management of ARDS, which showed mortality benefits using low tidal volume ventilation. The trial compared ventilation with a lower tidal volume, which involved an initial tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and a plateau pressure of 30 cm of water with traditional ventilation treatment, which involved an initial tidal volume of 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and a plateau pressure of less than 50 cm of water. This trial was stopped early due to lower mortality in the LTV group. The plateau pressure is defined as the airway pressure measured in a mechanically ventilated patient after a 0.5-second pause at the end of inspiration. This is a proven surrogate for measuring overdistension, and several studies recommend a plateau pressure threshold of 30 cm of water or lower to avoid overdistension.

**Preventing Hyperoxia and Avoiding Cyclical Alveolar Collapse**

It is now well known that lungs inflicted with ARDS have a heterogenous disposition with areas of collapse interspersed between areas of aeration. There are swings of collapse and opening of lung segments leading to damage via a phenomenon described as atelectrauma. The open lung concept was described by Lachmann while also postulating that areas of atelectasis or collapsed lung are interspersed with areas of the healthy lung. In order to maintain aeration and avoid this atelectrauma, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is applied, leading to continued patency of the airway following expiration. Kacmarek and colleagues performed a randomized controlled trial comparing a low PEEP approach as used by the ARDSnet group to a high PEEP open lung approach in a randomized controlled trial.

The open lung approach showed improved oxygenation and driving pressures without any detrimental effects on mortality, ventilator-free days, or barotrauma. However, their findings need to be demonstrated in a larger randomized controlled trial. Care should be practiced using a high PEEP strategy as it can lead to potential overdistension and result in VILI. Driving pressures are easy surrogates of lung compliance that can be calculated at the patient’s bedside. The calculation is Driving Pressure = (Plateau pressure – PEEP).  Studies have shown that driving pressure is possibly a better surrogate for lung distension and overdistension.

Hyperoxia is a known cause of lung damage with free radical-mediated injury as well as from absorptive atelectasis. The fraction of nitrogen in inspired air is important in maintaining the patency of smaller airways. Nitrogen is inert with negligible absorption via the alveoli at normal atmospheric pressure. When the fraction of nitrogen is replaced with oxygen, a freely absorbed gas, the smaller airway collapse due to a phenomenon called absorptive atelectasis. Hence frequent arterial blood gas measurements to maintain the lowest amount of FiO2 to maintain a PaO2 of 55-80 mm Hg is recommended.

**Prone Positioning**

Prone positioning has been used to improve oxygenation in severe ARDS. The improvement in oxygenation is postulated to be due to improvement in ventilation and perfusion matching, a better distribution of aeration, improvement of chest wall mechanics, and better secretion clearance.

Following are the criteria for proning:

- Mechanical ventilation for ARDS for less than 36 hours

- Severe ARDS is defined as a PaO: FiO ratio of <150 mm Hg, with a FiO of ≥0.6, a PEEP of ≥5 cm of water.

The patients should be proned for at least 16 hours. Care should be taken during the process of proning, as accidental extubation can lead to de-recruitment leading to ensuing lung injury.  Criteria for successful proning include improved oxygenation with a PaO2:FiO2 ratio of  ≥150 mm Hg with a PEEP of ≤10 cm of water and a FiO of ≤0.6. Of note, these measurements should be made at least 4 hours after unproning. On the other hand, a significant worsening of oxygenation by more than 20% decrease in the PaO2:FiO2 ratio, hemodynamic instability, impending collapse, cardiopulmonary arrest are indications of immediately abandoning proning.

**Neuromuscular Blockade**

Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMB) can help abolish patient-ventilator dys-synchrony, and their utility has been evaluated and studied in the past decade. The use of NMB’s has shown improvement in oxygenation and reduce inflammatory biomarkers. However, the consensus on an improvement in mortality remains divided. While a randomized controlled trial in 2010 showed an improvement in mortality, a larger RCT in 2019 did not demonstrate any mortality benefit.

In the context of COVID-19 ARDS, boluses of NMB’s are suggested to abolish episodes of asynchrony with ventilator in comparison to continuous infusions.

**ECMO**

If the indication of starting ECMO is met, prompt consultation with the ECMO team should be sought. When a decision to proceed with cannulation for ECMO has been made, the patient should ideally be moved to the pertinent ICU involved and experienced in dealing with patients on ECMO. ELSO guidelines recommended a two catheter strategy with the draining cannula in the femoral vein positioned just 1-2 cms below the cavo-atrial junction and the return cannula either placed in the internal jugular vein near the superior cavoatrial junction or contralateral femoral vein. Dual-lumen catheters should be avoided as they require specialized settings like fluoroscopic guidance or echocardiographic guidance, leading to longer cannulation times and are more prone to mispositioning, requiring specialized image guidance like TEE or fluoroscopy for repositioning.

The flows on the ECMO machine should be adjusted in order to capture at least 60% of the cardiac output to achieve adequate oxyhemoglobin saturation of >88%.

The goal of these ventilator settings is to reduce the driving pressure, which has been correlated strongly to mortality and decrease the energy transferred to the lungs by the ventilator, also called mechanical power.

Weaning from ECMO remains a challenge and needs to be timed appropriately to avoid the deleterious effects of prolonged ECMO. Ideally, the weaning strategy should be decided before cannulation if the patient’s native lung function doesn’t recover. If transplantation services are not available at the ECMO performing institution, prior engagement with the transplant centers is encouraged. Establishing futility in the absence of other organ dysfunction can be challenging, and decisions to terminate ECMO support should be carefully discussed. Discontinuation /prolonged continuation of ECMO can pose ethical dilemmas and challenges; early involvement of the ethics team and palliative medicine is highly encouraged.

In conclusion, VV-ECMO should be offered to patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure who have failed conventional therapies. However, ECMO is resource-intensive, and imitation should be done carefully based on the local case surges and capacity of the healthcare system.
