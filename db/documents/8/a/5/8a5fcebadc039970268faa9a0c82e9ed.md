Pruritus occurs secondary to increased levels of bile acids within the skin and in the serum. The exact mechanism by which bile acids induce pruritus is not well understood. Bile salts, due to their detergent properties, can lead to the release of histamine and proteolytic enzymes through the solubilization of lipid cellular membranes. The release of histamine and other enzymes can lead to the activation of free nerve endings, thus leading to pruritus.

The levels of bile acids rise secondary to hormonal and genetic factors. Hormones like estrogen and progesterone, whose levels increase through the course of pregnancy, have a cholestatic effect and reduce the hepatic excretory function.
