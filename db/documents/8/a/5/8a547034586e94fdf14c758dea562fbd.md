The LDL receptor is found in the liver and most other tissues. It recognizes Apo B 100 and Apo E, mediating the uptake of LDL, chylomicron remnants, and IDL through endocytosis. After internalization, the lipoprotein particle is degraded in lysosomes, and cholesterol is released. When cholesterol enters the cell, HMG CoA reductase activity increases then synthesizes cholesterol and modulates the expression of LDL receptors. LDL receptors on the liver determine plasma LDL levels. When there is a low number of receptors, less LDL can be taken up from the blood by the liver, leading to high plasma LDL levels. Conversely, when there are more LDL receptors, more LDL is taken up from the blood by the liver, leading to low plasma LDL levels.

Cholesterol levels regulate the number of LDL receptors in the cell. If the cell senses a decrease in cholesterol levels, the transcription factor SREBP is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi, where proteases cleave and activate SREBP, which moves to the nucleus and increases the expression of LDL receptors. When cholesterol levels are low in the cell, high SREBP levels remain in the endoplasmic reticulum in an inactive form, and the expression of LDL receptors is decreased.
