The pathophysiology of CBS first starts with any factor that leads to loss of vision. These factors which can affect any part of the visual pathway commonly include cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and cerebral infarction affecting the visual cortex.

The current and most commonly accepted theory for the visual hallucinations seen in CBS is that visual sensory deafferentation results in disinhibitions of cortical regions affecting vision.

Ultimately, this disinhibition leads to spontaneous firing of these vision-associated regions, resulting in hallucinations. Studies supporting this theory have shown through neuroimaging that visual cortical regions, such as the ventral occipital lobe, spontaneously fire during hallucinations in patients who met diagnostic criteria.

Furthermore, neuroimaging also revealed that the hallucinations correlate with the functions of the involved firing cortical region. Due to the process by which the hallucinations are understood, CBS is not seen in congenital blindness.
