Amebiasis is a relatively common parasitic infection. An important component of treatment is patient education via an interprofessional team. The primary caregiver, nurse practitioner, specialty care nurse, and pharmacist should educate all travelers on maintaining good personal hygiene, sanitation, and avoiding high-risk sexual practices. The E. histolytica cysts are relatively resistant to disinfection of water with chlorine. Drinking boiled or bottled water is advised. All food should be washed, and the skin of fruits should be peeled. If abdominal pain symptoms, cramps, and diarrhea persist, a visit to the healthcare provider is recommended. Physicians and nurse practitioners diagnose amebiasis and recommend treatment. Specialty trained nurses in infection control and gastroenterology should assist in coordinating care and assisting with patient and family education. The pharmacist should educate the patient on the importance of hydration and medication compliance and coordinate with the clinician on antimicrobial agent selection. Communication between these professionals as part of the interprofessional healthcare team will improve care coordination, leading to better outcomes.

When treated promptly, the outcomes are good.
