Somatostatin is produced in multiple locations in the body. It is most notably present in the islets of Langerhans within the pancreas. Within these specialized areas of the pancreas, somatostatin is produced by delta-cells, which comprise about 5% of the islet cells. The glucagon-producing alpha-cells and insulin-producing beta-cells make up the majority of the islets. Somatostatinproduciton is also in close proximity to the pancreas within the GI tract in D-cells, which contain the majority of somatostatin found in the entire body: roughly 65%. Lastly, somatostatin is produced by neurons in the anterior periventricular nucleus and arcuate nucleus within the hypothalamus, which was the first location within the body that somatostatin was identified.
