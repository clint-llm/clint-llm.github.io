Although the etiology and pathogenesis of CSX or microvascular angina is not entirely understood, different mechanisms and theories of the condition have been reported. One of the predominant etiologies is microvascular dysfunction of the coronary vessels limiting blood flow resulting in ischemia or typical/atypical angina. Another commonly hypothesized etiology is heightened cardiac pain sensitivity, termed "hyperalgesia." It is considered in patients with typical anginal chest pain and microvascular dysfunction of the coronary vessels after stressors such as exercise, which did not exhibit any evidence of ischemia of the myocardium.

Microvascular dysfunction and heightened cardiac pain sensitivity could also occur in some patients, while other subjects with CSX may have distinct underlying etiologies. Subjects who have established CSX have a 30% greater probability of presenting with underlying metabolic comorbid conditions when compared to the general population (8%). Potential contributing factors to the pathogenesis of CSX and coronary microvascular dysfunction include insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, enhanced sodium-hydrogen exchange in red blood cells (RBC), chronic inflammation with elevated C-reactive protein levels (CRP), and vascular or nonvascular smooth muscle dysfunction.
