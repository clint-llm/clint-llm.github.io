The management of Ancylostoma infection is best accomplished with an interprofessional team consisting of an infectious disease expert, emergency and primary care clinicians, and pharmacists. The diagnosis can be difficult because the infection is not common in the US. The clinicians should be aware that the majority of people who are infected with Ancylostoma are from the endemic areas, or they are travelers who visit the endemic areas. Healthcare practitioners should take a careful history, including asking whether patients walk barefoot in endemic areas, have contact with domesticated animals, and inquire about the nutritional status and growth of pediatric patients to determine the presence of Ancylostoma infection. Once the diagnosis is made, the treatment with drugs like albendazole and mebendazole is highly effective. Public health clinicians and nurses play an important role in endemic areas by maintaining MDA programs and educating patients on the importance of improved sanitation and hygiene.
