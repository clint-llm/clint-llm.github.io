Ketamine intoxication can present similarly to PCP, methoxetamine, and dextromethorphan intoxication, all of which bind to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. Also, providers should consider intoxication with alcohol, amphetamine, cocaine, LSD, MDMA, and salicylate, as well as delirium tremens from alcohol withdrawal. Malignant hyperthermia that develops after succinylcholine or volatile anesthetics such as halothane, and side effects from antihistamines like diphenhydramine and anticholinergics such as benztropine, can also mimic signs of ketamine intoxication.

Psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and complications from psychiatric treatments such as serotonin syndrome from SSRIs, neuroleptic malignant syndrome from antipsychotics, and side effects from tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants, can present similarly to ketamine intoxication.

Especially in the presence of altered mental status, CNS infections such as meningitis and encephalitis, and CNS malignancies also merit consideration. Acute conditions affecting the central nervous system, such as head trauma and intracerebral hemorrhage, can cause mental status and vital sign changes that simulate ketamine toxicity. Acute systemic conditions such as hypoxia, hypoglycemia, sepsis, hyperthyroidism, and electrolyte abnormalities such as hyponatremia should be differentials.
