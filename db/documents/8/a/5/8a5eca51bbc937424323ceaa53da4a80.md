Patients with a neuronal or glioneuronal brain tumor require interprofessional discussion. Patients with LEATs require consultation with neurosurgeons, epilepsy neurologists, neuroradiologists, and occasionally medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and neuropathologists. These consultations often occur in the form of an interprofessional epilepsy conference. These and other patients with neuronal and glioneuronal brain tumors may also be discussed at an interprofessional tumor board conference, including neurosurgeons, neurologists, neuroradiologists, neuropathologists, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists.
