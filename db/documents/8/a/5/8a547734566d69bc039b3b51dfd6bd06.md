The blood supply of the brachialis is ultimately from the tributaries of the brachial artery and the radial recurrent artery. Occasionally, other arteries may supply the brachialis, including branches of the ulnar collateral arteries. The venous drainage from the brachialis muscle is ultimately the brachial vein, which later joins with the basilic vein tributary and forms the axillary vein. The upper limb contains both superficial and deep lymphatic channels.

The superficial channels generally follow superficial vasculature and perforate into the deep lymphatics at various points, particularly near the cubital fossa.Â The deep lymphatic channels generally follow the main vessels and ultimately drain into the axillary lymph nodes.
