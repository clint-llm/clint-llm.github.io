The muscles of the face subdivide into four groups. These groups consist of the orbital group, the nasal group, the oral group, and others. The muscles correlating with the nasal group are the nasalis, procerus, and depressor septi. Another muscle, levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, is associated with the oral group but has functions associated with the nose.Â  The facial nerve, CNVII, is the innervation for these muscles.

**Nasalis**

- Transverse part: Originates on the maxilla lateral to the nose and inserts on the dorsum of the nose. This part compresses the nasal aperture.

- Alar part: Originates above the lateral incisor and inserts on the alar cartilage. The function of this part is to open the nostril by pulling the alar cartilage down and lateral.

**Procerus**

The procerus originates on the nasal bone and upper lateral cartilage while inserting on the skin overlying the glabella. The function of the procerus is to wrinkle skin over the bridge of the nose by pulling the medial angle of the eyebrows downward.

**Depressor Septi**

The depressor septi originates on the maxilla above the central incisors and inserts on the anterior septum. This muscle's primary function is to draw the nose inferiorly.

**Levator Labii Superioris Alaeque Nasi (LLSAN)**

The LLSAN originates on the frontal process of the maxilla and inserts on the alar cartilage and upper lip. The function of this muscle is to open the nostril and elevate the upper lip.
