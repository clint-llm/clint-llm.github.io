APUDomas or APUD tumors arise from APUD cells which have the ability of amine precursors uptake and intracellular decarboxylation, before converting them into active amines, hence the name, amine precursor uptake, and decarboxylation cells. These cells were originally described by Pearse in the 1960s, to arise from the neural crest.
