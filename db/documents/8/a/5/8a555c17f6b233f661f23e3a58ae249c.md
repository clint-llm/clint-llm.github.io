The evaluation of ozone toxicity is similar to the evaluation of any pulmonary irritant. Oxygen saturation monitoring should be implemented, and also bedside spirometry. Providers should also consider arterial blood gas analysis and chest radiography as potential exposure to other pulmonary irritants should always be considered. An electrocardiogram should be performed as well in patients with or at risk for underlying cardiac disease.
