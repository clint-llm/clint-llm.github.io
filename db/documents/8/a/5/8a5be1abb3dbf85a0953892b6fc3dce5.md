Changes in adrenergic receptors may contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure and hypertension. Studies have shown age-associated changes in the autonomic nervous system such as increased cardiac sympathetic tone with decreased parasympathetic input, dampened cardiovagal baroreceptor sensitivity, and reduced clearance of norepinephrine in the plasma. Furthermore, age-related declines in beta-adrenergic receptor function have been found in patients with cardiovascular disorders. These findings include reduced beta-1 receptor sensitivity and responsiveness in the myocardium and reduced beta-2 receptor function in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to impaired vasodilation.

Changes in the noradrenergic system have also been associated with several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases processes:

**Alzheimer's Disease**

Alzheimer's disease is the most frequently encountered form of dementia characterized by progressive loss of memory and cognition. Proposed mechanisms for the development and progression of the disease include:

- Decreases in locus coeruleus volume and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells

- Hyperphosphorylated tau protein assembly into neurofibrillary tangles that accumulate in the locus coeruleus leading to neuronal degeneration and cell death - rostral cortically-projecting neurons have been found to be predominantly affected, which contributes to the impaired cognition and dementia seen in the disease

- Decreased levels of norepinephrine in the CNS, leading to norepinephrine’s anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects on the CNS

- Impaired norepinephrine transmission in the hippocampus due to the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and noradrenergic axonal degeneration

**Parkinson's Disease**

Parkinson's disease is a movement disorder that is also associated with being a cause of dementia. Although dopaminergic system dysfunction is the primary cause of the deficits seen in Parkinson disease, there is some evidence of noradrenergic system impairments involved in the cognitive and emotional deficits seen in Parkinson disease:

- Destruction of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (with no topological preference)

- Accumulation of alpha-synuclein in the locus coeruleus which leads to decreased norepinephrine levels and nigrostriatal pathway degenerative due to the loss of norepinephrine’s neuroprotective effects.

- Loss of alpha-2 auto-receptor protective effects on the noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems

**Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**

A disorder characterized by impairments of working memory and behavioral flexibility, inattention, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity. Proposed mechanisms for the development of the disorder include:

- Imbalances in the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems, deficiency in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K-gamma) enzyme leading to imbalances in the norepinephrine/dopamine ratio and dysregulation of synaptic plasticity, and impaired norepinephrine transporter (NET) function

- Hyperactivity and inattention attributed to dysfunctional noradrenergic transmission within the prefrontal cortex

**Schizophrenia**

A chronic mental illness characterized by a combination of positive and negative symptoms which may include hallucinations, delusions, blunted affect, inattention, and disorganized thoughts. Although still poorly understood, changes in dopaminergic and glutaminergic signaling are thought to be the leading cause of schizophrenic symptoms. There is also some evidence of the involvement of the noradrenergic system in the disorder such as:

- Elevated norepinephrine levels in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid in patients who experience paranoia

- Increased markers for norepinephrine in the brains of post-mortem schizophrenic patients

Medications involving the noradrenergic system have also been implicated in treating or worsening schizophrenic symptoms, depending on function. It has been found that drugs such as alpha-methyldopa, clonidine, and propranolol which decrease noradrenergic transmission in the CNS, help reduce positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Furthermore, medications such as methylphenidate, and desipramine which increase norepinephrine levels in the CNS have been found to worsen positive symptoms.

**Depression**

A common disorder that affects a person’s mood, cognition, thoughts, and behavior. Research on peripheral biomolecule levels in depressed individuals has been conducted and is ongoing, with norepinephrine being one of several biomolecules included in studies. It has been found that depressed individuals have increased expression of tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme within the locus coeruleus and increased levels of urinary norepinephrine.
