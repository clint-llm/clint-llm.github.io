Pituitary tumors are complex disease processes with serious implications on multiple endocrine systems as well as vision. Optimal management of such tumors warrants an interprofessional team approach, with the involvement of endocrinologists, ophthalmologists, neurosurgeons, otolaryngologists, and qualified nursing staff to prepare patients for procedures and assist during surgery, and monitor afterward.

These tumors are often incidentally detected on imaging studies by radiologists and referred to neurosurgeons for surgical management. Nonfunctioning tumors are monitored with serial imaging to identify an increase in the tumor size or complications associated with it. Functioning tumors, such as a prolactinoma, require rigorous medical management by an endocrinologist. Tumors refractory to medical management are referred to the neurosurgeons.

Ophthalmologists play a vital role in the early recognition of visual abnormalities in the pre and postoperative period.

Surgical management involves a team, including a neurosurgeon and an otolaryngologist, neuro-anesthetists, as well as nurses specialized in such complex cases. An otolaryngologist provides access to the tumor via the nasal cavities, and a neurosurgeon performs the resection of the tumor. Postoperative management is crucial, with close coordination between critical care specialists, nurses, and endocrinologists required. Hence for improved patient care, expert interprofessional team performance is vital. [Level 5]
