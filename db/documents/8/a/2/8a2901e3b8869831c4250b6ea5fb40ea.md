The muscles of mastication are also responsible for occlusion, given that they are the predominant mobilizers of the mandible.

**Muscles of Mastication**

Muscle

Origin

Insertion

Action

Temporalis

Temporal fossa

Coronoid process of the mandible

Elevate the mandible closing the jaw, mandibular retraction, and with unilateral action deviate the mandible to the ipsilateral side

Masseter

Zygomatic arch

Lateral aspect of the mandibular ramus

Elevate the mandible closing the jaw, mandibular retraction, some degree of protrusion of the mandible, and approximation of dentition (occlusion)

Medial pterygoid

Medial surface of the lateral pterygoid plate (sphenoid bone)

Medial aspect of the mandibular ramus and angle

Assists with mandible elevation (jaw closure), protrusion of mandible, and side-to-side mandibular movement for grinding in coordination with the lateral pterygoid

Lateral pterygoid

The lateral surface of the lateral pterygoid plate (sphenoid bone)

Condylar process of the mandible

Upper head: jaw-closing



Lower head: mandible depression (jaw opening), protrusion of the mandible, and side-to-side mandibular movement for grinding in coordination with the medial pterygoid

**Suprahyoid Muscles**

The suprahyoid muscles contribute to mandible depression (jaw opening). These include the digastric, stylohyoid, mylohyoid, and geniohyoid muscles.
