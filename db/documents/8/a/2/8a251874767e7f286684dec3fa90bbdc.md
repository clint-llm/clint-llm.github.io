**Injury Description**

**Epstein classification of anterior hip dislocations
**

Type 1: Superior dislocations

- 1A: No associated fracture

- 1B: Associated fracture or impaction of the femoral head

- 1C: Associated fracture of the acetabulum

Type 2: Inferior dislocations

- 2A: No associated fracture

- 2B: Associated fracture or impaction of the femoral head

- 2C: Associated fracture of the acetabulum

**Comprehensive classification of hip dislocations
**

This system includes both anterior and posterior dislocations and incorporated pre- and –post findings.

- Type I: No significant associated fracture, no clinical instability after reduction

- Type II: Irreducible dislocation (after attempt under general anesthesia) without significant femoral head or acetabular fracture

- Type III: Unstable hip after reduction or with incarcerated fragments of cartilage, labrum, or bone

- Type IV: Associated acetabular fracture requiring reconstruction to restore hip stability or joint congruity

- Type V: Associated femoral head or neck injury
