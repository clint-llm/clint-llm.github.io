**Efficacy Parameters**

Patients should notice an improvement in symptoms. Laboratory signs of improvement would include an increase in gastric pH. For GI bleeding, the goal gastric pH is typically greater than 4. The goal gastric acid secretion in Zollinger-Ellison disease is less than 10 mEq per hour.

**Additional Monitoring**

For patients receiving ranitidine IV at total daily doses greater than 400 mg, daily monitoring of liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) may be warranted. For acutely ill patients, serum creatinine may also be measured to provide information for renal dose adjustments as well as to monitor for potential nephrotoxicity. When there is a concern of GI bleeding, further monitoring may include occult blood tests, hemoglobin, and hematocrit.
