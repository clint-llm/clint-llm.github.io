While a generally well-tolerated drugÂ with relatively mild side effects, colesevelam still has a few side effects that healthcare providers should be aware of before prescribing a patient the medication. Clinicians should not give colesevelam to patients with a history of bowel obstruction. Additionally, patients with a history of serum triglyceride concentrations greater than 500mg/dL or a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis should not be given this drug due to its ability to increase triglyceride levels.
