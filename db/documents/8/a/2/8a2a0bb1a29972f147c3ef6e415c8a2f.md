Fluoroscopy is a valuable imaging tool that can provide a functional and anatomic assessment of patients in real-time while minimizing radiation exposure to patients when accompanied by contrast administration. The modality can guide therapeutic interventions that may be performed on an outpatient basis allowing for healthcare cost savings. This activity reviews the benefits of fluoroscopic guided contrast administration, the mechanism of action of contrast utilized in fluoroscopy, and the management of patients undergoing fluoroscopic injections utilizing contrast with an emphasis on inter-professional learning of these aspects so that clearer inter-professional communication between healthcare providers decreases the morbidity and mortality of patients undergoing these procedures.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the benefits of utilizing contrast agents with fluoroscopy.
- Identify some of the adverse reactions that can occur while utilizing contrast agents with fluoroscopic procedures.
- Summarize the mainstay treatments for protecting against contrast-induced acute kidney injury.
- Summarize the basic characteristics of contrast agents used in fluoroscopy.
