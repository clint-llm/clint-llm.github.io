There are several different video capsules available for use inÂ the United States. Most are used for diagnosis of small bowel lesions and transmit 2 to 6 images per second. Some capsules are specifically used to visualize the esophageal lumen. The PillCam ESO has a battery life of 20 minutes and a camera at both ends of the capsule. It transmits 18 images per second to evaluate the esophagus. PillCam COLON is used to visualize the colonic lumen and also has a camera on both ends. PillCam COLON activates 2 hours after ingestion to conserve battery life and allow complete colonic evaluation. The capsules range in size but are approximately 1.1 by 1.6 cm in size. The colon capsule is larger and is 1.1 by 3.2 cm. Video capsules transmit data to a wearable receiver through ultra-high frequency band radio telemetry or electric field propagation. A computer with specialized capsule endoscopy software is used to view images and interpret data. The software can detect potential bleeding sources by tagging images that have red pixels.
