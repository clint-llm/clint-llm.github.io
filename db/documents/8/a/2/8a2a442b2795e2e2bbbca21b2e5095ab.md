Many diseases have IgA glomerular deposition but do not have the clinical findings of the IgA nephropathy. Some of the conditions that have secondary causes of mesangial IgA deposition include liver diseases (alcoholic, cryptogenic or primary biliary cirrhosis), inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease), infections (HIV, leprosy, tuberculosis), skin disorders (psoriasis, dermatitis herpetiformis), malignancy (lung, pancreas, larynx), sarcoidosis, cystic fibrosis, among others.
