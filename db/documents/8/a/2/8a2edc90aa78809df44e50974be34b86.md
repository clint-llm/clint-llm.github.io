Prior to insertion, the provider visualizes the patient's abdomen and reviews any imaging as prior surgery may prevent proper tube placement. The patients are usually sedated and provided local anesthetic. A physician familiar with the endoscope inserts the gastroscope and inflates the stomach. The light source is visible through the skin, and the clinician marks the area for insertion of the tube, usually 2-cm medial to the costal margin and 2-cm below to the xiphoid process. After local sedation, they insert the tube and visualize a gastrocutaneous fistula or direct track between the anterior gastric wall and abdominal wall to confirm placement.
