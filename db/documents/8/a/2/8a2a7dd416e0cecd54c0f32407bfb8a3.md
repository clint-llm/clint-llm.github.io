An estimated 1 million new cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer occur every year. The numbers have increased significantly over the last 20 years within the United States and Europe. A research survey completed in 2005 revealed limited awareness of nonmelanoma skin cancer and prevention in the U.S., Australia, and Europe. For most individuals, healthcare providers are not the primary source of information for sun protection measures. The media plays a significantly influential role; however, there is minimal long-term behavioral change. These findings support the importance of engaging healthcare professionals to increase patient education regarding photoprotection and its role in preventing nonmelanoma skin cancer.

This is where a coordinated interprofessional effort from the interprofessional healthcare team, including clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists, can help patients avoid UV exposure and protect their skin. Since retail pharmacists are uniquely positioned where sun protection products are sold and can also see if the patient is taking any medications with potential phototoxicity, they can exert a significant influence in this regard. Nurses can also counsel patients, and all team members should be aware of patients with fair skin, who present with significant or frequent burns, or who have a high level of UV exposure because of work. WIth a coordinated interprofessional effort, patients can achieve the best outcomes with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]
