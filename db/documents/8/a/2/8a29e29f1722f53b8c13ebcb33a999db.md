Several other health conditions may present, like a pediatric migraine.

- Chronic daily headaches

- Brain tumors

- Vascular malformations

- Hydrocephalus

- Head trauma

- Mitochondriopathies

- Cluster headaches

Headaches manifested in pseudotumor cerebri (pseudotumor; idiopathic intracranial hypertension) are nonspecific and are difficult to distinguish clinically from migraine. Children's headaches have a high predictive value for migraine versus nonmigraine headaches. Pseudotumor symptoms were similar to migraine except for the presence of diplopia in pseudotumor.
