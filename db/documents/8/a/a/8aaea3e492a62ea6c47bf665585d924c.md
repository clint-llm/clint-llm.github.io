The treatment and management of scleritis are designed to determine any causative factor, manage ocular inflammation, control ocular pain and symptoms, prevent sequela, and reduce recurrences.

**Anterior Infectious**

Treatment tailored to the infectious cause

**Anterior Noninfectious**

**First-line treatments
**

- Topical corticosteroid eyedrops

- Can be used in mild cases; some report very limited success
- Prednisolone acetate 1.0% or difluprednate 0.05% four times per day are options

- Oral NSAIDs

- Can start with one agent and switch to another agent if not effective
- Indomethacin, commonly used, 50 mg, 3 times per day
- Ibuprofen 600 mg, 3 times per day
- Naproxen 500 mg, 2 times per day

**Second-line treatments**

- Oral corticosteroids

- Prescribed when oral NSAID treatment fails
- Oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day; 60 to 80 mg per day
- Dose continued until one month after the resolution of scleritis, then tapered accordingly

- Subconjunctival corticosteroid injection

- Can be used when steroids are contraindicated
- Controversial use with previous studies of scleral necrosis/perforation
- More recent reports have indicated improved safety and efficacy of injections

**Third line treatments**

- Immunosuppressive agents (steroid-sparing)

- Reserved for more severe cases of scleritis, with oral steroid treatment failure or concern for side effects with long-term oral steroid use
- Methotrexate is the most commonly prescribed agent; starting dose of 0.15 mg/kg per week in combination with folic acid supplements
- Other agents include azathioprine, mycophenolate, and cyclophosphamide

**Fourth line treatments**
