The femoral nerve innervates the anterior compartment of the thigh except for the psoas major and minor, which are innervated by the anterior rami of the lumbar nerves (L1, L2, L3). The femoral nerve (L2, L3, L4) runs from the abdomen under the inguinal ligament to enter the later side of the femoral triangle. The nerve then divides into several branches. The medial compartment of the thigh is innervated by the obturator nerve (L2, L3, L4). The only exception is the hamstring portion of the adductor magnus, which is innervated by the tibial part of the sciatic nerve (L4). The posterior compartment of the thigh is innervated by the sciatic nerve, which is made up of a tibial and fibular division. The semitendinosus and semimembranosus are innervated by the tibial division of the sciatic nerve (L5, S1, S2). The biceps femoris has dual innervation; the long head is innervated by the tibial nerve, and the short head by the fibular division of the sciatic nerve (L5, S1, S2).
