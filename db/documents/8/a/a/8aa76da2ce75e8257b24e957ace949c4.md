Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a rheumatic disorder characterized by pain and stiffness around the neck, shoulder, and hip area. This disorder is more common in white adults over 50 years of age. It is an inflammatory condition associated with an elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and c-reactive protein (CRP) being the common findings. Patients with PMR can have coexisting and/or develop giant cell arteritis (GCA). Some authors consider giant-cell arteritis (GCA) to be an extreme entity of the same spectrum of disorders as PMR. Challenges in managing PMR lie in correctly diagnosing the condition and appropriate treatment which involves a long period of follow-up.
