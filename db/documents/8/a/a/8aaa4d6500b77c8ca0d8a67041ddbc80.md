In 1972, electrical engineer Sir Godfrey Hounsfield invented the first computed tomography (CT) scanner.

CT images are two-dimensional pictures that represent three-dimensional physical objects. The images are made by converting electrical energy (moving electrons) into X-ray photons, passing the photons through an object, and then converting the measured photons back into electrons. The number of X-rays that pass through the object is inversely proportional to the density of the object. Objects (such as human beings) imaged by CT consist of parts that vary in density.

The CT machine passes X-ray photons through each point in the object at different angles through 360 degrees. Fluctuations in the density of the different parts of the object change the intensity of photons that successfully pass through the object depending on the angles at which the beam of photons is shone. A computer processor uses the differences in successfully transmitted X-ray photon measurements to produce a dataset that recreates the 3D object based on its various densities and displays sequential images of this dataset as 2D slices on film or a screen. The quality of the images depends on multiple factors, primarily image resolution and image contrast.

This article describes CT image production and factors that affect CT image quality, including:

- CT scanner components

- CT image generation

- Techniques of image reconstruction

- Contrast media
