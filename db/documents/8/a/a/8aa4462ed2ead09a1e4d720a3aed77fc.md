Palmoplantar psoriasis is a chronic variant of psoriasis that characteristically affects the skin of the palms and soles and produces significant functional disability. It features hyperkeratotic, pustular, or mixed morphologies. Though historically difficult to treat, recent studies on biologic therapies have shown promising results for the treatment of palmoplantar psoriasis. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of palmoplantar psoriasis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of palmoplantar psoriasis.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with palmoplantar psoriasis.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for palmoplantar psoriasis.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by palmoplantar psoriasis.
