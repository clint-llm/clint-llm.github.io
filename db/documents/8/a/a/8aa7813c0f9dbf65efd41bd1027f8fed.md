Given the potential for maternal and fetal morbidity associated with a uterine rupture, prevention strategies are prudent. Women at higher risk for uterine rupture (e.g., multiparity, multiple gestations, advanced maternal age, connective tissue disorders) should receive oxytocin judiciously. Likewise, procedures that may cause a uterine rupture, such as the internal podalic and external cephalic version, should be performed gently and with careful consideration for the type of anesthesia. Lastly, significant pressure applied to the uterus during the second stage of labor should be avoided. This practice has not been shown to shorten the second stage of labor, and it increases the risk for uterine rupture.

Women with risk factors for uterine rupture should be educated on the early signs and symptoms of rupture. It is recommended that women at high risk for uterine rupture reside near their delivery hospital.
