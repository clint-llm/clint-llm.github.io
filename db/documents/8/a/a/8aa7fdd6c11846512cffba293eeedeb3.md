Bumetanide is available in oral and injectable administrations (intravenous, intramuscular). Bumetanide is rapidly absorbed after oral and intravenous formulations. 95% of the drug extensively bounds to plasma proteins and is eliminated by the metabolism of the butyl side chain and partially removed through urine excretion. The apparent half-life is 1.0 to 1.5 hours, and the volume of distribution is about 25 liters. Plasma clearance is 225 to 228 ml/min.

Bumetanide has high bioavailability, is between 80% to 100%; this means that oral and IV bioavailability are roughly equivalent, constructed to furosemide where oral doses should be roughly double IV doses.

The different modes of administration of bumetanide with dosages are the following:

- Bumetanide oral tablet: 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg

- Bumetanide intramuscular/intravenous injection solution: 0.25 mg/1 mL

Dosing regimens based on the condition are as follows:

- Edema

- Oral route of administration:

- 0.5 to 10 mg per day orally divided once or twice daily. Initiate treatment 0.5 to 2.0 mg per day, repeating every 4 to 5 hours until obtaining the appropriate response. The maximum dosage is 10 mg per day.


- Intramuscular/intravenous route of administration:

- 0.5 to 10 mg per day IM/IV divided once or twice daily. Initiate treatment 0.5 to 1.0 mg per day over 1 to 2 minutes, repeating every 2 to 3 hours until obtaining the appropriate response. The maximum dosage is 10 mg per day.

- An alternate day schedule or schedule of three to four days on with a one to two-day rest period may increase tolerability and effectiveness in continued edema control. Intravenous administration should be reserved for patients unable to take oral medications.
- Bumetanide solution is not Y-site compatible with midazolam and is admixed incompatible with dobutamine and milrinone.

- Hypercalcemia (off-label):

- 1 to 4 mg IV every 1 to 4 hours; administer with saline to maintain the patient's urine output at 200 to 250 mL/hour.

- Hypertension (off label):

- 0.5 to 2.0 mg daily by mouth divided into one or two doses.

Renal dosing: in patients with anuria, bumetanide is contraindicated. In patients with hepatic failure, dosing should remain at a minimum level and, if necessary, should be increased very carefully.

Data is lacking for the use of bumetanide in pregnancy and breastfeeding. No teratogenicity is expected based on data from other loop diuretics, although there is a potential risk for decreased placental perfusion based on the drug's mechanism of action. Clinicians should consider alternative therapy in patients breastfeeding high-risk infants.
