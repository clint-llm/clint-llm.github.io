Cutaneous angiofibromas are managed by an interprofessional team. Current treatments for angiofibromas include shave excision, cryotherapy, electrodessication, radiofrequency ablation, dermabrasion, lasers such as ablative fractional laser resurfacing (AFR) and pulsed dye laser (PDL), and topical podophyllotoxin. Although these treatments have proven to be successful, they can result in scarring, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and pain. The recurrence rate can be up to 80%, necessitating follow-up treatments. Topical rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor, seems to be a safe and effective treatment for angiofibromas however long-term studies still need to be conducted.  Combination treatments, such as fractional laser resurfacing and PDL laser, can be employed with topical medications, such as timolol or rapamycin, to effectively treat these lesions. Because the lesions are benign, they should only be removed for cosmesis or compression on adjacent structures resulting in pain. (Level V)
