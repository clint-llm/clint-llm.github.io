Symptomatic thoracic discogenic pain syndrome (TDPS) is a rare phenomenon making it challenging to diagnose. The rarity of TDPS is attributed to the particular orientation, structure, and function of the thoracic spine in the vertebral column. The majority of thoracic disc herniations are asymptomatic, or the patient presents with nonspecific symptoms like chest wall pain, epigastric pain, upper extremity pain, and sometimes, a pain in the groin or the lower extremity causing the clinician to think of a more common problem than a thoracic disc herniation. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of thoracic discogenic syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of thoracic discogenic syndrome.
- Outline the assessment and examination process to evaluate a patient with potential thoracic discogenic syndrome.
- Review the treatment and management options for thoracic discogenic syndrome.
- Explain how the facilitation of interprofessional team education and discussion can optimize the effective detection and treatment of thoracic discogenic syndrome.
