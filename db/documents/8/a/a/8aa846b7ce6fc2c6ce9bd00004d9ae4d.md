Patient safety is the most important aspect of an MRI exam. For an MRI scan, a full patient consent form should be filled appropriately. After the form has been filled, the staffs are responsible for clarifying some of the misunderstandings by using direct communication before the exam. These are things to be done while the patient is in the waiting room.

- An explanation of the consent form to the patient and answering his/her questions, if any.

- Review the form with the patient and ask for additional questions about any stimulator's presence, e.g., aneurysmal clips, cardiac valves, pacemakers, or metallic clips.

- Pregnant or suspected pregnant patients should have a consultation with the radiologist before performing MRI.

- Scan the patient with a metal detector to ensure no loose metallic objects.

Other things to be done during the MRI exam:

- Lowering the table to allow the patient to lie down.

- Placing protective pads.

- Giving and instruct the patient how to use the earplugs.

- Ask the patient to close the eyes when the laser lights are turned on.

- Place the safety pads.

- Give the patient an alarm bell and explain how to use it.
