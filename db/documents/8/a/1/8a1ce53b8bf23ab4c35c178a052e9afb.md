The management of acute hepatitis depends on the specific etiological factor implicated in the acute injury to the hepatocytes. Hepatitis A and E are the most common infectious causes of acute hepatitis and usually have a self-limited clinical course, resolving in 2 to 4 weeks with supportive treatment that includes IV fluids, antiemetics, and symptomatic treatment. Patients should avoid the use of alcohol and other potentially hepatotoxic medications and over the counter supplements but otherwise. They should also receive education about reducing the risk of transmission of infection to others

Acute acetaminophen ingestion is a common noninfectious cause of acute hepatitis leading to acute liver failure and needs to be considered in all patients presenting with signs and symptoms of acute liver failure. Prompt treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be initiated as early as possible after obtaining an initial history and acetaminophen testing. N-acetylcysteine can be administered orally or IV based on the clinical scenario as mentioned below.

- **72-hour oral protocol
**-  N-acetylcysteine oral: 140 mg/kg orally as a loading dose, followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 hours for a total of 17 doses

- **20 hour IV protocol**- N-acetylcysteine IV: 150 mg/kg intravenously over 60 minutes as a loading dose, followed by 50 mg/kg over 4 hours (12.5 mg/k/ per hour for 4 hrs), then 100 mg/kg over 16 hours (6.25 mg/kg per hour for 16 hours)

Treatment with N-acetylcysteine is also recommended for all patients with acute liver failure except ischemic hepatitis, with or without evidence of acetaminophen overdose.
