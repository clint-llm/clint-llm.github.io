Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a systemic disorder that affects many organs, thus it is best managed by an interprofessional team. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency leads to COPD, liver disease, and panniculitis. Other studies have linked it to several other conditions such as glomerulonephritis and certain cancers. Other associations like celiac disease, fibromuscular dysplasia, and pancreatitis. There is also approximately 15% of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis who are found to have a ZZ genotype. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner should educate the patient on avoidance of triggers that stimulate the unopposed neutrophil elastase activity such as smoking and infections. Patients should be encouraged to get the yearly influenza vaccine, protein conjugate pneumococcal vaccine, and tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccine. Inhalers typically used for COPD should be prescribed and initially should include long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) and or anticholinergics (LAMA). Because of the increased risk of pneumonia inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) should be reserved for when patients develop frequent exacerbations despite the other two inhalers. Pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen, and in some circumstances, lung transplant, should be prescribed as indicated. Transplant is usually reserved for those that fall below an FEV-1 of 30% despite maximum therapy.
