The First Maneuver

The first maneuver also called the fundal grip, assesses the uterine fundus to determine its height and which fetal pole—that is, cephalic or podalic—occupies the fundus. The uterine contour is outlined by the examiner, placing both of his or her hands on each upper quadrant of the patient's abdomen facing the maternal xiphoid cartilage. The ulnar border of each hand is in contact with the abdominal wall, and the opposite fingers are touching each other. Using the fingertips, the fundus is gently palpated to identify which fetal part is present in the upper pole (fundus) of the uterus. The breach gives the sensation of a large, nodular mass, and its surface is uneven, non-ballotable, and not very mobile whereas the head feels hard and round with a smooth surface of uniform consistency, is very mobile and ballotable.

The first maneuver aims to determine the gestational age and the fetal lie.

Gestational age can be evaluated using fundal height or McDonald's rule.

- The public symphysis at the 12th week

- A point midway between the pubic symphysis and the transverse and the transverse umbilical plane at the 16th week

- The transverse umbilical plane at the 20th week

- Having crossed this line, it is assumed each transverse finger breath corresponds to two weeks

The Second Maneuver

The second maneuver, sometimes called the umbilical grip, involves palpation of the lateral uterine surfaces. Still facing the maternal xiphoid cartilage, both hands slide down from the uterine fundus towards the lateral uterine walls. The clinician's hands are placed flat and parallel to each other along the abdominal wall at the level of the umbilicus. It allows establishing if the fetus is in a longitudinal, transverse, or oblique situation, and to determine the position of the back and small parts.The operator places the two flat hands sideways to the uterus and tries to bring them closer to the midline. In the approach maneuvers, the operator's hands are one on the back of the fetus and one on the small parts, which give different tactile sensations.The approach is possible when the fetus is in a longitudinal position regardless of the type of presentation, while it is not possible when the situation is transverse or oblique. Furthermore, it is possible to understand from which side the fetal back is located.

If the identification of the fetal back proves to be difficult, the provider can perform the following maneuvers. A simple adjustment involves alternating two hand palpation of lateral uterine surfaces. By placing the right hand steady on one side of the abdomen while using the palm of the left hand, the right side of the gravid uterus is palpated gently. This is then repeated using the opposite side. Otherwise, the Budin maneuver, named after French obstetrician and gynecologist Pierre-Constant Budin 1846–1907, can be performed for the precise determination of the position of the fetal back.

The Third Maneuver

The third maneuver was modified by Karel Pawlík (1849–1914), a Czech gynecologist and obstetrician, and is referred to as the Pawlik grips. This maneuver aids in the confirmation of fetal presentation.

The first Pawlík grip, sometimes called the first pelvic grip, helps to define which presenting part of the fetus is situated in hypogastrium. Using the thumb and fingers of the right hand close above the pubic symphysis, the presenting part is grasped at the lower portion of the abdomen and draws the thumb and finger near to clasp the lower uterine segment including its contents.

In the second Pawlík grip, the clinician carries on by sliding the hand upward to determine the cervical groove: if the mass moves, the presenting part is not engaged. Then lateral movements and ballottement are performed. The differentiation between head and breech is made as in the first maneuver. This maneuver also allows for an assessment of the fetal weight and the volume of amniotic fluid.

The Fourth Maneuver

This fourth maneuver resembles the first maneuver; however, the examiner faces towards the maternal pelvis. This maneuver involves the examiner placing the palms of both hands on either side of the lower abdomen, with the tips of the fingers facing downward toward the pelvic inlet. The fingertips of each hand are used to apply deep pressure from the outside to the inside and in a craniocaudal direction along the lower contour of the uterus towards the birth canal. It is possible to identify the characteristics of the part presented and confirm the findings detected with the third Leopold maneuver. The fingers of both hands move gently along the sides of the uterus towards the pubis. The side where there is resistance to the descent of the fingers towards the pubis is larger is where the forehead is located. If the head of the fetus is well flexed, it should be on the opposite side from the back of the fetus. If the head of the fetus is extended, however, the occiput is perceived and is on the same side of the spine. It is possible to evaluate the degree of descent of the presented part and to realize if there are gross disproportions between this and the pelvic inlet.

This maneuver identifies which presenting part is in the lower uterine pole. To perceive how much of the cephalic extremity, which we recognized to be at the lower pole, descends into the birth canal: if it is entirely external, then it has not confronted itself, if it is confronting itself or if it has ultimately descended. The fingers travel the upper contour of the cephalic end, around the neck of the fetus.

Completing the fourth maneuver with the so-called "fifth maneuver" of Leopold, or maneuver of Zagenmeister, also can allow the approximate distance between the presenting part and the maternal pelvis. In the cephalic presentation, the hand is placed flat on the pubic symphysis, and the palpation could delineate the fetal head portion that can be reached above the pelvic inlet. Using the rule of fifths, the distance between the base and vertex of the fetal head is divided into five equal parts. Each fifth corresponding to 2 cm or approximately one transverse fingerbreadth. If the fetal head accommodates two fingerbreadths above the pelvic brim, it is said to be engaged.
