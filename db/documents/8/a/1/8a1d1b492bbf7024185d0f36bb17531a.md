Radiation esophagitis is an adverse effect for patients undergoing radiation cancer therapy, usually for lung, breast, and other thoracic cancers due to its proximity. Symptomatic radiation esophagitis, however, is a rare complication of radiation therapy affecting the minority of patients undergoing treatment. In addition, genetics have been thought to play an important role in a patient who develops radiation esophagitis, with some research correlating single-nucleotide polymorphisms of transforming growth factor b-1 with severe radiation esophagitis.

Certain risk factors may predispose patients to a high risk of developing radiation esophagitis. These include White race, age greater than 70, female sex, poor initial performance status, low body mass index, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and dysphagia.
