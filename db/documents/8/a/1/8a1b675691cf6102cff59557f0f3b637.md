Adamantinoma is a locally aggressive neoplasm with the potential to metastasize. After inadequate surgery, recurrence of the tumor is frequent.

The risk factors for recurrent or metastatic disease are:

- Symptoms of less than 5 years duration

- Male sex

- Young age less than 20 years

- Pain at presentation

- Initial treatment by curettage or resection

- Lack of squamous differentiation of the tumor

- An increase in the epithelium-to-stroma ratio

Adamantinoma metastasizes in about 15 to 30% of cases by a hematogenous or lymphatic route to other sites of the body, frequently to the lungs or lymph nodes, less frequently to the bones and abdominal viscera.
