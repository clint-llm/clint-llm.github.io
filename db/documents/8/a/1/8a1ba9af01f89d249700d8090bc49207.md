Refractory shock carries a poor prognosis with mortality of up to 60%. The strongest predictor of mortality in critically ill patients is theÂ vasopressor dose that is required to maintain the mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal. Decreased mortality has been reported with the use of vasopressin and angiotensin II in patients with less severe shock (with baseline norepinephrine requirements <15 mg/min).
