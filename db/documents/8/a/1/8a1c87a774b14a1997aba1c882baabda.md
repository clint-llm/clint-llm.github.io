**Drug/Substance****Abuse**

As with most behavioral and psychiatric disorders, the interplay between genetic risk, temperamental traits, and the environment may predispose to early use of substances of abuse. Once exposed to substances, brain reward systems reinforce substance use, resulting in repeated use and lower ability to control substance use.

**Alcohol Abuse**

The pathophysiology of alcohol use disorder is not known, but its development may result from a complex interplay of genetics, environmental factors, personality traits, and cognitive functioning.
