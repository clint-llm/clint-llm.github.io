The involvement of an interprofessional team including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists is needed to manage leukocytoclastic vasculitis.  Pharmacists can assist in identifying potential drug triggers and removing them.  The involvement of the nursing team is crucial in maintaining close follow-up and monitoring of the patient.  The involvement of specialists including rheumatologists may be needed in some cases especially when secondary etiologies are suspected.  Finally, patient education and reassurance about the benign course of the idiopathic cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis as in most cases can help prevent undue anxiety in the patients.  Close communication among the team members can significantly enhance patient-centered care.
