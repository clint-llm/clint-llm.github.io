The splenic artery is defined as aneurysmal when a focal dilation is observed in its diameter of greater than 50% compared to the normal vessel diameter. The normal diameter of the splenic artery varies and ranges from 0.43 cm to 0.49 cm. True splenic artery aneurysms (SAAs) involve all layers of the wall, each of which is intact and thinning. Pseudoaneurysms are the result of a tear in the vessel wall intima with subsequent blood dissection into a false lumen and periarterial hematoma formation. They develop secondary to trauma or inflammation of the splenic artery, such as in cases of pancreatitis. The SAA is the most common visceral artery aneurysm reported. SAA represents 60% to 70% of patients diagnosed with visceral artery aneurysms (VAAs). Hepatic artery aneurysms have been reported in 20%, while celiac or mesenteric artery aneurysms represent 10% of all reported cases of VAAs.
