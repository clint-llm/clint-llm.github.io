Every member of the healthcare team can play a part in decreasing the incidence of adverse events. Proper prevention, reporting, follow-up, and analysis can all contribute to better care and the lowered incidence of adverse events. Healthcare team outcomes can be improved through the analysis of adverse events and the development of safer or alternative treatments.

The list of reportable adverse events include:

- Surgical events - wrong patient, wrong site, wrong procedure, retained foreign body

- Product/device related - contaminated products, air embolism

- Patient protection events - patient elopement, suicide

- Care management issues - medication errors, mismatched blood transfusion

- Environmental factors - burn, electric shock, wrong gas

- Criminal events - sexual assault, impersonation, physical assault

There is a pivotal need for developing a 'safety first' culture to prioritize our accountability in safeguarding the health of our patients. The implementation of WHO's surgical safety checklist can be the yardstick in minimizing the occurrence of adverse events in surgical specialties.
