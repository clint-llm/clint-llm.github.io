Genetic counseling and predictive testing can be done for asymptomatic adults who are at risk of developing HD. This helpsÂ patients to make informed decisions with respect to the caregiver, finance, and reproduction. This also makes them eligible to participate in clinical trials. The optimal time to determine the genetic risk as well as discuss prenatal testing is before pregnancy. DNA banking, which is the storage of DNA, can also be done for possible future use.
