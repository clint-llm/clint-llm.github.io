SD is believed to be an autoimmune disorder typically occurring after a Group A B-Hemolytic streptococcal infection. The immune system is stimulated to produce antibodies against the streptococcal bacterial infection. These antibodies cross-react to cells of the basal ganglia, which have important roles in controlling motor movements. Death and damage to these cells are considered to be responsible for the manifestations of the disease.
