The evaluation of strabismus starts with good history taking, ocular/physical examination, and with appropriate investigations. The history-taking aspect is already dealt with above. The physical and ocular assessment are as follows:

Visual Acuity:

- Infants: ‘CSM’ method is a simple technique to observe fixation and the followability. With a simple torch, observe the corneal reflex while moving it side to side. Central corneal light reflex shows “central” fixation, and the followability of eye sidewards to the torch is termed as “steady,” and if both eyes are in alignment during the movement, then its termed as “maintained”.

- Preverbal children: Preferential looking tests e.g., Cardiff picture cards

- Uncooperative children: children might cry or object to occluding the eye with good vision.

- Children: Snellen charts, Illiterate E chart, Sheridan-Gardiner charts

Stereo acuity: Stereoacuity measures the visual sense of depth. It is the sense of fusion of two simultaneous, slightly dissimilar images with integration by the brain. Titmus stereo-fly test and Lang cards are commonly used. Worth 4 dot test and Bagolini striated glasses are used to assess the fusional reserve while both stereopsis and fusion can be assessed by synoptophore.

Compensator Head Posture (CHP): CHP is a motor adaptation to strabismus to attain binocular single vision (BSV). Loss of CHP in concomitant strabismus may indicate the loss of BSV and warrants surgical intervention. In acquired paretic strabismus, CHP eliminates diplopia and helps to centralize the binocular visual field. Head tilt, face turn and chin up/down are commonly seen as abnormal head postures. A head tilt to the left is seen in right superior oblique palsy. A face turn to the left is seen in the left lateral rectus palsy. Chin up or down is seen in “A” or “V” pattern strabismus.

AC/A ratio: The accommodative convergence/accommodation (AC/A) ratio is defined as the amount of convergence in prism diopters per diopter change in accommodation. Two methods are used to measure the AC/A ratio: the lens gradient method and the heterophoria method. The normative range lies between 3 and 5 to 1.

Measurement of Deviation

- Hirschberg test: The Hirshberg test gives a rough estimate of the angle of manifest strabismus by noting the position of the corneal light reflex produced by shining a torchlight over the cornea. Each millimeter of deviation is equal to 7 degrees of deviation or 14 PD, assuming pupil to be 4 mm in diameter. If the light reflex is at the temporal border of the pupil, then the angle of deviation of esotropia is about 15 degrees, and if it is at the limbus, the angle is about 45 degrees.

- Krimsky test: This test uses prisms placed in front of the fixating eye to measure the deviation. The modified Krimsky test is done by holding the prism in front of the deviating eye. This test is essentially used to measure tropias and not for phorias.

- Cover test: The cover test is done to detect heterotropia. The fixating eye is covered, and movement of the uncovered eye is noted both for distance and near.

- Uncover test: Uncover test detects heterophoria. After covering an eye for 2 to 3 seconds, the same eye movement is observed on uncovering. This test is done for both distance and near. Most examiners do the cover test and uncover test sequentially; hence it is called the “cover-uncover” test.

- Alternate cover test: This is a dissociation test that reveals the total deviation when fusion is interrupted and should be performed only after the cover-uncover test. Patients with poor fusional control may decompensate to a manifest deviation when this test is done. The speed and smoothness of recovery are noted following a fast cover-uncover test done alternatively to both eyes.

- Prism cover test: This test combines the alternative cover test with prism for both near and distant fixation.

- Maddox wing: This test dissociates the eyes for near fixation (33cm) and measures heterophoria. When seeing through this instrument, the right eye sees only the arrows (white vertical and red horizontal), while the left eye sees only rows of numbers (horizontal and vertical). The white arrow position denotes horizontal deviation, and a red arrow denotes the vertical deviation. By aligning the red arrow parallel to the horizontal row of a number, cyclophoria can be measured.

- Maddox rod: Maddox rod converts a white light spot into a perpendicular red streak by a series of fused cylindrical red glass rods. The amount of dissociation is calculated by the superimposition of the two images using the prisms.

Ocular Motility: Extraocular movements involves the assessment of smooth pursuit movements followed by saccades.

- Versions: All nine diagnostic positions of gaze binocularly are assessed with a torch or a pen, and the cover-uncover test is done in each cardinal position to assess tropia/phoria.

- Ductions: Ductions are monocular eye movements elicited in all six cardinal positions by occluding the other eye. Ductions are assessed if either or both eyes ocular motility limitations are noticed. Underaction is graded from -1 to -4 with increasing degrees of underaction, and 0 indicates full movement.

- Vergence: convergence and divergence movements

- Near point of Convergence: Near point of convergence (NPC) is the nearest point at which the patient reports diplopia when tested with an RAF rule. It should be nearer than 10 cm.

- Near point of accommodation: Near point of accommodation (NPA) is the nearest point at which the eyes can maintain clear focus when tested with RAF rule. At 20 years of age, it is 8 cm and recedes to 46 cm by 50 years.

- Fusional amplitudes: Fusional amplitudes measure the efficacy of vergence movements and are tested with prism bars or synoptophore.

- Postoperative diplopia test: This test is mandatory for all patients above seven years of age before strabismus surgery. Prisms larger than the planned correction for the deviation is placed in front of the deviating eye. If suppression is seen, then the risk of diplopia following surgery is less. Intermittent or constant diplopia is an indication to do diagnostic botulinum toxin tests before the surgery.

Field of BSV: Field of binocular single vision is that area where bifoveal fusion of the object of regard occurs. The field of BSV is assessed by Hess chart to diagnose and monitor patients with incomitant strabismus caused by either extraocular muscle palsy (third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerve palsies) or restriction (thyroid ophthalmopathy, blow-out fracture or myasthenia gravis). Hess chart uses either Hess screen or Lees screen to chart the field by dissociating the ocular movements. Hess screen uses a tangent screen with a red-green goggle, and Lees screen uses two glass screens at right angles to each other.

The following is the interpretation of the Hess chart appearance:

- Smaller chart: indicates the eye with the paretic muscle, and the greatest restriction is in the direction of the paretic muscle.

- Larger chart: indicates the eye with an overacting muscle, and the greatest expansion is in the main direction of action of the yoke muscle.

The following sequelae are seen in the muscles in a paretic squint:

- Overaction of the ipsilateral antagonist (contracture)

- Secondary inhibition palsy of the antagonist of yoke muscle

Refraction: Assessing the correct refractive error and power is crucial in the management of strabismus. Most commonly, hypermetropia is seen in strabismus patients. Refraction should be done under both non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic conditions. Instilling one drop of 1% cyclopentolate hydrochloride twice at 5-minute intervals followed by retinoscopy thirty minutes later is the standard practice.

Forced duction test (FDT): This test is done to assess if the limitation of movement is due to the mechanical restriction of the muscle (fibrosis/tethering). The anesthetized conjunctiva of the eyeball is held with forceps and moved first in the direction of the muscle action and later in all directions to see if there is a restriction of the movement of the eyeball. This test should be mandatorily performed before any strabismus surgery.

Parks-Bielschowsky 3-step test: This test is done in acquired vertical diplopia to isolate the paretic muscle. Step1: Which eye is hypertropic in the primary gaze? Step 2: Is the hypertropia worsening of right or a left gaze? Step 3: Is the hypertropia worsening with the right head tilt or left head tilt? This test helps in diagnosing superior oblique palsy.

Fundoscopy: Dilated fundus examination is mandatory to rule out intraocular pathologies like optic disc hypoplasia, macular scarring, or retinoblastoma, which might cause squint.

Investigations for strabismus: Neuroimaging is essential, especially in sudden onset adult-onset strabismus to rule out stroke, diabetic mononeuritis, myasthenia gravis, thyroid eye disease, etc. Rarely a primary neurological disorder such as hydrocephalus, optic nerve glioma, medulloblastoma, or craniopharyngioma might cause childhood strabismus and need neuroimaging.
