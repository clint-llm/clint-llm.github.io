The overall incidence of infertility accounts for nearly 15% of all couples. Male azoospermia affects nearly 1% of the male population and about 10 to 15% of all infertile men.

Azoospermic men are also at increased risk of developing cancer compared to the general population. For example, between 5% and 8% of men with testicular cancer will be azoospermic.
