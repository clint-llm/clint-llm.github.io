Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis in women, with an annual incidence of approximately 1 in 10 women.

In general, the ideal NAC reconstruction recreates both the nipple and areola and achieves symmetry in position, size, shape, texture, pigmentation, and projection to the contralateral NAC.

For the purpose ofÂ this topic, only NAC reconstruction following breast cancer surgery will be discussed, not purely cosmetic NAC surgery. Similar techniques may be utilized in the treatment of congenital NAC abnormalities (athelia) and burn deformities.
