The literature evaluating the overall survival and prognosis of HHT is limited but may have a shorter expected lifespan. A retrospective study demonstrated lower median age of death in HHT versus non-HHT patients (63.2 vs. 70.0 years).

A more recent prospective study (n=675) found HHT patients to have poorer survival when compared to matched controls with a median age of death at 77 years versus 80 years.
