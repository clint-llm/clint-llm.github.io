The patient selection process involves evaluating patients' diagnosis and disease severity based on pulmonary function tests. Initial assessment of every patient includes- Borg scale of perceived exertion during supervised baseline incremental exercise test, dyspnea scores during initial maximal exercise capacity, a baseline 6-minute walk test, and Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) to estimate the quality of life.

An individualized exercise program is developed based on the assessments mentioned above. Additionally, it is necessary to evaluate the need for supplemental oxygen, rule out cardiovascular limitations, and also assess the safety of exercise interventions. Although a formal cardiopulmonary exercise testing is not necessary for all patients, it helps assess factors contributing to exercise limitations, the safety of exercise, and also prescribing appropriate exercise plan.
