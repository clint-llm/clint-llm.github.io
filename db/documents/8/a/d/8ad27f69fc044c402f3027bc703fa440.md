Symptoms vary depending upon the size of the pleural effusion. Patients can be asymptomatic with small effusions and are noticed incidentally on imaging studies like a chest x-ray and CT chest or abdomen. Clinical exam shows ipsilateral: decreased breath sounds, stony dull percussion, and decreased fremitus. When the effusion is significant enough, it can cause respiratory distress and warrant immediate relief through thoracentesis or even a surgical approach.

Patients experience discomfort during the thoracentesis owing to further reductions in intrathoracic pressure. Lung entrapment, on the other hand, is an active inflammatory process presenting as chest pain and severe dyspnea. Trapped lung poses a significant risk for inadvertent multiple diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures attempted for chronic stable pleural effusion, leading to further complications. Hence, trapped lung should be considered early in the differential diagnosis of any case of chronic stable pleural effusion when no clinically apparent active disease is found.
