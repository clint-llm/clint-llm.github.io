Infants with congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) present with a history of chronic or intermittent tearing and debris on the eyelashes. Conjunctival erythema is not characteristic although irritation from overflow tearing and chronic rubbing of the eyes may cause mild redness of the lower and upper eyelid. On physical examination, there is usually an increase in the size of the tear meniscus. Palpation of the lacrimal sac may cause reflux of tears and/or mucoid discharge onto the eye through the puncta.

Congenital nasolacrimal anomalies, particularly obstruction, can lead to various clinical manifestations including infection due to stasis of fluid within the lacrimal system. Obstruction can partially allow the duct to drain the tears produced, except in situations where increased tear production is present (wind, cold weather) and tear overflow results. The normal flora bacteria usually present within the tears do not cause problems because they are flushed readily into the nares. In NLDO, the stasis of fluid within the lacrimal sac creates a moist, warm environment favorable to bacterial growth.

A few infants with NLDO present within the first few weeks of life with a more severe infection: acute dacryocystitis. Clinical findings include edema and erythema with distension of the lacrimal sac below the medial canthal tendon, and patients may have systemic signs of infection such as fever and irritability. This is a rare complication of isolated congenital NLDO. Acute dacryocystitis can be complicated by preseptal or orbital cellulitis, sepsis, or meningitis and should be treated promptly with systemic antibiotics. Although antibiotic therapy is frequently prescribed for dacryocystitis, the definitive treatment of dacryocystitis is usually surgical.
