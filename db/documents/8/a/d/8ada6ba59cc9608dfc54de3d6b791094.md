Due to the lack of specific clinical signs and symptoms, the diagnosis of HEV infection is difficult. One complication is the lack of standardized testing. High clinical suspicion is, therefore, required for timely diagnosis. Fortunately for most immunocompetent patients, the infection is self-limited and only requires supportive care. Special attention, however, is needed for certain high-risk patient groups such as patients who are pregnant, immunocompromised, and those with an underlying liver disease. HEV infection should be considered in these patients if they have acute hepatitis and workup for other causes is unrevealing especially if they have a history of travel to an endemic area.

Immunocompromised patients with acute or chronic HEV infection should be managed by an interprofessional team including consultation from infectious diseases, hepatology, and oncology.

The most important measure to prevent HEV infection is protecting water supplies from contamination with human feces. Travelers to endemic regions must take precautions against the consumption of contaminated water, ice, and food. Women should try to avoid unnecessary travel to endemic areas during pregnancy. Vaccines against hepatitis E virus (HEV239) are available in China but are not FDA-approved.
