The effect of either type of laser trabeculoplasty decreases gradually over time. A prospective study that randomized patients to 180° of SLT versus ALT, did not find any statistically significant difference in IOP lowering between the two types of laser trabeculoplasty. The effect of trabeculoplasty on the diurnal curve shows that both ALT and SLT decrease diurnal IOP fluctuation. In different subgroups of patients of POAG, both ALT and SLT have been found efficacious compared to medical treatment. In pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, SLT is equally efficacious in pseudophakic eyes compared to phakic ones, whereas ALT is generally performed in phakic eyes.

Laser trabeculoplasty is a cost-effective procedure that can be performed as an adjunct to medical therapy or to control IOP when the surgical treatment is delayed. It is gaining popularity as a primary mode of treatment in several open-angle glaucoma patients.
