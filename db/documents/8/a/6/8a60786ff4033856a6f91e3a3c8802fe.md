RPF = Clearance of para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) = [U][V] / [P]

[U] is the urine concentration of PAH in mg/mL

[V] is the urine flow rate in mL per minute

[P] is the plasma concentration of PAH in mg/mL

RBF = RPF / (1 - Hematocrit)

In this equation, the denominator denotes the amount of blood volume occupied by plasma.
