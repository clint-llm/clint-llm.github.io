There are few contraindications to delivery. If the mother's labor is progressing to the point that she is about to deliver, there is little the prehospital provider can do to prevent it. If the EMS provider is close to the hospital and wishes to delay delivery until arrival, discouraging the woman from pushing may delay theÂ delivery for a short while.

One important relative contraindication to labor that EMS providers should be aware of is umbilical cord prolapse. Umbilical cord prolapse can lead to complications such as hypoxic brain injury and cerebral palsy. If possible, these patients need a Cesarean section and care not available in the prehospital setting.
