The diagnosis of thalamic pain syndrome, and more broadly, central post-stroke pain has its basis on history and physical examination. The history of the pain should include its onset, description, location, radiation, quality, and severity. Following a thalamic stroke, the patient may begin to experience numbness or tingling on the contralateral side of their injury. The pain is typically the entire contralateral half of the patient's body.

Pain may be poorly localized and may change over time.

A full neurological exam is necessary and a part of the initial evaluation of a patient following up after a CVA. The findings on gross sensory examination are often normal in an isolated thalamic stroke. However, difficulty in interpreting temperature for patients to interpret does occur in the thalamic pain syndrome. Spinothalamic tract dysfunction is a requirement for the development of central neuropathic pain. A full assessment of all post-stroke sequelae is needed. A thalamic stroke can be focal, but it also can be a part of a much larger CVA. Thus muscle strength sensation, cranial nerves, balance, and speech should be assessed, at a minimum. Depending on the extent of the stroke, a full musculoskeletal exam may be necessary.

On exam, the area of reported pain is colder than an unaffected area. The patient's pinprick and temperature sensation are impaired, while their proprioception and vibration sensation is intact.
