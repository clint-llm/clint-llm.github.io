Adverse reactions after glycopyrrolate administration may include anticholinergic symptoms such as mydriasis, hyperthermia, tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmia. They may also include blurred vision, constipation, cycloplegia, dry mouth, dry skin, flushing, photophobia, urinary retention, and xerophthalmia.

Glycopyrrolate may affect the patient's ability to perform tasks requiring mental alertness. In addition, the medication may induce drowsiness or blurred vision, which is exacerbated by the consumption of alcohol. Usage also requires close monitoring in patients with hepatic impairment. For example, patients may not be able to operate heavy machinery safely.

Use with discretion in patients with autonomic neuropathy or hyperthyroidism. Heat prostration can occur in the presence of fever, high ambient temperature, or physical exercise. Take caution to avoid this effect by limiting or discontinuing usage with exercise or in situations with elevated ambient temperatures.

Patients under the age of 12 with pediatric spastic paralysis are more likely to exhibit an increased anticholinergic response, which elevates the risk for unwanted effects.
