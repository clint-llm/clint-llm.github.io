Relaxation techniques are therapeutic exercises designed to assist individuals by decreasing tension and anxiety. Relaxation therapy has been a part of psychotherapy for ages; however, these techniques can be expanded to include diverse environments as complementary therapies to treat stress, anxiety, depression, and pain. In addition to its psychological impact, stress can cause physiological responses such as increased heart rate, palpitations, diaphoresis, shortness of breath, and muscle tension. Relaxation techniques can aid in the reduction of these unpleasant responses. Many variations of relaxation strategies exist and can be facilitated by a variety of health professionals or learned via self-help modalities. This activity describes the benefits of relaxation techniques in individuals undergoing stress and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in encouraging these practices to improve the lives of their patients.
