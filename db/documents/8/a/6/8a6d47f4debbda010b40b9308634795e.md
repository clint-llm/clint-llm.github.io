**Tips for Fluoroscopy Suite Staff**

Fluoroscopy suite staff members are exposed to higher doses of radiation as compared to nuclear medicine staff. In addition to the general recommendations mentioned above, the following precautions can further reduce radiation exposure to the lab staff.

- Every staff member must avoid direct exposure to the primary beam as much as possible.

- Wearing an appropriate lead apron and thyroid shield eye protective glasses during procedures and using a personal dosimeter should be made compulsory.

- The lab management staff should periodically calibrate and inspect the fluoroscopy lab to ensure there are enough protective devices, lead aprons, and thyroid collars.

- Radiation physicists should be involved during initial setup, periodic quality control, and lab staffâ€™s education. Radiation physicist opinion should be sought to monitor radiation exposure and to evaluate the root cause of excessive radiation exposure.

**Tips for Nuclear Medicine Staff**

In nuclear medicine studies, radiations are detected from radioisotopes injected inside the body compared to radiologic studies in which radiations emit from external sources. Considering this fact makes it easier to understand that health care workers are at low risk of radiation exposure in nuclear medicine as compared to interventional lab staff, and that is the reason that their effective dose is highly unlikely to exceed occupational dose limits. The highest radiation exposure in nuclear medicine is associated with exposure to positron emission tomography (PET) pharmaceuticals. Out of all PET pharmaceuticals, Technetium 99m carries the highest risk of radiation exposure.
