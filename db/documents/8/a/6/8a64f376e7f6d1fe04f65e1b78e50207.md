Prognosis is based on numerous factors including age of diagnosis, PRETEXT group, metastases, alfa fetal protein (AFP) levels, histologic subtype, completeness of resection, and clinical stage of the disease.Â  With certainty, the well-differentiated fetal subtype is associated with a better prognosis compared with small cell undifferentiated and macrotrabecular, which are linked to unfavorable prognosis.
