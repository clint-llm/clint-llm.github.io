Primary pulmonary hypoplasia is extremely rare but is lethal in most cases. Most of the cases are secondary, with significant morbidity in survivors. Perinatal mortality is as high as 70% (55-100%) in most cases.

Patients with unilateral pulmonary hypoplasia can typically experience healthy growth, development, and survivability in the absence of associated lesions. Patients with secondary hypoplasia demonstrate a wide variety of phenotypes secondary to the underlying cause. Of cases with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, mortality is up to 50% in the perinatal period. The significant deterrents for survival in CDH include pulmonary hypoplasia and severe pulmonary hypertension, with the outcome being more grave in the right-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Other indices for prognosis include associated neurological, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and nutritional comorbidities. Infants who survive often experience chronic lung conditions like low exercise capacity and heightened susceptibility to infection.
