Neuroacanthocytosis syndromes are caused by a variety of genetic mutations that are inherited in several different patterns, with the most common being autosomal recessive (see Tables 1 & 2). Other syndromes such as McLeod syndrome are inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, whereas Huntington like-disease 2 and hereditary hypobetalipoproteinemia are inherited in autosomal dominant and codominant patterns, respectively. HDL2 directly results from trinucleotide expansions of JPH3 very similarly to Huntington disease with patients experiencing intergenerational disease anticipation based on the extent of genetic expansion. Many of these diseases vary in genetic penetrance and phenotypic manifestations.
