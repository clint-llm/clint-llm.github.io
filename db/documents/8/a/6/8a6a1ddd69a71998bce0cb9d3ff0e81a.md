Abdominal abscesses contain cellular debris, enzymes, and liquid from an infectious or non-infectious source. They are a common and serious condition and can develop almost anywhere in the abdomen. However, most are confined to some part of the peritoneal cavity. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of abdominal abscesses and the importance of the interprofessional team in recognizing and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the clues for an abdominal abscess.
- Review the most definitive imaging test for an abdominal abscess and describe what this imaging might show in a patient with an abdominal abscess.
- Describe the treatment strategy for an abdominal abscess.
- Explain how careful patient monitoring and strong communication amongst the interprofessional team will improve patient outcomes in those with abdominal abscesses.
