NF-1 is an autosomal dominant disorder. The gene for NF-1 is located on chromosome 17 and encodes a gene product called neurofibromin.

The mutation or deletion of this NF-1 gene results in the phenotypic and genotypic manifestations of the disorder. Penetrance is complete, as it is an autosomal dominant disorder. All generations are involved with no skipping. Expression of the disease differs from one affected family to another and between individuals of the same family.
