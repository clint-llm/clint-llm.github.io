Lung development in-utero occurs in five main stages. The first stage begins with the development of the lung bud from the respiratory diverticulum during week 4 of embryogenesis. The stages are as follows

- Embryonic: begins from weeks 4 to 7; this is when the formation of the major airways and pleura occur.

- Psuedoglandular: occurs during weeks 5 to 17; this is when the bronchial tree and respiratory parenchyma form.

- Canalicular: occurs during weeks 16 to 26; the distal airway, blood-air barrier, surfactant, and acini form.

- Saccular: occurs during weeks 24 to 38 weeks; the airspaces (alveoli) continue to expand.

- Alveolar: occurs from week 36 of gestation and throughout childhood. The alveoli become septated and more mature - improving airspace and capillary networks.
