- Spontaneous closure of early post-traumatic CSF leak is seen in 60 to 70% of patients.

- The commonest site of CSF rhinorrhea is the junction of the cribriform plate and ethmoid bone.

- The presence of large dural defects, bony spicules, comorbidities, extremes of age reduces the chances of spontaneous healing of CSF leaks.

- The most sensitive and specific investigation to detect CSF leaks is the beta-2 transferrin assay.

- In case of a dubious leak or suspected multiple defects, MR cisternography should be combined with a high-resolution CT scan to increase the accuracy of detection of the leak site.

- Surgical management of cranial CSF leaks includes overlay or underlay techniques performed transcranially or endoscopically.

- The use of prophylactic antibiotics has not been proven to prevent meningitis in CSF leaks.
