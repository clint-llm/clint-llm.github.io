Before recommending hyperbaric oxygen therapy for a wound, the patient must have undergone at least thirty days of failed standard therapy consisting of mechanical and chemical debridements, application of acceptable wound products such as alginates and collagens, and treating underlying issues such as infection, malnutrition, and pressure relief. Patients then must have insurance approval for reimbursement. They then undergo orientation and a detailed history and physical exam to rule out any existing contraindications. They must demonstrate the ability to clear their ears by Valsalva and show no signs of claustrophobia for the monoplace chambers. They are also carefully instructed on what is allowed and prohibited in the chambers, as well as all possible risks of diving. Wound patients usually require transcutaneous oximetry (TCOM) testing to confirm that they will probably respond to hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Blood glucose and pressure are checked before each dive, as these numbers will change during an actual dive. Eardrums and breath sounds are also checked pre-dive and post-dive to rule out barotrauma.
