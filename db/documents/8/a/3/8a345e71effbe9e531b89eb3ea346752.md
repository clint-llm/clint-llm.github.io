Diagnosis of CMTC is clinical; with diagnostic criteria proposed by Kienast and Hoeger, that includes the presence of three major criteria: (1) Congenital reticular erythema, (2) absence of venectasia, and (3) Unresponsiveness to local warming; and the presence of two or more minor criteria: (1) fading of erythema within two years, (2) Telangiectasia within the affected area, (3) Port-wine stain, (4) Ulceration withing affected area, (5) Atrophy within affected area. These criteria, however, have not been validated.

Imaging studies are indicated when an associated congenital anomaly is suspected. Consider evaluation by ophthalmology, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, and/or vascular cosmetic surgery depending on the presenting associated abnormality. Limb girth and length measurements should be monitored on follow up.
