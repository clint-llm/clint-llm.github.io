Although more than 90 percent of identified thyroid nodules are clinically insignificant benign lesions, in 4 to 6.5 percent of cases, these nodules are due to thyroid cancer. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of thyroid nodules and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of benign and malignant thyroid nodules. 
- Describe the evaluation of thyroid nodules. 
- Outline the management strategies for different types of thyroid nodules. 
- Review the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of thyroid nodules.
