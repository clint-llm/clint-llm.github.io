**Causes**

- **Sinonasal infection**: The most common cause of this rare complication of acute or chronic frontal or ethmoid sinusitis. Sinusitis occurs in 1 out of every 8 people in the United States and most of the time, resolves uneventfully. Only 0.5% to 2% of patients develop bacterial sinusitis and of these, 80% resolve without antibiotics. In rare instances untreated bacterial sinusitis can lead to serious complications, such as PPT.

- **Trauma**: Head trauma, especially to the frontal area, is the second most common cause. PPT occurs by direct extension of wound infection or contamination, and not through secondary septic thrombophlebitis.

**Less Common Causes**

- Cranial/frontal surgery

- Dental infection

- Cocaine abuse

- Wrestling injuries

- Insect bites

Risk factors that affect the normal immune response and can influence the development of PPT include diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and aplastic anemia, as well as other causes of immunosuppression.

In most instances this is polymicrobial infection.staphylococci (22%).Fusobacterium, H. Influenza, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Escherechia Coli, Pasteurella multocida, Proteus, and Bacteroides.
