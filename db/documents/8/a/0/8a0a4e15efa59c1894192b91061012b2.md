The interprofessional healthcare team, e.g., physicians, nurses, pharmacists, etc., needs to work together to ensure the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy. Importantly, the healthcare team needs to monitor for signs of adverse drug reactions. The pharmacist should verify the dosing and perform a drug interaction check. Nurses can monitor adverse events and make preliminary assessments of treatment effectiveness on subsequent visits. The application of basic pharmacokinetic concepts, e.g., the first pass effect, can ensure the appropriate drug route of administration and dosing of the patient.

Both nurses and pharmacists need to have an open communication line with the prescribing physician so they can report or discuss any concerns regarding pharmacotherapy. This type of interprofessional healthcare team communication is necessary to optimize patient outcomes with minimal adverse events. [Level 5]
