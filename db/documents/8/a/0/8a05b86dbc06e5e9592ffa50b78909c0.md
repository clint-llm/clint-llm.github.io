Any disruption in the continuity of a vessel wall will generate a series of cascades to form a hemostatic plug. Any injury to the vessel will induce vasoconstriction by the release of endothelin and neural stimulation reflex. Exposed collagen will interact with vWF (Von Willbrand factor) released from nearby endothelial cells and the platelets. Platelets will bind to vWF through the GpIb receptors. Fibrinogen attaches the platelets to each other through GpIIb/IIIa receptors, forming an unstable plug eventually.

The formationÂ of fibrin mesh to stabilize the platelet plug will require the activation of two pathways. An intrinsic pathway, which is activated by collagen, basement membrane, activated platelets, and high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), which includes factor XII, XI, IX, and VIII and an extrinsic pathway which is activated by tissue factor (TF) which includes factor VII. Both will lead to activating the combined pathway, which consists of factor X, V, II, and I, which eventually will lead to a stable fibrin mesh formation.

Factor IX is synthesized by the hepatocytes and considered to be part of the intrinsic pathway, and its deficiency will result in the defective coagulation cascade and insufficient fibrin mesh formation.
