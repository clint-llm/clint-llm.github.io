A thorough history and physical exam are mandatory for any patient presenting with a mass suspicious for malignancy. History of receiving RT to a body part, especially if it was received a decade ago, should raise the suspicion for STS, including AS. Family history of AS is extremely rare, but must be covered in each patient. A history of exposure to chemicals (listed above) must be obtained. A history of surgical removal of lymph nodes, chronic lymphedema, and parasitic infections can provide a clue towards diagnosis.

Physical exam should evaluate for lymphedema, nail changes, or hair changes (a sign of exposure to harmful chemicals), radiation burns, previous scars from surgery and RT. Cutaneous AS can resemble a bruise or a raised purple-red papule. As the tumor size increases, it becomes ulcerated, fungating, bleeds easily, and is associated with tissue infiltration. Typically it is a multifocal disease.
