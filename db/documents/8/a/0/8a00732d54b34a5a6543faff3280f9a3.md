After initial stabilization and neurology evaluation, many consultations are not required in the acute phase setting. Physical therapy (PT), speech therapy (ST), occupational therapy (OT), and rehabilitation services led by a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM and R) physician must be made immediately. Lacunar syndrome patients must be initially evaluated in the hospital as well as followed closely in the outpatient setting to ensure that the patient recovers as quickly as possible.

Furthermore, close contact between the patient’s neurologist, primary care physician, physical medicine and rehabilitation physician, and PT/ST/OT providers after hospital discharge further aids in the prevention of recurrent lacunar/ischemic strokes.
