The adverse effects of TTF are limited to mild to moderate dermatological complications like dermatitis in the region of the application of transducer arrays. The longest follow-up data is available for patients withÂ glioblastoma treated with TTF, and the rate of dermatitis ranges from 16 to 43%. This complication has been seen around 2 to 6 weeks after the initiation of treatment in patients with glioblastoma. Dermatitis is usually easily controlled with topical steroids and antibiotics, oral antibiotics, and local skin protection.

However, compliance with the therapy is generally found to be high. It attests to the safety of this treatment modality, at least for the limited duration of follow-up available. The long-term effects and complications of TTF will be known as more literature is available in the future.
