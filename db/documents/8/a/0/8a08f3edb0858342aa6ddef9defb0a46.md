Venous oximetry is the key that provides invaluable insight into the adequacy of the cardiopulmonary system. It yields an estimation of the oxygen supply-demand ratio in the human body during critical illnesses. It assists in the early recognition and management of tissue hypoxia. Venous oxygen saturation levels should be used in conjunction with other vitals hemodynamic parameters (cardiac output, heart rate, blood pressure), serum lactate levels, and urine output to guide the patient's treatment plans. However, much remains to be understood about translating the information provided by it into therapeutic protocols for beneficial outcomes.
