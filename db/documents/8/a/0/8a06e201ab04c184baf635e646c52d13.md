Testicular seminomas are cancers that can usually be managed with surgical resection, although radiation is added for advanced-stage disease. Stage 1 disease may be offered single therapy with carboplatin, and for more advanced disease, bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin, or etoposide and cisplatin may be used. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of testicular seminomas and highlights the interprofessional team's role in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the etiology of testicular seminomas. 
- Describe how to identify testicular seminomas early in their disease process.
- Summarize the management of progressive testicular seminomas.
- Review some interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and treatment of testicular seminomas in order to improve clinical outcomes.
