Testicular non-seminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) is curable cancer. It can be managed ideally if the medical health providers know the knowledge of its pathophysiology and route of spread. It is a malignant but curable tumor if diagnosed and managed properly. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing testicular NSGCT.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the route of spread of testicular non-seminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT).
- Describe the pathophysiology of testicular non-seminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT).
- Review the management of testicular non-seminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT), including the roles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional collaboration and communication to achieve improved outcomes in testicular non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT).
