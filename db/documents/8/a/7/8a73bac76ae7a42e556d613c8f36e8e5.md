All patients with folate deficiency should be offered supplemental folic acid for the correction of the deficiency. Typically, oral folic acid (1 to 5 mg daily) suffices to treat folate deficiency

In patients who have a concomitant vitamin B12 deficiency, it is imperative to replete vitamin B12Â as well. Folate treatment alone does not improve neurological symptoms and signs due to B12 deficiency, which, if untreated, may likely progress and cause permanent neurological damage [5].

All patients should be encouraged to a diet rich in fruits and vegetables.
