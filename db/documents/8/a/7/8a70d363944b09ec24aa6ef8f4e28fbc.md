Pulmonary aspiration and a resulting aspiration pneumonitis are the most concerning risks of administration of activated charcoal. Aspiration from emesis and misplaced nasogastric tubes for activated charcoal administration can lead to severe respiratory compromise and even death. Therefore, an adequate airway assessment must occur before activated charcoal administration. In patients with a depressed level of consciousness, providers must considerÂ the risk-to-benefit ratio of intubation for airway protection and the therapeutic benefits of activated charcoal. Emesis occurs more often with rapid administration of activated charcoal, and the risk of emesis increases when the activated charcoal has sorbitol added. Patients should be monitored for mental status changes and continued airway protection if emesis occurs.

While emesis is a common adverse effect, more significant gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstructions have been reported after the administration of activated charcoal. Patients with pre-existing motility disorders, those receiving opioids or antimuscarinic drugs, and those treated with MDAC might be at greater risk. However, the likelihood of a more significant gastrointestinal complication following SDAC therapy is low.
