Predictive medicine is a relatively new subspecialty in healthcare, yet the concept itself is not novel. In the most basic terms, predictive medicine utilizes specific laboratory and genetic tests to determine an individual's probability of developing disease. The use of biomarkers has been common in the field of oncology, but now the aim is to increase the use of similar biomarkers to predict the more common clinical disorders seen in everyday life.

**Predictive Medicine**

Ideally, we would calculate a person’s individual risk for breast cancer or any other disease and intervene appropriately. This is the goal of predictive medicine, the practice of obtaining and cataloging characteristics about individual patients, analyzing that data to predict the patient’s individual risk for an outcome of interest, predicting which treatment in which individual will be most effective, and then intervening before the outcome occurs.Traditionally, predictive medicine was exclusively confined to the realm of genetics. It was once thought that genetics would revolutionize medicine and, in fact, genetics and genomics have improved our ability to predict individual risk for some diseases (e.g., the BRCA gene and breast cancer) and predict which treatment will be more effective in a given individual (e.g., therapy directed at a molecular target in cancer). However, genetics-based risk prediction has proven of limited benefit for reasons including (1) whole-genome sequencing is still relatively expensive and not currently covered by insurance, and (2) the majority of diseases afflicting the population today is multifactorial. For example, heart disease is influenced not only by genetics but also by age, diet, exercise, and stress levels. Collecting and organizing this data for analysis is invaluable.

**The Big Data Revolution**

Though never formally quantified, healthcare data has already been collected on a titanic scale; every vital sign, medical chart, and radiology image from every clinic, pharmacy, and hospital collectively represent only a tiny fraction of data points available for analysis. Social media data, billing data, census data, and more also include information that contributes to healthcare outcomes. The amount of data increases exponentially as the price of data collection, storage, and processing decrease. All this data, coupled with newer computer-based analytic techniques, such as machine-learning, make up the so-called "Big Data Revolution." With big data, predictive medicine may soon be able to quantify individual risk for a variety of healthcare outcomes and determine optimal, personalized treatment options. Other industries already have taken advantage of this revolution and are continuing to refine their predictive applications: banks can predict a customer’s individual risk for defaulting on a loan, social media websites predict the type of advertisement to which a user is most likely to respond, and insurance companies predict how likely an individual is to file a claim. Most importantly, these industries have developed the software and workflow infrastructure needed to deploy these analyses in real-time on the front lines of their operations.
