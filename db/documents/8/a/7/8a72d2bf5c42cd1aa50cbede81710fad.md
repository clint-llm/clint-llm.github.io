Knowledge of the crucial and protective functions of the spleen show the importance of recognizing functional asplenism, a condition most commonly seen in patients with autoimmune diseases and a variety of hematological disorders. OPSI, as well as thrombotic events, are serious medical emergencies that require prompt intervention. OPSI morbidity may be limited with prompt recognition of the high-risk nature of illness in asplenic patients. The simple interventions of immunizations and prophylactic antibiotics are expected to reduce the frequency of OPSI and decrease its mortality despite the controversy over antibiotic use in asplenic patients.
