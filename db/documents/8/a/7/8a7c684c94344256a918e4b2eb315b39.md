Around 6,000 years ago, laboratory medicine began with the analysis of human urine as uroscopy, which later became termed urinalysis. The word "uroscopy" derives from two Greek words: "ouron," which means urine and "skopeoa," which means to 'behold, contemplate, examine, inspect'. Ancient physicians spoke of urine as a window to the body's inner workings and reflected different diseases. For instance, Hindu civilizations recognized a "sweetness" in certain people's urine, which attracted black ants.diarrhea of the urine" to describe excessive urination.De Urinis", determined heating urine would precipitate proteins, documenting proteinuria as a disease state.

By the late 12th-century, a French scholar named Gilles de Corbeil taught and classified 20 different types of urine, recording differences in urine sediment and color. De Corbeil also introduced the "matula," a glass vessel in which a physician could assess color, consistency, and clarity.
