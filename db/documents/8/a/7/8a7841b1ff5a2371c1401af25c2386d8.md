Tooth polishing is an oral prophylactic procedure that involves the smoothening of the tooth surface, making it glossy and lustrous, reducing plaque deposition, therefore maintaining periodontal health. The term tooth polishing is typically used by professionals to refer to a dual procedure of cleaning and polishing, even though the American Dental Hygienists Association clearly distinguishes between these two terms. Cleaning is described as the ability to remove debris and extraneous matter from the teeth, and polishing is the implementation of making the tooth surface smooth and lustrous.

According to the American Academy of Periodontology, tooth polishing eliminates plaque, calculus, and stains from exposed and unexposed tooth surfaces through scaling and polishing as a preventive measure to control local irritation.

Since excessive polishing may cause wear of the tooth surface, dental professionals nowadays prefer to polish the teeth depending on the patients’ needs and not as a routine procedure.

The term selective polishing then emerges. This procedure is not performed on stain-free surfaces and is only provided when there are visible extrinsic stains after scaling and oral debridement is complete.
