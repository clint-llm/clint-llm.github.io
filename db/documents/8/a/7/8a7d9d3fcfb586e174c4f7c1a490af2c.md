Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is delivered in a hyperbaric (pressure) chamber with the patient breathing 100% oxygen at a pressure greater than 1.0 atmosphere absolute (ATA). Typically 2-3 ATA is used. Beyond 3 ATA, there are issues with oxygen toxicity.

The amount of oxygen delivered to the body (DO2) is dependent on the arterial oxygen content (CaO2) and cardiac index (CI). The equation representing this is as follows:

- DO2 = CaO2 x CI

The arterial oxygen content primarily depends on hemoglobin concentration; each hemoglobin molecule can carry up to 1.38 ml of oxygen per gram of hemoglobin.

- CaO2= (Hemoglobin [g/dL] x 1.38 ml O2 x %oxygen saturation) + (0.003 x PaO2)

The oxygen delivered to tissues is then extracted and used by the tissues. On average, the human body extracts 5% to 6% volume of oxygen from the blood.

In 1959, the Dutch surgeon Boerema published “Life Without Blood,” a manuscript detailing the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) for treating anemia.
