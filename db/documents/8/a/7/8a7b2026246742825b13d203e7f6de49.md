Given the advent of various injectable fillers along with their reported safety and efficacy, nonsurgical rhinoplasty has recently gained popularity for patients looking to alter the shape and/or appearance of the nose without incurring the risk, cost, and downtime typically associated with surgical rhinoplasty.

Despite these potential advantages, nonsurgical rhinoplasty remains a technically challenging procedure with significant associated risks (e.g., vascular occlusion). It thus should only be performed by those clinicians who possess a sound understanding of the relevant anatomy and safe injection techniques.

Herein, we outline the principles of a successful non-surgical rhinoplasty using injectable fillers with an emphasis on properly evaluating patients and executing a thorough, anatomic-based procedural plan.
