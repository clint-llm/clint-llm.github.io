Tethered cord syndrome (TCS) is a stretch-induced clinical constellation arising from tension on the spinal cord due to anchoring to inelastic structures. Tethered cord syndrome may present with neurologic, urologic, musculoskeletal, dermatologic, or gastrointestinal abnormalities and may be congenital or acquired in etiology. Long-term outcomes are favorable with appropriate diagnosis and treatment. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, and treatment of tethered cord syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pathophysiology of tethered cord syndrome.
- Describe the clinical presentation of tethered cord syndrome.
- Identify the radiographic appearance of tethered cord syndrome.
- Outline the evaluation and treatment/management of tethered cord syndrome.
