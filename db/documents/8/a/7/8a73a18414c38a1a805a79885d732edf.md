Researchers and healthcare professionals do not know a lot about the molecular mechanisms that lead to NBS. All the existing theories propose that there is activation of the central pain pathways, but how and why this happens is not well understood.

All the previous theories suggest that there is hyperalgesia. Either there is excess stimulation of the peripheral pain nerves, or there is an enhanced response by the central nervous system (CNS) to the pain stimuli. The latest theory suggests that perhaps opioid-induced hyperalgesia may have a neural-immune component. It is believed that there is activation of the immune cells, astrocytes, and microglia in the CNS, which then results in modulation of pain through the release of various proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines. The cascade of events that follow leads to a circular pattern of neuronal excitability that eventually is associated with an enhanced perception of pain.

The activation of the glial cells is believed to occur in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and these cells most likely mediate the hyperalgesia of NBS via several mechanisms. Firstly, these activated glial cells could be releasing central excitatory neurotransmitters like prostaglandins, nitric oxide, growth factors and excitatory amino acids. Secondly, the glia may also be releasing mediators that enhance the release of pain neurotransmitters from sensory nerves. Thirdly the glia may be activated by the pain neurotransmitters like substance P, glutamate or ATP, which in turn reinforce their nociceptive responses, thus creating a positive feedback loop. Fourthly, glial cells are activated by fractalkine (CX3CL1), a microglial agent which may further enhance the pain sensation.

Other theories suggest that the nerve cells in the gastrointestinal tract develop opioid tolerance. No one theory can completely explain all the feature of NBS, but experts on pain believe that the pathophysiological is probably more complex and involve many more pathways.

The recent discovery of excitatory and inhibitory G-coupled opioid receptors may shed more light on the molecular mechanisms of NBS. It is established that the inhibitor G-coupled receptors are known to produce analgesia, and the excitatory G-coupled receptors produce anti-analgesia. Since many people develop tolerance to opioid analgesia with time, the anti-analgesic effects of these excitatory receptors may be responsible for causing hyperalgesia.

Another theory for NBS suggests that the development of hyperalgesia may be associated with the activity of cholecystokinin (CCK) and/or dynorphin in the rostral ventromedial medulla. The CCK is said to trigger a sequence of biochemical events that lead to neuroplastic changes in the spinal cord and CNS; this plasticity facilitates the increased release of excitatory pain neurotransmitters, resulting in hyperalgesia.

All the present theories only partially explain the association between use of opioids and hyperalgesia, but why some people do not develop NBS is not well understood.
