Causes of secretory diarrhea in adults of the developed countries include laxative abuse, carcinoid syndrome, microscopic colitis, and bile salt malabsorption due to ileal resection. Though more common in developing countries, diarrhea due to infection from Vibrio cholera, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli may also need to be ruled out after careful assessment of the history. Secretory diarrhea may occasionally occur in association with gastrointestinal disorders like Crohn disease and short bowel syndrome. In rare cases, Munchausen syndrome by proxy may also need to be ruled out.

In children, rarely inherited electrolyte transport defects, like congenital chloride diarrhea and congenital sodium diarrhea may cause secretory diarrhea. These present in early infancy.
