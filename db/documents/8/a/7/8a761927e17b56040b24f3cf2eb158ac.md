The most important risk to staff is exposure to UVB. Staff who conduct dosimetry should wear goggles, face shields, appropriate clothing, and sunscreen (SPF>30) if they have to enter the cabinet with the lamps on. A formal physiotherapist or nurse is undertaken before the start of phototherapy. It must be recorded and includes cumulative doses of phototherapy. There is also a need to do blood tests in a few cases, allergies testing and also keep a record of current medication and special needs assessment.

In cabinets that have combined UVB and UVA lamps, it is essential that the correct tubes are selected for treatment. Male patients should wear appropriate clothing to protect the genitalia. The face (if not involved by the dermatosis being treated) should be shielded with a visor to avoid unnecessary UV exposure. For some indications, whole-body treatment may not be required (e.g., for polymorphic light eruption desensitization, treatment limited to the photo exposed skin may be sufficient.
