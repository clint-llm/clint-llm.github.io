To treat nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, doxylamine is often co-administered with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) as an extended-release oral tablet (doxylamine succinate 10 mg/ pyridoxine-HCl 10 mg). The tablets should not be crushed, chewed, or split to maintain the extended-release effects.

Patients should not take doxylamine/pyridoxine as needed while treating NVP. The need for continued therapy requires reassessment throughout the pregnancy.

Doxylamine as a standalone medication is also available as doxylamine succinate 25 mg oral tablets under both brand and generic forms. Adult dosing for doxylamine is as follows:

- For insomnia (adults and children 12 and older): 25 to 50 mg orally at bedtime as needed, dosed 30 minutes before sleep.

- For allergy symptoms (adults and children 12 and older): 12.5 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours as needed, with a maximum dosage of 75 mg daily.

Hepatic and renal dosing adjustments are not defined.
