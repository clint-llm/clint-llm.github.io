OTC deficiency is not part of routine neonatal screening or testing. Since it is genetic, it is useful to ask about family medical history.Â Signs of OTCD in neonates include tachypnea, vomiting, and lethargy within the first day of life.

In the late-onset form of OTCD, symptoms are vague and variable at first. These symptoms include lethargy, loss of appetite, early morning headaches, and confusion.
