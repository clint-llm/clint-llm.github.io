In the infective form, sporocysts, when ingested by the intermediate host (cattle and pigs), rupture to release sporozoites. The sporozoites enter the endothelium of blood vessels to undergo schizogony and form first-generation schizonts. These further develop into merozoites and invade small capillaries and blood vessels to become second-generation schizonts. These merozoites invade the muscle cells to form sarcocysts made up of bradyzoites. Upon consumption of undercooked meat containing these sarcocysts, bradyzoites are released in the small intestine of humans, invading the intestinal epithelium, where they differentiate into macro- and microgametocytes. The fusion of these gametes results in oocyst formation, which is shed in the feces. Â Humans may also become dead-end or accidental hosts for many non-human Sarcocystis spp. after the accidental ingestion of oocysts. The sporozoites ex-cyst and schizonts develop in the vascular endothelium of blood vessels, following which merozoites invade the muscle tissue causing muscular sarcocystosis.
