There are five muscles of the thoracic wall.

Superficial muscles to the thoracic wall function in the movement of the shoulder girdle, thoracic wall, and spine.

The diaphragm is an important muscle for respiratory function. It forms the inferior border of the thoracic cavity separating the abdomen from the thorax. As it contracts, it increases the volume of the thoracic cavity resulting in inspiration.

Other muscles that have attachments to the thoracic wall but act predominantly as extensions to the thorax include the scalene, sternocleidomastoid, and subclavius muscles superiorly. Muscles extending inferiorly include quadratus lumburum, psoas major/minor, external oblique, internal oblique, transversus abdominis, and rectus abdominis muscles.
