Ectopic thyroid tissue can be found anywhere along the migratory pathway and has been documented in locations ranging from the tongue to the diaphragm. The prevalence of an ectopic thyroid gland is between 1 per 100,000 and 1 per 300,000. The most common site for ectopic thyroid tissue is the ectopic lingual thyroid at the base of the tongue.

The thyroid gland may have a pyramidal lobe that extends superiorly from the isthmus. The pyramidal lobe is a normal vestigial remnant of the thyroglossal duct. This has been documented to occur in 28% to 55% of individuals. Most commonly, the pyramidal lobe will originate on the left side of the thyroid. The pyramidal lobe can be separated entirely from the main thyroid gland and has also been documented to occur bilaterally.

In addition to a pyramidal lobe, a wide variety of morphologic variations exist. The isthmus may be large, narrowed, or entirely absent. The lateral lobes may vary in size and symmetry when comparing right to left.
