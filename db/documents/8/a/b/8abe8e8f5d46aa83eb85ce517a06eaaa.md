Spinal cord injury patients represent a group with non-relaxing anal sphincters but from an anatomically defined etiology. These patients accomplish acceptable bowel control with training- use the Gastrocolic Reflex with increased bowel motility shortly after a meal along with rectal stimulation with either a suppository or enema for reflexive sphincter relaxation to facilitate evacuation.
