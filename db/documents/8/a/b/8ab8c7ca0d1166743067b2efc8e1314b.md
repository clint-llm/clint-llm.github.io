The globus pallidus, being a part of the basal ganglia, plays an additional role in higher cognitive functions such as reinforcement and memory building. The nuclei (including GP) and cortical areas interconnect via independent parallel loop circuits. The association and limbic cortices project to specific striatal domains, which, in turn, project back to the corresponding cortical areas via the globus pallidus and the thalamus. There have also been suggestions that the location of both the GP and substantia nigra helps transmit information from the limbic to the associative system.
