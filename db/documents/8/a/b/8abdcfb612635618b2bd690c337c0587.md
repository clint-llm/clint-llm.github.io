CST can be misleading in some cases and warrant careful interpretation. Unless results are straightforward, evaluation should be done by an Endocrinologist or provider with expertise in adrenal function.

CST may be falsely negative or normal in mild disease or disease of recent onset.  In mild disease, there may be sufficient adrenal functional cortex to maintain adrenal reserve, which can respond adequately to the external supraphysiologic dose of cosyntropin. Similarly, in the disease of recent onset, there may not be enough time for adrenals to lose complete function and they will respond to the supraphysiological exogenous stimulus of cosyntropin.

One of the most common causes of a false-positive test, especially in a hospital setting, is the recent use of corticosteroids. Steroids, in any form, IV, IM, intrathecal, oral, or inhalational, can suppress the HPA axis and decrease intrinsic cortisol production. Exogenous steroids decrease both baselines as well as adrenal responsiveness to cosyntropin and can cause false-positive results. A detailed history and review of the chart are key in the evaluation of AI and helps in the interpretation of CST. History should include prior glucocorticoid use and use of other drugs that can suppress the HPA axis. It should also include factors affecting cortisol binding, the onset of symptoms, and associated features for reasons noted below.

CST relies on measuring total serum cortisol levels. As with several other hormones, serum cortisol can be found as bound and free. 90% of circulating cortisol is bound to protein. Approximately 70% of it is tightly bound to cortisol binding globulin (CBG), and 10% to 20% is bound loosely to albumin. 10% of cortisol circulates as free and is biologically active. Disorders that reduce (inflammation, rare genetic disorders, Nephrotic syndrome, liver disease, immediate postoperative period, patients requiring intensive care) or increase CBG levels (estrogen, pregnancy, mitotane) need to be considered during interpretation of plasma cortisol. Abnormal levels of CBG and albumin can significantly affect the interpretation of CST and should be taken into account. Unfortunately, no formula or calculation can correct for abnormal CBG or albumin levels, and interpretation relies on clinical judgment.

Free cortisol levels are helpful in patients with abnormal binding globulin. Free cortisol can be measured directly or indirectly in saliva or serum. In critically sick patients, a random free serum cortisol level of more than 1.8 mcg/dL is desired. A stimulated free level of greater than 3.1 mcg/dL is generally accepted during CST.

There are several limitations of low-dose CST. Most studies have utilized high-dose CST and low-dose CST is not validated, especially in critically ill patients. Therefore 1 mcg CST should not be used in the evaluation of AI in critically ill patients.
