The entire interprofessional healthcare team, including the patient and family, should be part of the discharge planning with the goal of reducing the need for readmission and helping the person achieve the highest level of functioning possible. Hospitals utilize toolkits, such as the Re-Engineered Discharge (RED) toolkit to assist with discharge goals and their implementation. (reference) Nurses are an important part of the discharge team as the process progresses and review the plan again with the patient at the time of discharge. The nurse must insure that the patient has resources available prior to discharge. The nurse should complete medication reconciliation throughout this process. Important information that the patient with depression should have in writing at the time of discharge include:

Information about the hospitalization: length of stay, the reason for admission

Medications at time of discharge: name of each medication (generic and brand), amount, how much and how often to take, why the medication is taken, how it is taken

Appointments: Dates, times, and what the appointment is for. The patient should have appointments with a psychiatric prescriber and a therapist

Numbers to call if symptoms worsen before appointments as well as a crisis number, such as a suicide hotline

A place for the patient to write notes about questions to ask during the next appointment (about symptoms, medications, side effects, treatment options)
