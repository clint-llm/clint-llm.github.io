For neurapraxic injuries, conservative treatment is recommended. This includes orthotic measures with splints and limb supports, physical rehabilitation, avoidance of the aggravating activity, and neuropathic pain medications (analgesics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, anesthetics). Serial examinations and electrodiagnostic studies are performed to assess for evidence of improvement.

If there is compression by a hematoma, urgent surgical decompression is performed. If it is due to a fracture, surgical decompression may be required. In compartment syndrome, fasciotomy is needed.

If there is no clinical and electrophysiological recovery after 3â€“6 months, surgical intervention can be required as scar tissue may be preventing improvement. The nerve can have a simple decompression or a decompression with transposition.

Rehabilitation should include psychological support and pain control.

Prevention should be emphasized, especially for iatrogenic damage.
