The radial nerve is a peripheral nerve that arises from the bilaterally paired neural crest, which are strips of cells arising from the ectoderm at the margins of the neural tube during embryonic development. The migration of the neural crest cells eventually forms what becomes the radial nerve in a fully developed body.
