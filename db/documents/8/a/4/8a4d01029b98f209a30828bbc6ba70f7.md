Regardless of the specific prescribing patterns of different provider types, all providers must focus on patient-centered care. The growing PA and NP professions are essential to alleviate the burden of a physician shortage, especially in primary care settings.

The state-by-state legislation on advanced practice provider prescriptive authority is continuously changing and expanding. Given the current trends, it is likely that advanced practice providers will continue to have increasing prescriptive authority over time. Therefore, creating a dialogue between physician groups and advanced practice provider organizations can improve understanding of the attitudes towards increasing autonomy. Such discussions have shown that both physicians and NPs have similar beliefs surrounding increasing prescriptive authority.
