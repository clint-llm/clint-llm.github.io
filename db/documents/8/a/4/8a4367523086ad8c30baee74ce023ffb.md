Over-the-counter pain medications are generally sufficient to help with post-procedural facial discomfort. To minimize erythema and dryness, the patient should employ 0.25% acetic acid soaks as detailed above, and apply petroleum jelly several times a day until the treated area has finished peeling (5-10 days). Intense erythema appears immediately after skin desquamation, though gradually subsides over several days. Patients are strongly encouraged to avoid direct sun exposure for the first several days after the procedure. Protective measures should be exercised for the next several weeks to months, including wearing sunscreen and wide-brimmed hats when outdoors. Makeup may be worn again after about 1-2 weeks once re-epithelialization is completed and skin is in a good state.
