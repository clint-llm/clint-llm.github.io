Lamotrigine is an anti-seizure/anti-epilepsy drug first approved for use in the USA in 1994. It is considered a first-line treatment for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (including simple and complex partial seizures and focal-onset tonic-clonic seizures) and Lennox-Gestault syndrome.

Off-label uses include treatment of rapid-cycling bipolar depression, bipolar disorder type I maintenance, prophylaxis for basilar migraine with aura, panic disorder, and binge eating disorder.
