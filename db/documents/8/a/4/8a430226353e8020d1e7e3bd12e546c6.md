Similar to insulin, glucagon secretion is tightly regulated depending on blood glucose levels. In the pancreas, the prohormone proprotein convertase 2 processes proglucagon (160 amino acids (aa)) to the glicentin-related pancreatic polypeptide (GRPP, 1–30 aa), glucagon (33–61 aa), intervening peptide-1 (IP-1), and major proglucagon fragment (72–158 aa). In the intestine, proglucagon is processed by PC1/3 activity to glicentin (1–69 aa), GLP-1 (78–107 aa), IP-2, and GLP-2 (152–158 aa). Glicentin is further cleaved into GRPP (1–30 aa) and oxyntomodulin (33–69 aa). In the intestine, glucagon with N-terminally elongated form (1–61 aa) also forms. Hence, the entire amino acid sequence of proglucagon is also present in oxyntomodulin and glicentin, which the intestinal L-cells secrete in response to food intake. Reports exist of extra-pancreatic glucagon secretion after pancreatectomy in humans and dogs.
