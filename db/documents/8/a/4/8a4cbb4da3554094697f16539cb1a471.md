The most common reason to perform a thymectomy is to access the heart in a neonate to correct congenital heart defects.

The main indication for thymectomy in adults is for the removal of a thymoma, which may arise, among other reasons, as a complication of myasthenia gravis. A biopsy of the thymus is sometimes indicated in the diagnosis of primary thymic lymphoma, although it is usually unnecessary to follow up with a thymectomy.
