Livedoid vasculopathy is a challenging diagnosis. Surprisingly the epidemiological data shows that there is a 5-year delay with adequate diagnosis and management of this condition. Therefore, an interprofessional team that includes nurses, primary clinicians, pharmacists, and dermatologists should be educated about identifying this condition. Many of the patients can be misdiagnosed. Hence, educating health care workers about identifying and performing routine workup before referring to the dermatologist is an important part of enhancing health care. Finally, the dermatologist should also know the importance of getting a skin biopsy of appropriate depth and dimensions to avoid missing the diagnosis.
