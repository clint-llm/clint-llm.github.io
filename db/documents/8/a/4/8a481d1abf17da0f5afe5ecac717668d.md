Treatment-resistant schizophrenia is when the condition fails to respond to at least two antipsychotic medications for at least six weeks; up to 30% of patients with schizophrenia respond poorly to antipsychotics, and around 7% show no response. Clozapine is the therapeutic option in such instances.
