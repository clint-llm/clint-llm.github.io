The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. It measures approximately 7 cm to 10 cm in length and 4 cm in width. Even though the organ is small, it is a common cause of abdominal pain due to gallstones, which often require surgical removal of the organ. Anatomically, the gallbladder is located anteriorly on the undersurface of liver segments IV and V. There are many variants of the anatomy of the biliary system making exact knowledge of these anatomic possibilities crucial when performing gallbladder and biliary surgery. The gallbladder has an inferior peritoneal surface and a superior liver surface. It has no capsule however some authors describe an extension of the liver capsule (Glisson's capsule) covering the exposed surface of the body of the gallbladder. The gallbladder fundus is wide, and as it continues into the main body, it narrows in diameter. The gallbladder body tapers into the infundibulum, which then connects to the neck and cystic duct.  At the distal portion of the gallbladder and into the cystic duct are spiral valves of Heister. These valves may be responsible to aide gallbladder emptying with neural and hormonal stimulation. In most people, there is an inferior outpouching of the gallbladder infundibulum or neck called Hartmann's Pouch. Occasionally there is a paucity located at the top of the gallbladder fundus. This is called a Phrygian cap and has no pathologic or surgical significance.
