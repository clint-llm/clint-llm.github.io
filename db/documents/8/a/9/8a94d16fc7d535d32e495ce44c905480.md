Hypothalamic hamartomas are unique in their presentation with gelastic seizures. Other tumors arising from the ventral hypothalamus such as craniopharyngiomas, astrocytomas, optic nerve gliomas do not usually present with gelastic seizures. However, these tumors can be associated with endocrine dysfunction and very rarely associated with central precocious puberty. The differential diagnosis for incessant laughter is broad; however, a thorough history and physical exam along with neuroimaging, video EEG, and psychiatric screening can aid in the diagnosis of gelastic seizures with hypothalamic hamartomas.
