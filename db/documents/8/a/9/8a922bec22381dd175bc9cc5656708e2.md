If patients require a tracheostomy with either otolaryngology, oral maxillofacial surgery, or general surgery teams, they need to be seen and managed by respiratory therapy, speech therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy teams. The surgical teams should be rounding on their tracheostomy patients daily, provide some local wound and tracheostomy care, and monitor for status changes and complications. They will also be able to provide capping trials and plan time for decannulation once the infection has improved and the patientâ€™s airway stabilizes.

As mentioned below, the respiratory therapy and nursing teams will be crucial to provide daily maintenance to the tracheostomy, whereas speech-language pathology will help the patient to improve their swallowing technique as well as trialing a Passy Muir speaking valve (PMV) for speech. Case management and social work teams are vital for ordering and delivering tracheostomy supplies and evaluating discharge location, whether home versus a rehabilitation facility. These teams are essential in determining discharge status and identifying any safety concerns that the patient or the family may have.
