The hallux varus deformity if often asymptomatic. Some patients complain of deformity and have difficulty in wearing shoes, instability, decreased range of movement, and weakness with push-off. Pain indicates an underlying arthritic process. Patients may present with chronic pain, difficulty walking and standing for long, foot weakness, ingrowing toenails, limited MTP joint range of motion, swelling of the foot, and occasionally redness/ulceration of the big toe. The symptoms become worse when the patients wear closed-toe shoes that crowd the toes. The most common cause of pain in hallux varus is irritation of the deformed toe due to a poorly fitting shoe

A thorough assessment focusing on bone and joint deformity, joint flexibility and integrity, and soft-tissue balance. The following may be noted on physical examination:

- **Bone deformity:**Varus orientation of the great toe. Medial displacement of the medial sesamoid.

- **Joint flexibility and Integrity:**Dorsal contracture of the MTP joint with or without IP joint contracture. The degree of extension of the first MTP joint should be analyzed taking into consideration whether weight-bearing and the dynamics of ambulation increase the deformity or not.

- **Soft tissue balance:**Medial displacement of the extensor hallucis longus with a bowstring deformity.  The plantar surface should be examined for any callosities.
