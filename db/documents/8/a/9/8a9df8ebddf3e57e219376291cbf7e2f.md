Different radiology diagnostic modalities such as barium swallow, computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and esophagogastroduodenoscopy, can be used to diagnose liposarcoma. Although none of these techniques is specific, CT scan and MRI can help narrow down the differential diagnosis as both modalities can detect the percentage of a lipomatous component of the tumor. Higher fat content is associated with benign lipoma, while less fat is consistent with atypical lipoma or sarcoma. A definitive diagnosis can only be achieved by tissue examination. In the majority of the cases, complete resection of the tumor is needed for a correct diagnosis.

Most liposarcomas have well-defined and often lobulated margins. Well-differentiated liposarcomas are hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with minimal enhancement using intravenous contrast. Myxoid liposarcomas are homogeneous, which may have a pseudo-capsule on imaging. Pleomorphic liposarcomas have heterogeneous internal structures. Myxoid and pleomorphic tumors show significant enhancement with intravenous contrast on radiologic imaging.

Pre-operative open biopsy with a subsequent histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation of the specimen is crucial for treatment planning. Specialized stains are used to differentiate liposarcomas from leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, etc.
