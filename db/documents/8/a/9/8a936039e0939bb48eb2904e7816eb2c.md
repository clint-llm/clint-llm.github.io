Pregnancy is usually followed by an interprofessional team that includes the obstetric nurse. These professionals need to ensure that pregnant women do not develop erythroblastosis fetalis because it is preventable. Throughout pregnancy, the antibody titer is followed approximately every 4 weeks. As long as it remains less than 1:16, the pregnancy can be managed expectantly. However, if it exceeds 1:16, serial amniocentesis should be started as early as 16 to 20 weeks. At the first amniocentesis, fetal cells can be collected and analyzed for the Rh antigen to determine fetal Rh status. If negative, the pregnancy can be followed expectantly. However, if the fetus is Rh-positive, fetal anemia is screened for, using fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA) Doppler measurements.
