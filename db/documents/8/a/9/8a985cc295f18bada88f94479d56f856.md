**Diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction**

Prior to the introduction of cardiac troponins, the biochemical marker of choice for the diagnosis of acute MI was the CK-MB isoenzyme.

**Non-acute MI Causes of CK-MB Elevation**

As discussed above, the skeletal muscle and myocardial cell death of any etiology will cause an elevation of CK-MB. Listed below are multiple other causes of CK-MB elevation in plasma.

False elevations in CK-MB occur in the presence of atypical CK isoforms, macrokinases, and adenylate kinase; however, these false elevations can be eliminated by adding reagents to testing kits.

Cardiac etiology - myocarditis, cardiac surgery can damage heart muscle resulting in elevation of CK-MB.

Peripheral sources - rhabdomyolysis, myositis, inflammatory myopathies, trauma, medications (daptomycin, statins, antiretrovirals)

To differentiate the elevation of CK-MB for cardiac etiology versus skeletal muscle source, we can calculate the CK-MB relative index (CK-MB RI) by using the below formula.

- CK-MB RI = CK-MB (ng/mL) x 100/CK (IU/L)

A CK-MB relative index < 3% is consistent with the skeletal muscle source, whereas a relative index > 5% is consistent with the cardiac source of CK-MB.

Hence in patients with clear evidence of lack of trauma, chronic skeletal muscle abnormalities, and a high index of suspicion for AMI, the use of CK-MB RI can increase the specificity of CK-MB testing. Miscellaneous causes include hypothyroidism, renal failure, alcohol intoxication, pregnancy, and certain types of malignancies.

**Current Biomarker Use**

As explained earlier, following the WHO criteria for diagnosis of AMI, multiple cardiac biomarkers were being used to diagnose acute myocardial infarction; among them, CK-MB was being used as the most sensitive and specific marker for diagnosis of AMI, detection of reperfusion, and estimating the size of myocardial infarction in the 1990s. During this time, troponin was evaluated as potentially a more specific biomarker for myocardial infarction when compared to CK-MB.

Troponin is a protein complex of 3 units, troponin T, troponin I, and troponin C, present in the actin filament of the skeletal and myocardial muscle cells. There are multiple isoforms of troponin T and troponin I, one of which is specific to cardiac muscle, and it is not expressed in adult skeletal muscle allowing the development of assays to measure its level in plasma.

Troponin is present in the myocardium as a 3 units complex in the contractile apparatus attached to the actin filament of the tropomyosin complex, however similar to CK-MB, there is unbound/free troponin in the cytosol of myocardial cells, which is known as the cytosolic pool. In the event of myocardial damage, unbound troponin is first released.

Troponin is more specific to the cardiac muscle when compared to CKMB, and current assays for troponin are more sensitive and specific than the assays for CK-MB measurement.

**Use of CK-MB despite Troponin being the Biomarker of Choice**

Troponin remains in circulation for a longer duration when compared to CK-MB. In conditions where reinfarction is suspected, CK-MB may be useful to classify a new event due to its shorter duration of elevation at detectable levels in plasma.

**CK-MB Isoforms**

The CK-MB isoenzyme exists as 2 isoforms: CK-MB1 and CK-MB2. Laboratory determination of CK-MB actually represents the simple sum of the isoforms CK-MB1 and CK-MB2.

CK-MB2 can be detected in serum within 2-4 hours after onset and peaks at 6-9 hours, making it an early marker for acute MI. Two large studies evaluating its use revealed a sensitivity of 92% at 6 hours after symptom onset, compared with 66% for CK-MB and 79% for myoglobin.
