Etiologies for tethered cord syndrome can be divided into congenital and acquired groups. Myelomeningocele is the most common congenital etiology for tethered cord syndrome.Â TCS can also develop from other congenital etiologies, including dermal sinus tract, lipo-myelomeningocele, fibrous or fibro-adipose filum terminale, and diastematomyelia.

Acquired etiologies for tethered cord syndrome include spinal cord tumors and scar formation.
