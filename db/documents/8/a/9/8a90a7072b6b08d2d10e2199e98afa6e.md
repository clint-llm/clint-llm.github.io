Uninterrupted by intervention, the natural history of endometrial carcinomas begin as preinvasive intraepithelial lesions, which progress to full-blown invasive cancers (see above: Etiology and Epidemiology) involving endometrial stroma, then penetrating ever more deeply into the myometrium to engage lymphatic capillaries that carry the malignancy to regional lymph nodes, whence metastases may occur through vascular channels. Tumorous involvement of the uterine cervix and stroma probably is mostly through lymphatic channels, particularly by dedifferentiated carcinomas; although surface spread can occur from endometrial cancers in the lower uterine segment (LUS). Lymphatic capillaries also may carry endometrial carcinoma cells to the adnexa, in other words, fallopian tubes and ovaries. Anatomically, lymphatic channels usually follow the corresponding veins; thus a regional extension of cancers confined to the uterine corpus or extended only to adnexal organs is considered to be the para-aorta and para-cava nodes; whereas, a regional extension of invasive endometrial cancers involving the uterine cervix and LUS is to para-ureteral and pelvic lymph nodes. Locally advancing endometrial cancers may penetrate fully through the myometrium and uterine serosa to involve surrounding peritoneum, supporting tissues and other pelvic organs. Low-grade, type 1 endometrioid carcinomas tend to remain confined to the uterus and are characterized by rather a favorable prognosis; whereas, high-grade, type 2 endometrioid and non-endometrioid carcinomas with TP53 mutations often metastasize via the lymphatic system or transit through the fallopian lumens to disseminate throughout the pelvis and abdomen, manifesting at advanced stage and portending grave prognoses.
