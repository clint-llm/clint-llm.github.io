According to a UN report from 2021, 9.8% of the world's population suffers from hunger, while the rest of the world experiences food-related diseases like obesity, hypertension, and other conditions. It is undoubtedly a blessing to have easier access to a wider variety of foods; however, it has become an issue for our health conditions as often there is not much emphasis on healthy diets. Most people are unable to change their eating habits because they fail to acknowledge that there is a problem with diet or fully appreciate its impact on health.
