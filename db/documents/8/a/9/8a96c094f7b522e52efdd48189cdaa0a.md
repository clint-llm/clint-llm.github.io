Some authors reported that en-bloc removal of encapsulated myxopapillary ependymomas of the filum terminale showed a lower proportion of dissemination (10%) than myxopapillary ependymomas removed piecemeal (19%).

The factors that increase the risk of recurrence and metastases are the extension of myxopapillary ependymoma into the substance of the spinal cord, a clinical history of less than one year, the extent of resection, and atypical histology of the tumor.
