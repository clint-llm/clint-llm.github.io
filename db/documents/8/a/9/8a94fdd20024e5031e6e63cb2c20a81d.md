The diagnosis of HD is based on a combination of clinical features, radiological findings, and histopathological evaluation of the biopsied sample. Indeed, the histopathologic examination of the rectal biopsy confirms the diagnosis of the disease by highlighting the association of the absence of GC in the submucosal and myenteric plexus with hypertrophy of nerve fibers in the aganglionic segment. GC are polygonal cells with abundant fibrillar eosinophilic cytoplasm, eccentric nucleus, and a large nucleolus.

At least two biopsies should be required, with a minimum diameter of 3mm. The biopsy should have as much mucosa as the submucosa. It should be well-oriented and included in the correct axis to avoid tissue loss between the different cutting levels. Preoperative biopsies should be performed at least 2 cm above the dentine line. This area is physiologically devoid of GC and shows physiological hyperplasia of the nerve fibers. Conventional histopathology with hematoxylin-eosin (H and E) stain is commonly used in the diagnosis of HD.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining is an ancillary method to identify the increased activity of parasympathetic nerve fibers in the lamina propria and the muscularis mucosa and, thus, help in making the diagnosis, especially in difficult cases. Normally innervated intestine does not stain with AChE.

In 2004, Barschak et al. associated the loss of calretinin expression with the absence of GC, a characteristic of HD.
