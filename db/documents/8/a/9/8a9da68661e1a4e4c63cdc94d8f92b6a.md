Peptidoglycan or murein is a vital constituent of the bacterial cell wall that provides mechanical stability to it. It is an extremely conserved constituent of both the gram-positive and gram-negative envelopes. Nevertheless, peptidoglycan is a thick structure in gram-positive bacteria (≥10 layers), while it is thin (one or two layers) in gram-negative ones. Concerning its structure, peptidoglycan is composed of glycan chains made of N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid di­saccharide subunits; the N-acetylmuramic part is linked to highly conserved pentapeptide or tetrapeptide stems (l-alanine–d-isoglutamine–l-lysine–d-alanine–[d-alanine].

The beta-lactam antibiotics inhibit the last step in peptidoglycan synthesis by acylating the transpeptidase involved in cross-linking peptides to form peptidoglycan. The targets for the actions of beta-lactam antibiotics are known as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This binding, in turn, interrupts the terminal transpeptidation process and induces loss of viability and lysis, also through autolytic processes within the bacterial cell.
