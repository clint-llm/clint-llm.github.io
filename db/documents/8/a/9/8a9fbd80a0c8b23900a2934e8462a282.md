Benign eyelid lesions can be inflammatory, infectious, traumatic, or neoplastic in origin. They are a common condition that requires differentiation from malignant and pre-malignant lesions. Management options include observation, biopsy, excision, injection with steroids, topical application of steroids, antibiotics, antimicrobials, oral antibiotics, application of warm compresses, and cleaning of the eyelid margins. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of benign eyelid lesions and highlights the differential diagnosis as well as surgical and non-surgical treatment.

**Objectives:**
- Distinguish benign from pre-malignant and malignant eyelid lesions.
- Describe the clinical presentation of benign eyelid lesions.
- Review the eyelid structures that can give rise to benign eyelid lesions.
- Outline the management of different benign eyelid lesions.
