As mentioned, unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis can appear similar to other cardiopulmonary diseases. A good history, physical exam, and imaging studies are required for a definitive diagnosis.

**Diaphragmatic Issues**

Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is an issue with the phrenic nerve or musculature of the diaphragm, as mentioned previously. In addition, other diaphragm pathologies may appear similar on radiographs and present with similar findings. Diaphragmatic hernia, for example, could appear similar on radiographs with an elevated hemidiaphragm and could cause trouble breathing.

**Pulmonary Disease**

Diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pleural effusion, or pneumonia can present with dyspnea, much like unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. A good physical exam and imaging can usually differentiate these disease states. Atelectasis may cause dyspnea and could also cause an elevation of the hemidiaphragm on the affected side. A hemidiaphragm may also be elevated after a surgical lobectomy. It is important to consider the possibility of diaphragm paralysis coexisting with conditions such as pneumonia or pleural effusion. Patients have had residual paralysis after cases of pneumonia or pleural effusion.

**Cardiac Disease**

Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis can cause orthopnea, which can be misinterpreted as heart failure. A good physical exam would be able to differentiate the two by looking for signs such as peripheral edema or jugular venous distention.

**Neuromuscular Junction Disease**

Disease states such as cholinergic crisis, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert-Eaton syndrome could lead to diaphragm muscle weakness and dyspnea, similar in presentation to unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. This would be a later sign, and a thorough history or response to edrophonium would likely be able to differentiate the disease states.
