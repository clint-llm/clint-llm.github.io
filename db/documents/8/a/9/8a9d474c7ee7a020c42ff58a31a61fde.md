The histopathology of TTP and other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs)Â is characterized by small vessel changes with swelling of endothelial cells and the subendothelial space. There is vessel wall thickening, and platelet microthrombi are noted in small arterioles and capillaries obliterating the vessel lumen. Large-vessel thrombosis is not seen in TTP.
