**Formaldehyde Exposure Prevention**

Environmental exposure to formaldehyde is minimal, so workplace exposure is the primary source of concern regarding formaldehyde. All workplaces should take steps laid out by OSHA, including limiting exposure and monitoring for symptoms of overexposure, monitoring formaldehyde concentrations workers are exposed to, placing clear warnings on formaldehyde-containing materials, and providing appropriate personal protective equipment. All team members should continually monitor that these required workplace conditions are being maintained and bring them to the attention of appropriate administrators should they be compromised.

Specific to the healthcare setting in clinical pathology and gross anatomy laboratories, appropriate handling of formalin and other formaldehyde-containing solutions should be maintained. Personal protective equipment should always be worn to limit exposure. Additional steps like supplemental ventilation systems and pre-filled containers to place tissue samples in may be implemented to reduce exposure beyond that of standard practices further. Through these practices, healthcare team members like laboratory technicians and all workers handling formaldehyde can minimize the risk of adverse events associated with formaldehyde exposure.
