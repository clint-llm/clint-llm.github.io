Contraindications to abacavir in ART therapy include hypersensitivity to abacavir or any formulation component, moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and patients who are positive for the HLA-B*5701 allele. This allele is highest in Caucasian populations at a frequency of 5 to 8%.

Abacavir should also be avoided and is relatively contraindicated in individuals who test positive for HLA-DR7 and HLA-DQ3 alleles because evidence shows that switching abacavir for another NRTI leads to a reduced incidence of hypersensitivity reactions.
