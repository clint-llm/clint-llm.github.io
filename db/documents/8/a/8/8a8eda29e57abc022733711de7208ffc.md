There is a lack of research regarding the toxic levels and effects in humans. While there could be toxicity seen in patients with liver disease, there is not enough research to support this. More human trial studies will be necessary. There have been studies that show LD50 to be over 5000 mg/kg in rats when given orally, with a significant decrease in white blood cell counts.
