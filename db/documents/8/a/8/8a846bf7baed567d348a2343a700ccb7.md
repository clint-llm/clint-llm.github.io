Varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox) is an acute febrile rash illness that was very common in children in the United States before the universal vaccination program came into existence. Luckily, the varicella-zoster virus is a vaccine-preventable disease. The FDA approves the use of the live varicella virus vaccine to provide immunity for preventing varicella in individuals 12 months older. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, indications, contraindications, adverse effects of this vaccine, and the front-line personnel involved in the prevention of the disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the goals of vaccination with the varicella vaccine.
- Describe the mechanism of action of the varicella vaccine.
- Describe the potential adverse reactions expected following vaccination with the varicella vaccine.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance varicella vaccination and improve patient outcomes.
