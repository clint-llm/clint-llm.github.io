Benzathine penicillin is formulated from two penicillin G molecules reacting with diphenylethylene diamine. It is active against gram-positive bacteria, including beta-hemolytic streptococci (groups A, B, C, G, H, L, and M) as well as Treponema pallidum and T. carateum. There has been no reported resistance to benzathine penicillin in Streptococcus pyogenes. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, administration, adverse effects, and contraindications when using benzathine penicillin.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the approved indications for benzathine penicillin.
- Summarize the mechanism of action of benzathine penicillin.
-  Review the potential side effects of benzathine penicillin.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance appropriate clinical outcomes with benzathine penicillin leading to optimal patient outcomes.
