All the individuals with Angelman syndrome (AS) will have some form of developmental delay, speech, and motor deficits. However, there are many variations in the severity of these symptoms. This depends on the genetic cause of AS (big deletions have the worse prognosis), time of diagnosis, and intervention. Some patients can achieve a higher degree of ambulation, speech, and independence in tasks of daily living.

Most individuals with AS will have a normal life span. They do not show any developmental regression, and they might become better with some self-help skills with supportive care. Most of the patients remain dependent and need constant care and attention as they have perilous behavior. Prognosis improves remarkably with early diagnosis and interventions like speech, physical, and occupational therapies.

Symptoms of AS vary with age. Most patients have decreased frequency of seizures, hyperactivity, and improved sleep as they age. However, they may become obese as they age, which can cause scoliosis and reduce mobility. Puberty seems unaffected with normal sexual development.
