Tufted hair folliculitis is the manifestation of a fibrosis-induced gathering of adjacent follicular structures, as well as a follicular retention of telogen phase hairs over multiple cycles. Some authors hypothesized that tufted hair folliculitis might result from nevoid scalp structures that undergo inflammation and scarring. Staphylococcal colonies are frequently cultured from tufted hair folliculitis lesions, but the role of this organism in the pathogenesis is unclear. Although some authors think that tufted hair folliculitis may result from a local immune response disorder, no anomalies in the host immune response to pathogens have been demonstrated, since CD4 and CD8 counts, as well as the ratio T-cell/B-cell, were found to be normal.
