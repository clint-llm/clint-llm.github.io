The list of differential diagnosis includes:

- Dacryocystitis

- Congenital glaucoma

- Keratitis

- Nasolacrimal duct obstruction

- Cellulitis

Several of these conditions may present with similar signs and symptoms; since this is the case, it is necessary to perform a complete history that includes maternal and family histories. As with any other condition, the addition of a detailed physical exam may also help with the diagnosis. If the diagnosis remains uncertain after evaluation, an ophthalmology referral may be warranted.
