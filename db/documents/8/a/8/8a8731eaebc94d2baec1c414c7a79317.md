Depending on the location of the wound, nurses may be called upon to remove sutures one to two weeks after surgery. When procedures occurÂ in cosmetically sensitive areas, such as the face, nursing staff may also counsel patients on the importance of protecting the healing wound from ultraviolet light exposure to minimize unsightly scar formation. Patients should keep the wound covered or apply sunscreen with a solar protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 when outside and should continue to do this until the scar has matured completely, approximately one year after surgery.
