The causes and presentations vary among age groups. In newborns and children, structural abnormalities are the primary cause. Yearly, of the estimated 6% total new births worldwide (8 million) born with serious birth defects, as many as 1% of the newborns have congenital defects of kidney and urinary tract.

Nephrolithiasis is the most common cause of hydroureteronephrosis in young adults. Approximately 600,000 adults in the US suffer kidney stones per year, affecting nearly 1 in 11 persons. As per the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the prevalence of kidney stones is 8.8% in the United States. Among men, it is 10.6% compared to 7.1% in women. White race, obesity, and diabetes are strongly associated with kidney stones.

Hydronephrosis is commonly seen in up to 80% of pregnant women. Mechanical compression of the ureters due to the enlarging uterus and the effects of progesterone are thought to be the etiology. It is mostly identified in the second trimester and may persist up to 6 to 12 weeks postpartum. Ureteral stenting is a treatment of choice if patients develop pain and renal failure.

Hydronephrosis is more common in women for the age range 20-60 due to pregnancy and gynecologic malignancy. For the age group greater than 60, it becomes more common in men due to prostate disease and complications.
