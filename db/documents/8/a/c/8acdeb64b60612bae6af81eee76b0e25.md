No laboratory test can diagnose osteoarthritis, as the diagnosis is clinically based. Imaging can aid in the diagnosis of OA and can be used to exclude other types of arthritis. Inflammatory markers, including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), are usually normal in OA but may be useful in ruling out other conditions when the diagnosis is uncertain. Additional laboratory testing can be employed to exclude inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, which may include a rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies. Genetic testing looking into aberrations in collagen formation and other collagen matrix proteins, which lead to premature OA, are currently employed by research facilities. Many other biomarkers are being investigated as novel techniques to diagnose early OA, monitor disease progression, and/or respond to interventions. More data is needed, however, to validate these methods.

A variety of imaging modalities are available to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the severity of the OA. The most commonly used modality in clinical practice is plain radiography. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommends plain radiography as the gold standard for the initial assessment of knee or hand OA. Findings consistent with OA in plain radiography include joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, subchondral cysts, and osteophyte formation. Subchondral erosions and ankylosis can be seen in radiographic films of erosive hand OA. MRI may be helpful in patients with an uncertain diagnosis to evaluate surrounding joint structures. Ultrasound is an accessible and fast imaging modality that can be used to assess inflammatory changes, including osteophytes and joint effusions, with more specificity to the peripheral joints.
