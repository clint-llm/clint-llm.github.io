The evaluation and diagnosis of Saturday night palsy are primarily clinical, and many patients that have a clear history and physical exam may not require further diagnostic measures. However, additional diagnostic tools can be helpful in evaluating alternative causes and complications as well as for predicting prognosis. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies are able to localize lesions anatomically, which can help differentiate between cervical radiculopathies, brachial plexopathies, and peripheral neuropathies. Ultrasound can be a low-cost, low-risk modality that can assist with visualizing the nerve and identifying areas of damage or disruption. It can also be highly beneficial in the early identification of obvious nerve disruptionÂ and hastening early surgical intervention for these cases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide fine detail that may not be visible on ultrasound and can also identify which muscles have been affected. It can also evaluate for additional disease processes, neurologic disorders, and soft-tissue masses. X-ray imaging can evaluate for fractures, dislocations, and bony tumors that may be the cause of nerve injury. A combination of several imaging modalities may be appropriate when considering a specific case.
