Lidocaine has a narrow therapeutic index, and plasma level monitoring may be necessary for patients with hepatic impairment who are on prolonged infusions. Ideal body weight should be used instead of actual body weight for dose calculations to avoid excessively high plasma concentrations (with an absolute upper limit of 120 mg/h for lidocaine infusions).
