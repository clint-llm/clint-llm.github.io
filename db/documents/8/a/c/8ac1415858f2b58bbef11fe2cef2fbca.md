Renal involvement in autopsy cases is secondary to non-Hodgkin disease in 30% to 60% of cases. Immunocompromised patients with uncontrolled Epstein-Barr virus proliferation, organ transplantation, patients undergoing chemotherapeutic therapy, patients with HIV infection, or ataxia-telangiectasia patients are at increased risk. Primary renal lymphoma is of Hodgkin-type arising in hilar nodes or renal parenchyma form only less than 1 % of renal lymphoma. Association of the tumor has been found with chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases like Sjogren, systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic pyelonephritis, and Epstein-Barr virus infections.
