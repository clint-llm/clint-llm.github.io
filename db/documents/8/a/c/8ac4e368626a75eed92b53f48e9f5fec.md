Ranolazine is available as 500 mg and 1000 mg extended-release tablets. Dosing should begin at 500 mg twice daily and be titrated to 1000 mg twice daily as tolerated. The maximum recommended dose is 1000 mg twice a day. The tablets are film-coated and not scored; they should not be crushed, broken, or chewed. Food does not alter the rate of absorption or the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). Ranolazine can, therefore, be administered with or without meals. Peak plasma concentrations are reached between 2 to 5 hours, the half-life is 7 hours, and the steady-state is achieved within three days.

Dose adjustment is required when ranolazine is taken with moderate CYP3A inhibitors like verapamil, diltiazem, and erythromycin. The dose should not exceed 500 mg twice a day. Dosing should be titrated to clinical response in patients on concomitant P-glycoprotein inhibitors, for example, cyclosporine, because they may also increase ranolazine plasma concentrations.

**Clinical Evidence**

The Combination Assessment of Ranolazine in Stable Angina (CARISA) trial was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patients with symptomatic chronic angina despite taking standard doses of diltiazem, atenolol, or amlodipine.

In the Efficacy of Ranolazine in Chronic Angina (ERICA) trial, ranolazine reduced the frequency of anginal symptoms and nitroglycerin use compared to placebo in patients with coronary artery disease who still had symptoms despite therapy with amlodipine 10 mg a day.
