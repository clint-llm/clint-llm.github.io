Meniere syndrome and BPPV were discussed previously.

It is anticipated that nearly 50% of those with childhood vertigo are related to a migraine. Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood is the most common cause of vertigo between the years of 2 and 6 with a prevalence estimated at 2.6% between the ages of 5 and 15.

Chronic subjective dizziness (CSD) is an entity that includes chronic unsteadiness or dizziness without vertigo. Additionally, it presents with hypersensitivity to motion stimuli, poor tolerance of visual stimuli or precision visual tasks. This condition must last three or more months to make the diagnosis. It has been found that CSD often coexists with other recurrent vertigo illnesses.

The following diagnoses commonly replace a vestibular migraine when the patient is followed for an extended period: Meniere syndrome, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, psychogenic dizziness, and spinocerebellar ataxia. Episodic ataxia type 2 and transient ischemic attacks must be ruled out before making the diagnosis.
