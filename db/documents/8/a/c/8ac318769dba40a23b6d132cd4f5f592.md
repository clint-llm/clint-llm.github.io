Contraindications for glenohumeral arthrography include active infection of the joint of interest, overlying soft tissues, or skin adjacent to the needle path. The presence of cellulitis overlying the glenohumeral joint is a contraindication as infection can be spread into the joint space when the needle is traversing its course from the overlying skin into the joint capsule.

Reflex sympathetic dystrophy, RSD, is a contraindication as it can be reactivated post joint injection. RSD is a form of complex regional pain syndrome, a chronic condition characterized by severe and burning pain, typically affecting the extremities. There can be pathological changes to the skin and bone, tissue swelling, excessive sweating, and allodynia. RSD is triggered by a tissue injury with no underlying associated nerve injury and is thought to be secondary to a malfunctioning of the sympathetic nervous system.

Relative contraindications include a patient who has a history of a contrast allergy. In such patients, a prophylaxis protocol should be followed or consider using normal saline to achieve shoulder distention for MR arthrography. If an allergic reaction occurs with MR arthrogram, it is typically related to either the local anesthetic or the iodine solution rather than the gadolinium solution. In anticoagulated patients, arthrography can typically be performed when the INR is less than 1.5 to 2.0.

CT arthrography should be considered an alternative technique when MRI is neither feasible nor possible, including when an MRI is contraindicated or no MRI is available. If a patient is claustrophobic or has surgical hardware, CT arthrography should be considered. Movement artifacts also promote the usage of CT over MRI. CT can also serve as a salvage procedure when MRI proves to be inconclusive.

An additional advantage of CT over MRI includes a submillimeter resolution in most standard multidetector scanners. CT is typically more accessible and allows for fast acquisition. CT can also better characterize osseous structures like a bony Bankart or a Hill Sachs lesion. It also better demonstrates pathological calcifications like calcific tendinitis or a Bennett lesion. CT is less susceptible to artifacts.

The use of gadolinium-based contrast agents in pregnancy should be considered. These contrast agents can cross the placental barrier, enter the fetal circulation, and pass through the kidneys into the amniotic fluid. No definitive adverse effects of the gadolinium-based contrast agents on the human fetus have been documented, but the potential for bioeffects upon exposure is not understood well.

The usage of gadolinium-based contrast agents should be avoided in pregnancy unless there is no alternative imaging and the benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. A small fraction of this contrast administered to a lactating woman is excreted into their breast milk. A small portion of excreted milk is absorbed by the infant's gut. The minute amount absorbed by the nursing infant's gastrointestinal tract is unlikely to be harmful. If there's concern by the referring physician, radiologist, or the patient, it can be advised for the mother to discard breastmilk for 24 hours post-gadolinium contrast administration. IV administration of the contrast and neonates and infants is safe and performed routinely. With this information and the fact that temporary disruption of breastfeeding is stressful for both infant and mother, the recommendation for suspension of breastfeeding for 24 hours is unnecessary.
