In the following atopic diseases, there is a history of atopy (hypersensitivity to many allergens, and elevated IgE serum levels). Patients are symptom-free in the absence of exposure.

**Atopic rhinitis**

- Characterized by nasal congestion

- Rhinorrhea

- Sneezing

- Itching of the nose

- Post-nasal drainage

- Dry cough

- Ocular symptoms

- Rhinoscopy shows a pale, swollen nasal mucosa with watery secretions

- The conjunctivae are hyperemic and edematous

**Allergic asthma symptoms**

- Asthma may begin at any age

- Frequent attacks of wheezing and dyspnea  associated with chest tightness and coughing(often nocturnal in children) at times productive of thick and tenacious sputum

- Fatigue

- Malaise

- Use of accessory muscles of respiration

- The lung fields are hyper-resonant

- Diminished breath sounds, rhonchi, and wheezes on auscultation

- The expiratory phase is prolonged

- In severe attacks breath, sounds and wheezing may both be absent

**Atopic dermatitis**

- The disease almost always begins in infancy

- Itching that worsens at night and exacerbates by irritants such as wool

- There is a strong family history of atopy

- Scratching and rubbing cause the typical eczematous skin eruption to flare

- Ingestion of allergenic food may cause exacerbations

- The skin is typically dry and scaly

- Presence of active skin lesions with prurigo and erythema

- Chronic lesions are thickened and lichenified

- Distribution of the lesions is dependent on age - in childhood mostly affects the forehead and cheeks

**Food allergy can manifest as**

- Rhinoconjunctivitis

- Asthma

- Respiratory symptoms alone are rare

- Usually part of systemic anaphylaxis

- Hypotension

- Arrhythmias

- Nausea and vomiting

- Abdominal cramping or diarrhea
