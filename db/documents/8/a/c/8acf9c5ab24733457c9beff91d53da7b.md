The diagnosis and management of CJD are with an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, pathologist, internist, ICU nurses, and an intensivist. The disorder is very rare and is very rapidly progressive. Most of these patients need ICU admission, but there is no specific treatment. Most patients die within a few weeks/months, so preparations for hospice care should be addressed immediately. Counseling for the family is important because there is no effective treatment, and death is inevitable. Interprofessional collaboration can help smooth the fatal course of this disease with family counseling and appropriate palliative care. [Level 5]
