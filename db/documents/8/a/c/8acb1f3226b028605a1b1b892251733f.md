The ulnar nerve provides motor innervation to part of the forearm and majority of the hand. It supplies sensory cutaneous innervation to the medial forearm, medial wrist,Â and medial one and one-half digits. The ulnar nerve and its branches send motor innervation to the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum profundus in the forearm, and hypothenar muscles (opponens digiti minimi, abductor digiti minimi, and flexor digiti minimi brevis). In the hand, the ulnar nerve provides motor innervation to the third and fourth lumbricals, dorsal interossei, palmar interossei, adductor pollicis, flexor pollicis brevis and palmaris brevis.
