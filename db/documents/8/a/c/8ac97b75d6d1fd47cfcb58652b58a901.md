Since this topic is of enormous importance, scientific societies of cardiologists and anesthesiologists have repeatedly collaborated to define the most effective strategy, including indications. The figure that emerges from this close collaboration is that any surgical non-cardiac intervention should be risk-stratified using the perioperative risk assessment path. The use of indexes is part of this assessment process (Class I recommendation, level of evidence B) and must be combined with other approaches such as the assessment of preoperative functional capacity based on metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) or exercise testing.
