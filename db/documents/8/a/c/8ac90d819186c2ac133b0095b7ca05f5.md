The differential diagnosis of conditions that cause back pain is extensive and varies by region. In the cervical area, possible etiologies include

- Rheumatic diseases: fibromyalgia, polymyalgia rheumatica, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, degenerative joint disorders, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis

- Trauma: fractures, dislocations, soft tissue injury

- Regional conditions: myofascial pain, osteomyelitis, septic discitis, septic arthritis, synovial cyst, torticollis syndrome

- Bone conditions: Paget disease, osteomalacia, osteoporosis, metastatic tumor

- Neurological: meningitis, cerebral palsy, paralysis of cervical muscles.

Many of the etiologies of low back pain have similar presentations. A mechanical origin of low back pain is the most common cause, representing 97% of cases of acute back pain. Lumbar strain or sprain is the number one cause of mechanical low back pain accounting for 70% of cases.

While the list is not comprehensive, the etiologies of thoracolumbar back pain include:

- Mechanical: lumbar strain/sprain, degenerative conditions, herniated disc, spinal stenosis, compression fracture, spondylolisthesis, fracture, congenital disease

- Non-mechanical: neoplasia, infection, inflammatory conditions, Scheuermann disease, Paget disease

- Visceral disease: pelvic organ disease, renal disease, aortic aneurysm, gastrointestinal disease
