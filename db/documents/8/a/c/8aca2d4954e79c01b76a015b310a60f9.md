Diagnosis of oral candidiasis is often clinical, based on clinical examination, medical history taking, and assessment of risk factors. The diagnosis is made after finding the typical lesion's features, excluding other conditions, and assessing the lesion's response to antifungal treatment.

Cultures and sensitivity tests can be done if antifungal treatment is ineffective.Candida infection is suspected, collecting a whole saliva sample in a sterile container or the oral rinse technique is advised.

In addition to confirming candidiasis, testing to diagnose an underlying immunocompromising condition should be considered. Patients may be tested for diseases such as HIV, adrenal insufficiency, malnutrition, steroid use, and diabetes mellitus.
