Ibuprofen, an over-the-counter drug in most countries, is available in forms convenient for consumer consumption. Typical dosage formulations include oral capsule, oral suspension, oral tablet, chewable tablet, intravenous solution, topical gel, and combination kit. The recommendation for oral administration is usually to consume the drug with food or milk in both adults and children. IV administration is often an option in inpatient settings for convenience of delivery or when oral delivery is unavailable,Â and infusion should be over at least 30 minutes for adults and 10 minutes in pediatric patients.

Ibuprofen with lysine is a commonly used IV formulation. Ibuprofen should not be administered simultaneously with total parenteral nutrition but may still use the same line, pausing total parenteral nutrition for 15 minutes before and after ibuprofen dosing. Burgeoning research hopes to explore further the possibility of simultaneous delivery of ibuprofen with other IV medications or nutrition. A recent study exploring the chemical compatibility of continuous ibuprofen lysine infusion with total parenteral nutrition was conducted in 2018, which showed both physical and chemical compatibility of IV ibuprofen infusion with two different total parenteral nutrition formulations in neonates with PDA.
