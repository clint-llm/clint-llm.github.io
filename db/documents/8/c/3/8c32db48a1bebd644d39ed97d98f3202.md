Observation provides an excellent treatment alternative, as 65% of the tumors remained stable and sometimes regressed in size.

There are different therapeutic options aimed at improving local control and minimizing associated treatment morbidity; however, the management of glomus tumors continues to be a challenge.

For young, healthy patients with functional cranial nerve deficits, the mainstay treatment of choice is surgical removal. Preoperative embolization is generally performed 24 to 72 hours before surgery.

Sub-total resection followed by radiosurgery for the residual tumor yields a better outcome with lower morbidity and mortality.

Radiation can be utilized in the setting of bilateral glomus jugulare tumors and can represent an adjunct to limited surgical approaches with associated subtotal resection.

Complete obliteration of glomus jugulare tumors with the use of embolization is very difficult and is prone to revascularization and is not beneficial in terms of alleviating clinical symptoms.
