History and physical examination are key to diagnosing recurrent acute rhinosinusitis. In most cases, a healthcare provider can make the correct diagnosis by considering the time course of symptoms and applying the major and minor diagnostic criteria set forth by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.

Radiological imaging is not routinely recommended to evaluate patients with presumed uncomplicated recurrent acute sinusitis. A non-contrast CT scan of the sinuses is indicated for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, suspected anatomical abnormalities, or possible orbital complications. A CT scan is a component of presurgical planning for balloon sinuplasty and functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS).

Cultures obtained from sinus aspirates or endoscopy may be needed to identify resistant bacterial or fungal pathogens in cases of persistent or chronic sinusitis. The most frequent pathogens involved in recurrent acute rhinosinusitis are similar to those that cause acute sinusitis: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, other Streptococcus species, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Staphylococcus aureus.
