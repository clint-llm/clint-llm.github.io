The gastrointestinal tract arises by the beginning of the third week of embryonic development. During a process called gastrulation, the three germ layers form. The germ layers include the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, which together compose the embryonic disc. The cranial end of the embryonic disc consists of the oropharyngeal membrane, which ultimately forms the mouth, and the caudal end includes the cloacal membrane, which forms the anus.

Towards the caudal end of the cloaca is an area called the cloacal membrane, whichÂ is a boundary between the endoderm layer and the ectoderm layer with no mesoderm in between; this ultimately forms the proctodeum. A mesoderm-derived urorectal septum divides the cloaca into the ventral urogenital cavity and the dorsal anorectal canal by week seven or eight.
