The falx cerebri is a sickle-shaped structure formed from the invagination of the dura mater into the longitudinal fissure between the cerebral hemispheres. The falx cerebri is anchored posteriorly to the internal occipital protuberance, travels superiorly to the corpus callosum, and anchors anteriorly to the crista galli forming a sail-like structure between the cerebral hemispheres. The falx cerebri contains blood vessels, nerves, and is a common site of falcine meningiomas and age-related calcification.
