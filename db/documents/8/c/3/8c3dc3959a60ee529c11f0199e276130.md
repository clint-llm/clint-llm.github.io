Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is a disease of disordered keratinization. Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis is one of six variants of porokeratosis and is more extensive than most other variants. Risk factors for porokeratosis include genetic factors, immunosuppression, and exposure to ultraviolet light. The lesions seen in disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis begin as pink to brown papules and macules with raised borders in sun-exposed areas and can be asymptomatic or slightly pruritic. There are many options for the treatment of disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis. This activity describes the pathophysiology and presentation of superficial actinic porokeratosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis.
- Describe the presentation of disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis.
- Outline the treatment options for disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis.
- Explain why careful planning and discussion amongst interprofessional team members involved in the management of patients with disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis will improve outcomes.
