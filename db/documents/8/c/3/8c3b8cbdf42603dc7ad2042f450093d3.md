Acute ocular burns may constitute an ophthalmic emergency. The severity of the injury depends on multiple factors. These factors include the offending agent, length of exposure, the surface area affected, and which ocular tissues are involved. Moderate to severe burns of the eye and the ocular adnexa cause serious morbidity and may result in long-term consequences on both vision and quality of life. Acute and chronic pain, scarring with resulting disfigurement, loss of normal function of the protective adnexa, and permanent vision loss are common sequelae of more severe burns.
