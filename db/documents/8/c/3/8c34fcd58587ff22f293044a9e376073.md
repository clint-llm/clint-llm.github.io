Patients should be educated on the symptoms that can be related to their aortic regurgitation. Patients who have not undergone surgery yet should be educated to follow up for serial echocardiograms depending on the severity of their aortic insufficiency. Patients with mild aortic insufficiency echocardiography can be performed every three to five years. Patients with moderate aortic insufficiency should have echocardiography performed every one to two years. Patients with severe aortic insufficiency should have echocardiography performed every six to twelve months or more frequently if left ventricular dilatation is progressively worsening. Patients should be told to follow up after surgery in approximately six weeks to three months to have echocardiography performed.
