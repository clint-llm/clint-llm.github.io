Significant progress has been reported in the prevention of congenital rubella syndrome since the identification of teratogenic potential of rubella virus. However, more efforts are required to eliminate it. Since no treatment is available for congenital rubella syndrome, it is important for women to get vaccinated before they get pregnant. MMR vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine, and due to its theoretical teratogenic risk, women who are pregnant andÂ not vaccinated should wait to get MMR until after they have given birth. Although, several publications have reported the absence of congenital rubella syndrome after vaccination during pregnancy.

The antibody response rate to a single dose is more than 95%; after two doses, the response rate is almost 100%. Rubella vaccine is generally well tolerated with benign adverse effects like fever, rash, and transient lymphadenopathy.

Even though rubella has become a rare disease in developed countries, lack of vaccination may lead to significant public health problems.
