Regarding the conduction pathway of cardiac action potentials, neurons that originate from the sinoatrial node pass through and along the interatrial septum to the atrioventricular node. Bachmannâ€™s bundle allows signal transduction between the right and left atrium while multiple neuronal pathways connect the sinoatrial node, located at the top of the right atrium, to the atrioventricular node near the base of the interatrial septum.
