Uric acid stones account for about 10% of all urinary stones in the United States and 5 to 40% of all stone cases globally.

The prevalence of uric acid uropathy varies with age, gender, and environmental factors. For example, people aged more than 65 were found to suffer from uric acid stones twice as often as younger patients. Males are affected up to three times more than females, but this is changing as more women are developing this disorder.

The incidence of uric acid stones has been found to be 6% in the white population, whereas it was 30% in the non-white population.

Uric acid stones vary with ethnic groups. For example, about 50% of ethnic Hmong patients (from Laos and Thailand) were found to be affected by uric acid stones, whereas, among non-Hmong patients from the same country, the rate was only 10%.

Environmental factors also influence the frequency of uric acid disorders and stone formation. The prevalence of uric acid stones was found to be 9% among factory workers laboring in a hot environmental condition, whereas it was only 0.9% among people working the same job at standard room temperature.
