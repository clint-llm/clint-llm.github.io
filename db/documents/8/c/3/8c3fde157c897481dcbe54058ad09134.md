The progression of uncomplicated acute mastoiditis can result in devastating consequences. Based on the location of the mastoid process, opportunistic infections can spread inward towards the brain or outward toward the periphery. Extracranial complications of acute mastoiditis include the following:

- Subperiosteal abscess referring to an abscess at the periphery of the skull near the mastoid process

- Facial nerve palsy via compression of the facial nerve.

- Labyrinthitis is due to the spread of infection within the middle ear cavity resulting in tinnitus.

- Petrous apicitis, referring to osteomyelitis of other portions of the skull. Often can present with a constellation of symptoms including otorrhea, retro-orbital pain, ipsilateral abducens palsy, and additional cranial nerve deficits referred to as Gradenigo syndrome.

- Bezold abscess is an abscess in the sheath of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

Intracranial manifestations of acute mastoiditis occurred in 6Â to 23% of cases. These patients will often present with physical exam findings concerning intracranial involvement, including seizures, nuchal rigidity, headaches, and altered mental status. They include:

- Temporal lobe or cerebellar abscess

- Epidural or subdural abscess

- Venous sinus thrombosis, which is the least common of all intracranial complications.
