The prognosis varies depending on the severity of the syndrome. Many children may remain in an early developmental level. Life expectancy is short, and many will die before the age of 10 years. The most common cause of death among lissencephaly patients is aspiration and respiratory disease.

Lissencephaly may affect some areas of the brain more severely than others. The gradient of severity is dependent on theÂ lissencephaly type and gene mutations.
