Electron microscopy reveals that the plasma cells contain an eccentric round nucleus with condensed chromatin and a well-developed nucleolus. The nuclear membrane-associated chromatin gives the nuclei of mature plasma cells a cartwheel appearance in histologic sections. The cytoplasm contains parallel arrays of rough endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasmic fibrils, and numerous polymorphic mitochondria. The cytoplasm also contains a Golgi complex immediately adjacent to the nucleus. Intracytoplasmic inclusions of various types—elliptical, round, or needle-like crystalline—are present. A significant accumulation of immunoglobulins forms these inclusions.
