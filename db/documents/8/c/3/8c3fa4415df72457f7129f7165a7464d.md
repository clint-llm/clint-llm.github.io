**Cardiovascular System**

Separation from the placenta causes a change in significant vascular pressures in the neonate. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) decreases with increased blood oxygen content, while the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) increases due to the loss of the low-pressure placenta. The neonatal heart has a decreased number of myocytes, is more fibrous, and lacks the compliance of its adult counterpart; therefore, it must rely on the flux of ionized calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum for contractility.  Cardiac output is dependent on heart rate as the neonate is unable to generate increases in stroke volumes due to their non-compliant ventricle. There is a dominant parasympathetic tone with the increased presence of cholinergic receptors causing a bradycardic response to stress. A striking difference between adult and neonatal physiology is that adults have a dominant sympathetic tone, generating tachycardia to their stress response. Due to the neonate's dependence on heart rate for cardiac output, bradycardia can result in decreased blood pressure and eventual cardiovascular collapse, so low or falling heart rates require prompt attention. Additionally, there is a delay in diastolic relaxation and subsequent decreased diastolic filling, making neonates unable to manage increased circulating volumes.

At birth, the exposure to increased oxygen and a decreasing level of prostaglandins precipitate the closure of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), a remnant of fetal circulation, thereby allowing more blood to circulate to the lungs. Complete closure typically occurs throughout the 2 to 3 weeks following birth. If the communication fails to close between the descending thoracic aorta and pulmonary artery within the expected period, a left-to-right shunt develops. PDA is considered an acyanotic congenital heart defect, and it can be closed surgically with a PDA ligation. This procedure is regarded as a preferred method over pharmacologic management (usually indomethacin) as the latter can be ineffective, have a poorly tolerated side effect profile, or enable recurrence.

**Respiratory System**

The neonate possesses some physical characteristics which can inhibit efficient breathing mechanics. They have very cartilaginous rib cages with a horizontal rib arrangement and decreased lung compliance contributing to paradoxical chest movements. They are susceptible to oxygen desaturations as they have reduced functional residual capacity (FRC), higher minute ventilation to FRC ratios, and consume almost twice as much oxygen as adults. Closing volume is greater than the FRC in neonates, and therefore small airways can close during expiration limiting gas exchange. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can be useful in term and preterm infants to help maintain lung volumes during spontaneous respiration.

The neonatal respiratory system has more dead space (which does not participate in gas exchange) compared to an adult, as well as fewer alveoli, which are thicker and less efficient in gas exchange. Neonates are obligate nose breathers and have narrow nasal passages, which account for a baseline airway resistance they must overcome. There are also significant differences in the neonatal airway; the newborn infant has a large head and short neck relative to body size.  Some of the airway characteristics that make neonatal intubation more challenging include a large tongue, long, floppy omega-shaped epiglottis, larger arytenoids, and narrow glottis.  The cricoid cartilage below the glottis is narrower than the glottis making the subglottic area the narrowest portion of the airway and giving it a characteristic "conical" shape.  The larynx is more cephalad and anterior in the C3-C4 position compared to the adult (C5-C6).

These anatomical airway differences allow for the neonate to suckle effectively by allowing an open channel for nasal breathing created by the approximation of the epiglottis and the soft palate while the milk passes over the back of the tongue to the side of the epiglottis. This accommodation allows for simultaneous nasal breathing while feeding. The cartilage in the airway is more collapsible, and the underlying tissue is loose, making the neonatal airway more vulnerable to edema.

**Hematologic System**

Neonates are born with fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which comprises 70 to 90% of the hemoglobin molecules and remains present in circulation until about three months of age when it becomes gradually replaced with adult hemoglobin (HbA). HbF has a high affinity for oxygen, causing the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to shift to the left. Therefore, arterial oxygen pressures are lower in the neonate than in the adult. The partial pressure of oxygen at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated with bound oxygen is 19mmHg for newborns vs. 27mmHg for adults (see Figure 1).  2,3-Bisphosphoglyceric acid (2,3 BPG) binds less strongly to fetal hemoglobin, also contributing to this left shift. HbF also can also protect the sickling of red blood cells. The normal neonatal hemoglobin level is 18 to 20 gm/dL. Due to the immature liver in the newborn, vitamin K clotting factors are deficient (II, VII, IX & X) for the first few months of life. Vitamin K is administered in the delivery room to prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn.

**Central Nervous System**

The neonatal brain lacks cerebral autoregulation, a protective mechanism that controls blood perfusion of the brain under the circumstances of extreme blood pressures. In the setting of elevated blood pressure, the neonate is predisposed to an intraventricular hemorrhage as fragile blood vessels can rupture. This arrangement also allows the maintenance of cerebral perfusion in the setting of hypotension. In adults, cerebral autoregulation occurs in the range of 60 to 160 mmHg mean arterial pressure (MAP). The lower limit of neonatal autoregulation is at 30mmHg, although the upper limit is undetermined.

**Endocrine System**

Neonates have an increased body surface area to weight ratio subjecting them to losing body heat more readily. They have a poor compensatory mechanism to prevent heat loss as they are unable to shiver or utilize vasoconstrictive mechanisms. They are born with brown fat, which allows non-shivering thermogenesis, an oxygen-consuming process. Hypothermia should be avoided in newborns as it induces a stress response, which causes a cascade of events to occur, including increased oxygen demand, pulmonary vasoconstriction, metabolic acidosis with peripheral vasoconstriction, and tissue hypoxia. Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common pre-existing medical conditions associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications and adverse birth outcomes.

**Gastrointestinal / Hepatic System**

Neonates have a decreased gastric emptying time and have decreased lower esophageal sphincter tone causing more gastroesophageal reflux. Hypertonic feeds increase intestinal energy demands resulting in bowel ischemia and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Immature hepatic function and decreased hepatic blood flow result in delayed drug metabolism. Plasma protein synthesis begins to increase after birth and is essential to the formation of albumin and alpha-fetoprotein.

**Renal System**

The fetal kidney can produce urine starting at the 16th week of gestation, and nephrogenesis is complete at 34 to 36 weeks. At birth, there is a decrease in renal vascular resistance as the mean arterial blood pressure increases. Initially, only 3 to 7% of the cardiac output is dedicated to renal blood flow (RBF) but will continue to increase to 10% after the first week of life.
