An ingrown toenail is a straightforward diagnosis. Almost all the patients present with toe pain. This pain may be responsible for different levels of discomfort and disability, ranging from a simple difficulty with walking, to a complete inability to ambulate.

The initial presentation, corresponding to stage 1, is characterized by signs of inflammation in the affected toe: pain, swelling, and erythema. The initial stage is followed by an acute infection with seropurulent drainage and ulceration of the nail fold, causing more edema and tenderness (stage 2). Chronic infection leads then to the formation of hypertrophic granulation tissue, which increases the compression and thus adds to the swelling and discharge (stage 3).
