In general, diffuse axonal injury is a severe form of traumatic brain injury.

A definitive diagnosis of diffuse axonal injury can be made in the postmortem pathologic examination of brain tissue. However, in clinical practice, a diagnosis of diffuse axonal injury is made by implementing clinical information and radiographic findings. Understanding the mechanism of head injury facilitates a differential diagnosis of DAI. Patients who experience rotational or acceleration-deceleration closed head injury should be suspected to have DAI. Generally, DAI is diagnosed after a traumatic brain injury with GCS less than 8 for more than six consecutive hours.

Radiographically, computed tomography (CT) head findings of small punctate hemorrhages to white matter tracts can indicate diffuse axonal injury in the setting of an appropriate clinical presentation. Overall, CT head has a low yield in detecting diffuse axonal injury-related injuries. Currently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), specifically diffuse tensor imaging (DTI), is the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of diffuse axonal injury. A recent report suggests that acute gradient-recalled echo (GRD) MRI will enhance the detection of axonal injury in grade 3 diffuse axonal injury patients, suggesting that it is most likely a better diagnostic tool.

It should be of note that DAI should be strongly considered in patients that fail to improve after receiving surgical evacuation of subdural or epidural hematomas. Conversely, if patients drastically improve after surgical evacuation of a subdural or epidural hematoma, DAI may not be present.

Currently, there are no laboratory tests for the diagnosis of DAI.
