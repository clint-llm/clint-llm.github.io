- Symptoms of ICU delirium usually manifest with acute onset and transient fluctuation throughout the day and may persist for days or months after the likely causes have been addressed.

- Delirium has severe consequences for the patient while they are in the hospital (increased mortality and longer length of hospitalization) and after discharge (prolonged cognitive impairment).

- Hypoactive delirium is a severe and commonly missed form of delirium.

- Prevention of ICU delirium is imperative.

- Delirium is a diagnosis of exclusion. It requires accurate clinical testing and observation.

- Soft restraints should be used judiciously and only after trying behavioral and pharmacological interventions for agitation in the setting of delirium. They should be utilized for the shortest amount of time possible, and only for specific behaviors that are directly impeding the delivery of necessary care.

- When verbal and non-verbal behavioral techniques are ineffective or not appropriate, haloperidol can be considered, starting at the lowest clinically effective dose.

- QT prolongation is a serious side effect of many antipsychotic medications and care should be taken when using them, including baseline EKG, for agitation in the setting of delirium.
