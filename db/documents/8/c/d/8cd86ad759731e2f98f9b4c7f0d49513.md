The symptoms of coronary artery ectasia may be associated with concomitant coronary disease, Kawasaki disease, or connective tissue disease. Most patients are asymptomatic. Patients with CAE may present with angina post-stress tests and acute coronary syndrome.  Diminished coronary flow speed or stagnancy of blood flow may cause exercise-induced angina without coexistent stenotic coronary artery disease.  Formation of intracoronary thrombus or dissipation leading to distal emboli may be the trigger of acute coronary syndrome, which is hastened by stagnant flow in the ecstatic coronary segment. The hypothesis is that coronary artery ectasia is predisposed to vasospasm, which may elicit angina or acute coronary syndrome. In people less than 50 years old, CAE should raise concern for connective tissue disorders and vasculitides.
