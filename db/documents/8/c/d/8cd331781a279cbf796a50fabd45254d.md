LS has a specific histologic pattern characterized by a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate below a zone of dermal edema and orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis. Histopathology findings vary depending on disease duration. In earlier stages, it shows vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer, hyalinization of subepithelial collagen, decreased elastic fibers in the upper dermis and dilated blood vessels under the basement membrane. In older lesions, histology shows a reduced number of mononuclear cells and dispersed patchy islands of mononuclear cells within the hyalinized dermis.
