Because patients with open fractures usually sustain significant trauma, an arterial blood gas (ABG), hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, metabolic panel, serum lactate, and toxicology screens are often warranted. Plain radiographs are usually adequate to assess the extent of the fracture. At a minimum, anteroposterior and lateral views of the injured bone should be obtained. The joints above and below the injury should also be x-rayed as the fracture could extend into the adjacent joints or involve articular surfaces. Air present on plain radiographs in the muscle, subcutaneous tissue or joint and visualized foreign bodies indicate an open injury. If the patient is stable, a CT of the ankle or knee joint may be helpful to characterize the orientation of the fracture and aid in reduction and plans for fixation. In the absence of pulses, a CT angiogram can be used to identify vascular injury.
