There is a chance of recurrence of ICH. Hypertension and old age are risk factors. BP should be controlled. Lifestyle modifications should be advised, including avoidance of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs. Continued multidisciplinary rehabilitation should be done.

The following are the possible risk factors for a recurrent ICH:

- Lobar location of the initial ICH

- Older age

- Presence and number of microbleeds on gradient echo MRI

- Ongoing anticoagulation

- Presence of apolipoprotein E epsilon 2 or epsilon 4 alleles
