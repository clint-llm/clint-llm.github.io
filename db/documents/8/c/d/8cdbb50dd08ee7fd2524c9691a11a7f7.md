The management of blunt force trauma patients is with an interprofessional team that includes a trauma surgeon, emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, anesthesiologist, internist, and specialty-trained emergency and trauma nurses. After the secondary survey is done by the team, other specialists can be consulted as appropriate. All over the U.S., hospitals now have protocols to manage blunt force trauma. The outcomes of these patients depend on their age, type of injury, other comorbidities, time to treatment and number of organs involved. While mortality rates have dropped over the past 3 decades, a significant number of trauma patients still die either at the scene or upon arrival to the trauma center.

- The clinicians should focus on completing the first and secondary survey and performing procedures.

- The emergency and trauma nurses should provide patient monitoring, assist with procedures, and providing medications and blood products.

- The pharmacist should double-check dosing and assist in evaluating any medications that may cause deterioration or drug-drug interactions.

- A clinician or nurse should coordinate with the team to provide family education during and after the recitation.

The importance of coordination and communication between members of the team will improve outcomes.
