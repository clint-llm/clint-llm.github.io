The tracings of the jugular venous pulse wave, which can be observed using cardiac catheterization, are said to be biphasic due to the presence of alternating peaks and troughs.**c**uspid valve to bulge towards the right atrium during RV isovolumetric contraction. Following the “C” wave there is an "X" (X prime) descent result of the right ventricle pulling the tricuspid valve downward during ventricular systole.
