The most frequent and problematic complications of EBP include failure (15 to 20%), worsening of PDPH by inadvertently creating additional dural rent(s), back pain, and infection. Mild to moderate back pain is commonly reported. This is self-limited, generally resolving in days and preferable to the discomfort of a PDPH. Also, patients need to be made aware of signs and symptoms of infection at the injection site: fever, malaise, erythema, or purulence as injected blood may serve as a nidus for infection. This requires urgent evaluation and care.
