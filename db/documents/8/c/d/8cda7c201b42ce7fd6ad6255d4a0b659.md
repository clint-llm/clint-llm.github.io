Long arm splints have a variety of indications:

- Distal humerus fractures

- Olecranon fractures

- Radial head fracture (although a simple sling is preferred in most settings)

- Capitellum fractures (if significant swelling present)

- Elbow fracture/dislocations (after the appropriate reduction is achieved)

- Monteggia fracture/dislocations -- the Monteggia eponym implies a proximal ulna fracture with an associated radial head dislocation

- A useful eponym for emergency medical personnel is the term "MUGR" (pronounced "MUGGER")

- **Monteggia**(involves a fractured)**Ulna**(proximal based injury in reference to the forearm, also "proximal" given its orientation in the actual eponym)
- **Galeazzi**(involves a fracture)**Radius**(distally-based injury in reference to the forearm, also "distal" given its orientation in the actual eponym)

- Soft tissue injuries

- In most clinical situations, a simple sling provides enough patient comfort/immobilization 
- collateral ligament injuries/UCL injuries
