Currently, Riehl melanosis is considered as a non-eczematous allergic contact dermatitis to fragrance, cosmetics, and sometimes occupational agents. It is specially marked by a reticulate gray-brown to black pigmentation involving the face and neck, interface dermatitis, and pigment incontinence. Hence, the diagnosis is best reached with an interprofessional team including dermatologists, pathologists, pharmacists, and occupational clinicians. The goal of treating patients is aesthetic. Fortunately, RM may resolve gradually on its own when the trigger factors are removed. Hence, healthcare workers including primary care clinicians, pharmacists, dermatologists, and nurse practitioners, should educate the patient on avoiding the suspected allergen and sun exposure. The outcomes for most patients are unpredictable. The condition is known to cause psychosocial impact, and hence a mental health counselor should be consulted.
