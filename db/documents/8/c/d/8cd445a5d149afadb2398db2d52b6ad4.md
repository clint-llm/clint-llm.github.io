The condition usually develops following a greater than 50 percent loss of kidney function, typically when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Anemia of chronic renal disease is associated with a poor quality of life, worse renal survival, increased morbidity and mortality, and excessive healthcare costs.

Anemia becomes more prevalent and severe with a declining estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2007–2008 and 2009–2010 (
