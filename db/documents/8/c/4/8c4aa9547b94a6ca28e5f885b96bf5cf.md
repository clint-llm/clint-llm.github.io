Anatomic structures to consider while performing wrist arthrocentesis are the following:

- Distal radius

- Anatomic snuffbox

- Extensor carpi radialis brevis

- Extensor pollicis longus

The joint space can be palpated distal to the radius and ulnar to the anatomic snuffbox on the dorsal aspect of the wrist, avoiding extensor carpi radialis brevis and extensor pollicis longus. Additionally, the joint space can be approached from the ulnar aspect. From the ulnar approach, space can be palpated distally to the distal ulna.
