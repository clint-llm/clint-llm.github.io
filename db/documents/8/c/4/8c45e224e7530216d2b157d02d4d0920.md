Sucralfate is a medication used to treat duodenal ulcers, epithelial wounds, chemotherapy-induced mucositis, radiation proctitis, ulcers in Behcet disease, and burn wounds. Sucralfate exhibits its action by forming a protective layer, increasing bicarbonate production, exhibiting anti-peptic effects, promoting tissue growth, regeneration, and repair. The medication has a relatively safe profile as there is negligible absorption from the enteral system. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring, of sucralfate, so providers can direct patient therapy in conditions where it has therapeutic benefit as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of sucralfate.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of sucralfate.
- Review the toxicity of sucralfate.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance sucralfate use and improve outcomes.
