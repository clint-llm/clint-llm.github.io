Cystectomy with urinary diversion is a complex surgery commonly performed in an older and more comorbid patient population.  Outcomes have been shown to be improved in centers that perform more operations and have healthcare teams accustomed to the specialized care needed in these patients.

Common pathway components include narcotic sparing pain management, which often begins preoperatively with epidural anesthesia or regional blocks. Additionally, early enteral feeding, bowel optimization with opioid antagonists, aggressive ambulation, and early involvement of physical therapy, as well as enterostomal therapists, can improve perioperative outcomes. Early mobilization postoperatively with the assistance of physical therapists can also help shorten hospital stays. Occupational therapy for older patients may be important in optimizing each patient’s ability to care for their diversion outside the hospital.
