The kidney receives innervation by sympathetic, parasympathetic, and sensory nerves.

The sympathetic fibers innervating the kidney arise from the prevertebral and paravertebral ganglia and give rise to postganglionic neurons that largely track with the renal artery towards the kidney and intrarenal vasculature within the kidney.

Sensory nerves within the kidney concentrate in the renal pelvic area.
