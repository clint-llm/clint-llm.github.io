Granular cell tumors are rare neoplasms derived from Schwann cells with characteristic pathologic findings. They can exhibit either benign or malignant behavior and most commonly occur in the oral cavity, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. They must be appropriately treated to avoid recurrence or metastasis of malignant lesions. This activity reviews the diagnosis, management, and prognosis of granular cell tumors and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this neoplasm.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical clinical presentation of patients with granular cell tumors.
- Identify the histologic features required to differentiate benign from malignant granular cell tumors.
- Outline the management of patients with granular cell tumors.
