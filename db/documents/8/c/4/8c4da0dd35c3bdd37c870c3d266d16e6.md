Birdshot chorioretinopathy (BCR) is an unusual form of chronic, bilateral, posterior uveitis with a distinguishing clinical phenotype, and a strong association with HLA-A29. This disease predominantly affects middle-aged individuals and more often affects females than males. Early in the course of this disease, patients may present with mild symptoms delaying treatment that can often result in permanent visual dysfunction. The disease is permanent, chronic, and progressive resulting in irreversible ocular damage. This activity will help the clinician gain a deeper understanding of this disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of birdshot chorioretinopathy.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of patients with suspected birdshot chorioretinopathy.
- Review the treatment and management options available for birdshot chorioretinopathy.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance birdshot chorioretinopathy and improve outcomes.
