Clinically, IFR may be utilized to assess indeterminate coronary artery stenosis further, for lesions anywhere from 40% to 90%, but recommendations do not include patients with ACS. Patients with clinical symptoms or non-invasive testing consistent with ischemia, and an IFR of 0.89 or less are candidates for PCI. While a patient with IFR greater than 0.93 typically qualifies for optimization of medical therapy (OMT), those with a ratio of 0.90 to 0.93 should have a follow-up with FFR. In a patient with clinical symptoms not consistent with ischemia, PCI is recommended for IFR under 0.86. In those with an IFR ratio over 0.89, OMT is recommended. Patients with IFR ratios between 0.86 and 0.89 are recommended for FFR confirmation. This information appears in the attached flow chart.
