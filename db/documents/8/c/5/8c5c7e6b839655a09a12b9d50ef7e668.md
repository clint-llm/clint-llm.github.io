Microtia is a congenital ear deformity in which the external ear is malformed and underdeveloped. In more severe cases, it is usually associated with the absence of an ear canal, known as aural atresia. These patients suffer from severe conductive hearing loss in the affected ears. In the absence of a congenital syndrome, these patients generally live normal, full, and productive lives. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of patients with microtia.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the Marx classification of ear microtia.
- Summarize psychosocial considerations for patients with microtia.
- Explain the different techniques of surgical microtia repair.
- Review the advantages and disadvantages of the various auricular reconstruction options.
