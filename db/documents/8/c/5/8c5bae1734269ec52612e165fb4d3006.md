Mycoplasma pneumonia is a bacteria that can infect humans. It usually causes upper respiratory tract infections but can also cause pneumonia, and it is one of the most common causes of atypical pneumonia in the United States. Many extrapulmonary infections have been attributed to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. However, a causal link is yet to be established. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and presentation of mycoplasma pneumonia and highlights the interprofessional team's role in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of mycoplasma pneumonia.
- Review the examination process for a patient with suspected mycoplasma pneumonia.
- Outline the management options available for mycoplasma pneumonia.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with mycoplasma pneumonia.
