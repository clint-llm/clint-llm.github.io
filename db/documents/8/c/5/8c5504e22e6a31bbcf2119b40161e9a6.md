The provision of nerve supply to the triceps is by the radial nerve (root C6, C7, and C8). However, according to the cadaveric study, it was found that the medial head of the triceps brachii could be innervated partially by the ulnar nerve. Following that line of investigation, other research also reveals that the long head of the triceps brachii can also be innervated partially by the axillary nerve.

The radial nerve originates from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus in the anterior axilla. The nerve then courses along with the profunda brachii artery (the artery that supplies blood to the posterior arm) and travels through the arm inferolaterally. It passes behind the humerus and through the radial groove between both the lateral and medial heads of the triceps brachii.
