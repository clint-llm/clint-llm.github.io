The anatomy of the female external genitalia is vital in clinical settings. The importance of this anatomy comes to the fore with the diagnosis of various diseases and lesions that affect the female genitals. Also, the knowledge of the female genitals is important when it comes to performing procedures involving the vulva.

**Urinary Tract**

Foley Catheter: One common procedure that is routinely due in healthcare is the catheterization of the female urethra. This procedure involves the introduction of a flexible tube into the urethra and securing it in place with a saline-filled balloon. This procedure is done to assist in the excretion of urine from the bladder. This method can be used to collect urine for surveillance monitoring of the amount of urine produced or to collect urine used for the analysis of other pathologies.

Urinary Tract Infection: One common pathology that involves the urethra is a urinary tract infection (UTI). In urinary tract infections, the patient classically complains of dysuria, increased urination, foul-smelling urination, and cloudy urine. This condition commonly affects females due to their urethrae are shorter than males' urethrae.  The short urethra in females allows the bacteria to ascend the urethra more readily, and the anatomical location of the urethra, vagina, and anus allows for cross-contamination between the vaginal and anal bacteria into the urethra. The most common bacteriologic etiology of urinary tract infections is gram-negative rods, with the most common bacteria being Escherichia coli.

**Sexually Transmitted Infections**

Haemophilus ducreyi: Infection of the vulva region may manifest as a rash or ulcer-like lesion. One bacteria that present as an ulcerative lesion is Haemophilus ducreyi (chancroid). This bacteria causes painful ulcerative lesions described as having irregular, jagged borders with exudative drainage. This condition also presents with inguinal adenopathy. The treatment for this infection is third-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones.

Klebsiella granulomatis: Infection with the bacteria Klebsiella granulomatis causes lesions similar to Haemophilus ducreyi. But the main difference is that these lesions appear as a painless, beefy red ulcer that bleeds with touching, and it lacks inguinal adenopathy. Treatment of this condition involves macrolides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, or Bactrim.

Chlamydia trachomatis: Infection with chlamydia is a common, sexually transmitted infection. In most individuals, this infection is asymptomatic, but some individuals may present with cervicitis, urethritis, and vaginal discharge. The fear complication of this infection in females is pelvic inflammatory disease and perihepatitis. Interestingly, chlamydia is commonly coinfected with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Since these two bacteria commonly cause infection together, the treatment is tetracyclines or macrolides for chlamydia and third-generation cephalosporins for gonorrhea.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae: Infection with Neisseria gonorrhoea manifest similar to chlamydia that it is commonly asymptomatic. But the infection may present with urethritis, cervicitis, and creamy purulent vaginal discharge. The fear complication of this infection is pelvic inflammatory disease and perihepatitis. Treatment for gonorrhea is the same as chlamydia since the two bacteria commonly cause coinfections. The treatment is tetracyclines or macrolides for chlamydia and third-generation cephalosporins for gonorrhea.

Treponema pallidum: Syphilis infections result from Treponema pallidum. This infection usually manifests as a painless chancre in the primary stage. If the disease is left untreated, it will progress to the secondary stage. In the secondary stage, it manifests as fever, widespread maculopapular skin rashes involving the palms and soles,  widespread lymphadenopathy (epitrochlear node is pathognomic), and genital lesions similar to genital warts (condylomata lata- has a rounder surface when compared with condylomata acuminata). If there is still no treatment during the secondary stage, the infection will progress into the tertiary stage. The tertiary stage causes necrotic lesions called Gummas, neurological symptoms such as tabes dorsalis, Argyll Robertson pupils, and general paresis, cardiac symptoms such as aortitis. The treatment of syphilis is with the use of penicillin.

Herpes Simplex Virus 1&2: Genital herpes is due to the infection from Herpes simplex virus 1&2 (HSV1&2), with HSV2 being the most common in the genital region. This infection manifest as episodes of painful vesicular lesions. Constitutional symptoms may accompany these lesions. Unfortunately, this condition is chronic and incurable. But infected patients can take acyclovir to decrease flare-ups and decrease the viral shedding load.

Human Papillomavirus: Genital wart is a condition that manifests as cauliflower-like lesions in the genital region called condylomata acuminata. This lesion is due to the infection from the human papillomavirus (HPV). The human papillomavirus comes in many viral strains, but HPV6 and HPV11 strains are the strains that cause genital warts. The defining feature of genital warts is koilocytes on histology. Fortunately, this condition is usually self-limiting and will resolve on its own. In some individuals, the virus is not cleared appropriately by the immune system, which results in chronic genital warts and may progress to cancer.

Human immunodeficiency virus: Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an infection that can be due to unprotected intercourse or the transfer of blood-borne products. This infection is usually asymptomatic for a few years, but it slowly destroys and decreases the number of T helper lymphocytes. Once the T helper lymphocytes decrease lower than 200 cells/mm3, the disease progresses into Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS presents as many different diseases, but the most common presentation is infection with opportunistic infections. Unfortunately, there is no curable treatment for HIV-AIDS. There are many maintenance medications to prolong the progression of the disease.

Hepatitis B and C: Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis B and C are viruses potentially transmitted during intercourse. Most individuals are asymptomatic. The main concern for this infection is the progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis B is preventable with vaccination, but there is no vaccination for hepatitis C. The only prevention for hepatitis C is barrier protection during intercourse and avoiding blood-borne products from infected individuals. There are treatment options for hepatitis B and C, but they are usually maintenance medications that slow the progression of the disease. Unfortunately, no real cure exists for these two diseases.

**Vulvar Pathology**

Bartholin cyst and abscess: Bartholin's glands are glands that produce secretions to lubricate the vulva and vagina. This gland can become obstructed and form a cyst containing the buildup of lubricant. If the cyst becomes infected, it then progresses to become an abscess. This condition tends to affect females of reproductive age. Bartholin cyst/abscess presents as a swelling located posterolateral to the vaginal orifice. This infection may result from infection with Escherichia coli, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

Lichen sclerosus: The vulva region is a sensitive region that may be prone to irritations. In lichen sclerosus, the vulva is under chronic irritation resulting in itching. This itching causes the patient to scratch, and over time the trauma from scratching will cause the vulvar skin to undergo lichenification (thickening). Lichen sclerosus is the thinning of the epidermis and thickening/fibrosis of the dermis. It appears as white parchment paper like lesions. This condition affects prepubertal and postmenopausal females with an increased risk of vulvar cancer. The treatment is topical steroids.

Lichen simplex chronicus: In lichen simplex chronicus, the vulvar region undergoes hyperplasia of the epithelium. This condition presents as a thick, leathery vulvar skin due to chronic scratching and rubbing. This condition is not associated with an increased risk of cancer.

Imperforate hymen: In pubertal females that reach the age of menarche, but do not have menses is called primary amenorrhea. One cause of primary amenorrhea is imperforate hymen. These females present with monthly pain and pressure in the lower abdomen, but not excretion of mense. On physical examination, there will be a blue, brown round bulging mass protruding from the vagina. The mass protruding from the vagina is a collection of the menstrual products getting trapped due to an imperforate hymen. The treatment for this condition is incision and drainage of the mass.

**Neoplastic**

Vulvar carcinoma: Cancer of the vulvar region is rare. The most common cancer involving the vulvar region is squamous cell carcinoma. This malignancy could be due to a transformation of leukoplakia or due to the infection from HPV16 or HPV18. Lichen sclerosus can also progress to vulvar cancer. A biopsy can confirm the diagnosis.

Extramammary Paget Disease: Padget disease of the vulva is usually a type of carcinoma in situ. This condition presents as scaling plaques, crusting, pruritus, ulcers, and erythema. But there is no risk for underlying malignancies.
