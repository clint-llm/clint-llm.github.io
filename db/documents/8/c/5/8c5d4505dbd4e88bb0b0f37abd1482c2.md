Complications can occur in long-term chronic cases. Involvement of the cornea, such as ulceration, scarring, or vascularization, is possible. Additionally, the lid margin can be distorted, leading to trichiasis, ectropion/entropion, or madarosis. Ulceration or perforation requires urgent aggressive therapy to prevent further permanent vision impairment.
