Each year in the United States, people visit the physician more than 1 million times per year because of plantar heel pain. It involves athletes and sedentary people and affects both males and females equally. The most frequent cause of the plantar heel pain is the plantar fasciitis affecting approximately 2 million Americans each year. It affects almost 10% of the population over a lifetime. Calcaneal stress fractures account for 20% of lower extremity stress fractures in 109,296 soldiers, reported from a 4-year study conducted by Pester et al. Around 16% of patients with heel pain have a systemic illness like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To the author's knowledge, the estimated prevalence of neurogenic causes of plantar heel pain is not clear.
