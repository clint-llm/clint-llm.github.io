Peripheral pulse observation and recording is a valuable assessment because of how quickly and easily they can be performed without specialized equipment or added cost. It is commonly used to continue evaluating patients who may have had trauma, sepsis, or other forms of shock, as well as a screening tool for pathologies such as PAD. Many clinical providers are trained to assess pulses, not just nurses and physicians but all those in the healthcare field who have taken a CPR course. Clear documentation of pulses is essential, indicating the location and laterality of the pulse, the results, and if it has changed from previous assessments. Sometimes peripheral pulses are marked with an "X" on the overlying skin, promoting continuity of care as different clinicians evaluate the patient over time.
