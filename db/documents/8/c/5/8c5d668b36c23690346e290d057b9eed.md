Patient education is mandatory in cystinuria.Â  The consequences of inadequate prophylactic measures causing eventual renal deterioration and possibly even renal failure need to be repeated and reinforced to patients to achieve optimal hydration and urinary pH levels. Teaching patients how to check urine specific gravity, pH values, and 24-hour urine volumes can be extremely helpful in fine-tuning and optimizing therapy to maintain a daily target urinary volume of 3 liters with a pH of 7.5.
