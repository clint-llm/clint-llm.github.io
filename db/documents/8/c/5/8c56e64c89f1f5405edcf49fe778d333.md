Electroretinography (ERG) not only assists in the diagnosis of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) but can quantify the severity and track the progression of the disease. Over time, a waves decrease in amplitude to a point at which the ERG signal can no longer be detected at all.

Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (CSNB), which presents with nyctalopia in childhood, presents in two forms.  The first is CNSB (both Riggs and Schubert-Bornstein type) and lacks any abnormalities on the fundoscopic exam.  The second group has fundoscopic abnormalities and includes both Oguchi Disease and Fundus Albipunctatis.  ERG in these diseases generally demonstrates attenuation or absence of b waves, with relative preservation of a waves.  As previously mentioned, these are non-progressive in nature.
