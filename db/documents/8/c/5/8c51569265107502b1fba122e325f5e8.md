Isoflurane is metabolized to trifluoroacetic acid, which increases concern for renal impairment.

There has also been increased concern for neurotoxicity, especially in the developing brain. These effects have been seen in animal models, where it has been demonstrated that both intravenous and inhalational anesthesia promote neuronal apoptosis.
