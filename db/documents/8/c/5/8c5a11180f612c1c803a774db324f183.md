Pediatric detrusor muscle has less contractility and has more passive stiffness compared to adult detrusor muscle; this is most likely due to a greater connective tissue to smooth muscle ratio in children, which is the bladder compliance (change in bladder pressure/change in bladder volume). Poor (decreased) bladder compliance is associated with upper urinary tract damage.
