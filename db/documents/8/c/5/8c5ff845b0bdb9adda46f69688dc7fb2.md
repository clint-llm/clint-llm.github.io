Clinical manifestations of SIADH can be due to hyponatremia and decreased ECF osmolality, which causes the water to move into the cells causing cerebral edema. Signs and symptoms depend upon the rate and severity of hyponatremia and the degree of cerebral edema. The earliest clinical manifestations of acute hyponatremia include nausea and malaise, which may be seen when the serum sodium concentration falls below 125 to 130 mEq/L (normal 135 to 145mEq/L). Vomiting is an ominous sign for patients with acute hyponatremia. With a more severe and acute fall in sodium concentration, headache, lethargy, obtundation, and eventually, seizures can occur. Coma and respiratory arrest can occur if the serum sodium level falls below 115 to 120 mEq/L. Acute hyponatremia encephalopathy may be reversible, but permanent neurologic damage or death can occur, particularly in premenopausal women.

Chronic hyponatremia allows cerebral adaptation, and the patients remain asymptomatic despite a serum sodium concentration below 120mmol/L. Nonspecific symptoms like nausea, vomiting, gait disturbances, memory, cognitive problems, fatigue, dizziness, confusion, and muscle cramps can occur with chronic hyponatremia. Sign and symptoms or mild and chronic hyponatremia are often subtle and missed during the history and physical examination. Nausea and vomiting affect approximately one-third of patients with chronic hyponatremia who have a serum sodium concentration of less than 120 mmol/L. Idiopathic SIADH is more common in patients over 65 years of age, and mild to moderate hyponatremia in such patients may contribute to fractures in addition to a higher risk of falls and gait problems.

History must include inquiry about head injury, chronic pain, smoking, weight loss, pulmonary symptoms, drug intake, or substance abuse (particularly heroin and ecstasy), in addition to all the above-mentioned symptoms. The clinicians should evaluate the source of excess fluid, and the chronicity of the conditionÂ merits consideration.

Physical examination should include assessment of volume status, as these patients are typically euvolemic. Skin turgor and blood pressure are within the normal range. Moist mucus membranes with no evidence of jugular venous pulsation or edema typically indicate euvolemia. Detailed neurological and chest examinations are necessary.
