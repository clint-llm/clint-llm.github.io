The complications of the various types of myopathies are largely attributed to the progression of the disease. Congenital, metabolic and hereditary myopathies could have fatal complications like cardiomyopathies, recurrent infections, and sepsis, neuropathies, respiratory failure, or renal failures. On the other hand, the complications of acquired myopathies are relatively limited to the etiology. For example, if it is infectious related then it is dependant on the type of the infection or if it is related to drug or toxin, then it is dependant on the dose and the period, and so on. Here is a list of possible complications:

- Death

- Rhabdomyolysis

- Heart arrhythmias

- Paraneoplastic syndromes

- Heart failure

- Hypertension

- Renal failure

- Neuropathies: Seizures and cerebral dysplasias

- Impaired movement

- Bedsores

- Infections and sepsis

- Irreversible muscle wasting

- Recurrent dysphagia

- Acute gastric dilation

- Respiratory system failure

- Endocrinopathies

- Cataracts

- Sensorineural hearing loss
