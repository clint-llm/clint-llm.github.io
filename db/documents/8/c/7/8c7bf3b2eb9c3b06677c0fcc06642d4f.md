Patients who start fibric acid therapy require close monitoring for adverse effects. Fibric acids should only be a therapy consideration in patients receiving treatment with low or moderate-intensity statin therapy if the benefits from reducing the risks of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or the benefits of lowering triglyceride levels are higher than 500 mg/dL outweigh the potential risks of adverse effects. Monitoring parameters include a lipid profile, blood counts, serum CPK levels (particularly if the patient has had muscular issues on a statin), and liver function tests. The treatment should cease if there is no adequate response within 2 to 3 months of initiating fibric acid therapy.

The need to monitor INR when giving fibric acid agents to patients on long-term warfarin therapy is unclear.
