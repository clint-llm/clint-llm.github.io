Abdominal pain and fever in a neutropenic patient is a signal for a serious underlying pathology that requires timely intervention and an interprofessional approach. In the case of NEC, early and appropriate intervention helps to prevent complications and improve outcomes. Early surgical evaluation is critical in the management of this condition, as it can be life-saving for some patients who present with a complicated NEC.

Infectious disease specialists can also help with guiding antibiotic selection because patients also have treatment as febrile neutropenic patients. Pharmacists review prescriptions for antibiotics and granulocyte stimulating factors, verifying dosages, and drug-drug interactions. For recalcitrant infections, a board-certified infectious disease pharmacist can be an invaluable team asset, working with the specialist using the latest antibiogram data to guide antimicrobial therapy. Also, a hematology-oncology evaluation is essential because patients usually have received intensive chemotherapy before or during their symptom onset and presentation. Oncology nurses administer treatments, educate patients, and are invaluable in monitor patients and informing the interprofessional team about changes in the patient's medical condition. This interprofessional team paradigm results in optimal patient outcomes for NEC cases. [Level 5]
