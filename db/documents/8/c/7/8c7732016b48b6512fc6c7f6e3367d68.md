Cluneal neuralgia is a painful condition that can occur with damage to one of the three sets of cluneal nerves: superior, middle, or inferior. More specifically, the entrapment of the superior, middle, and/or inferior cluneal nerves represents an overlooked cause of low back pain. With careful consideration given to a detailed history and physical exam, cluneal neuralgia can be recognized and treated appropriately. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of cluneal neuralgia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline and explain the basic anatomy of the superior, middle and inferior cluneal nerves.
- Explain a proposed diagnostic criterion for superior, middle, or inferior cluneal nerve entrapment.
- Identify the different interventional treatment options for cluneal neuralgia.
- Review the interdisciplinary team approach to the treatment and management of cluneal neuralgia that helps improves healthcare outcomes.
