Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA), also known asÂ Mucha-Habermann disease, is an uncommon cutaneous inflammatory rash characterized by diffuse red-brown papules in various stages with a mica-like scale on more established lesions. The papules may progress to form vesicles, pustules, and ulcers, and these lesions can be associated with pruritus or a burning sensation. PLEVA favors the trunk and proximal extremities, especially in the flexural regions. This rash tends to relapse and remit with variable duration, sometimes lasting up to years.
