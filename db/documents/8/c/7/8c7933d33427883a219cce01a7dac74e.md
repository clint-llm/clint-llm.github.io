The diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia is challenging. The initial clinical presentation may be mistaken for psychiatric disorders or a stroke.

**Behavior variant type FTD (bvFTD):**It is the most common phenotype. Patients suffering from bvFTD may present with a cluster of altered behavior and personality changes earlier in the disease process, which include disinhibition, loss of emotional reactivity and disease insight, apathy, impaired abstract thinking, and executive function that gradually worsens over time. Additionally, it may demonstrate a change in dietary behavior and loss of fundamental emotions and empathy but with intact memory until late in the disease.

**Semantic variant FTD:**In this form of FTD, patients manifest language difficulties characterized by paraphasia (impaired word-finding ability or loss of vocabulary), difficulty in understanding the meaning of words, impaired comprehension, and difficulty in recognizing unfamiliar objects or faces.

**Non-fluent variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (nfvPPA):**Patients with this type of FTD present clinically with effortful halted speech and paraphasia (jumbled words), difficulty in understanding complex sentences and naming objects.

Various bedside tests can be performed if clinical suspicion for FTD is high.

- Go-no-go test: In this test, the patient is asked to perform an action in response to a particular stimulus and inhibit that action in response to different stimuli.

- Letter fluency test: In this test, the patient is asked to say as many words (except proper nouns), starting with a single letter in one minute.

- Attention test: It is used to evaluate the attention span. It is done either by serial seven subtractions from 100 or spells the word “world” backward.

- Similarities and differences: It is done to evaluate abstract thinking. The patient is instructed to compare items (table and chair, apple, and orange).
