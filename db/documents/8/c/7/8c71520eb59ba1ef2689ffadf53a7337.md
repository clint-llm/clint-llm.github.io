Approximately 80% of the United States experiences low back pain at least one time during their life.

Neck pain is also widespread and affects greater than one-third of the general population at some point in their lives. As patients age, osteoarthritic change to the cervical spine becomes more common. Most cases of neck pain are self-limited, lasting less than one week, and not necessarily perceived as neck pain.

Osteoarthritis is a chronic, degenerative disease. In most cases, patients are asymptomatic. Arthritis is a product of aging. Prognosis often is a function of the severity of osteoarthritis. For example, severe lumbar radiculopathy caused by arthritic changes and spinal stenosis can require surgical intervention. Patients whose osteoarthritic back pain is so critical they require surgical intervention have a worse prognosis than patients with milder symptoms.
