Although there is no widely accepted treatment regimen for trichodysplasia spinulosa, the prognosis is relatively good, although it may take months to years to fully resolve. In some cases, the condition regresses spontaneously or after the completion of the immunosuppressive treatment. The associated alopecia of the eyebrows and eyelashes and leonine facial disfiguration also resolve over time with the resolution of active disease. The underlying condition that either causes or requires immunosuppression is much more pertinent to the prognosis for the patient as a whole.
