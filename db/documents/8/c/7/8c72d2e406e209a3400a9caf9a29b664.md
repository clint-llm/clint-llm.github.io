PAES is a rare vascular disorder seen in young people. The diagnosis is difficult and thus requires an interprofessional team that includes a radiologist, nurse practitioner, vascular surgeon, primary care provider, and an emergency department physician. The treatment depends on the symptoms. The primary care provider can observe asymptomatic patients, but symptomatic patients require treatment. There are several treatments besides an open vascular bypass. Following treatment most patients have a good outcome; however, several patients may develop nerve injury following surgery (Level V).
