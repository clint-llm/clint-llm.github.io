The overall clinical outcomes in patients with xanthomas depends on a variety of factors. Most importantly, the underlying systemic disease must be appropriately managed. Some of the underlying systemic diseases in these patients may have early and high mortality rates, such as homozygous familial hypocholesterolemia. Others may be managed with lifestyle modifications and systemic therapies that can provide substantial improvements in survival rates. In terms of local disease, most smaller xanthoma lesions may either decrease in size or even completely resolve with effective systemic management. For those local lesions which are symptomatic due to their size or anatomic location, recurrence after excision can be minimized by careful surgical planning. Partial resection or debulking has been associated with a very high recurrence rate in these lesions.
