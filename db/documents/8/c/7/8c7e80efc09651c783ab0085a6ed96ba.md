Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is normally used for a short period in post-menopausal women. The routes of admission can be transdermal (cream and patches), intramuscular, or oral.Â Estradiol therapy usually comes in two forms: as a vaginal cream or as a capsule. Studies have found that using estradiol vaginal cream twice a week has significantly reduced vaginal dryness and dyspareunia compared to placebo pills. However, there was no significant improvement between estradiol vaginal cream and placebo therapy in vaginal irritation, itchiness, and dysuria.

There is still research underway to determine the efficacy of vaginal estradiol capsules. Capsules currently undergoing clinical trials hope to relieve post-menopausal symptoms with very little systemic estradiol exposure. The capsules should be less messy and more patient-friendly than creams and tablets.

In one clinical trial, capsules improved vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. Also, capsules increased the percent of superficial and intermediate cells in the vagina, thus improving vaginal physiology.

Sustained-release estradiol vaginal rings are becoming more popular in research. Rings can be effective for up to 90 days and can be easily inserted and removed by patients.
