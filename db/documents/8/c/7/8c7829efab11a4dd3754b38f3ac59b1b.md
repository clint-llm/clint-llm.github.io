- IOP rise - the most common complication in patients undergoing laser trabeculoplasty. The frequency of IOP spikes can be reduced by two-thirds using prophylactic alpha-adrenergic agonists about 30-60 minutes before the procedure.
- The use of higher energy levels,
- 360-degree angle treatments,
- Posterior placement of laser beam,
- Heavy pigmentation of the angle, and
- A low aqueous outflow facility. These IOP spikes are usually transient, occur in the first hour, and resolve with medical treatment. However, in cases with sustained IOP rise, surgical management is needed.

- Low-grade iritis

- Formation of PAS

- Corneal edema- occurs due to HSV reactivation. The inflammatory cascade following laser therapy reactivates the virus.

- Hyphema
