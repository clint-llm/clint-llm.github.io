When there is a suspected myeloid neoplasm with monocytic differentiation, it is challenging and essential to accurately classify monocytes as mature or immature. There is no definitive test to identify immature monocytes. Flow cytometry identifies molecules on the surface of such cells, known as cluster of differentiation (CD) markers. Such markers canÂ provide information to help in estimating the approximate populations of mature and immature monocytes.
