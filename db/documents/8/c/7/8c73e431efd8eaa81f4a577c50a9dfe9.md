In an anatomically normal heart, oxygenated blood from the lungs drains into the left atrium via four or more pulmonary veins, and deoxygenated blood from the systemic circulation drains into the right atrium via the superior and the inferior vena cave. Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connections (PAPVC) is a spectrum of congenital heart defects where one or more but not all pulmonary veins abnormally drain into the right atrium either directly to the right atrium or through draining into systemic veins. Total anomalous pulmonary venous connections (TAPVC) is a cyanotic congenital heart disease where all of the pulmonary veins drain directly or indirectly into the right atrium.
