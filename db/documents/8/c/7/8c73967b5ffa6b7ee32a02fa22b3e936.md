Gilbert syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder that presents most commonly due to the addition of an extra dinucleotide sequence, TA, to the TATA promoter in the UGTA1A gene. UGTA1 enzyme activity is consequently 10% to 30% of its normal activity and presents with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with bilirubin levels less than 5 mg/dl.Â  Jaundice occurs during times of stress or fasting when bilirubin levels exceed 3 mg/dl. Crigler-Najjar type 1 syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder that occurs most commonly due to mutations in exons 2 to 5 of UGT1A1 and leads to complete or near complete loss of activity of the enzyme. Elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels between 20 to 45 mg/dl appear after birth, and life-threatening symptoms such as bilirubin encephalopathy (Kernicterus) arise. Crigler-Najjar type 2 syndrome, also an autosomal recessive disorder, is the much milder variant of this disease, due to UGT1A1 functioning at less than 10% of its capacity and presents with rare kernicterus during times of stress, fasting, or illness. It appears that a bilirubin level greater than 15 mg/dl increases the risk for kernicterus. Drugs such as protease inhibitors like Indinavir can also cause disorders of bilirubin metabolism by competitively inhibiting the UGT1A1 enzyme.
