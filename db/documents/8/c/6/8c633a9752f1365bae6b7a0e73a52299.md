The primary function of the LES is the protection of the esophagus from highly acidic stomach secretions. Except in the lower one-eighth of the esophagus, the esophageal mucosa cannot resist the digestive action of gastric secretions for a prolonged period. Under normal conditions, the LES remains tonically contracted with an intraluminal pressure of about 30 mmHg. When swallowing causes a peristaltic wave to pass down the esophagus, receptive relaxation of the LES occurs ahead of the peristasis, allowing for easy propulsion of the swallowed bolus into the stomach.

**Intrinsic Component of LES**

- 
**Clasp Fibers**

- 
              
- Semicircular "C-shaped" smooth muscle fibers on the ride side of the LES
              
              
- Maintain stronger myogenic tone than sling fibers
              
              
- Not responsive to cholinergic stimulation
              
              
- Predominantly innervated by inhibitory neurons located in the body of the esophagus
              
              
- Utilize L-type calcium channels

- 
**Sling Fibers**

- 
              
- Oblique gastric muscle fibers found on the left side of the LES
              
              
- Weaker resting tone
              
              
- Contract vigorously to cholinergic agonists
              
              
- Predominantly innervated by excitatory neurons located in the stomach
              
              
- Responsible for the asymmetry of LES pressure
              
              
- Responsible for the maintenance of the angle of HIS and flap valve function - both of which are important in the prevention of reflux

**Extrinsic Component of LES**

- 
**Crural Diaphragm**

- 
              
- Considered the "external sphincter" of the LES
              
              
- Functions to increase pressure at the distal esophagus
              
              
- Crucial during inspiration when intrathoracic pressure decreases or during periods of increased intraabdominal pressure - both situations predispose to gastric reflux

- 
**Right Crus**

- 
              
- Thicker and more extensive
              
              
- Arises from lumbar vertebrae L1-L3 and divides into superficial and deep components
              
              
- Superficial component: lies to the right of the esophageal hiatus
              
              
- Deep component: lies to the left of the esophageal hiatus, lateral to the left crus

- 
**Left Crus**

- 
              
- Smaller - arises from L1-L2
              
              
- Lies to the left of the esophageal hiatus

- 
**Phrenoesophageal Ligament**

- 
              
- Continuation of the inferior diaphragmatic fascia
              
              
- Acts as a protective sleeve over the intraabdominal esophagus
              
              
- Upper limb: connects the distal esophagus to the superior aspect of the diaphragm
              
              
- Lower limb: connects the cardia of the stomach to the inferior aspect of the diaphragm
              
              
- Allows independent movement of the esophagus and diaphragm - protecting against gastric reflux and hiatal hernia

The proper function of the LES occurs through two main mechanisms - myogenic and neural control. Myogenic control is the intrinsic rhythm of gastrointestinal smooth muscle contraction and relaxation. Neural control is achieved through the autonomic and enteric nervous systems.

The LES tonically contracts to an average pressure of 15 to 30 mmHg. After swallowing, inhibitory signals generated by peristalsis cause a reflex relaxation of the LES for approximately 5 seconds, allowing transit of the bolus into the stomach. During this time, the diaphragmatic crura also relax. After the bolus passage, the LES and crura return to their baseline contracted state. Transient LES relaxation (TLESR) is another physiologic relaxation of the LES that occurs outside of the swallowing mechanism. It is believed to be triggered by gastric distention and causes both the LES and the diaphragmatic crura to relax, allowing the release of excess gas. This process is followed by primary peristaltic waves distally to return any refluxed liquid into the stomach.
