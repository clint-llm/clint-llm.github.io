Injuries to the spleen are one of the most common injuries in abdominal trauma. The spleen is the most vascular organ in the body. Since bleeding in splenic injuries is mainly arterial, significant haemoperitoneum can occur. Unrecognized injury can be a cause of preventable traumatic death. This activity reviews the framework for the evaluation and initial management of patients with abdominal trauma with a suspected injury of the spleen and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing the patients presenting with it.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical imaging findings to aid in the diagnosis of suspected splenic injury.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with splenic injury in patients with abdominal trauma. 
- Review the conservative management of trauma patients with suspected spleen injuries.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance and improve outcomes for the trauma patients with suspected spleen injuries.
