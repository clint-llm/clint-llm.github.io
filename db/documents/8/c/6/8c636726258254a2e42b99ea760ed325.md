Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) is an exudative maculopathy characterized by multiple recurrent serosanguineous retinal pigment epithelial detachments (PED). It is similar to neovascular age-related macular degeneration in morphological characteristics. It was first described by Yannuzzi et al. at an annual meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology in 1982 and termed idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (IPCV). in 1984, Kleiner et al. described a similar presentation in middle-aged black women and named it posterior uveal bleeding syndrome (PUBS).
