The mid-forehead brow lift can be performed under either local or general anesthesia, with general anesthesia more commonly used when additional procedures, such as four lid blepharoplasty, ablative LASER resurfacing, or rhytidectomy, is undertaken concurrently. In addition to a surgeon, a nurse and a surgical technologist are necessary. In the operating room, an anesthesia provider and a surgical first assistant are usually available as well.
