Levofloxacin is available both for oral tablets and solution and intravenous administration. Levofloxacin is not available for administration through intramuscular, intrathecal, or subcutaneous routes. The marketed oral dosage strengths for levofloxacin are 250 mg, 500 mg, and 750 mg.

Oral dosing with tablets can be without regard to meals. However, the oral solution should be taken 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals. Patients should avoid using antacids, or levofloxacin should be administered two hours before or two hours after taking antacids containing magnesium or aluminum. It is essential to maintain proper hydration to prevent crystalluria.

Levofloxacin injection should be administered for adult and pediatric patients by slow intravenous infusion over 60 minutes (250 to 500 mg) and over 90 minutes (for 750 mg). Due to an increased risk of hypotension, bolus or rapid intravenous administration should be avoided. In addition, the infusion should not use a solution containing multivalent cations. The ophthalmic solution is safe and an effective antibiotic used for seven days to treat bacterial conjunctivitis.

- The recommended oral dose regimen is 750 mg once daily to treat nosocomial pneumonia, complicated skin and skin structure infections (7 to 14 days), community-acquired pneumonia, acute bacterial sinusitis, complicated urinary tract infection (UTI), or acute pyelonephritis (five days).

- The daily dosing of 500 mg once daily is recommended to treat nosocomial pneumonia (7 to 14 days), acute bacterial sinusitis (5 to 14 days), acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (seven days), uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (7 to 10 days), chronic bacterial prostatitis (28 days), and post-exposure inhalational anthrax (60 days).

- The daily dosing of 250 mg is recommended for patients with complicated urinary tract infections, acute pyelonephritis (10 days), or uncomplicated urinary tract infections (3 days).

- The daily dosing of  750 mg IV or orally once daily (5 days regimen) is recommended for complicated UTIs or acute pyelonephritis.****

**Use in Specific Patient Populations**

**Patients with Hepatic Impairment:**No dose adjustment is provided in the manufactures labeling. As levofloxacin is eliminated primarily by the kidney and undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism, dose adjustment may not be required. In addition, levofloxacin is used in patients with cirrhosis to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The preferred drug for SBP prophylaxis is 3rd generation cephalosporin; levofloxacin can be used in patients allergic to cephalosporins.

**Patients with Renal Impairment:**A 50% reduction in the total daily dosage is recommended in patients with renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate between 10 and 50 mL/min) and extended to every 48 hours if the glomerular filtration rate falls less than 10 mL/min).

**Pregnancy Considerations:**Guidelines for acute and recurrent urinary tract infections in women in pregnancy recommends using agents other than levofloxacin, such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and cefuroxime. According to joint guidelines published by the American Thoracic Society, CDC, European Respiratory Society, and IDSA, in patients with MDR-TB, levofloxacin can be considered in pregnancy if the benefits of treatment to the mother outweigh the harms.

**Breastfeeding Considerations:**Levofloxacin has not been used in infants because of consideration of adverse consequences on the infants' developing joints. Clinical data indicate that breast milk has a low concentration of levofloxacin, which is unlikely to cause damaging effects in breastfed babies. Using levofloxacin with breastfeeding mothers is acceptable with monitoring the infant for possible GI adverse effects (diarrhea or candidiasis). Additionally, pregnant women should be counseled not to breastfeed during treatment with levofloxacin and for two days after taking the last dose of levofloxacin.
