**Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (**SIRS**):**

Four criteria include:

- Temperature higher than 38 C or less than 36 C

- Heart rate higher than 90 beats per minute

- Respiratory rate greater than 20 per minute

- White blood cell count greater than 12 x 10/L or less than 4 x 10/L

Two of the 4 criteria are needed to identify a patient with SIRS.

Two of the SIRS criteria plus a suspected source of sepsis are required to diagnose sepsis.

- Sepsis plus organ dysfunction is consistent with severe sepsis.

- Severe sepsis plus refractory hypotension (refractory to fluid resuscitation) is consistent with septic shock.

**Signs of Organ Dysfunction**

- Systolic BP less than 90 mm Hg or mean arterial pressure less than 65 mm Hg.

- Drop in BP greater than 40 mm Hg (especially in hypertensive patients)

- Lactate greater than 2 mmol/L

- Urine output less than 0.5 mg/kg/hr for 2 consecutive hours

- Drop in Glasgow coma scale (GCS) or abbreviated mental test scores
