Acanthosis nigricans is a velvety, darkening of the skin that usually occurs in intertriginous areas.  This hyperpigmentation has poorly defined borders, usually occurs in skin fold areas, such as the back of the neck, axilla, and groin, and may include thickening of the skin. Acanthosis nigricans is most commonly associated with diabetes and insulin resistance, but rarely it can be a sign of internal malignancy. It can also occur with hormone disorders, and with the use of certain medications like systemic glucocorticoids and oral contraceptives.
