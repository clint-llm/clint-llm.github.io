Pancreatic serous neoplasms are unifocal, round, well-demarcated, and are often honeycombed. The cysts are loculated, contain serous fluid that is mucin free, and are lined by flattened or cuboidal epithelium. Their size can reach to more than 20 cm. They do not communicate with the pancreatic duct. Usually, a dense fibronodular scar is found in the center of the lesion (also called fibrous stellate scar) that is composed of acellular hyalinized tissue and a few clusters of tiny cysts, which are lined by a single layer of cuboidal epithelial cells.
