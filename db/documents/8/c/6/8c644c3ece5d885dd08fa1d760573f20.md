Lab values vary, and there is no standard at present.  However, in general, the result is reported in either mg/dL or mg/L. Hs-CRP is usually reported in mg/dL. When used for cardiac risk stratification, hs-CRP levels less than 1 mg/dL are considered low risk. Levels between 1 mg/dL and 3 mg/dL are considered a moderate risk, and a level greater than 3 mg/dL is considered high risk for the development of cardiovascular disease.

**Interpretation of CRP levels:**

Less than 0.3 mg/dL: Normal (level seen in most healthy adults).

0.3 to 1.0 mg/dL: Normal or minor elevation (can be seen in obesity, pregnancy, depression, diabetes, common cold, gingivitis, periodontitis, sedentary lifestyle, cigarette smoking, and genetic polymorphisms).

1.0 to 10.0 mg/dL: Moderate elevation (Systemic inflammation such as RA, SLE, or other autoimmune diseases, malignancies, myocardial infarction, pancreatitis, bronchitis).

More than 10.0 mg/dL: Marked elevation (Acute bacterial infections, viral infections, systemic vasculitis, major trauma).

More than 50.0 mg/dL: Severe elevation (Acute bacterial infections).
