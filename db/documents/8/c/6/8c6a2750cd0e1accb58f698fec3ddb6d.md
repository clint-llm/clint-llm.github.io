The most effective intervention for dust mite allergy is primary prevention, that is allergen avoidance. This can be achieved by reducing the levels of mite allergens.

Measures for allergen avoidance in the bedroom

- Covering of mattresses and pillows with fine woven fabric or plastic. These prevent the penetration of the house dust mites.

- Hot washing of bedding, at least once a week in hot water (130 - 140°F), bedding can also be frozen overnight to kill dust mites.

- Removal of carpets and drapes

- Room air cleaner with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. These filters can remove up to  99.7% of particles as small as 0.1 microns.

Measures for allergen avoidance in the whole house

- Humidity control to 45 percent humidity or less

- Vacuum cleaning. They reduce dust disturbances. Dust disturbances include moving furniture, throw pillows, drapes, or bedding that can make mite allergens airborne, thus increasing exposure.

- Cross ventilation

- Use of acaricides, which is a chemical to kill the house dust mites in the house.

Over the counter medications. These provide symptomatic relief to the allergic manifestations.

- Antihistamines

- Nasal corticosteroids

- Leukotriene receptor antagonists

- Cromolyn sodium (mast cell stabilizers)

- Decongestants

Nonpharmacological measures. These are safe, effective, and convenient modalities to help manage symptoms of dust mite allergy. Their use as an adjunctive helps to reduce the use of pharmacological drugs.

- Saline nasal irrigation

- Saline nasal sprays

HDM allergen immunotherapy (AIT). This is also known as desensitization. AIT has been in use for achieving clinical tolerance to allergens through the administration of allergen extracts to the sensitized individual. It is effective in the treatment of Type I allergic diseases induced by IgE in terms of alleviating the clinical manifestations of allergic rhinitis and asthma, reducing the use of symptom-relieving medication, and improving the quality of life. It provides an effective improvement in clinical symptoms, reduces the need for rescue medications, improves lung function, and brings about intrinsic disease-modifying effects such that the allergic inception of asthma and new sensitizations can be completely or partially abrogated. The effects persist for years after therapy discontinuation.

- Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT).

- Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT). It is an effective alternative to SCIT. The immune responses include the induction of circulating, allergen-specific Th1, and regulatory CD4+ T cells that lead to clinical tolerance.

- Alternative routes include oral, nasal, epicutaneous, bronchial, and intra-lymphatic. Many of these routes have been tried and attempted but abandoned due to increased adverse effects or difficult administration.

- Allergy specific immunotherapy (AIT). This therapy is based on recombinant allergens, rather than on allergen extracts. Modified dust-mite allergens that are hypoallergenic derivatives of group 1 and group 2 have been developed. This is promising towards better efficacy, lesser adverse effects, and better administration, as compared with immunotherapy using allergic extracts. Using a combination of hypoallergenic groups 1 and 2, efforts are being made to develop vaccines.

Treatment of asthma. It depends on the severity of asthma. Short-term relief is provided through short-acting beta-agonists (SABA). The long term relief is provided by anticholinergics, long-acting beta-agonists (LABA), and low dose inhaled corticosteroids. Oral corticosteroids are used in acute exacerbations of asthma. Leukotriene antagonists and mast cell stabilizers may be useful.
