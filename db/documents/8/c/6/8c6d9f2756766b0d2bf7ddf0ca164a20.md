A historical review of radiation studies that are important from the perspective of managing STS of extremities and trunk is necessary. Please be aware that these studies do not apply to visceral and retroperitoneal sarcomas.

**Establishing Adjuvant RT as the Standard of Care**

- **1982**- National Cancer Institute (NCI) study- randomized 43 patients to amputation or limb salvage surgery (LSS) followed by adjuvant RT and concurrent chemotherapy.
- The disease-free survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) at five years were similar.
- Although four local recurrences (out of 27 patients) occurred in the LSS group, the trend was insignificant compared to amputation (p-0.06).
- Distant metastasis was more common with amputation alone.
- After this study, the rates of amputation fell below 10%.

- **1996**- Randomized trial exploring the role of brachytherapy (BRT) in 164 patients undergoing LSS.
- The patients were randomized to receive brachytherapy via an intraoperatively placed catheter versus no local or systemic treatment.
- The results were significantly in favor of patients with high-grade STS who received BRT (5 local recurrences out of 56 patients in the BRT group versus 19 local recurrences out of 63 patients in the control arm, P = 0.025).

- **1998**- The NCI trial was a follow-up to the previous trial. It examined the need for adjuvant RT in patients receiving LSS.
- Ninety-one patients with high-grade STS and 50 patients with low-grade STS were randomized to receive five cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy and RT (44 and 26, respectively) versus chemotherapy alone.
- At the nine-year follow-ups, only one patient (out of 26) in the low-grade STS group and none in the high-grade STS group experienced a local relapse.
- On the contrary, in the chemotherapy group, nine patients in the high-grade STS and eight patients in the low-grade STS group experienced local release (P<0.05 for both groups).
- No difference in the OS and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) was noted at the end of 10 years.

The three trials listed above established postoperative adjuvant RT as the standard of care for patients with STS of the extremity or trunk. However, the OS benefit with RT alone remains controversial for patients receiving LSS.

**Preoperative versus Postoperative RT**

- **2002**- NCI Canada (NCIC) leads the SR2 trial examining the question of preoperative versus postoperative RT in patients with STS.
- Patients receiving preoperative RT will be operated upon within 3 to 6 weeks.
- Patients will receive a boost of 16-20 Gy in the event of a positive margin.
- The trial was closed early due to a higher number of wound complications in patients undergoing preoperative RT
- No differences were noted in the local, locoregional, distant failure, and progression-free survival

- **2007-**In a select group of patients [those with intermediate to high-grade T1a STS (<5 cm in size)], the need for adjuvant RT can be obviated provided the preoperative biopsy identifies the histology correctly and the surgery results in an R0 margin.

**Image-guided IMRT**

-  **2013**- NCIC phase II study to explore the utility of IMRT.
- Introduced the concept of 'virtual skin flaps'- These are contours designed according to the anticipated suture closure lines
- Primary closure of the wound was significantly higher with IMRT compared to NCIC SR2 data

- **2015-**Phase II RTOG 0630 evaluated preoperative RT with image guidance and reduced margins. The primary endpoint was late 2-year toxicity.
- 10.5% of patients experienced grade 2 or later toxicity compared to 37% of patients in the NCIC trial.

**Retroperitoneal Soft-tissue Sarcomas**

The EORTC-62092: STRASS trial was a Phase III trial randomizing patients with retroperitoneal sarcomas between preoperative RT followed by surgery versus surgery alone with a primary endpoint of abdominal recurrence-free survival (RFS).

- Two hundred sixty-six patients enrolled, with 133 assigned to each group. The majority of patients were diagnosed with either liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma.

- The study excluded patients with GIST, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, small round blue cell tumors, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, aggressive fibromatosis, or sarcomatoid or metastatic sarcoma.

- The median abdominal RFS was 5.0 years for those who received surgery only compared to 4.5 years for those who received surgery and preop-RT. (P- 0.95).

- Post-hoc analysis according to different histopathology showed that specific tumor types may still benefit from preop RT and surgery.
