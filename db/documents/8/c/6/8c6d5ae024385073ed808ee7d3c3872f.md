The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a non-invasive tool for the assessment of vascular status. It consists of the ratio between the systolic blood pressure of the lower extremity, specifically the ankle, and the upper extremity. This ratio compares the resistance of the blood vessels, with one of the primary factors being the diameter of the vessels. This diameter is narrowed either from internal factors (plaque, intimal tear) or external factors such as compression by soft tissues. The activity reviews the noninvasive diagnostic procedure: the ankle-brachial index. It reviews the role of health care providers in using the tool for screening, diagnosis, treatment, and guidance for patients with various vascular-related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Explain how ABI is useful in various clinical situations in both the acute trauma setting and the chronic clinical setting.
- Review the differences between normal and abnormal values for ABI
- Identify the steps for an appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of arterial insufficiency.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance and improve outcomes using ABI as a diagnostic tool.
