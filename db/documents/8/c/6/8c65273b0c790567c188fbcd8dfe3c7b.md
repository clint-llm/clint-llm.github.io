**Structure of the Femoral Triangle**

- Superior border - inguinal ligament

- Medial border - adductor longus muscle

- Lateral border - sartorius muscle

- Medial floor - adductor longus and pectineus muscles

- Lateral floor - iliopsoas muscle

- Roof - (from superficial to deep) skin, subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and fascia lata

- Internal structures - (from lateral to medial) femoral nerve, femoral artery, femoral vein, deep inguinal lymph nodes, and associated lymphatic vessels

**Function of the Femoral Triangle**

The femoral triangle itself does not have an intrinsic function but contains many vital structures that can be located quickly using the landmarks of the femoral triangle. The muscles that form the borders of the triangle also allow many different movements.
