Apraxia is a neurological disorder affecting motor function, planning, and task performance, in the absence of apparent neurological insult to motor, sensory, or comprehension. It can result from various types of brain lesions, including stroke, dementia, tumors, neurocognitive disorders, and brain injuries. Identification and diagnosis of apraxia are primarily clinical and with little consensus. A thorough understanding of neuroanatomy, neural pathways, and physiology, along with a complete physical exam, is required for evaluating and managing the disease. Management of the underlying disorder and associated supportive measures is the treatment modality. Early identification of apraxia can help the patient with activities of daily living (ADL). This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, clinical assessment, evaluation, treatment, and management of complications of apraxia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathogenesis of apraxia.
- Review the different types of apraxias.
- Summarize the evaluation steps to differentiate the various types of apraxias.
- Outline the short and long-term management of apraxia and its complications.
