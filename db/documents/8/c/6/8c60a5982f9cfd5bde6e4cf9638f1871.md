A skin biopsy is not required to confirm a diagnosis, but if it is performed, histological findings include hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and a mild superficial, perivascular infiltrate in the dermis. Fungal elements are localized almost exclusively within the stratum corneum and can often be visualized even in sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Both spores and hyphae of Malassezia are present and are often likened to spaghetti and meatballs. Periodic acid-Schiff stain may improve recognition of the fungus.
