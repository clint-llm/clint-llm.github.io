Managing insomnia and zolpidem use requires an interprofessional team approach of healthcare professionals, including pharmacists, therapists, nurses, and clinicians (MD, DO, NP, PA). [Level 5] Prescribers should consider the possibility of addiction and withdrawal symptoms when starting patients on zolpidem. Without proper management, significant drug-drug interactions may occur. For example, CNS depression is increased with the combination of opiates, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, or alcohol. Because the drug has the potential to cause dependence, it should not be prescribed for long periods, and the team should coordinate monitoring for dependency concerns. In addition, the patient should be counseled by nurses and pharmacists to avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants when taking zolpidem. Nurses can verify dose and therapy duration before zolpidem administration, and pharmacists can perform medication reconciliation to optimize the treatment with zolpidem and enhance patient outcomes.
