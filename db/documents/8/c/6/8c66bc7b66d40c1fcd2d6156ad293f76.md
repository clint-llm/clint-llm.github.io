Improving healthcare team outcomes in patients with atrial septal defects requires an interprofessional team with strong input from the patient's pediatrician, primary care physician and nurse practitioner. In most cases, ASD is first diagnosed by the primary provider and the patient referred to the cardiologist.

Adults and children with atrial septal defects require consistent follow up with cardiologists to monitor the heart structure, heart function, and the patient's hemodynamic status.

Asymptomatic patients should be followed by the clinicians and the patient educated that elective closure will reduce the risk of pulmonary hypertension.

When a patient requires intervention, cardiac interventionists and thoracic surgeons with experience caring for children and adults with congenital heart disease provide the best outcomes for patients with congenital heart disease.

Due to the challenges of the disease, and family concerns, it is important for the nurse to assist with family education. The family must be taught about the signs and symptoms of complications and when the patient should return for further evaluation. The nurse should assist in making sure the patient has regular follow-up appointments. In followup after the procedure, the nurse should monitor the patient for changes in vital signs and any development of a new murmur or insidious unexplained fever. Open communication between the interprofessional team is recommended to ensure the best outcomes with minimal complications.

**Outcomes**

If the ASD is closed, the outcomes are excellent; however, if the ASD is not treated, patients may develop arrhythmias and pulmonary hypertension with poor outcomes.
