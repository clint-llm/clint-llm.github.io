The main priority is the patients' safety. Such alterations not only increase the stress upon the patient, but patients can be at risk of falls, injuries, and perhaps can be a danger to themselves or to others due to their violent behaviors. The management and interventions depend upon the cause of sensory and perceptual disturbances. Hence careful evaluation is needed to ascertain the cause while assisting the patient and preventing them from any further distress or injuries.

The patient can be supported to be re-oriented to time, place, and person. This can be done by engaging the patient in a conversation about the current news, weather, or asking them about their hobbies or experiences. They should be frequently monitored and settled in a comfortable environment that is devoid of excessive stimuli (bright lights, noises within the ICU).

Patients who are visually impaired can be provided with corrective lenses and reading material in large print or braille. Conversations should be carried out at the patient's eye level and within their field of vision. The surrounding environment should be organized, and they should be aware of where their items are placed. Patients with hearing deficits should be provided with their hearing devices. To ensure effective communication, the environment should be noise-free. The written form of communication or sign language may be facilitated to aid in communication.

To treat or prevent ICU delirium, a multicomponent intervention should be adapted. This includes both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.

Non-pharmacological intervention to prevent and manage delirium in the ICU includes:

- The use of earplugs and eye masks

- Noise control strategies and music therapy

- Bright light therapy

- Cognitively stimulating activities

- Medication review

Providing adequate sleep in terms of length and quality is necessary to prevent sleep deprivation, and thus delirium in patients admitted to the ICU. Improving sleep hygiene has been associated with a decreased risk of delirium.

Auditory hallucinations due to mental health problems such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, post-traumatic stress, and dementia can be assessed by clinical observation or by talking to the patients. The patient may say that they are hearing voices, or the clinician may see the patient talking to themselves. Apart from a full assessment to identify the specific cause, the patient can be managed with medications, cognitive-behavioral therapies, or with a psychotherapist. Visual hallucinations due to mental health problems, sleep disorders, or substance misuse should be managed according to the cause with appropriate medications to treat the cause along with cognitive-behavioral therapies or wit a psychotherapist. Similarly, other hallucinations can affect smell and taste and will need appropriate supportive therapy.
