**Stenosis**

Subclavian vein stenosis is a narrowing of the subclavian vein, presenting with variable symptoms ranging from asymptomatic, to arm swelling, pain, paresthesia, neck pain, or an occipital headache. Stenosis of the subclavian vein can arise from many intrinsic or extrinsic causes and can be further complicated by the development of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (see below). Intrinsic causes of stenosis include previous intravenous catheterization, such as hemodialysis catheters, central venous catheters, or hemodialysis-related subclavian vein stenosis from intimal hyperplasia secondary to an increase in turbulent blood flow from a created arteriovenous fistula. Extrinsic causes of stenosis include entrapment between the clavicle and first rib (costoclavicular space), termed costoclavicular syndrome, Paget-Schrotter syndrome (PSS), regional tumors, lymphadenopathy, trauma, or mediastinal inflammatory pseudotumor. Costoclavicular syndrome is one of the three types of thoracic outlet syndrome and is the most common site for subclavian vein compression. It can be caused by depression of the clavicle toward the first rib, a tight subclavius muscle, congenital anomalies in the thoracic outlet, trauma, or tight clothing/straps over the area. This condition is characterized by spontaneous swelling of the entire arm, often with cyanotic discoloration, heaviness, and pain. Unilateral upper extremity swelling caused by subclavian vein obstruction without an underlying thrombosis is an uncommon form of thoracic outlet syndrome and should be considered in the patient with unilateral arm swelling in the setting of no lymphatic obstruction. Diagnosis is made with contrast venography, and plain radiography of the neck and chest with the cervical spine or thoracic inlet views can help demonstrate bony abnormalities that can aid in the diagnosis. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and physical examination, but conservative treatment with anticoagulation and extremity elevation often results in chronic venous congestion. Therefore, depending on the clinical scenario and presence or absence of an underlying thrombosis in addition to the venous stenosis, surgical thoracic outlet decompression and/or catheter-based thrombolytic therapy are the mainstay of treatment. Surgical treatment comprises trans axillary or para-clavicular first-rib resection, with potential balloon angioplasty or direct venous reconstruction if there is a residual subclavian vein obstruction.

**Deep Vein Thrombosis**

With the increased use of central venous catheters, DVT of the upper extremities are becoming more prevalent, especially involving the subclavian, brachial, and axillary veins. There is an incidence of about 5% to 10% of upper extremity DVT's out of all DVT's, with the incidence rising each year. There are two subsets of upper extremity DVT's: primary and secondary. The primary DVT subset is known as Paget-Schretter syndrome (PSS) and most typically occurs in the dominant upper extremity of young athletes that perform excessive and repeated motions of the upper extremity (gymnastics, wrestling, swimming, sports that require repetitive ball throwing such as football, baseball, basketball). The secondary subset commonly occurs in patients with central venous catheterization in place or patients with an underlying malignancy. The rate of upper extremity DVT in patients with central venous catheters are about 14% to 23%, and pulmonary embolisms arise in up to 6% of all DVTs affecting the upper extremities. In PSS, the repetitive motions of the upper extremity result in hypertrophy of the scalene muscles, which leads to compression of the neurovascular bundle as it exits the thorax between the cervical rib and musculature. Repetitive compression of the subclavian vein over time leads to venous stasis, microtrauma of the vein activating the intrinsic coagulation pathway, setting up for thrombosis. In the secondary form, the catheterization itself disrupts the endothelial lining, activating the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Most patients with an upper extremity DVT will present with limb swelling, arm discomfort, or arm heaviness. A patient with an upper extremity DVT resulting in a PE may also present with cardinal signs of PE including but not limited to tachycardia, chest pain, or shortness of breath.  The physical examination may also show erythema in the upper extremity with visible veins across the chest and upper limb (Urschel's sign). In PSS, patients often will present with more sudden onset of severe limb pain and swelling in the dominant arm. Assessment of the distal pulses bilaterally is important. Limbs that appear pale, cool, or mottled are at an increased risk for limb ischemia. Documentation of any motor or sensory defects is also important components of the physical exam. Diagnosis is confirmed with compression duplex ultrasonography, which has a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 96% in diagnosing DVT in the upper extremity and is the gold standard in imaging diagnosis. Magnetic resonance and computed tomographic venography are superior to ultrasonography in diagnosis. However, their clinical utility can be limited by cost, radiation exposure, and/or availability in the facility. In patients suspected of having an underlying hypercoagulable condition, coagulation assays can be ordered. In patients with a low clinical suspicion of DVT, a d-dimer test can rule-out the diagnosis. The treatment of the DVT depends on the clinical scenario and patient. If the patient has a central venous catheter in place, the American College of Chest Physicians recommends the provider determining the necessity of the line, and if it is required, it should remain in place, and anticoagulation therapy should begin. If the catheter is not needed, the patient can undergo removal of the catheter after 3 to 5 days of anticoagulation therapy. Each patient should continue on warfarin for 3 to 6 months after diagnosis and initial bridging with heparin. In PSS, often urgent surgical intervention is needed in the setting of acute thrombosis.
