Women will often present with a chief complaint similar to other sexually transmitted infections, including vaginal discharge, painful intercourse, urinary tract infection symptoms, vaginal itching, or pelvic pain. Men may be asymptomatic, or on occasion, they may present with symptoms including penile discharge, testicular pain, dysuria, urinary frequency, or cloudy urine. Trichomoniasis can cause urethritis in men and occasionally epididymitis or prostatitis.

Critical questions to ask when gathering a history include past treatment for STIs, condom use with intercourse, and the presence of foul-smelling discharge.

A physical exam will often include a pelvic exam for women and a urethral swab for men.

A vaginal discharge is common in women; the discharge is thin, frothy, and has an abnormal odor. The genitals are often red and edematous. A strawberry cervix is seen in about 40% of patients. Palpation of the pelvis may reveal mild tenderness.
