The suboccipital muscles are a group of four muscles located in the posterior region of the neck, inferior to the occipital bone. These four muscles are the rectus capitis posterior major, rectus capitis posterior minor, obliquus capitis superior, and obliquus capitis inferior. The muscles serve as postural support of the head and neck and allow extension and rotation movements of the neck. The muscles are innervated by the suboccipital nerve, which is formed by the dorsal ramus of C1. Three of the four muscles form the suboccipital triangle, a common anatomic landmark that localizes the vertebral artery and suboccipital nerve. This landmark is particularly important to surgeons operating in the posterior cervical region to avoid life-threatening bleeding.

The vertebral artery takes a torturous course behind the suboccipital muscles while giving off branches that supply the suboccipital muscles. Clinically, the suboccipital muscles have importance regarding their close relationship to the vertebral artery and surgical access to the posterior cranial fossa. Various cranial pathologies can be accessed by a suboccipital surgical approach that requires knowledge of the posterior cervical region. The group of four muscles has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cervicogenic headaches due to their connections with the dura mater.
