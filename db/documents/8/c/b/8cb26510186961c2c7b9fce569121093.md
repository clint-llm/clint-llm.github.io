The primary indication of vaginal and vulvar reconstruction is to restore the structure, body image, sexual function, and integrity of the genitalia and pelvic floor. This most commonly happens after colorectal or gynecologic cancer resection. Treatment for these types of cancer varies from chemotherapy, radiation, and surgical excision.

Surgical treatments for these types of lesions include pelvic exoneration, abdominoperineal resection, vulvectomy, and vaginectomy. These complex wounds are often unable to heal on their own or after primary closure and benefit from flap reconstruction. Flap reconstruction of pelvic defects has been shown to decrease perineal wound morbidity secondary to the obliteration of dead space and the addition of a new healthy blood supply to the wound bed.
