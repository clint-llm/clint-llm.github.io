Studies have shown that biopsies of meninges typically appear normal in patients with ICH. In acute cases, abnormal histopathological findings suggest meningeal reaction and hyperplasia of arachnoid cells. This reaction becomes more pronounced in patients with persistent symptoms. It is believed that the proliferation of the arachnoid cells occurs secondary to chronic venous hypervolemia and changes within layers of the deep dura during ICH. In one report, seven patients with spontaneous ICH underwent meningeal biopsy, one revealed: "non-specific inflammation."
