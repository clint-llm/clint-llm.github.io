The umbilical vein is easier to sample due to its large diameter. However, umbilical artery blood gas analysis gives more accurate information about the fetal metabolic condition and correlates better with neonatal outcomes.

Oxygenated blood is carried from the placenta to the fetus through the umbilical vein, whereas blood rich in carbon dioxide eliminated by the fetus returns to the placental circulation through the umbilical arteries. Consequently, venous cord blood gas analysis mainly reflects placental metabolism, whereas arterial sampling more accurately reflects fetal metabolism.

Veins are more compressible than arteries. Thus, in umbilical cord compression, venous flow from the placenta to the fetus decreases more than arterial flow. To meet their metabolic demands, fetal tissues will respond by increasing their extraction of oxygen. Consequently, there is more carbon dioxide eliminated through the umbilical arteries, which renders the arterial cord blood more acidotic, while the umbilical venous acid-base status remains equilibrated by the normally functioning placenta. The severity of cord compression has aÂ significant effect on the arteriovenous pH difference. Thus, it is always essential to obtain both venous and arterial blood samples for analysis.
