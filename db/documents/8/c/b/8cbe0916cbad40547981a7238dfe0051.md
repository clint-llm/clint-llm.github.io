Surgical excision is the treatment of choice. Numerous studies have shown the traditional 0.5 cm surgical margins for MIS to be inadequate for LM, with approximately half of tumors requiring larger margins for clearance and recurrence rates between 8 to 20%.

For patients who wish to avoid surgery or would otherwise be poor surgical candidates, topical imiquimod 5% cream may be a viable alternative, although the data on efficacy is mixed. Clinical and histologic clearance rates for imiquimod range between 46 to 78% and 37 to 76%, respectively.
