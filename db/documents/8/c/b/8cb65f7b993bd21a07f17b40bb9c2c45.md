Polycythemia can affect every organ in the body, and the symptoms are primarily related to impaired oxygen delivery and blood hyperviscosity. The condition is primarily managed by the hematologist, but managing complications requires anÂ interprofessional team comprised of clinicians, specialists, nursing staff, pharmacists, and phlebotomists. Patients need to be educated by clinicians about the potential complications and when to seek medical assistance. Pharmacists will help manage medication regimens, verify dosing, check for interactions, and offer patients medication counseling. Nurses will assist in patient evaluation, counsel patients about their condition, answer patient questions, and serve as coordinators for the activities of the various disciplines covering the case. The interprofessional model requires open communication among all care team members, including accurate record-keeping. This approach will result in improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]

The nursing staff should coordinate and monitor close follow-up and assist in educating the patient and family to ensure regular care is obtained.
