Single small lesions are excisable, followed by antifungal therapy. If surgery is not feasible, oral antifungals alone are an option. The antifungal drugs of choice are; itraconazole 200 to 400 mg/day or terbinafine, 250Â to 500 mg/day given for a period varying from 6 months to a year or more. Flucytosine alone or combined with amphotericin also may be effective. Oral supersaturated potassium iodide solution is another choice. Other approaches to treatment are cryotherapy or local application of heat.
