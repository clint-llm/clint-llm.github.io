Each somatic cell possesses multiple and variable copies of the same mitochondrial DNA or genome. This mitochondrial DNA is also damaged to different degrees with the aging of cells. Like any mitochondrial disorder, MELAS exhibits heteroplasmy or a variation in the types of mitochondrial DNA found in different tissues in the same person. It is common for genetic mutations only to affect some mitochondria, which leads to a variable appearance of diseased mitochondria in different tissues in the same person. This phenomenon explains the wide variability in the presentation of different tissues within an individual and also presentation among different patients with the same diagnosis. This also has implications for diagnosis, as occasionally serum and urine studies may be negative if those cell lines are unaffected, making it necessary to perform muscle biopsy to examine affected tissue.

Mitochondrial disorders including MELAS affect mainly tissues with the highest metabolic activities. These include skeletal and heart muscles, brain, eye, and the inner ear. Due to the impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain function and oxidative phosphorylation, the increased anaerobic glycolytic activities will lead to increased lactic acid during acute attacks.
