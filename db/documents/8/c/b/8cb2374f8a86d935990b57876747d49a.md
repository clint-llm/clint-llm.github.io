Features in the epidermis can include spongiosis, interface change including vacuolar degeneration and dyskeratotic keratinocytes, and in the dermis, a lichenoid infiltrate, melanophages, and papillary dermal fibrosis.

Recent studies indicate that immunohistochemistry of the skin lesions will reveal localized deposits of complement factor 3, immunoglobulins, and fibrin within the basement membrane.
