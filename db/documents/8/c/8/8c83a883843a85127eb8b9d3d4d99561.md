Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), characterized by repeated or prolonged episodes of acute otitis media lasting for more than 12 weeks, can cause damage to the tympanic membrane (TM) and result in a non-healing perforation.

A subtype of CSOM is CSOM with cholesteatoma. Cholesteatomas are most commonly an acquired disease process occurring within the middle ear. They consist of a sac of squamous epithelium, usually in the attic and originating at the pars falccida of the TM, which can extend beyond the TM, eroding bone and thereby causing ossicular chain destruction.

Tympanoplasty is the surgical procedure performed to repair a perforated TM, with or without reconstruction of the ossicles (ossiculoplasty), aiming to prevent reinfection and restore hearing ability.

**Wullstein Classification**

Tympanoplasty can be classified into five types, according to the Wullstein classification.

- Type I: repair of the TM alone; no middle ear abnormality. Type I tympanoplasty is synonymous with myringoplasty

- Type II: repair of the TM and middle ear; the malleus is eroded. Tympanoplasty involves grafting the TM to the incus

- Type III: repair of the TM onto the stapes head; the malleus and incus have a defect

- Type IV: the TM is grafted to the stapes footplate, which is movable

- Type V: repair involves the stapes footplate, which is fixed
