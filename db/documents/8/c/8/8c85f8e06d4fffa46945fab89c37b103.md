On gross examination, affected adrenal glands appear small and atrophied. Histological findings at the microscopic level consist of nodular swelling affecting mainly the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis. Celluar vacuoles and clefts may be visible as well. The medulla is usually spared and appears normal.

Central nervous system pathological findings in ALD consist of symmetrical demyelination of the white matter. These effects commonly occur in the corpus callosum and the occipitoparietal region. In severe cases, the spinal cord may get affected. At the cellular level, swelling and vacuolization are caused by infiltrates of active inflammatory cells ( macrophages and astrocytes). These changes usually result in the loss of the myelin sheets, oligodendrocytes, and neuronal axons. Ultimately dystrophic mineralization is seen on the histological examination.
