The tibialis posterior muscle, a muscle of the posterior compartment of the lower limb, is formed beginning at four weeks of gestation as a primary limb bud. Limb buds begin as undifferentiated mesenchyme (mesoderm) with an epithelial (ectoderm) covering; they are paddle-shaped structures that grow outwards gradually under the influence of local growth factors. By eight weeks of gestation, the skeletal muscle that derives from somites at the level of the limb buds is well-formed.
