Drug resistance is a challenge for the global control of tuberculosis. A multicentre cohort study was done in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria, Peru, South Africa, and Thailand. Patients were stratified by tuberculosis drug resistance and HIV status. Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing was performed locally. The researchers examined mortality during treatment considering drug susceptibility test results and multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, HIV status, and sputum microscopy.

The results showed that inaccurate drug susceptibility testing leads to under-treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis as well as increased mortality. Rapid molecular drug susceptibility test is required to improve outcomes in patients with MDR tuberculosis. This study showed that 163 (26%) of MDR microorganisms were isolated.

M. leprae drug resistance could affect leprosy treatment success. Studying M. leprae efflux pumps as targets for drug development will enhance the global efforts to eradicate endemic leprosy, and stop the emergence of drug resistance in endemic countries.
