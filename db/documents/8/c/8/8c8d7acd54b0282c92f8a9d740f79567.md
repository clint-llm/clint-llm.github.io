Complications that arise from coronary interventionÂ can vary from minor to major, depending on their hemodynamic significance. The most common complication of coronary intervention is access site bleeding. Due to a large amount of anticoagulation given and the occasional need for large bore access, access site complications (hematoma, pseudoaneurysms, dissection, etc.) can arise and most commonly result in transfemoral access. Additional complications seen are contrast-induced nephropathy, vessel dissection or perforation, acute cerebrovascular accident or other embolic phenomena, myocardial infarction, need for emergent cardiothoracic surgery, and rarely death. The rates of complications vary by center and operator volume; however, for the most part, the risk of the procedure is generally low (between 1 to 2%), and the benefit of the procedure far outweigh the risk.
