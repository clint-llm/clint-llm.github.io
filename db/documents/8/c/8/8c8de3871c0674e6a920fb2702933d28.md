**Imaging**

Radiographs of the entire extremity, including the joints proximal and distal to the suspected injury, should be obtained when patients are hemodynamically stable to characterize the injury. Femur fractures are rarely a life or death emergency despite their associated impressive deformities. Traction views can help with characterizing the fracture pattern; however, this is very painful for the patient, and pain control is necessary before any manipulation. Contralateral femur films may be considered for pre-operative planning and templating.

At the time of planning for treatment, CT with coronal and sagittal reconstruction is recommended for complex fractures, fractures with intra-articular extension, and assessment for osteochondral fragments in the intercondylar notch. CT is a strong recommendation to asses for the Hoffa fracture, which is an intra-articular distal femoral fracture in the coronal plane that most commonly involves the lateral condyle with an incidence of 38.1%.

CT angiography is indicated in the setting of decreased ipsilateral distal pulses despite re-alignment or distal pulses present with ABI below 0.90.

**Classification**

Classification of distal femur fractures may be descriptive, including extra-articular, intra-articular unicondylar, intra-condylar bicondylar, and pattern of fracture, including the degree of comminution.

The most commonly used fracture classification system used is the****Orthopaedic Trauma Association classification.

**The Orthopaedic Trauma Association Classification**

**33A - Extra-articular**

- A1 - simple

- A2 - metaphyseal wedge

- A3 - metaphyseal complex

**33B - Partial articular (a portion of the articular surface remains attached to the proximal shaft)**

- B1 - lateral condyle

- B2 - medial condyle

- B3 - coronal plane (Hoffa fragment)

**33C - Complete articular (articular fragment separated from the shaft)**

- C1 – simple articular, simple metaphyseal

- C2 – simple articular, metaphyseal comminution

- C3 - metaphyseal and intra-articular comminution
