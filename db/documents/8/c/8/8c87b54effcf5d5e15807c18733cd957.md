Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a congenital pediatric cardiac defect arising from an embryological discordance between the aorta and pulmonary trunk. Consequently, the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk arises from the left ventricle thus creating two parallel circuits incompatible with life. Early diagnosis and treatment of TGA is paramount to the prognosis of the patient. This activity illustrates the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of patients with transposition of the great arteries. In addition, it highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing and treating these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and of transposition of the great arteries.
- Describe the pathophysiology of transposition of the great arteries.
- Summarize the treatment options for transposition of the great arteries.
- Explain why careful planning and discussion amongst interprofessional team members involved in the management of patients with transposition of the great arteries will improve outcomes.
