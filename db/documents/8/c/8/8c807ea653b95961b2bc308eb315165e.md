Complications in ECT, although rare, do occur. The anesthetic provider should be monitoring the patient at all times. The most common side effects of ECTs are headaches and cognitive impairment.

Upon induction of general anesthesia and muscle relaxation, it may be difficult to mask ventilate the patient. Depending on which medications were used, letting the patient wake up and return to spontaneous ventilation may be the best option. Endotracheal intubation may be required to prevent severe hypoxia.

During recovery in the post-anesthesia care unit, myocardial infarction, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke are possible. Evaluation by cardiology or neurology should be implemented if these conditions are noticed. Patients emerging from anesthesia may also become agitated and experience pain. Postictal side effects such as paralysis or mania are also possible.

Patients with deep brain stimulators or cardiac devices require special considerations. Deep brain stimulators can cause electrical interference when inducing a generalized seizure and should thus be turned off. A physician specialized in deep brain stimulation should be consulted.
