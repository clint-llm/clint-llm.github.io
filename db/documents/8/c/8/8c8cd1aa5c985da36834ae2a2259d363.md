Cervical dislocations can occur in two locations; axial, consisting of the occipitocervical (occiput/C1) and atlantoaxial articulation (C1/C2), and subaxial, which includes from C2/C3 to C7/T1. Acquired instability causing dislocations can occur in the axial spine and can be seen in the pediatric population. However, The majority of these dislocations are secondary to a traumatic event, and about 75% occur in the subaxial spine.
