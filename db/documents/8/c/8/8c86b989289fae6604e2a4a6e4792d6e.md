**Boyle’s Law**

Boyle’s law or Boyle–Mariotte law or Mariotte's law (especially in France) takes the name of Robert Boyle (1627–1691) and is based on the research of Richard Towneley (1629-1707) and Henry Power (1623–1668). It states that at a constant temperature, the pressure is inversely proportional to volume:

- P alpha 1/V or P·V = k, where k is a constant and is dependent on the temperature.

NB: alpha means 'is proportional to.'

For the same gas under different conditions at the same temperature, it can also be expressed as:

- P1·V1 = P2·V2

**Charles’ Law**

Charles’s law, discovered by Jacques Charles (1746-1823) in 1787 and refined by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1778-1850) in 1808, states that at constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to absolute temperature, for a fixed mass of a gas:

- V alpha T, which can also be stated as V/T = k, where k is a constant, and similarly, V1/T1 = V2/T2

**Gay-Lussac’s Law**

Gay-Lussac’s Law or Third Gas Law states that for a constant volume, the pressure is directly proportional to absolute temperature:

- P alpha T; also stated as P/T = K, where K is a constant, and similarly, P1/T1 = P2/T2

Those three laws can be mathematically combined and expressed as:

- P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2

In addition to the three fundamental laws, other gas laws must be considered.

**Avogadro's Law**

Equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of molecules (6.023·10^23, Avogadro’s number). In other words, the volume occupied by an ideal gas is proportional to the number of moles of gas and the molar volume of an ideal gas (the space occupied by 1 mole of the "ideal" gas) is 22.4 liters at standard temperature and pressure.

**Ideal Gas Law**

The ideal gas law is a combination of Boyle’s law, Charles’s law, Gay-Lussac’s law, and Avogadro’s law:

- P·V = n·R·T

n is the number of moles of the gas (mol), R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/(K·mol), or 0.820 (L·atm)/(K·mol)), T is the absolute temperature (K), P is pressure, and V is volume.

**Dalton’s Law and Henry’s Law**

Dalton’s law of partial pressures states that, for a mixture of non-reacting gases, the sum of the partial pressure of each gas is equal to the total pressure exerted by the mixture, at constant temperature and volume:

- Ptotal= P1 + P2 + … Pz, or Ptotal= (n1·R·T1/V1) + (n2·R·T2/V2) + ... (nz·R·Tz/Vz)

Henry’s law states that for a constant temperature, the amount of dissolved gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas (in contact with its surface). This relationship is no longer linear once a gas mixture is used, due to stabilization and destabilization effects on solubility

- P = K·M, where P is the partial pressure of the gas, K­ is Henry’s constant of proportionality, and M is the molar concentration of the gas.

**Graham's Law**

The rate of diffusion (or effusion) of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of its particles. When a gas had particularly large particles (or is particularly dense), it will mix more slowly with other gases, and oozes more slowly from its containers.
