The differential diagnosis of CES includes various conditions that produce both microvascular ischemia of various organs and systemic inflammation. These include the small- to medium-vessel vasculitis (Takayasu disease, polyarteritis nodosa, Henoch-Schonlein purpura), antiphospholipid syndrome, infective endocarditis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, disseminated intravascular coagulation, cryoglobulinemia, and left atrial myxoma. Cancer such as lymphoma and diseases such as polycythemia vera, pheochromocytoma, Raynaud phenomenon, and tuberculosis are other possible differentials. In specific cases where some contrast agents are used, and the patients develop renal failure because of CES, the most common differential diagnosis is radiocontrast nephropathy. Other potential differentials are rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, focal segmental glomerulonephritis, and hypertensive nephrosclerosis.
