A detailed clinical and physical examination and the laboratory and imaging studies are essential for the diagnosis of lymphoma. Laboratory data include Complete blood count with differential (CBC), comprehensive metabolic profile (CMP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), HIV and Hepatitis B and C serologies, and serum protein electrophoresis. CBC can show cellular atypia on smears as well as cytopenias. Patients with symptoms or at risk of central nervous system (CNS) involvement should have a lumbar puncture. HIV should be tested as B cell lymphomas can be an AIDS-defining illness. Besides, as the treatment involves significant immunosuppression, it requires consideration of the patientâ€™s HIV and hepatitis status. Renal involvement can be seen by up to 14% of the patients. LDH is elevated in more than 50% of the cases. LDH is a predictor of survival.

Excisional biopsy of the lymph node is preferred over fine-needle aspiration (FNA) to look for the entire architecture of the node along with the histologic and immunologic studies. The morphology and immunophenotyping, along with staining for B-cell markers, are needed for the diagnosis. Imaging of choice includes positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) for staging the disease. PET is useful in most B cell lymphomas, as the sites with high standardized uptake value (SUV) may indicate aggressive disease. PET scan is less useful in CLL, as it is fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) nonavid.
