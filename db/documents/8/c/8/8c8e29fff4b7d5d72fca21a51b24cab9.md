Metoprolol is an effective beta-blocker for many cardiac disorders. However, prescribers of this drug should be aware that specific indications for this drug are still lacking. While research has shown the drug to lower mortality in CHF patients, the same applies to several other beta-blockers. To ensure the safe use of the drug, all membersÂ of the interprofessional healthcare team, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), specialists, nurses, and pharmacists, should be very familiar with the indications, administration, and potential adverse effects and drug interactions of metoprolol, as well as all members of the beta-blocker drug classification, including which agents are specific vs. beta-1 specific. This will result in improved patient outcomes with fewer adverse events. [Level 5]

Metoprolol can be administered orally or IV and works quickly.
