Over 200 million people have osteoporosis, and the incidence rate increases with age. Over 70% of those over age 80 are affected. It is more common in females than in males. In the developed world, 2% to 8% of males and 9% to 38% of females are affected. Worldwide, there are approximately 9 million fractures per year as a result of osteoporosis.

One in 3 females and 1 in 5 males over the age of 50 will have an osteoporotic fracture. Areas of the world with less vitamin D through sunlight than regions closer to the equator have higher fracture rates in comparison to people living at lower latitudes.
