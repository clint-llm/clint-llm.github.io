**Medical Treatment**

Medical treatment has a limited role in PPC management. Only syndromic patients with systemic involvement may need treatment with the help of a physician or other clinician. Pediatric patients presenting with PPC should be thoroughly evaluated for rare systemic syndromes. Kronenberg et al. reported PPC in patients with neurocutaneous syndrome. Similarly, Duke-Elder reported PPC in patients with ectodermal dysplasia, ichthyosis, scleroderma, dyskeratosis congenita, and Rothmund syndrome.

**Surgical Management**

**Indications for Surgery**

Excessive glare and photophobia, difficulty in reading fine prints, and difficulty in carrying out routine activities are all indications for surgery. Another indication is early type 1 and 2 PPC when the nucleus is soft, and the risk of complication is less. Pediatric PPC should be operated on as soon as possible to prevent the risk of blindness.

**Surgery of Choice**

Phacoemulsification and manual small incision cataract surgery are the surgical techniques commonly employed for PPC management based on patient affordability, surgeons' expertise, and indication for surgery.

In contrast, Das et al. showed that the rate of complications was more with ECCE. Hence phacoemulsification is the surgery of choice.

**Surgical Anesthesia**

In today's era, topical anesthesia is the anesthesia of choice for phacoemulsification. However, some surgeons prefer peribulbar or retrobulbar anesthesia depending on the density of PPC, patients' age, systemic comorbidities, patients' cooperation on the table, other eye conditions, confidence, and surgical expertise of the surgeon while operating PPC. Sometimes during topical anesthesia, the patient squeezes the lids, which contributes to positive vitreous pressure. Excessive vitreous pressure acts as an added risk factor for intraoperative PCR. A gentle massage post peribulbar or retrobulbar block is suggested to reduce vitreous pressure.

**Anterior Approach**

**Corneal Incision Placement**

The main corneal incision can be temporal or superior. The preferred incision is a temporal clear corneal 2.8 mm incision with two side port incisions. Consideration is given to straight clear corneal incision due to the ease of conversion to SICS or ECCE during posterior PCR. A straight clear corneal incision is easy to extend without causing trauma to the posterior cornea. The sclerocorneal incision helps reduce astigmatism and endothelial trauma.

**Ophthalmic Viscosurgical Devices ( Viscoelastic)**

The viscoelastic of choice is a dispersive one; it aids in corneal endothelial protection, tamponade the vitreous during vitrectomy, and viscodissection of the nucleus.

**Capsulorhexis**

Rhexis size should be about 5.5 mm to 6 mm for good sulcus support for IOL placement in the case of PCR. A small rhexis invites difficulty in delineation and phacoemulsification and also postoperative capsular phimosis, whereas a large rhexis helps in easy delineation and optic capture.

**Hydro Procedures**

As a general rule, hydrodissection is contraindicated in the case of PPC. The recommendation is for hydrodelineation by the inside-out technique. Some surgeons have also described multiple partial jets of hydrodissection while removing PPC, but it should be avoided ideally. Some surgeons prefer viscodissection for the separation of the nucleus from the epinucleus and cortex.

**Phacoemulsification and Dynamics**

A good interplay of appropriate pharmacodynamics is important for excellent outcomes in case of PPC cases. The ideal scenario is wound with a minimum leak, adequate vitreous pressure, and perfect phaco machine parameters. For soft PPC, lower energy settings are recommended with the torsional mode in recent newer phaco machines. Nucleus rotation is contraindicated in PPC to prevent PCR and zonular dialysis. A low vacuum with a lower aspiration flow rate is recommended. The nucleus should be emulsified before manipulating the PPC component, which prevents nucleus or cortex drop in the vitreous cavity in case of PCR.

Various techniques have been described, like pre-chopping and sculpt and chop to avoid stress and manipulation of PPC. The nuclear material removal is followed by epinucleus and cortical material. In the case of soft PPC, the nuclear material should be fed to the phaco probe with the help of sinskey or the chopper.

Doing this reduces tension on the central PPC component and also reduces the need to strip the cortical material under stress. Vacuum should be employed judiciously, as it can result in PCR. Dense nucleus material can be cracked into multiple small fragments and removed with minimal or no stress on the central component keeping the probe in the center. The epinucleus and cortical matter can be removed or freed leaflet by leaflet from the periphery to paracentral area avoiding stripping of the central PPC fragment. In most cases, the PPC comes in toto without compromising the integrity of the posterior capsule.

In case of a PCR, the dispersive viscoelastic and anterior vitrectomy should be ready to manage the vitreous prolapse. The other school of thought is removing the central PPC component with the help of a vitrectomy probe or by performing a posterior capsulotomy. After a thorough anterior vitrectomy. the IOL can be placed in the sulcus.

**Phacoemulsification Parameters**

The ideal parameters described for management for PPC are 60% power, a bottle height of 50-70 cm, the aspiration flow rate of 15 to 25 mL/min, and a minimal vacuum of 30 to 100 mm. These parameters prevent stress on the posterior capsule and help in a very stable anterior chamber.

**Nucleotomy Techniques**

**Phacoaspiration**

This process is recommended for soft PPC. While dealing with such a scenario, it is assumed that the posterior capsule is absent below the PPC.

**Phaco Chop**

This process is recommended for harder PPC plaques. Phaco chop help to reduce stress on the posterior capsule. It is important to avoid anterior chamber collapse as it can result in spontaneous posterior capsule rupture. Before withdrawing the phaco probe, the chamber should be filled with dispersive viscoelastic through the side port to prevent spontaneous rupture. Moreover, aggressive nuclear rotation, vigorous cracking maneuvers, and wider and deeper separation of fragments should be avoided to prevent PCR.

**Lambda Technique**

Lee et al. described the lambda technique where the nucleus is sculpted in a λ shape. This is followed by a crack along the arms and quadrant removal of the central piece. This technique prevents stretching and rupture of the capsule.

**Inverse Horseshoe Technique**

Salahuddin proposed this technique in which the distal portion of the nucleus is divided after sculpting. This is followed by OVD injection to elevate the two portions of the nucleus, thus forming a Visco shell. This technique helps in the hemi-dissection of the nucleus without the stretch of the posterior capsule. Later the individual nuclear fragments can be chopped and emulsified as usual.

**Epinucleus Pre-chop Technique**

Lim and Goh described a technique of pre-chopping the epinucleus without reaching the depth of the posterior capsule and epinuclear plate. This is helpful for hard PPCs where the nucleus can be quickly mobilized by separating it from the anterior epinucleus shell.

**Peripheral Crack Technique**

Chee described this technique for hard PPCs by partially cracking the nucleus in the periphery and further chopping the nuclear pieces in multiple quadrants without rotation. In this way, the posterior polar opacity is not manipulated, and the nucleus is separated from the outer nuclear shell with the help of the chopper.

**Reverse Flower Bloom Technique**

In this technique, first, the nuclear material is removed without disturbing the integrity of PPC.  In the second step, the cortical matter is peeled by the outside-in technique (mimicking a reverse blooming flower), leaving the PPC intact. In the last step, the poster polar attachment is separated gently from the capsule.

**Predivision Technique**

Kamoi and Mochizuki described this technique where a pre-chopper creates two pre-chops on both sides of the central part. This is followed by central fragment removal, thus creating space in the capsular bag to remove further fragments easily.

**Posterior Approach**

Pars plana lensectomy with vitrectomy has been described to prevent unwanted complications of PCR and nucleus drop. Few authors have also described the posterior approach through the pars plana route with variable outcomes. In a study of 11 eyes of 8 patients with this approach, three eyes developed posterior segment complications.

**Epinucleus Removal**

Vajpayee et al. described the layer by layer technique for removing epinuclear plate in cases of the pre-existing posterior capsular breach, which can be picked clinically or using ASOCT. While performing layer by layer removal of epinucleus, care should be taken to leave the central area untouched without undue stress on the posterior capsule. The PPC plaque can be easily viscodissected in the end.

In another technique by Fine et al., epinucleus can be removed by pure viscodissection without unnecessary pressure on the posterior capsule.

Nagappa et al. described loosening of the epinucleus by phacoaspiration in the quadrant opposite the wound. This is followed by the removal of the sub incisional cortex by loosening it with hydrodissection. They reasoned that the hydrodissection wave doesn't cause posterior capsular rupture because the fluid escapes the path of least resistance in the epinuclear free area. They also proposed that this technique would be contraindicated in cases of pre-existing PCR detected clinically or by ASOCT.

**Pseudohole Sign**

Sometimes after removing posterior polar opacity, the impression of the onion ring is seen on the posterior capsule. This impression gives the appearance of a hole, but since the posterior capsule is intact, it has been labeled as a "pseudohole sign." Nagappa et al. were the first to describe the "fish mouth sign" as the sign of posterior capsular rupture when vitreous prolapse is seen through the PPC defect.

**Cortex Aspiration**

The cortex removal should be performed with a bottle height of around 15 to 25 cc/min. The cortex should be pulled tangentially rather than the usual pulling centrally to avoid stress on zonules and prevent rupture of the posterior capsule. Vajpayee et al. proposed cortical removal by the "layer by layer "technique. In this technique, they described the removal of the cortex in a wedge-shaped manner and then separated with the help of a chopper; this prevents stress on the central plaque of PPC and prevents PCR. Another technique is the dry aspiration of the cortex with the help of Simcoe cannula (5 cc syringe) by filling the capsular bag with viscoelastic. It has also been proposed that capsular polishing should be avoided in these cases.

**Removal of the Posterior Polar Plaque**

The general rule is PPC plaque should be left untouched till the end of the surgery (cortical aspiration). At the last step, the plaque should be separated by viscodissection. The separated plaque then should be lifted and can be aspirated with the help of a phaco tip or by bimanual irrigation and aspiration. Another proposed technique is filling the capsular bag with viscoelastic and then dislodge the plaque with a sinskey hook. The separated plaque can then be easily removed with the help of forceps. This will avoid the drop of PPC plaque in the vitreous cavity. Osher described the technique of "minimal residual aspiration."

**Managing Posterior Capsular Tear**

Once the posterior capsular tear is noticed, viscoelastic must be injected before removing the phaco probe to form the anterior chamber and prevent disruption of the anterior vitreous face. Dispersive viscoelastic must be injected to tamponade the vitreous and seal the posterior capsular rent. If possible, the rent can be fashioned into a posterior capsulorhexis, and then the intraocular lens can be easily placed in the bag. In case of an irregular tear, the IOL can be placed in the sulcus after a thorough anterior vitrectomy.

**Anterior Vitrectomy**

Bimanual vitrectomy is recommended for cutting the anterior vitreous. High cut rate and low vacuum vitrectomy can be easily performed close to the rent. The vitrector is held in the dominant hand, and the infusion cannula should be held in the non-dominant hand directed towards the angle away from the rent. This helps to prevent vitreous hydration, vitreous prolapse, and enlargement of the tear.

**Intraocular Lens Implantation**

If the PCR is small, it can be converted to a round posterior capsulorhexis, and a single piece of IOL can be easily implanted in the capsular bag. If the PCR is large and irregular, a piece of IOL can be implanted in the ciliary sulcus, or an optic capture can be done. Optic capture helps in IOL stabilization and prevents iritis due to iridolenticular touch. Mackool, in his analysis, proposed that PMMA IOL is a better option than foldable IOL, as haptics of foldable IOL can stretch the PC and may enlarge the rent. In case of lack of adequate support for IOL, an ACIOL can be implanted or an iris-claw lens of a scleral fixated IOL.

**Viscoelastic Removal, Wound Hydration, and Anterior Chamber Formation**

Once the IOL has been implanted and is stable, viscoelastic should be thoroughly washed by irrigation and aspiration, and the incision should be hydrated. The anterior chamber should be formed with the self-sealing corneal incision. In case of PCR and vitreous prolapse and micro leaks, the main and side port incision should be sutured to prevent vitreous prolapse and endophthalmitis.
