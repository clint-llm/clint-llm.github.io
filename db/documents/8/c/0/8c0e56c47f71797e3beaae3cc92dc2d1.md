Postoperative splints are left in place for up to 10 days, depending on stability achieved and concurrent injuries. If both MCL and LCL were repaired, the splint should be positioned in flexion and neutral rotation. Otherwise, the splint may be placed in flexion with forearm pronation to provide stability against posterior subluxation. Some patients may even be cleared to initiate ROM exercises on the first postoperative day, with a majority beginning active ROM within 48 hours to improve functional outcomes. Active and active-assist therapies are employed to permit the recruitment of dynamic muscle stabilizers. Forearm rotation is allowed. Shoulder and wrist exercises are encouraged without restrictions. Patients should be counseled to avoid extension within the terminal 30 degrees of motion for four weeks, as this is the most unstable position.

The terrible triad of elbow injuries is difficult to manage. Even after optimal treatment and compliance with postoperative rehabilitation, rarely is it possible to achieve a normal range of motion. Leandro et al. revealed a mean flexion-extension range of 113 degrees and average flexion contracture of 24 degrees.et al. reported an average flexion-extension arc of 112 degrees and a mean flexion contracture of 19 degrees. Garrigues et al. documented a mean flexion-extension range of 115 degrees and average flexion contracture of 21 degrees.
