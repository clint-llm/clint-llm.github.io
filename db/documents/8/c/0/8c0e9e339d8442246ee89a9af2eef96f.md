Naproxen was initially approved in 1976 for prescription use and remained a prescription drug until it received approval as an over-the-counter (OTC) medication in 1994. Naproxen has been FDA-approved to treat acute gout, ankylosing spondylitis, bursitis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, osteoarthritis, tendonitis, rheumatoid arthritis, pain, and primary dysmenorrhea. It is considered the first-line treatment for acute gouty arthritis, osteoarthritis, musculoskeletal pain, inflammation, and dysmenorrhea. While Naproxen and other NSAIDs have FDA approval for the treatment of inflammatory arthropathies, such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, they do not alter the course of the disease, nor do they prevent joint and soft tissue destruction that are common sequelae of these diseases. In these cases, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have become the first-line treatment for inflammatory arthropathies, and NSAIDs such as naproxen are used as adjunctive therapy.

Off-label uses of naproxen include treating acute migraines and migraine prophylaxis, with Naproxen being considered a first-line abortive remedy for acute migraines. Further, it can be used for chronic migraine prevention as well, along with other medications such as beta-blockers, anti-depressants, and anticonvulsants.
