Healthcare workers, including the primary caregiver and nurse practitioner, frequently see patients with coronary artery disease. Often these patients are referred to a cardiologist, where imaging studies are done to determine the degree of calcification in the coronary vessels.

Coronary artery calcification in several large observational studies has been shown to predict future cardiovascular events. Furthermore, when added to commonly used risk prediction models, CAC significantly improves risk prediction and stratification compared to other biomarkers. It can correctly classify patients into low-risk and high-risk categories. Patients have an extremely low risk of cardiovascular disease and events if they have no coronary calcification detected (CAC score of 0).

Currently, there is no known specific treatment for coronary artery calcification. Risk factor modification is recommended and includes treating hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, as well as preventing the development of advanced kidney disease. In addition, the presence of coronary artery calcification makes a percutaneous coronary intervention during cardiac catheterization more challenging. Techniques that can be utilized during cardiac catheterization in addition to drug-eluting or bare-metal stent placement include rotational, orbital, or laser atherectomy and cutting balloons.
