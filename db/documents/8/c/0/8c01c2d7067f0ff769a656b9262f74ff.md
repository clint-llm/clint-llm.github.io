A 15-year review of epidemiologic factors of open fractures in adults, reports the incidence was 30.7 per 100,000 persons per year. Motor vehicle accidents are the most common cause of open, lower extremity fractures and are responsible for 34.1% of these injuries. Crush injuries are the most prevalently associated with open, lower extremity fractures causing 39.5% of these cases. The overwhelming majority of open fractures occur singularly, but patients may have more than one at a time. The overall average age of occurrence is 45.5 years, but in general, the incidence declines in males and increases in females with age. The highest incidence of open fractures in males is between ages 15 and 19 years at 54.5 per 100,000 persons per year, whereas the highest occurrence in females is at 53.0 per 100,000 persons per year between the ages of 80 and 89 years. Open phalanx fractures are the most common open fractures accounting for more than 45% of all open injuries. The most common long bone fracture is the tibia and fibula at 11.2%.
