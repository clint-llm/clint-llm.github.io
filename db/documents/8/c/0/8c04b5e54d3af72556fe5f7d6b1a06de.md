Acquired perforating dermatosis may manifest with several polymorphous skin lesions, such as hyperkeratotic, often umbilicated, millimetric or larger papules or nodules. Erythematous or non-erythematous lesions can also be found on follicular or non-follicular regions depending on the APD type.

Since pruritus is very frequent, excoriations and crusts are common presenting signs. New skin lesions can emerge due to Koebnerization.

Most skin lesions develop on the extensor surfaces of the lower extremities, but APD can also be present on the trunk, scalp, or any area that the patient may scratch or rub due to pruritis.****

Faver et al. proposed diagnosticÂ criteria of ARPC as follows: onset of the disease after the age of 18 years, the presence of umbilicated nodules or papules with a central adherent plug, and elimination of necrotic collagen tissue within an epithelium-lined crater.****
