Pulsus alternans occurs as a result of underlying cardiac distress and dysfunction. Pulsus alternans has been identified as left ventricular, right ventricular, or biventricular, and the etiology of pulsus alternans varies depending on the causative pathology. Left ventricular alternans occurs in the setting of severe left ventricular dysfunction. This includes cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease. Right ventricular alternans occurs as a result of right ventricular strain, often precipitated by a pulmonary embolus or pulmonary hypertension. Other potential etiologies of right ventricular alternans include reactive airway disease, mitral stenosis, or left-sided heart failure.

Another possible etiology for PA is pericardial effusion. Different mechanisms may provoke PA, such as hemodynamic and inotropic impairment.
