The definitive management of this condition is an emergency cholecystectomy upon diagnosis. It is possible to perform the cholecystectomy laparoscopically if gangrene or perforation of the gallbladder is not suspected. Clinical suspicion or confirmation of perforation and peritonitis indicates an open-cholecystectomy. Open surgery also is the preferred option if there is an associated pneumoperitoneum to rule out the presence of bowel perforation. The surgeon should have a low threshold for conversion to open due to the high chances of distorted anatomy or very fragile tissues. At surgery, a severely inflamed gallbladder is one with evidence of air in the pericholecystic tissue or foamy collection detected along the hepatoduodenal ligament or the right retroperitoneum. An intraoperative cholangiogram helps to avoid bile duct injury when the anatomy cannot be delineated clearly. In patients without evidence of peritonitis who cannot tolerate anesthesia because of a poor clinical condition, a reasonable intervention is to perform percutaneous radiological drainage as a temporizing option. The cholecystostomy can be followed by removal of the gallbladder at a later date once the patient's condition improves.
