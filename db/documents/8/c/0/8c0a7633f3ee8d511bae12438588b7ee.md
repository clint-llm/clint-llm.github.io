**Vestibulopathy**

- Vestibular conditions (including, but not limited to, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular migraine, vestibular neuritis, ototoxic medication exposure) may present with similar symptoms of motion sickness as they can increase visual-vestibular conflict.  This etiology should be a consideration in a patient with new-onset motion sickness without explanation.  These patients may require referral to a neurologist or vestibular specialist.

**Cerebrovascular Event**

- Patients with risk factors for a cerebrovascular accident should have a high index for suspicion, especially in new-onset, severe symptoms with no history of motion sickness in the past.
