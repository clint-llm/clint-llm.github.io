Presentation of MDMA toxicity is variable due to the common practice of co-ingestion with other illicit substances. Even self-reported mono-ingestion of Ecstasy/Molly is not reliable due to the varying composition of the synthesized drug. Patients may present tachycardic, hypertensive, hyperthermic, and agitated.Â  Even at minor recreational doses, adverse effects include increased muscle activity (such as bruxism, restless legs, and jaw clenching), hyperactivity, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of restlessness.

Because Ecstasy is a popular rave drug, the dangerous combination of intense physical activity (such as dancing) along with the heightened sympathomimetic effects of the drug lead to an increase in body temperature that resembles heat stroke and resulting in rhabdomyolysis.
