Classic vitamin K deficiency is a vitamin-k responsive elongation of prothrombin time or bleeding. Prothrombin time has served as an indicator of vitamin K status because of the effect on plasma prothrombin; however, there must be approximately a 50% decrease in prothrombin before the prothrombin time becomes abnormal and is nonspecific.

Diagnostic criteria for VKDB includes a PT greater than or equal to 4 times the normal value and one of the following:

1. normal or increased platelet count with normal fibrinogen and absent degradation products

2. PT normalization within 30 minutes after IV vitamin K administration

3. Increased levels of PIVKA-II.

When VKCFD is suspected as the cause, a research laboratory can be employed to perform genotyping of gamma-glutamyl carboxylase and vitamin K2,3-epoxide reductase complex for confirmation.
