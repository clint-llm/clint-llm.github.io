Patients need to understand that the risk for malignant transformation of these lesions is about 5 percent. Females do not necessarily need to avoid pregnancy with lesions of 5 cm or less, but becoming pregnant will require coordinated care from all interprofessional team members, and the patient needs counsel on the risks involved. If resection is needed during pregnancy, this should occur during the second trimester when risks to both mother and fetus are at their lowest. These decisions require the patients to be fully informed of their condition and the options, risks, and benefits of any course of action.
