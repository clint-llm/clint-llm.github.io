Histopathology will reveal a subepidermal split with a superficial perivascular inflammatory infiltrate and numerous eosinophils. Spongiosis and superficial papillary dermal infiltrate of eosinophils without vesiculation are characteristic features of urticarial lesions and may indicate the dermatopathologist to a diagnosis of urticarial or pre-bullous pemphigoid.

Direct immunofluorescence involves directly detecting tissue bound autoantibodies and is the gold standard of evaluation in autoimmune blistering diseases. It is imperative to biopsy the site of the skin lesion to get direct immunofluorescence. At least 2 punch biopsies should be obtained at the time of evaluation: one to send for hematoxylin and eosin staining, and the other is perilesional, uninvolved skin for direct immunofluorescence. DIF pattern for bullous pemphigoid will show deposition of C3 and IgG in a linear homogeneous pattern at the basement membrane zone.
