Closed-loop obstruction is a surgical emergency. If inflow and outflow of the colon are both obstructed (classical examples are a sigmoid volvulus or obstructing sigmoid colon cancer with a competent ileocecal valve), the obstructed bowel will continue to distend, owing to a significant amount of gas-forming bacteria trapped inside. This will eventually lead to vascular compromise, initially affecting the venous outflow, leading to further congestion until the arterial inflow ceases. Ischaemia, necrosis and eventual perforation of the obstructed segment occur. The part of the colon most at risk of perforation is the caecum as it has the thinnest wall compared to other parts of the colon.

While the colon is obstructed and distending, mucosal ischemia can lead toÂ bacterial translocation of the gut flora, increasing the risk that the patient will present with bacteremia and sepsis.
