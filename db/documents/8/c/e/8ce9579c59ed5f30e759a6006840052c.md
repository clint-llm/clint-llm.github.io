Hospitalized patients often have conditions that impair their ability to regulate their hydration status. Improper fluid management leads to significant morbidity and mortality. Thoughtful consideration of the type and amount of fluid required for each patient is crucial. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of patients’ fluid needs and highlights the importance of an interprofessional team managing patients in shock.

**Objectives:**
- Outline methods for evaluating a patient’s volume status.
- Explain how to calculate maintenance fluids for pediatric patients.
- Identify common complications of fluid derangements.
- Explain a structured interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients requiring fluid management.
