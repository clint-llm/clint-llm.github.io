After obtaining informed consent, the patient is brought to the cardiac catheterization lab. The patient is placed in the supine position on the table, and the access sites are cleaned and draped in a sterile fashion. For providing a sterile access site, chlorhexidine is used. The operating physician and the assistant will require sterile gowns, gloves, head caps, and facial protection. The needles, access sheaths, catheters are flushed to avoid introducing air into the systemic circulation.
