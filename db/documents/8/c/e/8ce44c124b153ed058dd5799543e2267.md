The morbidity of peripheral nerve injury is highest in trauma patients, specifically the upper extremity with the radial nerve the most commonly injured. Approximately 34% of discharged upper extremity trauma patients require support services, and 16% require rehabilitation according to a recent international survey of surgeons.

The best clinical tools for objective measurement of the extent of peripheral nerve injury include EMG and nerve conduction velocity (NCV). Characteristic findings of a compressive neuropathy on EMG include positive sharp waves representing fibrillations from denervation of muscle fibers. NCV in focal compression will show increased latency, decreased conduction velocity, reduced amplitude of motor action potential and sensory nerve action potential.

The Seddon classification system of nerve injury can be used to predict the complexity of nerve regeneration.

The differential for non-traumatic peripheral neuropathy includes:

- Immune-mediated

- Metabolic

- Hereditary

- Toxic

- Infectious

- Entrapment

Sensory neuropathies can represent the neurologic manifestations of systemic disease.
