Intramuscular injection is the preferred administration method. The intradermal route is not recommended. The preferred site of injection is the deltoid muscle. A regimen of three doses of the recombinant vaccine over six months is the current preferred method. A new vaccine has received approval for adults in the United States, which requires just two doses in one month.

After completing the three vaccination series, patients may receive a blood test after one to four months to determine the immune response, which is defined as an anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-Hbs) antibody level exceeding 100mIU/mL. An antibody response falling between 10 and 100 mIU/mL demonstrates an inadequate response; these patients should get a single booster shot, but do not require a retest. Responses below 10 mIU/mL require additional testing to check for prior hepatitis B infection, and these patients should receive another three-dose regimen with testing again at the one to four-month mark. Continued failed response warrants may require more aggressive interventions, including intradermal administration, high-dose vaccine, or double dosing of combination hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine. Should this fail, the patient will need hepatitis B immunoglobulin upon any exposure to the hepatitis B virus.
