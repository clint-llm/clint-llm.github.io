The elbow joint serves as a crossing for most of the neurovasculature in the upper extremity.  The superficial nature of most of these structures allows a provider to visualize many of these structures using ultrasound.  The brachial artery is one of the continuations of the axillary artery and is the source of all the main arteries feeding into the elbow joint.  The branches of the brachial artery include a deep brachial artery which courses posteriorly to give rise to a few other small arteries which ultimately anastomose with the radial artery. The majority of the blood flow travels through the brachial artery distally and branches into the radial and ulnar arteries.

The major lymphatic structures around the elbow joint are the deep and superficial cubital lymph nodes, and the epitrochlear and supratrochlear lymph nodes, the latter comprising up to five nodes lying superior to the medial epicondyle. Lymph drains up the arm and passes through the deep brachial lymph nodes, eventually ending up in the axillary lymph nodes.
