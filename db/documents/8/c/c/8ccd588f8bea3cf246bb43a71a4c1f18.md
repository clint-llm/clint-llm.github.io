# Continuing Education Activity

A new and rapidly progressive respiratory syndrome termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the Guangdong province of China as a global threat in March of 2003. SARS went on to spread globally over the following months to over 30 countries and became the first pandemic of the 21st century. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients suspected of or with SARS.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of the severe acute respiratory syndrome.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of severe acute respiratory syndrome.
- Describe the management options available for the severe acute respiratory syndrome.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional teams to improve outcomes for patients affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome as well as their communities.

# Introduction

A new and rapidly progressive respiratory syndrome termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was identified by the World health organization (WHO) in the Guangdong province of China as a global threat in March of 2003. SARS went on to spread globally over the following months to over 30 countries and became the 1st pandemic of the 21st century. It showed that the dissemination of an infectious microbe could be drastically increased in the era of globalization and increased international travel. The decade preceding the SARS outbreak featured the emergence of multiple novel pathogens, including H5N1 influenza, Hantavirus, Nipah virus, and Avian flu. However, SARS was unique among these as it had the ability for efficient person-to-person transmission.

The WHO, along with its international partners, including the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC), was able to identify within two weeks the etiologic agent.

The number of secondary cases produced by one SARS patient is thought to be in the range of two to four though a few patients, including the original index case, were suspected to be “super-spreaders” spreading to up to hundreds of others. The mode of transmission for the virus was largely through respiratory inhalation of droplets. Treatment was primarily supportive, and no specific anti-virals were effective. Since mid-2004, no new cases of SARS have been reported. Until the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the global reach of SARS had been matched only by the 2009 H1N1 Influenza pandemic.

# Etiology

The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was established as the cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) after fulfilling all of Koch postulates.

# Epidemiology

The first severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases were noted in the Guangdong province of China in November 2002 as an outbreak of atypical, acute community-acquired pneumonia cases.

The illness spread rapidly from the Guangdong province and Hong Kong globally to over 30 countries in Asia, Europe, and North America. SARS mostly affected adults. Children were affected though in lesser numbers and with similar or milder presentations, and no deaths reported.

SARS-CoV, like many other respiratory viruses, is transmitted predominantly person to person by face-to-face contact suggesting a droplet spread mechanism though also by direct contact with fomites or contaminated secretions.

# Pathophysiology

The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for entry into its host.Staphylococcus aureus, Strenotrophomonas maltophilia), viral, or fungal (i.e., Aspergillus, Candida) superinfections.

# History and Physical

The typical clinical presentation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) includes fever, myalgia, cough, fatigue, and headache, with fever being the most common symptom.

# Evaluation

The case definition of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is defined by both the WHO and the CDC. A case of SARS occurs in a person with laboratory confirmation of infection who meets the clinical criteria or who has worked in a lab with live SARS coronavirus. The clinical criteria include fever or a history of fever along with one or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness such as cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing and radiographic findings of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or an autopsy finding of pneumonia or ARDS without an identifiable cause and no alternative explanation of the illness.

When SARS is suspected in a patient, diagnostic workup should include complete blood count with differential, chest x-ray, pulse oximetry, blood cultures, Gram stain, and culture of sputum, Legionella, and Pneumococcal antigen testing as well as viral respiratory pathogen panels. Additionally, the samples for specific SARS-CoV testing should be performed in coordination with the local health department and the CDC or WHO.

Laboratory findings vary with the most common identified abnormalities being low total lymphocytes, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels.

Radiographic findings are similar to other causes of viral pneumonia and may appear normal during the prodromal phase.

# Treatment / Management

There is no specific treatment for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and supportive care is emphasized. To date, no antiviral agents have been found to be beneficial, nor were glucocorticoids shown to have a beneficial effect.

Once suspected of SARS, the patient needs to be quickly identified and placed in isolation with appropriate infection control measures in place to avoid transmission. Triage using a set of clinical criteria and epidemiologic criteria should be in place to allow the rapid identification of suspected patients. Infection control precautions include contact precautions (gloves, gowns, and eye protection), droplet precautions (additionally a private room and limit movements), as well as airborne precautions (N-95 respirators and negative pressure isolation room).

# Differential Diagnosis

Other infectious causes of community-acquired pneumonia and ARDS must be considered as differentials of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

- The bacterial causes include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenza

- Viral causes include influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, varicella, and hantavirus

# Prognosis

Prognostic features identified by epidemiologic studies for poor outcomes include diabetes, chronic hepatitis B and other underlying comorbid conditions, older age, non-typical presentation, and an elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at the time of admission.

# Complications

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused many pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications. These include:

- Spontaneous pneumomediastinum was reported in about 12% of cases in one study

- Renal and hepatic impairment

- Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia

- Diastolic cardiac dysfunction

- Pulmonary hypertension

- Neurologic disorders

- Rhabdomyolysis

- Nosocomial infections, including bacteremia, catheter-related sepsis, and pneumonia

- Corticosteroid treatment was trialed in the early phase of the SARS epidemic before proving not to be beneficial. Complications of prolonged high-dose corticosteroid therapy such as avascular necrosis and disseminated fungal infection were identified in SARS patients on these therapies.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

While prevention modalities such as effective antiviral therapy, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, or natural immunity are lacking, the public health measures of rapid case identification and containment are of the utmost importance. The fact that patients during the prodromal phase of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have lower contagiousness allows the application of containment precautions once they become symptomatic to be effective in containing transmission.

Control of the disease relies on early identification of suspect cases, isolation, and strict infection control measures. SARS-CoV may also spread by the fecal-oral route as evidenced by the outbreak in the Amoy Gardens building in Hong Kong. Therefore, in addition to respiratory secretions, fecal material and urine should be considered infectious materials. SARS-CoV can remain viable on surfaces for several days.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Knowledge of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by the interprofessional team members should help in the early detection as well as proper management of the disease should it recur. Moreover, this knowledge can be applied not just to a recurrence of SARS-CoV but to any other novel coronavirus, such as we are currently seeing with SARS-CoV2 or other infectious pandemics. This knowledge should enhance patient care, improve outcomes for patients as well as safety for healthcare workers, and improve performance throughout the healthcare team. This is of increased importance in a disease such as SARS, given that 1 in 5 cases was seen in healthcare workers, and healthcare centers were major amplifiers of the disease. Additionally, in the case of pandemics, the healthcare team extends from the frontline clinical workers to health departments, research laboratories, internal health organizations, and governments. Knowledge and coordination are important across all of these organizations and their team members.

Research during the years following the SARS pandemic revealed the existence of many different coronaviruses circulating in bats and other animals, suggesting that the emergence of another coronavirus into humans was not just possible but inevitable.
