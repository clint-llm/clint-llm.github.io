Parental consent improves the relationship between the healthcare provider and those caring for their pediatric patient - this establishes a bond and trusting dialogue that provides a more healing environment in and out of the exam room. Patient consent is then just as essential as the child becomes more involved in their care and control over their bodies. However, there are some situations where parental consent is not required, which may be harmful to involve parents or the provider to do what is in the child's best interest, which may be against the guardianâ€™s wishes. Inability to obtain parental consent, except for emergency conditions or otherwise specified in various jurisdictions, may lead to litigation and claims. Hence, in a healthcare setting, it is deemed essential to obtain parental consent whenever required.
