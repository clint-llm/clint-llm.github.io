Phenothiazines selectively inhibit the D2 receptor; thus, any medications that act through this mechanism of action should be contraindicated, like levodopa or cabergoline. Dementia-related psychosis is contraindicated as it can increase the risk of death as secondary to a cardiovascular or infectious effect. Also, patients who have a history of QTc elongation, hypotension, abnormal lymphoid count, or that are currently using other medications that elongate the QTc interval extenuate hypotension like beta-blockers, and or affect their lymphoid count should not receive phenothiazines. Furthermore, patients suffering from extrapyramidal events or using other medications that elicit those effects should avoid using phenothiazines as they will significantly increase the effects of those conditions.
