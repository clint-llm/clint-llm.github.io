A comprehensive history, including allergies, must be taken from the patient with the primary purpose of anticipating complications and ruling out relative and absolute contraindications. A complete physical exam also contributes to this purpose. The physical exam focused on the spine is important to notice infection of the area and anatomical abnormalities or variations that can potentially affect the procedure. All the monitors must be placed and working, intravenous access placed, time out should take place before the procedure, and asepsis and antisepsis must be maintained. Risks must be discussed, and informed consent obtained.

Positioning: The patient's position plays a pivotal role in the procedure's success. Epidural placement can be performed more commonly in a lateral decubitus and sitting position or less frequently in the prone position. In the lateral decubitus position, the patient is completely resting on their side on the bed surface, and the spine is parallel to that surface as well. Thighs and neck are flexed forward, imitating fetal position. In the sitting positioning, the patient is sited on the bed or OR table, and the spine is perpendicular to the table's surface. The goal is to curve the spine forward in a letter "C" shape. Asking the patient to hug a pillow and placing a stool to rest their feet help to achieve correct positioning.
