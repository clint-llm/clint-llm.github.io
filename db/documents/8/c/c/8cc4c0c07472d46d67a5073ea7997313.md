Marijuana can be administered in many different ways - orally, sublingually, or topically. It can also be smoked, mixed into foods, and brewed as tea.

- Typically cannabis is smoked, which has the advantage of rapid onset and easy titration and rapidly delivers it to the brain and circulation. However, smoked cannabis has had difficulty being approved for medical use for multiple reasons, an important one being the variable mixture of THC, other cannabinoids, carcinogens, and other toxic substances to the lungs.

- When ingested orally, the pharmacokinetics vary greatly. The onset of action is delayed with maximum blood levels reaching up to six hours post-ingestion and a half-life of 20-30 hours.

- The topical route, such as making it into a liniment, has been used for arthritic pain with varying success.

- Routes such as lozenges, sublingual tablets, skin patches, or suppositories have been attempted for medical purposes but have had difficulty obtaining standardized effects. In addition, the combinations of cannabinoids in each preparation can vary substantially, which makes precise dosing difficult.
