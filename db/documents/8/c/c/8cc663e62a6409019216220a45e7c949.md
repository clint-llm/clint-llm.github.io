Even though pre-HTN is not yet considered as a disease, its early detection can prevent the risk of development of HTN and cardiovascular risk.

Non-pharmacological interventions incorporate/include exercise, staying away from pressure (avoiding stress), dietary alterations, and way of life adjustments and limiting liquor(alcohol) intake. DASH diet along with the Mediterranean, diet is a recommended diet which meets the dietary requirements of people with hypertension. These diets promote the utilization of vegetables, natural products, dairy items, grains, and food rich in magnesium, potassium, phosphorous and calcium. Restriction of sodium consumption has the greatest role in bringing down the blood pressure. DASH diet itself has equal efficacy to that of single drug therapy for hypertension. Exercise and weight reduction are the second significant intervention after dietary alteration for hypertension management. Limiting liquor(alcohol) utilization helps significantly to control blood pressure. As the way of life change (lifestyle modification) is a dynamic process, it requires nonstop adherence.

In stage 1 HTN without any cardiovascular complications, 6 to 12 months of lifestyle modifications can be attempted as a measure to reduce hypertension.
