Congenital diaphragmatic herniation results in unique pathophysiologic changes that may be challenging to manage perioperatively. Anesthesiologists involved in the care of these patients must have a thorough understanding of the disease process and know how to evaluate and manage this condition throughout the perioperative period. This activity reviews the principles and considerations for safe anesthetic administration for patients with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. It highlights the role of interprofessional teams in achieving perioperative goals and optimizing outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiologic changes most pertinent to anesthetic concerns for congenital diaphragmatic hernia.
- Describe the role of anesthesia during the prenatal and postnatal stages for congenital diaphragmatic hernia.
- Summarize the preoperative evaluation to be performed prior to undergoing surgical repair for congenital diaphragmatic hernia.
- Outline the general anesthetic considerations for the intraoperative period for congenital diaphragmatic hernia for the interprofessional team to maximize patient outcomes.
