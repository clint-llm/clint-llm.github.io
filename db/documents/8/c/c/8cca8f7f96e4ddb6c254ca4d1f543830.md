Much information of clinical significance is discovered when imaging the pelvis with ultrasound. This includes information about the uterus, its shape, size, and characteristics of endometrial cavity and its contents. Identification and evaluation of ovarian size and morphology help determine if there are any abnormalities in the ovary for a given age. US can identify masses in structures other than the uterus and ovaries such as adnexal cysts. Ovarian neoplasms can be assessed for size and morphology and growth over time. This may include ovarian teratomas with their usual cystic and solid (Rokitansky nodule) contents including bone or calcium. Rectal contents can be evaluated, especially in neonates or young children. Thick bowel walls of chronic inflammation or tumor may be noted at times. Urethral cysts may be seen, particularly in adult females. Rarely an abnormality of the bony pelvis may be noted.
