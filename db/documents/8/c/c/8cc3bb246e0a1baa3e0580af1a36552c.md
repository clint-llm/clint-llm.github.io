Before the discovery of H2-receptor antagonists in the 1970s and PPIs in the 1980s,  the only reasonable option to treat ZES was a total gastrectomy.

Hyperparathyroidism from MEN1 causes hypercalcemia which can exacerbate the symptoms because hypercalcemia increases gastrin levels. Therefore, subtotal parathyroidectomy must precede the resection of the primary tumor, which can result in better symptom control and may normalize abnormal gastrin levels.
