Acetylcholine synthesis and storage occur in the presynaptic neurons of the NMJ. Acetylcholine binds to postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors upon its release from the presynaptic neurons. In the NMJ, acetylcholine is metabolized by acetylcholinesterases via hydrolysis, attenuating its physiological effects. Edrophonium is a synthetic short-acting acetylcholinesterase competitive inhibitor that functions by forming non-covalent bonds at the serine-103 allosteric site of acetylcholinesterase enzymes. Thus, edrophonium increases the amount of acetylcholine in the NMJ synapses. The higher amounts of acetylcholine in the NMJ synapses overcome the antibodies on the nicotinic receptors in MG, resulting in a brief improvement of muscular strength. Edrophonium has a rapid onset of action occurring within 1 minute of administration and a short duration of action lasting 10 minutes.
