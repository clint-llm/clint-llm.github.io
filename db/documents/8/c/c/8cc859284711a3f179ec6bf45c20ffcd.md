Though there are no absolute contraindications to insulin therapy, the dose of insulin needs to be adjusted and monitored in numerous settings.

- Insulin dosing requires adjustment in patients with renal impairment and liver failure, as insulin metabolism occurs in the liver, excreted in the urine.

- Insulin dose and blood glucose levels should have careful monitoring in patients with a history of hypoglycemic episodes.

- Insulin should not be given with other drugs, which also cause hypokalemia, like diuretics.

- Vomiting and diarrhea cause a hypokalemic state in the body, and clinicians and patients should exercise care when administering insulin as it also causes hypokalemia.

- Insulin is also contraindicated in patients with cresol sensitivity as insulin preparations contain cresol.
