History and physical exam will allow for diagnosis of incisional hernias in the vast majority of cases. In cases of occult hernias, either small incisional hernias or hernias in obese patients, further workup with imaging is warranted. The computed tomography (CT) scan is the most commonly used method to diagnose an incisional hernia and can be useful in complex cases as well in helping plan operative management

Complete evaluation of incisional hernias includes confirming the diagnosis, sizing the defect, identifying the herniated content, and assessing the abdominal cavity to plan the surgical treatment in complex hernias. CT scan imaging is useful for obtaining these details.
