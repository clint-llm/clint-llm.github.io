The diagnosis and classification of heart failure are primarily based on the presence/severity of symptoms and physical exam findings. It is imperative to obtain a detailed history of symptoms, underlying medical conditions, and functional capacity/exercise tolerance to adequately treat the patient. The most commonly reported symptom is shortness of breath. Further qualification of this symptom is essential to help elucidate potential causes of heart failure and to determine the plan of care for the patient. Shortness of breath must further be classified to determine if it is related to exertion, positional changes (orthopnea), and whether it is acute or chronic. Other commonly reported symptoms of HF include chest pain, palpitations, anorexia, and fatigue. Some patients may present with a recumbent cough which may be due to orthopnea.

Physical examination of patients with heart failure requires a comprehensive assessment. The general appearance of patients with severe, chronic heart failure or those with acutely decompensated heart failure will include anxiety, diaphoresis, and poor nutritional status. The classical finding of pulmonary rales translates to heart failure of moderate to severe intensity. Wheezing may be present in acute decompensated heart failure. As the severity of pulmonary congestion increases, frothy and blood-tinged sputum may be seen. It is important to note that the absence of rales does not exclude pulmonary congestion. Jugular venous distention is another classical finding which must be assessed in all patients with HF. A paradoxical increase in jugular venous distention with respiration (Kussmaul sign) may be seen. In patients with elevated left-sided filling pressures, hepatojugular reflux (distention of the jugular vein after applying pressure over the liver with the patient lying at a 45° angle) will be seen. Peripheral edema is present in severe heart failure and will be seen if a substantial degree of volume overload is present.

Cardiac findings in patients with HF include S3 gallop, pulsus alternans, and accentuation of P2. An S3 gallop is the most significant and early finding associated with HF.

**Framingham Diagnostic Criteria for Heart Failure**

The commonly used Framingham Diagnostic Criteria for Heart Failure requires the presence of 2 major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor criteria to make the diagnosis of heart failure. This diagnostic tool is highly sensitive for the diagnosis of heart failure but has a relatively low specificity. The Framingham Diagnostic criteria are as follows:.

Major Criteria

- Acute pulmonary edema

- Cardiomegaly

- Hepatojugular reflex

- Neck vein distention

- Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea

- Pulmonary rales

- Third heart sound (S3 Gallop)

- Weight loss of 4.5 kg or more in 5 days in response to treatment

- Central venous pressure greater than 16 cm of water

- Radiographic cardiomegaly

Minor Criteria

- Ankle edema

- Dyspnea on exertion

- Hepatomegaly

- Nocturnal cough

- Pleural effusion

- Tachycardia (heart rate greater than 120 beats per minute)

- A decrease in vital capacity by one third the maximal value recorded

**New York Heart Association Functional Classification**

**Based on symptoms, the patients can be classified using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification as follows:**

- Class I: Symptom onset with more than ordinary level of activity

- Class II: Symptom onset with an ordinary level of activity

- Class III: Symptom onset with minimal activity

- Class IIIa: No dyspnea at rest
- Class IIIb: Recent onset of dyspnea at rest

- Class IV: Symptoms at rest
