Patients treated with IMRT have improved long-term toxicities relative to patients treated with conventional radiation techniques. The cumulative acute non-hematologic grade 3+ toxicity rate is ~20%. The most common non-hematologic acute toxicities include desquamation, proctitis, cystitis, and diarrhea. The cumulative rate of acute hematologic grade 3+ toxicity is ~60%, most commonly neutropenia. The most common late toxicity is grade 1 diarrhea in ~35%, which is manageable with conservative interventions. Additional long-term toxicities of chemoradiation include persistent radiation proctitis, angioectasias, and, less commonly, hip fractures, fistulas, sexual dysfunction, or strictures.
