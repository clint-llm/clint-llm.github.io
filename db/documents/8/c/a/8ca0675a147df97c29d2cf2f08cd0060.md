As with other tests, the actual reference range used for the ESR should be established by the laboratory performing the test.

The ESR is typically higher in females than males and increases gradually with age.

- Male <50 years old: ≤15 mm/hr

- Female <50 years old: ≤ 20 mm/hr

- Male >50 years old: ≤20 mm/hr

- Female >50 years old: ≤30 mm/hr

- Child: ≤10 mm/hr
