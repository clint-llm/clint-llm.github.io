Management of a patient with hypospadias should start with a comprehensive physical examination and review of organ systems to exclude several possible accompanied clinical syndromes. Several differential diagnoses might be considered while approaching a patient with hypospadias. Enzymatic defects, including dihydrotestosterone (DHT), might result in masculinization defects of varying degrees.

The production of DHT, as a highly potent androgen, is correlated with the function of the SRD5A2 gene. In contrast, the mutations of the mentioned gene might clinically present with perineoscrotal hypospadias and female phenotype. In order to differentiate this pseudovaginal hypospadias from other disorders of sexual differentiation, remarkable virilization, and lack of gynecomastia during puberty should be considered.
