Tachyarrhythmias, most commonly atrial fibrillation or flutter, are the usual differential and can be easily excluded by an ECG and device interrogation. LV dysfunction and cardiomyopathies which usually present with similar symptoms can be excluded by echocardiography with tissue characterization by cardiac MRI (if the device is MRI compatible).
