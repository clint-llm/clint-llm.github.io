Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, also known as paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia is one of the most commonly occurring paraneoplastic neurological syndromes. The symptoms of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration can be rapidly progressive and very debilitating. They can also precede the diagnosis of the underlying malignancy. Thus, prompt recognition and treatment of this disease are crucial to the prevention of significant disability. This activity reviews the diagnosis and treatment of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration and highlights the importance of interdisciplinary coordination between healthcare teams to manage patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. 
- Summarize the pertinent history and physical examination findings in patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration.
- Outline the diagnostic tests for patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to diagnose paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration and improve patients outcomes.
