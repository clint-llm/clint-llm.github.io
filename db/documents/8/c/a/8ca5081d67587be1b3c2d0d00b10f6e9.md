By mammography, medullary carcinoma manifests as a mass with rounded, oval, or lobulated contours. The mass is noncalcified and has a well-defined tumor border.

Similar findings appear on ultrasound examination, where examples show as a well-circumscribed hypoechoic mass.

MRI studies show round, oval, or lobular mass with a smooth margin. Internal enhancement can be homogeneous or heterogeneous with delayed peripheral enhancement by contrast-enhanced MRI.
