In vernal keratoconjunctivitis, multiple papillae are seen in the upper tarsal conjunctiva. The underlying pathological process involves hyperplasia of the conjunctival epithelium. These hyperplastic tissues send projections downwards into the subepithelial tissue. The adenoid layer shows marked cellular infiltration by eosinophils, plasma cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes. The fibroblasts show proliferative changes, which later undergo hyaline changes. These factors are responsible for the inflammatory process and are involved in tissue remodeling, resulting in giant papillae seen in VKC.
