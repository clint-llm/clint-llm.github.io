Pseudocholinesterase is a plasma enzyme produced in the liver that is responsible for the metabolism of the common anesthesia drugs, succinylcholine, and mivacurium, as well as ester local anesthetics, including cocaine. Individuals with a normally functioning version of the enzyme can rapidly and extensively metabolize succinylcholine and mivacurium, leading to their short duration of action (less than 10 minutes for succinylcholine).

With an acquired deficiency, there is a decreased ability to degrade the substrate drugs solelyÂ due to decreased concentration of the enzyme in the serum.
