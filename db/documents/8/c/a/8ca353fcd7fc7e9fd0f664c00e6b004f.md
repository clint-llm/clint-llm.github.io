**Prophylactic Antibiotic Therapy**

Administration of prophylactic antibiotics against aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacteria is essential before an appendectomy. To ensure maximal effectiveness, prophylactic antibiotics should be administered within 60 minutes before initiating the procedure.

Antibiotics are essential in helping to prevent postoperative surgical site infection and intra-abdominal abscesses.Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae resistant to non-pseudomonal cephalosporins, enteric streptococci, and anaerobes is indicated. However, after culture and antibiotic sensitivity assays, antibiotics should be adjusted.

The Surgical Care Improvement Project has established current guidelines for prophylactic antibiotics.
