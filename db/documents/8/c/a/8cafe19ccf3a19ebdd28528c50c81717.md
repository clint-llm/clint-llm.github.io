The management of neck trauma can be challenging and sometimes overwhelming, as this anatomical region contains many vital structures. These structures may pose a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma in the emergency department. For descriptive and clinical management purposes, the neck is divided into three zones: zones 1, 2, and 3. In penetrating trauma, zone designations have anatomic, diagnostic, and management implications. Since the zone system is helpful in guiding management decisions, it is preferable to employ the zone system when describing traumatic injuries. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of neck trauma and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Differentiate between the three different classes of neck trauma, and give an example of each type.
- Describe the three different anatomical zones of the neck, and give the key structures resident in each one.
- Review the proepr procedure for examination and evaluation of neck trauma injuries, including all appropriate diagnostic testing..
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes with trauma to the neck.
