Discovered in 1882 by Robert Koch, tuberculosis (TB), one of the oldest known infections, is a major global health problem and one of the top ten causes of death worldwide. It is a disease of humans, as it does not affect animals naturally.

Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death from an infectious agent worldwide, causing even more deaths in HIV/AIDS patients. A third of the world's population is said to have contracted the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with estimates of ten million new infections globally each year.

The major pathology in tuberculosis is necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, with the lungs being the primary organs of involvement of the disease in up to 87% of the cases. Having that said, almost any bodily organ could be a site for the disease.

The worldwide incidence has been steadily decreasing, but it is still a common problem in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa. It is still a major medical cause of mortality as the global death toll reaches up to 1.5 million deaths a year.
