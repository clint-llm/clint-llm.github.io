Simple renal cysts are extremely common, and the incidence increases with age. Approximately 25% of people who are 40 years or older and approximately 50% of people 50 years and older have simple kidney cysts. Simple renal cysts can double in size over 10 years. Solitary renal cysts are usually incidentally discovered and are typically asymptomatic. Multiple renal cysts are often seen in patients with chronic renal disease on dialysis.
