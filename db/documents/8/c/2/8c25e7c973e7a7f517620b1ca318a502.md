The gold standard for the diagnosis and treatment of intrauterine pathology is hysteroscopy. As such, this technique has numerous indications and benefits. Hysteroscopy can improve quality of life, treat infertility, remove foreign bodies, or diagnose malignancy. Women with abnormal uterine bleeding may experience significant improvement in symptoms post hysteroscopic resection of pathology, avoiding the need for invasive surgical procedures such as hysterectomy.

Also, compared to blind endometrial sampling, direct visualization of the entire uterine cavity and biopsy with hysteroscopy allows for targeted sampling and complete resection of uterine abnormalities such as polyps. These have the potential for malignancy, especially in postmenopausal women and women with a family history of gynecologic cancer. Further, ambulatory hysteroscopy offers appeal with the potential avoidance of general anesthesia or conscious sedation. Studies comparing in-office hysteroscopy to operating room hysteroscopy show comparable patient acceptance and outcomes along with decreased cost.
