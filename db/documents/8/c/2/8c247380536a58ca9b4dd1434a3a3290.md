Electroencephalography (EEG) is a neurophysiological test that measures changes in neuronal activity associated with current flows in the extracellular space produced by local field potentials. Such field potentials can be either excitatory, also known as excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP,) or inhibitory, also known as inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSP) in nature. EEG tracing records not only the physiologic cortical activity, but inevitably also captures fields of electrical activity generated by other sources such as cardiac, myogenic, and electromagnetic, among others. It is substantial for the electroencephalographer to be able to distinguish normal physiologic brain activity from those recorded from non-physiologic sources. Such knowledge is critical to avoid EEG misinterpretation.

Basal cortical rhythms are physiologic rhythms that present in normal healthy brains. The alpha rhythms encompass 3 rhythms: (1) Alpha rhythm, (2) Mu rhythm, and (3) Third rhythm (may also occur in theta range).

In addition, cortical rhythms also encompass theta range rhythms [(1) Ciganek or Third rhythm and  (2) Rhythmic mid-temporal theta of drowsiness (RMTD)] and beta range rhythms.
