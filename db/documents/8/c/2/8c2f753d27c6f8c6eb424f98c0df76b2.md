Phthalates, or phthalate esters, are a group of compounds with a broad range of industrial applications, including their use as solvents and plasticizers, especially as additives in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to impart flexibility.

Phthalates with a longer side chain are referred to as high molecular weight phthalates (HMWP), are more fat-soluble, and are used industrially as part of PVC, which may contain 50Â to 80% phthalates by weight.

Low molecular weight phthalates (LMWP) are used primarily in personal care products (PCPs), enteric-coated tablets, adhesives, paints, printing inks, and solvents. They are also used as fixatives in fragrance-containing products to allow scents to last longer before evaporating.
