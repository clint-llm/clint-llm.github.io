Oral NAC may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, flatus, and gastroesophageal reflux. IV NAC can cause rate related anaphylactoid reactions in up to 18% of patients,

Most of the anaphylactoid reactions are mild (6%) or moderate (10%) with severe reactions like bronchospasm and hypotension rare at 1%. Interestingly, anaphylactoid reactions occur more commonly with lower APAP levels than with higher APAP levels.

When an anaphylactoid reaction occurs, NAC should be stopped immediately, and the patient treated with anti-histamine medication (e.g., diphenhydramine) and IV fluid for hypotension. Vasopressors are not typically necessary. NAC therapy may restart at a slower rate after the resolution of the reaction. If there is a persistent reaction, oral NAC should is the alternative approach.

IV NAC can cause a spurious increase in INR which normalizes once infusion stops.

Oral NAC may cause vomiting in up to 33%.
