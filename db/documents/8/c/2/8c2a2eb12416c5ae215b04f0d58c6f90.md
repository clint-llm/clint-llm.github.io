Contact urticaria falls into three types- immune-mediated, non-immune mediated, and contact urticaria due to an unknown mechanism. This activity reviews the etiology, types, pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of contact urticaria and protein contact dermatitis. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with contact urticaria.
