Castleman disease is a rare disease, with minimum availability of therapeutic options. As a unicentric Castleman disease lesion is localized, complete surgical resection of the tumor is the best treatment available.

Many treatment options are available for treating multicentric CD, including surgery, cytotoxic chemotherapy with or without corticosteroids, and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) with varying outcomes. Better results have been observed by targetting CD20 and IL-6 pathways and HHV-8 replication.

Monoclonal antibodies interrupting the IL-6 signaling cascade, including the anti–IL-6R antibody Tocilizumab and Siltuximab, an anti–IL-6 antibody, tend to be highly effective and are considered to be the first-line therapy, especially for highly symptomatic patients without being HIV or HHV-8 positive. Antiviral therapy comprising of ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir is proven effective against HHV-8 replication pathways. Novel immunomodulatory agents like rituximab, thalidomide, bortezomib, IL-1 antagonist anakinra, and interferon-alpha have somehow shown promising results as well with minimum side effects.

Chemotherapy and immunomodulatory drugs are best reserved for the relapse scenarios. However, it should be kept in mind that not all CD cases respond to therapy and get cured.
