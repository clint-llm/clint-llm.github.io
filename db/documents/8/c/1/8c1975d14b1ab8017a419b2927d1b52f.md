Clinicians should be wary of multiple complications that can occur in the management of aortic insufficiency. Surgical management of aortic insufficiency is the gold standard for correcting aortic insufficiency, and the implementation of TAVR is influencing post-surgical outcomes. Initially, TAVR was contraindicated in pure native aortic insufficiency due to the lack of aortic valve annular calcification and difficulty with anchoring the implanted valves. Based on a multicenter registry developed in 2017 using 331 patients with aortic insufficiency to evaluate early generation vs. newer generation valve devices for TAVR in this population, TAVR was overall associated with relatively high rates of procedural complications; non-statistically significant post-procedural outcomes of conversion to conventional surgery, coronary obstruction, aortic root injury, and new permanent pacemaker implantation were reported more in the cohort of patients with newer generation devices.
