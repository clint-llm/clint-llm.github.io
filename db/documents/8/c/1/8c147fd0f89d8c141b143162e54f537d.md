Physical and chemical lesions of the oral mucosa are common conditions that any interprofessional healthcare team can manage. Identifying the etiology of such lesions is important in determining the appropriate treatment modalities to improve patient care. If the etiology of the lesion cannot be identified, or if the lesion persists beyond two weeks, appropriate referral to a healthcare specialist is warranted for subsequent diagnostic procedures. All interprofessional team membersÂ are integral in identifying these lesions and initiating treatment, referral, and/or education in a timely manner to ensure optimal patient care. This interprofessional approach will drive better patient outcomes. [Level 5]
