Congenital ectropion associated with glaucoma has a poor prognosis. Congenital glaucoma needs early surgical intervention in the form of trabeculotomy with trabeculectomy. Many times, bleb failure may occur, which leads to repeated surgeries.Â NO-CEU was associated with bilateral severe congenital glaucoma. There was worse corneal clarity and worse control of IOP without surgery in NO-CEU compared to neonatal-onset primary congenital glaucoma.
