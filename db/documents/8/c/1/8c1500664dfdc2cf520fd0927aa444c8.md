Most patients are put through a rigorous workup prior to surgery. The patient must have a secured diagnosis with radiographic studies and endoscopy as needed. Tissue diagnosis and accurate preoperative staging are critical for cancers, so upper endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are staples. The patient must have cardiac and pulmonary evaluations to make sure the patient can tolerate the operation, potential one-lung ventilation, and the possibility of an open conversion to thoracotomy if needed. Patients should be on a walking or exercise program and should be abstinent from cigarettes and tobacco at least 3Â to 4 weeks prior to the operation. Underlying abnormalities in lab values should be corrected, and an assessment of nutritional status should be made. Positive gains in nutrition should be attempted with preoperative supplements as tolerated.

The day prior to surgery, the patient should have a mechanical bowel prep in case the colon needs to be used as a conduit, should receive incentive spirometry training, and be hydrated. In the operating room (OR), the patient should have two large-bore IV lines placed or a central line. The patient should have an arterial line, and then undergo general anesthesia with a dual lumen tube. The patient should be intubated in the Trendelenberg position and with cricoid pressure to prevent aspiration on induction. The patient is positioned supine with the neck turned to the right so that the left neck can be accessed. Foley catheter and pneumatic compression sleeve devices should be in place as well as a nasogastric tube. The procedure would begin with the abdominal exploration and then migrate to the cervical portion of the operation.
