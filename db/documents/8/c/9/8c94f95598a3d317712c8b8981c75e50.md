Protein cellular denaturation with the loss of collagen cross-linking starts to occur with an increased temperature above 44 C. This causes necrosis secondary to abnormal osmotic and hydrostatic pressure gradients, with the movement of fluid into interstitial spaces. There are three zones of injury: coagulation, stasis, and hyperemia.

- The Zone of Coagulation is irreversible tissue loss due to coagulation and the point of maximal damage

- The Zone of Stasis is the potentially salvageable zone around the zone of stasis due to decreased tissue perfusion.

- The Zone of Hyperemia has increased perfusion most likely to recover.
