The air within the paranasal sinuses is subject to Boyle's law which states at a constant temperature, the volume of gas is inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas. When an individual ascends at a constant temperature, the atmospheric pressure is reduced, and the air within the nasal passage and paranasal sinuses wants to expand. In the case of a blocked ostium, however, this sinus air isn't allowed to expand leading to pain and mucosal damage. Conversely, when a patient descends at a constant temperature, the atmospheric pressure increases and the volume in the paranasal sinuses creates a relatively negative pressure environment.

These changes in sinus pressure and volume are compensated for with the nasal passage via small openings termed ostia. Should these ostia and the sinus outlet be blocked, an equilibrium will not occur, and sinus mucosal damage and symptoms ensue. During ascent the volume of air in the sinus wants to expand but is not allowed to, resulting in painful compression of the sinus mucosa. During the descent, the relative negative-pressure environment in the center of the sinus draws fluid from mucosal capillaries with resultant mucosal edema and pain. Sinus squeeze may result in a bloody nose due to pressure induced vascular damage.
