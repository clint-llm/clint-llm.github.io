Jejunoileal atresia (JIA) is one of the common causes of intestinal obstruction in neonates. It has been generally reported that JIA occurs due to a vascular accident involving mesenteric blood supply in-utero. The atresia can be found anywhere on the small bowel, either as solitary or multiple lesions. Advancement in pediatric surgical techniques, pediatric anesthesia, intensive care unit (ICU) care, and nutritional supports over the years has led to better overall survival in patients with intestinal atresia. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the treatment of jejunoileal atresia, including improvement in surgical approaches, nutritional support, and postoperative care.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of jejunoileal atresia.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of jejunoileal atresia.
- Outline the management options available for jejunoileal atresia.
- Summarize and explain the role of an interprofessional team involving the surgeons, anesthetists, nutritionists, neonatologists, and cardiologists for patients with cardiac anomalies in improving care coordination and communication to advance the overall patients outcomes in patients with jejunoileal atresia.
