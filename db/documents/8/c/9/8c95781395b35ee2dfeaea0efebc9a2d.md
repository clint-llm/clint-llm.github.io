All surgeries have complications, and this is no exception.  The highest complications are wound-related and include infections, seromas, hematomas, skin flap necrosis, and delayed healing. In some series, wound complications can be up to 30% to 50%. Problems with the microsurgery occur commonly as well, with flap loss rates from venous or arterial thrombosis 1 to 4% and fat necrosis of 5% to 40%. If choosing the mammary arteries, there is a small risk of pneumothorax. Donor site complications depend on the flap chosen.  For abdominally based flaps, complications include abdominal bulge, hernia, and weakness.  Thigh flaps have a high rate of breakdown, sensory disturbance to the thigh, and risk of lymphedema.  Gluteal flaps can risk sciatic exposure or lack of padding and also have wound healing complications.
