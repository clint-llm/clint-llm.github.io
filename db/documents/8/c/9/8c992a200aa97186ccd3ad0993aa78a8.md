BD characteristically starts with a sudden appearance of one or more painless, tense vesicles or bullae within normal-appearing, non-inflamed skin, generally on the acral portions of the body.

Most patients with BD have longstanding diabetes. BD has associations with both insulin-dependent and noninsulin-dependent diabetes melliÂ­tus. Many patients have an associated polyneuropathy, retinopathy, or nephropathy. But occasionally, bullae can be a presenting sign of the disease.
