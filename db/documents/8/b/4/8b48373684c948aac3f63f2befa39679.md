The best prevention is by assuming all caterpillars are toxic.  Teaching children and outdoor workers avoidance will alleviate most exposures.

It is essential to have a heightened level of alertness during peak caterpillar seasons (spring/summer), particularly in endemic areas.

Protective clothing like long-sleeved shirts, long pants tucked into socks, work gloves along with a wide-brimmed hat minimizes the likelihood of accidental exposure.

For known areas of heavy infestation or presence of toxic setae, persons in areas where exposure might occur should utilize a tight-fitting respirator mask and eye protection.
