Most physicians use a classification system for Poland syndrome using grade I-III to qualify the different degrees of severity. The grading system is also referred to as Foucrasâ€™s classification.

- Grade I is usually a mild chest deformity with pectoralis major hypoplasia, moderate breast hypoplasia. It illustrates on examination as slight chest wall asymmetry in men and breast asymmetry in women.

- Grade II involves marked pectoralis major aplasia, hypoplasia, or other chest wall muscles, with possible rib deformity. It demonstrates a marked chest wall asymmetry in men and marked breast asymmetry in women.

- Grade III comprises full muscular and breast aplasia, including aplasia of other chest wall muscles with major bone and cartilage anomaly, including rib and sternal deformity. On physical exam, it will present as major chest wall asymmetry in men and women and breast asymmetry with aplasia in women.
