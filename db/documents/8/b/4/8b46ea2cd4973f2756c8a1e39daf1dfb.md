The diagnosis of PIH is clinical. Woodâ€™s lamp evaluation can help distinguish between epidermal and dermal PIH. A biopsy may be useful for confirming the diagnosis if uncertain or if the underlying etiology has yet to be determined. Laboratory evaluation to rule out Addison disease and systemic lupus erythematosus may be necessary if signs and symptoms are present.
