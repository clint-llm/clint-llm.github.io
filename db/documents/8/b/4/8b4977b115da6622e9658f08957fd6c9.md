Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) describes a narrow complex tachycardia involving episodic supraventricular tachycardia with sudden onset and termination. In contrast to multifocal atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter, PSVT involves a regular ventricular response. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the exam of a patient with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
- Review the evaluation of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
- Describe management options for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
