While the nuclear medicine liver/spleen test has fallen out of favor with the advent of CT, MRI, and ultrasound imaging, there are still advantages to this nuclear medicine test. The liver/spleen scan is a relatively low-cost nuclear medicine procedure. It may also be used to diagnose patients with hepatic vascular disorders such as Budd-Chiari syndrome who are unable to receive IV contrast for CT or MRI. For Budd-Chiari syndrome, in particular, Doppler ultrasonography can be used to confirm the diagnosis. There has been renewed interest in the liver/spleen test - primarily as it is used in conjunction with attenuation-corrected SPECT scanning. More recently, Tc-99m liver/spleen scans have been shown to demonstrate functional hyposplenism in renal transplant recipients.

The liver-spleen scan, when combined with attenuation-corrected SPECT, can be used to map the function of different regions of the liver and spleen non-invasively.

The nuclear medicine liver/spleenÂ test is a useful imaging modality that complements modern imaging techniques. Clinicians should consider the nuclear medicine liver/spleen test when choosing an imaging study.
