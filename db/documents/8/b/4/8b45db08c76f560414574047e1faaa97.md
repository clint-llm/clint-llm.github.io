The fundus camera is an instrument used for fundus photography. Fundus photography captures the images of the retina, optic nerve head, macula, retinal blood vessels, choroid, and the vitreous. Fundus photography impacts the detection and screening of various causes of treatable and preventable blindness, notably diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and retinopathy of prematurity. Over the decades, the quality of fundus images and the ease of photography has improved significantly. This activity describes the techniques of fundus photography and the use of fundus cameras for the management of various ophthalmic conditions and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing the diseases of the vitreo-retina and optic nerve head with fundus photography.

**Objectives:**
