Ileus, also known as paralytic ileus or functional ileus, occurs when there is a non-mechanical decrease or stoppage of the flow of intestinal contents.

Ileus is an often unavoidable consequence of abdominal or retroperitoneal surgery, but can also be found in severely ill patients with septic shock or mechanical ventilation. Due to the delayed refeeding syndrome seen after an ileus, postoperative ileus has a large economic impact in the United States alone.
