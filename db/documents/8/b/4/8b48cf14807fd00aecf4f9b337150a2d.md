Patient education plays an important role in the management of stress disorders. The patient needs to know that most people will have a strong emotional response, which will resolve in a few days to a week in most cases and will not be chronic. The patients should be advised to avoid scenarios that remind them of the event (such as watching TV shows with a similar theme), spend time with family, and have patience. The patient should be able to actively participate in the treatment planning, therapy options, and significant side effects of therapies.
