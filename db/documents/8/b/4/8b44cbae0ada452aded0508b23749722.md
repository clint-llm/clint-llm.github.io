Methamphetamine is a Schedule II stimulant under the Controlled Substances Act, which means that it has a high potential for abuse and limited medical use. Methamphetamine hydrochloride is FDA-approved for long-term treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with and short-term treatment of exogenous obesity. With regard to prescribed methamphetamine, in 2011 6.4 (11%) of children 4–17 years old had at some point in their lives been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and 3.5 million were taking an ADHD medication. Illicit use of these prescribed medications among young adults without ADHD is an increasing problem. Methamphetamine used illegally may be snorted, ingested, injected, or smoked. A dangerous form of methamphetamine ingestion, “parachuting,” in which drugs are wrapped in toilet paper or plastic wrap to delay absorption, is becoming more commonplace.
