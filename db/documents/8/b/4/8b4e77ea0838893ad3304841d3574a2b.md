Morel Lavallee lesions are soft tissue injuries seen in high-velocity trauma and are usually associated with underlying fractures of the pelvis, acetabulum, or proximal femur. Often these injuries are not immediately diagnosed due to the distracting concomitant bony injuries. However, identification of such injuries is important as they may pose as an independent risk factor for surgical site infection. The clinical findings include soft tissue swelling, bruise/ ecchymosis, fluctuance, and compressibility in the swelling. The diagnosis is usually established on physical examination, however, radiological investigations including ultrasonography and CT might help. The management options include nonoperative treatment, percutaneous aspiration, and open debridement. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Morel Lavalle lesions and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical etiology of Morel Lavallee lesions.
- Describe the common clinical findings in a patient with Morel Lavallee lesion.
- Identify the imaging findings associated with various duration of Morel Lavallee lesions.
- Explain the treatment considerations taken by the interprofessional team for patients with Morel Lavallee lesions.
