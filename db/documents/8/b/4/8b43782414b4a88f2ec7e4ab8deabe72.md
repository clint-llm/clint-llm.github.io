About 15% of all****couples have some degree of infertility, with the male partner solely responsible about 30% of the time. Geographically, West Africa and East Asia have the highest incidence of infertility cases. In infertile men, about 10% to 15% will demonstrate azoospermia or the complete absence of any sperm in the semen.

Azoospermia is generally categorized as either obstructive (due to scarring or surgery of the vas or epididymis) or non-obstructive. Non-obstructive azoospermia can be from Sertoli cell-only syndrome, early or late maturation arrest, or hypospermatogenesis.

Sertoli cell-only syndrome is also known as Del Castillo syndrome and germ cell aplasia. Sertoli cells are found in the convoluted seminiferous tubules and form part of the blood-testis barrier in males. They play a critical role in spermatogenesis and sperm production. The cells respond to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) produced by the anterior pituitary as a response to stimulation by the pulsatile release of GnRH by the hypothalamus.

In Sertoli cell-only syndrome, only Sertoli cells line the seminiferous tubules of the testis, and the patients have extremely low or absent spermatogenesis. Some patients may only have focal disease, which would leave some areas of the testis capable of normal spermatogenesis.
