**Warnings and Precautions**

Teprotumumab has no listed contraindications on the label. However, warnings and precautions are for poorly controlled diabetics, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and prepubertal children. Based on its mechanism of action, it is likely that teprotumumab will have teratogenic effects during pregnancy. Therefore, it is recommended that women of child-bearing age use adequate contraception before starting therapy, during the course of treatment, and for six months following the last dose of teprotumumab.

Teprotumumab for thyroid eye disease should be used cautiously in patients with IBD. In the phase 2 study for thyroid orbitopathy, two patients with pre-existing colitis showed severe exacerbations while receiving teprotumumab. These adverse events led the researchers to exclude patients with IBD from the phase 3 study and for the FDA to list IBD as a relative contraindication. It can be considered in selected patients; however, co-management with a gastroenterologist is strongly recommended.

Simultaneous use of teprotumumab with another biological agent is strongly discouraged. No data currently exists regarding potential infectious risks with concomitant treatment. Rituximab-treated patients may have depleted B-cell counts for six months following their last treatment; hence a 6-month break between the last rituximab dose and the start of teprotumumab is strongly advised. The peripheral B-cell count can be checked beforehand.
