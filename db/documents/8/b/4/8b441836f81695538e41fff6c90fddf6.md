The primary complication of prepatellar bursitis is the development of infection. Other complications are more likely to be secondary to management options, including infection due to the inoculation of bacteria from needle aspiration, a fistula between the skin surface and bursa after needle aspiration, subcutaneous atrophy as a result of corticosteroid injections, bleeding after injections, and even patellar tendon rupture.
