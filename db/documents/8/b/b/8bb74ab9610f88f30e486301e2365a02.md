Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are a group of pharmacologic agents that disrupt the signal transduction pathways of protein kinases by several modes of inhibition. This activity will review the currently available drugs, their mechanism of action, routes of administration, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the different types of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drugs and the currently available TKIs.
- Describe the mechanism of action of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
- Summarize the indications and contraindications for each type of tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
- Review the adverse effects and toxicity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
