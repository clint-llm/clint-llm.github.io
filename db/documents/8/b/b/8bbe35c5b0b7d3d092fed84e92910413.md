Final visualization of osteoprogenitor cells under the microscope involves a delicate preparation phase: the explants are fixed in 4% buffered formalin for one whole day, and samples are decalcified with 0.5 mol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (pH 8) for 7 to 10 days. The samples are deposited in paraffin, and the cross-sections of the samples are prepared with 5 um thickness at three different strata.

The samples are stained with hematoxylin/eosin and Masson/Trichrome, and both a qualitative exam for the presence of bone tissue and a quantitative exam by computerized bone histomorphometry is conducted. For each hematoxylin/eosin-stained cross-section, 3 or 4 images (adequate to fill the construct cross-sections) are required to calculate the bone tissue area and available area for tissue ingrowth (net implant area - undegraded scaffold area) by digital imaging analysis. Under the visuals of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the red color in the slides that are stained by Masson/Trichrome indicates lamellar and remodeled bone, while the blue color shows freshly deposited and immature bone.
