Multiple theories have been proposed for the pathogenesis of patellar tendinopathy, mechanical, vascular, and impingement related. However, the chronic overload theory is the most commonly reported. Repetitive overload on the knee extensor tendons will cause it to weaken progressively, eventually leading to failure. Microscopic failure occurs within the tendon at high loads and eventually leads to alterations at the cellular level, which undermine its mechanical properties. Tendon micro-trauma may cause individual fibril degeneration due to stress across the tendon. As the fibril degeneration becomes ongoing, chronic tendinopathy will ensue.

Examination of the tendon under ultrasound shows three pathologic changes. At first, there will be edema along the damaged tendon fibers. The affected tissue is swollen and thickened but still homogenous. The second is a "stage with irreversible anatomical lesions," the tendon has a heterogeneous appearance with hypoechoic and hyperechoic images without edema (granuloma). At this point, the tendinous envelope is still more or less well-defined. In the final stage of the lesion, the tendinous envelope is irregular and thickened. Its fibers appear heterogeneous, yet the swelling has disappeared.
