The embryological development of the sternum follows a highly variable pattern in terms of age and location of ossification.

Ossification of these three different sternal parts starts and completes at varying times following a craniocaudal direction. The manubrium and body begin to ossify around the 6th month of gestation and continue through the 1st postnatal year. Similarly, the ossification process of the xiphoid can continue up to the early years of childhood or late teenage (5th to 18th year).
