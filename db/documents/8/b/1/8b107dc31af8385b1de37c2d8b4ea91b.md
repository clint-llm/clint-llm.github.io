**High Risk for DVT**

- Mechanical SCDs to both legs upon admission until discharge

Heterotopic ossification prophylaxis is for extended or posterior approaches.  Heterotopic ossification prophylaxis includes an irradiation-single dose of 700 to 800 cGy delivered within 72 hours after surgery or indomethacin 25 mg three times daily beginning within 24 hours after surgery and continued for 6 weeks-contraindicated for long bone fractures at risk of nonunion.
