Use of selegiline within ten days before elective surgery is contraindicated due to adverse effects on blood pressure.

Transdermal selegiline is contraindicated for use in children younger than 12 years and patients of any age with pheochromocytoma.

Patients should discontinue transdermal selegiline for at least two weeks before starting any of the following medications: carbamazepine, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, clomipramine, imipramine, tramadol, propoxyphene, methadone, pentazocine, and dextromethorphan. Conversely, transdermal selegiline therapy should not start within five half-lives of the previously listed medications.

Oral selegiline should not be used concomitantly with cyclobenzaprine, dextromethorphan, St John's wort, methadone, propoxyphene, tramadol, and other MAO inhibitors.

Selegiline, in any form, should not be used if there is a previously identified hypersensitivity to selegiline, and all forms are contraindicated with concomitant use of the medication meperidine.

Selegiline metabolism involves many subunits of the cytochrome P450 system. The 2B6 subunit plays a significant role in metabolism, so interactions and impairments with this enzyme are clinically important. Patients with hepatic impairment may need adjustment of selegiline dosage, and selegiline ODT is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment. Likewise, selegiline ODT should be avoided in patients with less than 30 mL/min creatinine clearance.
