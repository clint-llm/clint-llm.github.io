ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a life-threatening, time-sensitive condition that requires prompt recognition, assessment, and treatment. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and thrombolysis with intravenous thrombolytics are currently available treatments for the restoration of blood flow to affected myocardium. Thrombolysis is an available treatment option for prehospital providers; however, given the risks associated with thrombolytics, care must be taken to identify patients who will benefit without undue risk. With the proliferation of PCI facilities and the regionalization of STEMI care, prehospital thrombolysis is generally a viable option where transport times to PCI or emergency department facilities is prolonged. This activity will review the indications, technique, and requirements surrounding the use of prehospital thrombolytics for STEMI.
