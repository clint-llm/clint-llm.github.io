Children hospitalized secondary to RSV infection usually recover without sequelae. They are discharged in 3 to 4 days. High-risk infants have longer hospitalizations and have higher rates of mechanical ventilation and admission to the intensive care unit.

People infected with RSV are contagious for 3 to 8 days. However, some infants, and people with weakened immune systems, can continue to spread the virus even after they stop showing symptoms for as long as 4 weeks.
