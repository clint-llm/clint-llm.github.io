The longitudinal CHARTER study is one of the most prominent clinical research studies that focus on neurocognitive deficits in persons with HIV. It investigated the incidence and predictors of neurocognitive change over 16Â to 72 months (mean 35) in 436 HIV-infected participants in the CNS HIV Anti-Retroviral Therapy Effects Research cohort. The conclusion was that neurocognitive changes were complex and depended on several factors, including HIV treatment and the extent of HIV infection and comorbid infections.

In a study of the Use of Nonantiretroviral Medications That May Impact Neurocognition, 3300 women (71% with HIV) and data from almost 42,000 visits were studied. HIV infection was associated with neurocognitive adverse effects (NC-AE) medication use, which may influence the determinations of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment. So it is advised that physicians consider the impact of NC-AE medications when evaluating patients with HIV and concurrent neurocognitive symptoms.
