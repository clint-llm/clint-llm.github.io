Streptomycin is an important antibiotic therapy primarily used to treat the infection from M. tuberculosis and other aerobic gram-negative bacteria. The MRC randomized trial of streptomycin established streptomycin as an effective therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis. However, it also highlighted the susceptibility of developing resistance with streptomycin use. Hence, using streptomycin as monotherapy is generally discouraged, and its use as a treatment for tuberculosis is always in combination with isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide. Streptomycin is an important antibiotic therapy primarily used to treat the infection from M. tuberculosis and other aerobic gram-negative bacteria. Although efficacious in this role, it is important for all interprofessional healthcare team members that utilize this medication to monitor serum levels throughout the course of treatment and be aware of developing signs of ototoxicity and/or nephrotoxicity. The patient's renal function requires assessment both before and during therapy with streptomycin. Healthcare workers should be aware of co-administering streptomycin with other potentially ototoxic or nephrotoxic agents due to the risk of synergistic toxicity.
