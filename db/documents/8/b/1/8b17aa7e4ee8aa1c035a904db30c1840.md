Nasotracheal intubation (NTI) involves passing an endotracheal tube through the naris, into the nasopharynx, and the trachea, most commonly after induction of general anesthesia in the operating room. Nasotracheal intubation permits the administration of anesthetic gases without limiting access to intraoral anatomy, and it is commonly used for dental, oropharyngeal, and maxillofacial operations.
