Tay Sachs disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. There is progressive neurological deterioration, and the seizures often remain refractory to treatment. Even with the best care, patients with infantile Tay Sach's disease usually die by age of 4 to 5 years. Death usually results from recurrent infections.

In late-onset disease, there are progressive gait difficulties and motor impairment, which often requires the use of adaptive equipment and mobility assistance.  Besides, psychiatric symptoms often remain resistant to treatment. Progressive neurological deterioration often leads to a vegetative state, and death usually occurs by 10 to 15 years of age.
