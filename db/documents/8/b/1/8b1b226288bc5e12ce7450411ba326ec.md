The majority of patients present following head trauma. The main presenting complaint is hearing loss. A full otoscopy examination should be undertaken, which may reveal blood in the external auditory canal, hemotympanum, perforated tympanic membrane, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. AlternativeÂ etiologies of hearing loss, as described above, should be excluded.

Associated findings include:

- Facial palsy

- Tinnitus

- Vertigo

- Perforated tympanic membrane
