Light microscopy with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining reveals a well-demarcated area of acanthotic epidermis with regular psoriasiform hyperplasia comprised of pale staining keratinocytes. An abrupt transition from the normal-appearing non-lesional epidermis to the paler acanthotic lesional epidermis is readily apparent. The pale keratinocytes are replete with intracellular glycogen which stains positive with periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) and are diastase sensitive. The pigmented clear cell acanthoma or melanoacanthoma histologically, as well as clinically varies from a typical clear cell acanthoma in that it shows a higher number of melanocytes and increased levels of melanin within the lesion. occurring within a clear cell acanthoma.
