Essential and fundamental to all organisms, transcription is the process for RNA synthesis from template DNA. At the heart of this activity is the large multisubunit enzyme called RNA polymerase. RNA polymerase, abbreviated RNAP and officially known as DNA-directed RNA polymerase, is found in all living organisms as well as many viruses. Present in bacteria, archaea, and even eukaryotes, these RNAPs all share similar protein core structures as well as mechanisms.
