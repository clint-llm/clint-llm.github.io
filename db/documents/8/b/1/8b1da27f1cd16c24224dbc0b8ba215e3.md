There are been no randomized trials to establish a standard of care for LP. Treatment plans should be individualized based on manifestations of disease and desire for improved cosmetic outcomes.

Systemic retinoids such as acitretin or etretinate may be effective in treating cutaneous and laryngeal lesions by decreasing the amount of hyaline-like deposits within the dermis.

There is conflicting evidence about the efficacy of long-term oral dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for the treatment of cutaneous lesions and hoarseness.

For patients with vocal cord involvement and impaired phonation, microlaryngoscopy and carbon dioxide (CO) laser procedures can be quite successful.

To minimize the appearance of scars and moniliform blepharosis, cosmetic procedures such as CO laser, dermabrasion, blepharoplasty, and erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet ablative laser have been employed.

Management of neurologic and psychiatric manifestations of LP should be tailored to each individual. Certain anti-epileptic medications can minimize seizure frequency and severity. Anti-psychotic medication can help manage behavioral changes and psychosis.
