The limb buds appear at four weeks as tiny masses on the ventrolateral body wall. Reciprocal induction of ectoderm and mesoderm forms the limb buds. Each bud is initially composed of a mass of mesenchymal cells covered by ectoderm. As the limb bud grows, it receives innervation from the last four and first three sacral metameres. As the distal limb end flattens into footplates, grooves appear in the limb. Rotation of the footplate occurs to align with the fibula and tibia by weeks 9 to 12. At the same time, the muscles start to grow on the flexor and extensor surfaces of the limb.
