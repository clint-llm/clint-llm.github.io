Drugs such as those listed previously elicit damage to renal tissue via numerous mechanisms. A few of these mechanisms include impairment of perfusion, inflammation induction, free radicals formation, and many other mechanisms.

**GFR Alteration**

- A few examples include the effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, cyclosporins, NSAIDs, and tacrolimus that affect the intraglomerular hemodynamics via the alteration of the glomerular filtration rate.

**Tubular Cell Toxicity**

- The presence of certain pharmaceutical agents may damage the cells of the proximal tubules via free radical formation, mitochondrial damage, and transport systems damage. These agents include aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, adefovir, cisplatin, and foscarnet.

**Interstitial Nephritis**

- NSAIDs and rifampin are common causes of acute interstitial tissue inflammation. Chronic forms result from agents, including analgesics, anticancer drugs, lithium, and calcineurin inhibitors.

**Crystal Nephropathy**

- Antivirals such as acyclovir and antibiotics such as ampicillin have been common etiologies of insoluble crystal formation within renal tissue.

- A more detailed list is present in tables 1-3.
