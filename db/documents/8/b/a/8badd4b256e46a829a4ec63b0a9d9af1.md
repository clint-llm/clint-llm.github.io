Tetramine is a noncompetitive GABAa channel antagonist, blocking this inhibitory chloride channel. Early studies noted similarities between tetramine and picrotoxin, another noncompetitive GABAa inhibitor.Â The chemical is classified as a cage convulsant based on its structure. The GABAa receptor is a pentameric structure composed of different subunits. Due to the potential variability in subunit composition and genetic variances within subunits, there is a large amount of heterogeneity in the subunit composition of the GABAa receptor in vertebrates.

Tetramine has a different affinity for different subunits, and further studies of this have noted that inhibition is incomplete, with a wide range of inhibition (46%-85%) dependent on the subunit makeup of the receptor it is inhibiting.

Tetramine also affects calcium dynamics in neurons and the frequency of spontaneous calcium oscillations.
