Successful performance and optimal outcomes for regional anesthesia require multidisciplinary, collaborative teamwork. Communication between the surgeon and anesthesiologist, buy-in from the surgeon, and appropriate monitoring and nursing facilities are imperative. For instance, a patient with a lumbar epidural catheter might require a urinary catheter, which calls for coordination between the surgical, anesthesia, and nursing teams.

Other areas include the timing of postoperative anticoagulation therapy and the use of ancillary medications as part of enhanced recovery after surgery protocols. The American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA) has published guidelines on the performance of regional techniques in patients receiving anticoagulant medications. Prophylactic anticoagulant therapy is commonly used in the postoperative period to prevent thromboembolic complications. A detailed description of anticoagulant management in patients receiving regional blocks is beyond the scope of this article. Still, a thorough knowledge of this is essential for safe clinical practice. The readers are referred to the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine Evidence-Based Guidelines (fourth edition) for a detailed description.
