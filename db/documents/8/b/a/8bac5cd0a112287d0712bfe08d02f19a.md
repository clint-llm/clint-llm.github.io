**Hypophosphatemia**:

Hypophosphatemia is defined as serum phosphate levels of less than 2.5 mg/dL. It can be due to any of the following mechanisms.

**.**Decreased dietary intake e.g., intestinal malabsorption, chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, and vitamin D deficiency.

**.**Increased excretion e.g., hyperparathyroidism, forced saline diuresis, genetic causes that involve proximal renal tubule i.e., Fanconi syndrome.

-  The transcellular shift from extracellular fluid to intracellular fluid e.g., treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis by insulin, refeeding syndrome

**Clinical presentation**: Mild hypophosphatemia (2 to 2.5 mg/Dl) is usually asymptomatic. Some patients present with non-specific symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and bone pain depending upon the severity and underlying disorder.

In the context of hypophosphatemia, a condition called refeeding syndrome is especially important. It develops when a chronically malnourished patient suddenly receives parenteral nutrition, which causes the release of insulin that shifts phosphate ion from extracellular fluid to intracellular fluid leading to the development of acute hypophosphatemia, the consequences of which include electrolyte imbalance, arrhythmias, muscle weakness, seizure, and encephalopathy.

**Management:**It involves the treatment of underlying cause and phosphate replacement.

**Hyperphosphatemia**:

Hyperphosphatemia, which is abnormally elevated levels of serum phosphate i.e.,> 4.5 mg/dL, is an important laboratory finding as it can have several underlying causes.

Acute phosphate load: it can develop by any of the following mechanism:

- Exogenous e.g., intake of phosphate-containing laxatives and vitamin D toxicity

- Endogenous e.g., tumor lysis syndrome, rhabdomyolysis

****Decreased phosphate excretion: it can be due to,

- Decreased filtered load e.g., kidney failure

- Abnormal tubular handing e.g., hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism

Transcellular shift from intracellular to extracellular fluid**:**diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis.

**Clinical presentation**: Most of the patients are asymptomatic, or they have symptoms of the underlying cause of hyperphosphatemia. Hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients can lead to an increased risk of vascular calcification that increases the risk of cardiovascular events.

Acute hyperphosphatemia can present with hypocalcemia symptoms because of the binding of excessive phosphate ions with calcium, thus lowering serum calcium levels. This condition leads to the development of symptoms such as muscle cramps, tetany, perioral numbness, and tingling.

**Diagnosis**: To diagnose the cause of hyperphosphatemia, it is important to do a complete blood chemistry profile, including serum calcium levels, PTH, BUN, creatinine, and vitamin D levels.

Hyperphosphatemia in the setting of abnormal BUN and creatinine values indicate chronic renal failure, which is the most common cause of hyperphosphatemia.

Low serum calcium levels indicate renal failure, hypoparathyroidism, and pseudohypoparathyroidism as the cause of hyperphosphatemia, while high calcium levels with high phosphate levels indicate vitamin D toxicity and milk-alkali syndrome.

Elevated PTH would present in renal failure or pseudohypoparathyroidism, but low PTH levels in the setting of normal renal function test indicate primary or acquired hypoparathyroidism as the cause of hyperphosphatemia.

Rarely, if the cause of hyperphosphatemia cannot be established, then a 24-hour measure of urinary phosphate is helpful in diagnosis.

Fractional renal excretion >15% indicates massive phosphate ingestion (laxative abuse) or tissue lysis. While fractional renal excretion of <15% shows impaired renal excretion of phosphate, it can happen due to impaired renal function or hypoparathyroidism.

**Management:**It involves the diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause.

-  Limit phosphate intake: in patients of chronic renal failure, phosphate binders are used to decrease gastrointestinal absorption of phosphate.

- Increased renal excretion: in patients with normal renal function, phosphate excretion can be increased by giving saline along with forced diuresis using loop diuretic such as furosemide.

**Pharmacologic use:**Phosphate ion, as a combination of sodium phosphate is used as a laxative to relieve constipation and also as a purgative for bowel preparation before colonoscopy or colon surgery. Sodium and potassium phosphate salts are used as supplements in hypophosphatemia in both intravenous and oral forms.
