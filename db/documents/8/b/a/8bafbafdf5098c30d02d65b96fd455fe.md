Danazol has been historically used to manage endometriosis and other gynecological problems, such as uterine fibroids, fibrocystic breast disease, and heavy menstrual bleeding, for which it has demonstrated greater effectiveness than other medical therapies such as progestogens, NSAIDs, and OCPs.

Recently, researchers have explored the role of danazol in various hematologic diseases, such as persistent/chronic refractory immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who failed to respond to corticosteroids or other therapies amegakaryocytic thrombocytic purpura, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, myelofibrosis, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia.
