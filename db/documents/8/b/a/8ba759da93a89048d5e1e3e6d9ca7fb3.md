The forearm provides the bony structure and muscular origins that allow the hand to operate in many orientations. The two bones of the forearm (the radius and ulna) function to allow flexion and extension at the elbow as well as at the wrist via diarthrodial joints. The radius and ulna exist in a delicate anatomical balance that allows for pronation and supination of the hand in a 180-degree arc of motion. This activity will briefly review the mechanism, diagnosis, and management of radius and ulna shaft fractures. Radius and ulna shaft fractures are one of the most common orthopedic injuries, and therefore, familiarity with these topics is necessary for the interprofessional team in both academic and community settings.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of radius and ulna shaft fractures and emergencies.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of radius and ulna shaft fractures.
- Review the management options available for radius and ulna shaft fractures.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of radius and ulna shaft fractures and improve outcomes.
