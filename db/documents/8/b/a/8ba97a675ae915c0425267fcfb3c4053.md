- RB/RB-ILD and DIP belong to the well-characterized group of smoking-related interstitial lung disease ( SR-ILD)

- DIP is distinguished from RB-ILD by its uniform homogenous pattern of pneumonitis across lung fields, as opposed to bronchiolocentric disease in RB-ILD.

- In addition, histology shows a characteristic intra-alveolar accumulation of "smokers macrophages" laden with eosinophilic cytoplasm and characteristic brown "smoker's pigment."

- Unlike UIP, the interstitial involvement is temporally homogenous and not subpleural, with fibrosis being an underwhelming feature. Honeycombing is almost never present on imaging.

- A surgical lung biopsy is the gold standard of diagnosis although Transbronchial cryobiopsy is being explored as an alternative.

- Immediate cessation of smoking or occupational exposure of suspicion holds the key to interrupting disease progression. Corticosteroids with or without additional immunosuppressants are the essence fo pharmacotherapy, with isolated reports of clarithromycin use in refractory cases.

- Twenty-five percent of patients have been reported to progress to fibrotic disease, in spite of treatment, often making it indistinguishable from NSIP.

- Continuation of smoking in adults, as well as childhood disease, is known as poor prognostic indicators.
