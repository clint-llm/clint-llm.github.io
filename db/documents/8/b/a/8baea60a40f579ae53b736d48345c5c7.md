Sphenopalatine ganglion RFA is a relatively quick, cost-effective, and safe procedure with a low complication rate that has demonstrated itself to be a useful method for treating chronic cluster headaches. Salgado-Lopez et al. from Spain published their results on the safety and efficacy of SPG RFA; they followed 37 SPG RFA patients for a mean of 68.1 months (range, 15 to 148 months) after the procedure. Five of their patients (13.5%) experienced complete clinical relief of both pain and parasympathetic symptoms; 21 patients (56.8%) had partial or transient relief, and 11 patients (29.7%) did not improve. They reported no complications in this series. The authors claim this is the largest number of patients and the longest follow-up period for SPG RFA published in the literature.

There is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, blinded-endpoint trial to test the safety and efficacy of SPG pulsed radiofrequency treatment for cluster headache underway in China. The sample size of this study is 80 patients, and follow-up is three years. This study aims to investigate whether the SPG pulsed radiofrequency ablation method is superior to a traditional SPG nerve blocking. It may also provide evidence that SPG pulsed RFA is a safe, effective and minimally invasive alternative for patients with cluster headaches who have failed medical management.
