Poliomyelitis is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by the poliovirus. This virus is highly infectious, spreading from person to person mainly through the fecal-oral route. The virus's invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) can lead to significant morbidity, including paralysis of the extremities or the diaphragm. There is no cure for polio; therefore, prevention is critical. Today the CDC recommends the polio vaccine series among the list of routine childhood vaccinations. This activity describes the mode of action of polio vaccines, including modes of administration, formulations, adverse event profiles, eligible patient populations, monitoring, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of the trivalent polio vaccine.
- Outline the schedule for polio vaccine administration.
- Review the potential adverse effects of the polio vaccine.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance polio vaccination and improve patient outcomes.
