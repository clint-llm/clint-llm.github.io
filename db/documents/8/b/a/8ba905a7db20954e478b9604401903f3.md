There are four types of hiatal hernias. However, the sliding hiatal hernia (type 1) is the most common and accounts for up to 95% of all hiatal hernias. Type 1 hiatal hernias solely involve "sliding" of the gastroesophageal (GE) junction into the thoracic cavity. Type 2 to 4 hiatal hernias are true paraesophageal hernias (PEHs) and are classified based upon on location of the GE junction as well as what has herniated into the thoracic cavity. A type 2 hiatal hernia has a GE junction in the normal anatomic position, but a portion of the stomach, most often the fundus, has herniated through the hiatus. Type 3, like type 2, have a portion of the stomach that has herniated through the hiatus, but also have an abnormal position of the GE junction in the thoracic cavity. Type 4 has an abnormal GE junction position like type 1 and 3. However, another organ, most often a portion of the colon, has herniated into the thoracic cavity.
