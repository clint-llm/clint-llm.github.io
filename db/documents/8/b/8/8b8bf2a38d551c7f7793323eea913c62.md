Technetium-99m (Tc99m) can be administered both in adults and children. Extra precautions should be taken with children as the pediatric population is at higher risk for radiation exposure compared to adults. In contrast, new mothers with exposure to technetium-99m agents at their workplace do not require special precautions other than the general protective care from radiation exposure.
