About 50% of the patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis are asymptomatic on presentation, and they are diagnosed after abnormal liver function tests are found when tested for other reasons. The majority of patients are males in the third or fourth decade of life.

Most patients complain of right upper quadrant abdominal pain (20%) and pruritus (10%), which might be episodic, fatigue, and jaundice (6%). Pruritus can be extremely disabling, leading to severe excoriations and a decreased quality of life. Weight loss may also be reported at presentation. Late symptoms or symptoms of advanced liver disease include jaundice, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, ascites, and confusion.

Physical examination may reveal hepatomegaly (44% of patients), splenomegaly (39%), jaundice, and excoriations from pruritus.

The development of fever, chills, and right upper quadrant pain with or without jaundice indicates the development of bacterial cholangitis, which may occur sporadically.
