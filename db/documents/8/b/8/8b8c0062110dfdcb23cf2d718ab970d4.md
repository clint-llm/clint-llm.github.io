Serial monitoring of iron stores can prevent iron overload in patients on chronic transfusion therapy. Serum ferritin levels should be monitored every three months, and a serum iron panel should be done once a year. It is recommended to monitor liver and cardiac iron (either by biopsy or MRI) annually and every 3-6 months in patients with heart failure and intensive chelation therapy.
