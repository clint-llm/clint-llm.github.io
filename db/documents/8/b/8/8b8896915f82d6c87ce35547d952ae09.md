The caudate nucleus has implications in several neurocognitive impairments and dementia pathologies. The degree of dementia and neuropsychological performance in Parkinson’s disease has correlations to the degree of loss of dopaminergic neurons projecting to the caudate nucleus. While the putamen is more severely affected in Parkinson disease than the caudate nucleus, early deficits in working memory are tied to lower levels of caudate nucleus activity in patients with Parkinson’s disease. Similarly, the degree of caudate nucleus atrophy and caudate nucleus D2 receptor binding potentials of those with Huntington disease (a condition resulting in striatum atrophy) correlate with performance on executive tasks.

The caudate nucleus also implications in various psychiatric conditions, including multiple disorders involving impulse-control and hyperactivity. The activity of the caudate nucleus increases in the left head during manic states in bipolar disorder.

Other interesting clinical correlations include speech disturbances, chorea-acanthocytosis, and migraine with aura. Research shows that children who stutter have lower right caudate nucleus volume as compared to controls.
