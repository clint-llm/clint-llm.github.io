In week 4, the development of the urinary tract (Kidney, Ureter, Bladder) begins with pronephros, mesonephros, and metanphros, which form from the nephrogenic cord.

The stalk of the ureteric bud, which is a diverticulum from the mesonephric duct, gives rise to the ureter. The ureteric bud is regulated by different molecular pathways including GDNF-RET, BMP4(bone morphogenic protein 4), and Gremlin. There is a fine balance between ureteric bud growth and ureteric stalk elongation. This concerted effort to suppress ureteric bud development while also stimulating the elongation of the ureteric stalk is achieved by BMP4. And Gremlin secretion inhibits BMP4 and thus stimulates ureteric bud development. This finely orchestrated balance ensures that a single ureteric bud develops from each nephrogenic cord.

The bud branches near the cranial aspect into the collecting tubules which become confluent and form the major calyces.

Disruptions in the embryologic development can cause conganital abnormalitis of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT).
