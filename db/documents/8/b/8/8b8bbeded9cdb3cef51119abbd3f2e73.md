The use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers has greatly increased compliance to hand hygiene in healthcare settings. They are efficient, accessible, and take relatively little time to use. Even though there are some situations where they are perhaps less effective than standard soap and water, it may be worth the trade-off if using ABHS results in more consistent hand hygiene. Guidelines regarding the use of soap and water instead of ABHS can be established, keeping in mind the prevalent pathogens in a particular setting.
