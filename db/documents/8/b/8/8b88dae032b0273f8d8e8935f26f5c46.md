Musculoskeletal pain is a common complaint that many primary-care and pain providers diagnose and treat regularly. Treating pain with a multimodal approach is paramount in providing safe and effective results for patients. Trigger point injections can be an effective primary or adjunctive therapy aimed at decreasing pain in the musculoskeletal system. By targeting specific points of myofascial pain, clinicians can directly treat pathologic tissue, address a patient's pain generator, and break the pain cycle with little to no side effects. Patients can have significant improvement in range of motion and overall functionality, without the need for taking pain medications. Meaningful results can be provided with trigger point injections and should merit consideration as a treatment modality in the appropriate setting.
