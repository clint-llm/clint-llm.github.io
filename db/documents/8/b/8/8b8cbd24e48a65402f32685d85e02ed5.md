There are relatively few contraindications to the Dix-Hallpike maneuver; however, providers need to consider the patientâ€™s physical anatomy and neck mobility concerning their ability to tolerate the quick actions and movements required to perform the maneuver. Patients with cervical spinal stenosis or limited cervical mobility may not tolerate the procedure well due to the quick cervical spine rotation and hyperextension needed for success.

In a small study of 50 emergency physicians, barriers that contributed to decreased use of either the Dix-Hallpike maneuver or Epley maneuver included negative experiences associated with performing it, forgetting how to perform the maneuver, or relying on a history of present illness to diagnose BPPV. Overall, these physicians still had positive experiences with utilizing the Dix-Hallpike or Epley maneuvers.
