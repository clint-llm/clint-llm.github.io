The prognosis of neutropenia disorders depends on the cause and organs involved. CGD has a better prognosis if allogeneic bone marrow transplantation can successfully achieve. Neutropenia due to chemotherapy or drugs may cause remission once the treatment is over. Some primary defects of neutrophil functions affect the prognosis, where devastating fatal diseases can lead to death at a young age.

Serious infections occur in a significant number of patients with neutropenia, and many require repeated admissions. Without treatment, neutropenia is associated with a high risk of death.
