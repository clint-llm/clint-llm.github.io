The aim of Leopold maneuvers isÂ to determine the fetal presentation and position by systematically palpating the gravid abdomen. The initial steps are described below:

- Wash hands

- Explain the steps of the examination to the patient as this reduces anxiety and enhances cooperation

- Obtain consent

- The patient should be advised to void as an empty bladder promotes comfort and allows for more productive examination, and the distended bladder can obscure fetal contour

- Provision of privacy

- Prepare the equipment, such as measuring tape, Pinard stethoscope or Doppler transducer, and ultrasound gel

- Position the patient supine with the head of the bed raised to 15 degrees, and a small pillow or rolled towel placed on her right side

- Adequate exposure of the gravid abdomen from the xiphisternum to the pubic symphysis

- Inspect the gravid abdomen
