# Introduction

The World Health Organization recognizes palliative care as a method of improving quality of life by preventing and treating pain and other physical, psychosocial, and spiritual issues.

# Function

The publication of “To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System” in 1999 revealed concerning statistics about patient safety, including that an estimated 98,000 people die in hospitals due to medical errors.

# Curriculum Development

While most palliative care simulation experiences are with standardized patients, there are other methods of simulation for palliative medicine that have been identified. Two that have been discussed are the sociodramatic method and the virtual patient.

Some consider that high fidelity simulation, including mannequins and virtual reality, should be used more frequently as live actors can be costly.

Additional findings from Kozhevnikov et al.’s review of palliative care simulation found that primary skills addressed over the 78 studies were eliciting treatment preferences (50%), providing bad news (41%), and empathy skills (40%). Only 13% of studies reviewed symptom management, although the studies they evaluated included learners in medicine and nursing.

# Clinical Clerkships

Developing a curriculum for SBME is a complex task that has been studied for over 20 years. Per Motola et al., establishing such a curriculum requires consideration of the following educational principles: feedback, curriculum integration, deliberate practice, mastery learning, range of difficulty, capturing clinical variation, individualized learning, and approaches to team training.

A successful medical simulation is most effective when it is integrated into the curriculum of the learner.

Palliative care is a specialty that requires effective communication.

Debriefing is another crucial part of SBME. An effective debriefing allows learners to reflect on their experiences and learn from them adequately. A studied method of debriefing sessions for medical simulations includes the 3 Ps: Planning, Pre-brief, and Providing feedback.

First, it is important to plan for how the debriefing will take place. Palliative care debriefing sessions should have a debriefer who can help cope with emotionally stressful situations. It has been shown that an effective debriefer can help students cope with their feelings about palliative care. Additionally, students should be able to freely talk about their feelings in debriefing sessions as it can normalize their own emotions.

Next, Pre-briefing is the explanation of expectations to participants before beginning the simulation.

# Clinical Significance

Palliative care is a vital part of the medical curriculum. Palliative care has found an important role in the modern age as early utilization of palliative care correlates with improved quality of life, mood, and survival.

Palliative care simulation plays an important role in the eyes of medical trainees. An internal survey among Internal Medicine Program Directors found that 87.5% of respondents felt that having training in palliative care was "very important."

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Palliative care is best delivered when all members of the health care team work together. Nurses are important as they are coordinating care for patients and families while tailoring their care for each patient differently.
