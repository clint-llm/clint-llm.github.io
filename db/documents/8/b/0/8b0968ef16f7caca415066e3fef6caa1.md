There are some epidemiological studies suggesting that ionizing radiation and some radiofrequency waves can increase the chance of redeveloping high-grade gliomas. However, these studies lack specificity to gliomas. However, advances in the molecular biology and genetics of gliomas have revealed that low-grade gliomas transform into high-grade gliomas by altering the genetic makeup of low-grade gliomas. Therefore, one can hypothesize that environmental and treatment-related toxicokinetics can play a role in the transformation of low-grade gliomas.
