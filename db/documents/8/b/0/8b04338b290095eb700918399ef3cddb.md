# Continuing Education Activity

Primary intraocular lymphoma is a subset of the primary central nervous system lymphoma characterized by monoclonal proliferation of lymphocytes. It is a very rare ocular neoplasm with high morbidity and mortality. This activity describes the signs useful in the evaluation and treatment of primary intraocular lymphoma. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of primary intraocular lymphoma.
- Summarize the relevant history and clinical findings of patients with primary intraocular lymphoma.
- Review the evaluation process of patients with primary intraocular lymphoma.
- Outline the management and interprofessional care of patients with primary intraocular lymphoma.

# Introduction

Primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL) is a rare ocular malignancy and is considered as a subset of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) with ocular involvement.

Secondary intraocular lymphoma arises outside the central nervous system or eye and later metastasizes to the eye.

# Etiology

The etiopathogenesis of primary intraocular lymphoma is still not well understood.

**Chemokine theory –**B cell chemokines such as B-lymphocyte chemoattractant (BLC) and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) present in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) attract lymphoma cells from the choroidal circulation to RPE.

**Infection theory**– Infectious agents are known to cause lymphocyte proliferation which later turns into clonal proliferation. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of the B lymphocytes results in uncontrolled proliferation of the lymphocytes in the absence of T- suppressor lymphocytes in immunodeficiency states such as AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).

# Epidemiology

The exact epidemiology of PIOL is not known. Most of the available data relates to a larger group of primary central nervous system lymphoma. PCNSL accounts for 1 to 2% of all extranodal lymphomas and 3 to 5% of primary CNS (central nervous system) tumors.

Primary intraocular lymphoma usually occurs in adults from the third to eighth decade of life, with a mean age of presentation in the fifth and sixth decades of life.

# Pathophysiology

Most primary intraocular lymphomas originate from B lymphocytes (late germinal or post germinal center).

# History and Physical

Primary intraocular lymphoma is a great masquerader and can mimic nonspecific uveitis. The delay between the onset of symptoms (ocular or CNS) and a positive diagnosis usually varies from 4 to 40 months.

**Ophthalmic Findings**

The most common symptom is a painless blurring of vision or a complaint of floaters. The disease is bilateral in 80% of the individuals and is asymmetric in presentation.

Creamy lesions with yellowish-orange subretinal or sub-RPE infiltrate may be seen, leading to "leopard skin pigmentation" over the lesions.

**Central Nervous System (CNS) Findings******

The new onset of seizures indicates CNS involvement in a case of PIOL.

# Evaluation

- 
**Imaging**

- 
**Biopsy & analysis**

- 
**Blood tests**

- Optical coherence tomography (OCT)

- Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA)

- Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA)

- Fundus autofluorescence (FAF)

- Ultrasonography (USG)

- Neuroimaging

- Histopathology

- Immunohistochemistry

- Cytokine analysis

- Polymerase chain reaction

**I. Imaging**

- **Optical coherence tomography (OCT):**It is helpful to demonstrate or analyze lesions at the posterior pole. Findings include nodular hyperreflective lesions in the retinal pigment epithelial layer corresponding to subretinal and sub-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) lymphoma deposits (**Figure 1**).

- **Fundus Fluorescein angiography (FFA):**Findings in FFA include small hypofluorescent lesions in the early and late phase corresponding to infiltrates masking the choroidal fluorescence, with late staining at the level of RPE in another series.

- **Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA):**It shows small hypofluorescent lesions in the early phase, which become less apparent in late phases. The hypofluorescent lesions are more numerous in FFA compared to ICGA.

- **Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF):**Sub-RPE pigment clumps that give rise to "leopard spotting" appearance are hyperautofluorescent, whereas white lesions above the RPE are hypoautofluorescent.

- **Ocular ultrasound:**There are no definitive findings of PIOL on ocular ultrasonography. The most common ultrasound findings in the case of PIOL include vitreous echoes, elevated chorioretinal lesions, and retinal detachment.

- **Neuroimaging:**Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging of the brain show unifocal or multifocal periventricular, homogenously contrast-enhancing lesions.

**II. Biopsy and Analysis**

The definitive diagnosis depends on the demonstration of the malignant lymphoma cells in the ocular specimens (vitreous, aqueous, chorioretinal biopsy) or the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

**Ocular Biopsy**

**Technique:**Techniques of ocular biopsy include fine-needle aspiration of vitreous via pars plana (21G to 25G), pars plana vitrectomy, transscleral biopsy for subretinal lesions, anterior chamber tap, and enucleation. Vitrectomy has added advantage of clearing vitreous debris, maximizing sample collection, and access to subretinal space, although there is a risk of extension of lymphoma through the sclerotomy site to peribulbar space.

Techniques to increase the diagnostic yield include

- Any corticosteroid use should be discontinued for at least two weeks before the biopsy.

- Precautions during vitrectomy include the use of large-bore cutters and a low cut rate to reduce the shearing of cells.

- Collect undiluted fresh vitreous with infusion off.

- Since lymphoma cells undergo morphological degeneration within 60 minutes, the sample should be transported to the laboratory quickly.

- Fixation of the sample in HOPE (HEPES-glutamic acid buffer-mediated Organic solvent Protection Effect) solution may increase the yield.

**Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and Brain Biopsy**

A lumbar puncture can be done to obtain CSF in cases with suspected PCNSL. In cases with a positive yield on CSF and if an intraocular lesion suspicious of PIOL is present, the need for ocular tissue biopsy is less important unless the intraocular process does not respond to the treatment initiated.

**Analysis**

- ****Histopathology:****Histopathological analysis reveals a monoclonal population of large B cells with scanty cytoplasm, high nuclear: cytoplasmic ratio, hypersegmented round, oval, or clover-shaped nuclei with coarse chromatin pattern, and prominent or multiple nucleoli (**Figure 2**).

- **Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry:**The presence of a monoclonal population of a single immunophenotype supports the histopathological diagnosis. Most cases of PIOL are monoclonal B cell lymphomas and stain positively for B cell markers like CD19, CD20, CD 22, and germinal center markers such as BCL 6 and CD 10.

- **Cytokines**: B cells secrete high amounts of interleukin (IL) IL-10, an immunosuppressive cytokine.

- **Polymerase chain reaction (PCR):**In cases of PIOL, monoclonality of the B cell population can be detected using framework regions (FR)- FR2, FR3, and complementarity determining regions 3 (CDR3) primers.

Given the paucity of vitreous available for testing, the histopathological analysis gets precedence, and the supernatant sample can be sent for cytokine analysis.

**III. Blood tests:**These are basically done to rule out infective causes of uveitis such as syphilis, tuberculosis, herpes, toxoplasmosis, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) status; inflammatory disorders such as sarcoidosis, Vogt Koyanagi Harada disease, Behçet, and also to look at side-effects of systemic chemotherapy.

# Treatment / Management

Treatment goals include controlling the local disease along with preventing CNS dissemination. Treatment modalities include intravitreal injections, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, used alone or in combination. Chemotherapy is considered the first-line therapy for PCNSL.

**Local Therapy**

**Intravitreal Methotrexate (MTX)**

**Dose:**0.4 mg in 0.1 ml

**Indications:**

- Unilateral/Bilateral PIOL

- In combination with systemic chemotherapy for PVRL with CNS involvement

- Relapsed PIOL

- Ocular relapse of PCNSL

The therapeutic dose of intravitreal MTX is maintained in the vitreous for five days.

The common complications of intravitreal MTX include cataracts, corneal epitheliopathy and maculopathy, limbal stem cell damage, optic atrophy, and sterile endophthalmitis.

**Intravitreal Rituximab**

**Dose:**1 mg in 0.1 ml

It is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, given as an intravitreal injection. There is a lack of standardization of treatment schedules varying from a single injection to multiple injections at variable intervals.

**Radiation Therapy**

External beam radiotherapy is given to patients with PIOL without CNS involvement.

Whole-brain radiotherapy is added with ocular radiotherapy in cases with CNS dissemination and who do not respond to systemic chemotherapy or cannot tolerate aggressive therapies.

**Vitrectomy**

In cases with significant cellular load, this can be considered as an adjunct therapy for debulking.

**Systemic Therapy**

**Chemotherapy**

Chemotherapy is the mainstay of the treatment - usually used in combination with radiation therapy or can also be used alone as primary therapy. The main barrier to systemic chemotherapy is penetration via the blood-brain barrier and blood-ocular barrier. Methotrexate and Cytosine arabinoside penetrate the blood-ocular barrier and are commonly used.

**Route**– Intravenous, Intrathecal****

**Methotrexate (MTX)**

High-dose methotrexate can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, with a complete response rate of 50 to 80%,

Systemic MTX can cause ocular complications like periorbital edema, increased lacrimation, photophobia, blepharitis, conjunctival hyperemia, and photophobia.

**Cytosine Arabinoside (Ara-C)**

Cytosine Arabinoside, also used as a chemotherapeutic agent, can penetrate the ocular blood barrier.

**Rituximab**

Intravenous rituximab is usually given along with methotrexate in cases with relapse/ recurrences of PVRL in the dose of 375mg/sqm.****

**Combination Chemotherapy**

A combination of MTX and Ara-C was used in patients with both ocular and CNS disease by Valluri et al.

Autologous stem cell transplantation is done in cases of refractory or recurrent PCNSL and PIOL after a course of intensive chemotherapy to rescue from systemic side effects of high-dose chemotherapy.

**Drugs Under Ongoing Trials******

**Pomalidomide**

It's a thalidomide-based agent, usually used for systemic diffuse large B cell lymphoma with better penetration to CNS. It has been tried along with dexamethasone systemically for recurrent or refractory CNS and vitreoretinal lymphoma with promising results. The dose-escalation schedule of pomalidomide that followed was 3,5,7,10 mg orally daily for 21 days every 28 days and dexamethasone 40 mg every week.

**Ibrutinib**

It is an orally administered agent with significant penetration of the blood ocular/CNS barrier.

**Lenalidomide plus Rituximab**

Lenalidomide and rituximab combination has shown promising results in recurrent/ relapsing PCNSL.

**Chemoradiation**

Combining chemotherapy with radiation can be used as primary therapy or as salvage therapy in PIOL.

# Differential Diagnosis

Diagnosis of PIOL is very challenging as various infectious and non-infectious diseases can mimic the clinical condition. Various differentials include

**Inflammatory Diseases**

- Posterior uveitis/panuveitis

- Intermediate uveitis

- Sarcoidosis

- Vogt Koyanagi Harada disease

- Behçet disease

- Multifocal choroiditis

- Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome

- Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy

- Birdshot choroidopathy

- Serpiginous chorioretinopathy

- Frosted branch angiitis

**Infectious Diseases**

- Tubercular uveitis

- Endophthalmitis

- Syphilis

- Toxoplasmosis

- Acute retinal necrosis

- Herpetic uveitis

**Neoplasms**

- Amelanotic melanoma

- Metastatic cancers

In a study, the most useful signs to differentiate lymphoma from simulating conditions listed above were – better vision, less anterior chamber flare, less posterior synechiae, and less optic disc swelling, retinal vasculitis, or disc involvement.

# Treatment Planning

The treatment plan for the management of PIOL is varied, and no common consensus is available. The protocol suggested by Pulido et al. for treatment has been discussed in the following figures (**Figures 3, 4, and 5**).

# Prognosis

PIOL with CNS involvement has a poor ocular prognosis due to the intrinsic aggressive nature of the disease. In PIOL, the mortality rate ranges from 9 to 81% in a follow-up period from 12 to 35 months.

The IELSG score used for PCNSL prognostication is valid only for PVRL with CNS involvement.

In a study by Grimm et al., the patients after receiving a mix of therapies had a median survival of 31 months and median progression-free survival of 18 months, with ocular therapy causing no improvement in chances of survival.

# Complications

Unlike other posterior uveitides, which PIOL masquerades, if not detected and treated early, it may progress to CNS involvement with high fatality rates. The use of chemotherapeutic agents to treat the disease presents its own set of systemic and local complications such as pancytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, dry eye, cataract, and radiation retinopathy.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients diagnosed with primary intraocular lymphoma should be informed about the risk of central nervous system involvement and its symptoms such as behavioral change, new onset of seizures, hemiparesis, and ataxia.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Due to the high correlation between PIOL and PCNSL, collaboration with a neuro-oncologist, when available, enhances patient care. Baseline screening and periodic evaluation to look for PCNSL by neurologists help identify cases with high-risk mortality and early initiation of aggressive systemic chemotherapy. An ocular pathologist should be consulted before collecting any diagnostic specimens to help handle and process the specimen appropriately.
