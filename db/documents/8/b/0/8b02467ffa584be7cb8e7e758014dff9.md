The most feared complication of pediatric DKA is cerebral injury/cerebral edema:

- Develops in 0.3%-0.9% of pediatric DKA cases.

- Mortality ranges from 21-24%

- Risk factors:  Severe acidosis, severe dehydration, elevated blood pressure, markedly elevated BUN

- Etiology:  Unclear, however initially thought to be to due rapid IV fluid replacement but this is now controversial as a recent PECARN study in 2018 showed no difference in neurological outcomes.

- Presents at any time before, during, or after treatment, but typically onset is within 12 hours of treatment.

- Signs/Symptoms:  Altered mental status, new headache, recurrent vomiting, urinary incontinence, Cushing Triad (bradycardia, irregular respirations, hypertension)

- Cerebral Edema may not initially be seen on CT imaging of the brain, therefore may still require starting treatment even if the CT head is normal.

- Treat if high suspicion:

- Mannitol (0.5-1 g/kg IV over 15 minutes): Osmotic diuretic causing withdrawing water from the brain parencyma. May give a second dose if there is no initial response.
- Hypertonic (3%) saline 2.5 mL/kg over 30 minutes

- Neurosurgical consultation

Other Complications include:

- Cognitive impairment

- Venous thrombosis

- Pancreatic enzyme elevations

- Acute kidney injury

- Hypokalemia

- Hypoglycemia

- Rhabdomyolysis

- Pulmonary edema

- Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome

- Cardiac arrhythmias
