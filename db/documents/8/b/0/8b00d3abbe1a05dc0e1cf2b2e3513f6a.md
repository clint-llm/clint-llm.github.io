The most important preventative measure is patient education.  If the patient should be made aware about the importance of good glycemic control, proper care of the foot, avoiding tobacco and the need for frequent follow-up examinations, then the risk for developing ulcer is significantly reduced.  The patient should be reminded of these things during each visit with the primary care physician.
