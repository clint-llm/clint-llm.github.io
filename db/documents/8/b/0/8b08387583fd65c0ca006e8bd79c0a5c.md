Dens evaginatus/talon cusps have a good prognosis with appropriate management. When less severe, patients may be unaware of their presence, while more severe cases may warrant more invasive intervention. As long as proper restorative or endodontic protocol is followed, teeth that present with dens evaginatus have a good prognosis.

Dens invaginatus have a good prognosis with appropriate management. Due to the altered tooth structure, teeth with this condition should be regularly monitored for early signs of caries to prevent more invasive dental treatment measures.

Amelogenesis imperfecta, as well as dentinogenesis imperfecta, has a good prognosis with appropriate management. In cases where patients are asymptomatic or do not express an esthetic concern, most patients will have a good quality of life with no or little treatment. More involved cases may require more invasive or multi-disciplinary treatment, which can potentially change the prognosis.
