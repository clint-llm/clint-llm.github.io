The term "robotic surgery" refers to the use of programmable devices to perform a wide variety of surgical tasks. These are not intended to replace the surgeon but rather to provide assistance. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluation and treatment using robotic assistance to perform knee arthroplasty.

**Objectives:**
- Review the technique of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
- Summarize outcomes between conventional jig-based total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and robotic-assisted TKA.

- Describe the benefits of robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
