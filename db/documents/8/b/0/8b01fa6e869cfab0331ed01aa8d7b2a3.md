Foremost a surgeon with an adequate skill level for exploration and removal is required. An anesthetic operating department practitioner (ODP), surgical scrub nurse, and an un-scrubbed member of the surgical team are needed.

If being performed in the emergency department, the surgeon may have to rely on a junior surgical colleague for support and assistance.
