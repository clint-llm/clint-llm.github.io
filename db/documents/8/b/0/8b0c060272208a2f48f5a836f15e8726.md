Diagnosis can be made by an experienced physician in endemic areas but may be difficult in other areas of the world. In nonendemic areas, the diagnosis will require a high index of suspicion. A non-tender, beefy-red ulcerative lesion that bleeds easily located in or around the genitalia should raise the diagnostic suspicion of granuloma inguinale.

The diagnosis is confirmed by identifying Donovan bodies in a tissue smear. PCR testing is possible but not widely available. It is seen in the research setting and often used during eradication programs. There are serologic tests that can be used for population studies, but they are not accurate enough to diagnose an individual.
