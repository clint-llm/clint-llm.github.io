Imaging confirms fracture severity, determines stability, and guides the treatment approach. Plain radiographs should be obtained before and after reduction, if necessary. The standard radiographs include posteroanterior and lateral views of the wrist, as well as oblique views for further fracture definition. Oblique views are useful to help evaluate articular involvement, particularly the lunate fossa fragment. Contralateral wrist views may evaluate the patient’s normal ulnar variance and scapholunate angle. Computed tomography scan may demonstrate the extent of intraarticular involvement. It is important to know normal radiographic measurements of the distal radius because it is useful in identifying distal radius fractures. These measurements are also useful in determining treatment.

Important normal radiographic relationships include

- Radial inclination: Average of 23 degrees

- Radial height: Average of 11 mm

- Volar tilt: Average of 11 degrees
