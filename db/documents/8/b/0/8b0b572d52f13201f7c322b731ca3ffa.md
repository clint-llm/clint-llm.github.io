In the acute setting, early surgical consultation is mandatory as a delay in diagnosis and intervention is life-threatening. Gastroenterology can assist with palliative/endoscopic management for select patients, and Interventional Radiology may be necessary for percutaneous intervention. In the chronic or subacute setting, when intervention can sustain delay for nutritional and medical optimization, hematology and nutritional medicine are meaningful consultations to consider.
