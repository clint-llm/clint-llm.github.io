# Continuing Education Activity

Normal versus chronic adaptations to aerobic exercises occur as a natural response to acute bouts of aerobic exercise and prolonged periods of training. The cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems are the two main organ systems affected during aerobic exercise. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing individuals with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the differences in acute and chronic cardiovascular adaptations to aerobic exercise.
- Explain the differences in acute and chronic musculoskeletal adaptations to aerobic exercise.
- Describe the impact of aerobic exercise on cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes mellitus.
- Identify the overall goal of the interprofessional team to identify acute and chronic cardiovascular and musculoskeletal adaptations to aerobic exercise.

# Introduction

Effective aerobic exercise has been shown to elicit adaptations at both the molecular and macroscopic levels. These adaptations profoundly impact the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems (the two most affected organ systems), enabling more efficient oxygen delivery, endurance capacity, and improved performance. When implemented consistently for prolonged periods of time, aerobic exercise may lead to chronic adaptations with beneficial clinical outcomes.

This review will define an acute adaptation as any change that occurs within 30 days, or 1 month, following at least one episode of aerobic exercise. A chronic adaptation will be defined as any change occurring after 30 days of onset of regular training. Using these definitions, we will examine the cardiovascular system and musculoskeletal system changes and the relevant clinical changes that occur within these domains.

# Issues of Concern

**Normal (Acute) Adaptions**

**Cardiovascular**

**Changes in Cardiac Output**

The ultimate goal of the cardiovascular response to acute aerobic exercise is to maximize cardiac output and match the metabolic demands of the musculoskeletal system.

In the acute setting, adjustments in stroke volume are reflected by changes within the left ventricle. During exercise, an increase in primarily left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume augment stroke volume; however, a reduction in left ventricular end-systolic volume may also play a small role. Various factors have been shown to affect LV end-diastolic volume, including heart rate, intrinsic myocardial relaxation, ventricular compliance, ventricular filling pressures, atrial contraction, and pericardial and pulmonary constraints.

**Changes in Blood Volume**

Mechanisms inherent to blood volume and blood mass also allow the body to adapt following aerobic exercise. One way exercise may lead to increased blood volume is through activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone cascade. Activation of this hormonal pathway causes water retention by the kidneys and increases plasma albumin, causing hypervolemia.

During blood volume expansion, it is hypothesized that exercise augments erythropoiesis by way of androgen production. Androgens cause an increase in catecholamine and cortisol levels, leading to further erythropoietin (EPO) release and reticulocyte production.

**Blood Pressure**

It has been well documented that consistent aerobic training reduces blood pressure in both the long and short term - in some cases as quickly as a few hours following one bout of exercise. A meta-analysis by Carpio-Rivera et al. demonstrated an average reduction of systolic blood pressure (sBP) by -4.8 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (dBP) by -3.2 mmHg following one exercise session and continued reductions of sBP by -3.2 mmHg and dBP by -1.8 mmHg up to 24 hours after exercise.

The mechanism for this is likely due to aerobic exercise's effect on parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous activity, nitric oxide (NO), the prostanoid system, the renin-angiotensin system, and vascular remodeling.

Consequently, greater amounts of nitric oxide induce more vasodilation and decrease blood pressure. Some studies have also shown exercise increases levels of prostacyclins, which may have an additional vasodilator effect. However, evidence supporting this is limited at the moment.

**Musculoskeletal**

**Changes in Mitochondria**

Aerobic exercise has also been shown to initiate cellular and molecular changes to improve oxidative capacity. One of the main cellular modes of improving oxidative capacity is by increasing both the number and size of mitochondria.

The timing of adaptation is likely dependent on the training history of subjects and the type of aerobic exercise (endurance training versus high-intensity interval training (HIIT)) (Hughes 2018). In either case, the same mechanisms are thought to be responsible for these adaptations. Exercise has been shown to induce peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)−1α transcription. During aerobic exercise, an increase in PGC-1α results in more mitochondria biogenesis and density, which subsequently improves glucose and fatty acid oxidation.

Since being discovered as the original tumor suppressor protein, p53 has been shown to have additional roles in mitochondria biogenesis by modulating transcription factors and altering the mitochondrial genome.

**Muscle Capillary Characteristics**

An increase in cardiac output would decrease the efficiency of oxygen uptake at muscle cells without muscle capillary growth. To accommodate for the drastic magnification in cardiac output, muscle capillaries undergo rapid growth. Most of the growth appears to occur within the first weeks of training before plateauing after about four weeks.

Capillary growth is thought to occur mainly by shear stress and passive stretch. In shear stress, capillaries undergo longitudinal splitting resulting in two new parallel capillaries. With passive stretch, capillary growth occurs primarily through angiogenesis, where new capillaries sprout from existing capillaries.

**Glucose Metabolism In Muscle**

Aerobic exercise has been linked to increased insulin sensitivity within skeletal muscle, which plays a large role in glucose metabolism as both a consumer of glucose and a storer of glucose (glycogen). Magkos et al. reported that a single episode of exercise improved insulin sensitivity from 12-48 hours after exercise.

GLUT4 is an insulin-stimulated transporter protein responsible for glucose uptake in muscle cells. On a molecular level, low to moderate aerobic exercise at <70% VO2 max has been linked to more production of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) - a sign transducer involved in glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, possibly through increased GLUT4 translocation.

**Chronic Adaptations**

**Cardiovascular**

**Structural Heart Changes**

Over time, regular exercise causes the heart to undergo structural change and accommodate the homeostatic needs of the individual. In the cardiovascular system, this occurs through the increased end-diastolic right (RV) and left ventricular (LV) volume, LV hypertrophy and mass, and left atrium (LA) volume.

**Heart Rate Changes**

At rest and submaximal exercise, a trained individual's heart rate will be lower due to an increase in vagal tone and increased parasympathetic activity.

**Arterial Characteristics**

As cardiac output increases, there is increased perfusion through the musculoskeletal system. In order to adapt to changes in blood flow, arteries and arterioles undergo remodeling in response to hemodynamic factors. As perfusion increases, arteries increase in diameter and reduce the wall thickness to augment blood volume carrying capacity.

Studies have shown that shear stress, the frictional force on the vascular endothelium, is the main driver that induces artery enlargement. One way it does this is through increased nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. NO acts directly on smooth muscle cells within arterial walls to cause vasodilation and can also promote vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leading to angiogenesis and more arterial growth.

**Musculoskeletal**

**Muscle Hypertrophy and Myofibrillar Adaptations**

Similar to resistance training, aerobic endurance training has been shown to elicit muscle hypertrophy and growth.

Studies have shown that previously sedentary participants who performed cycling for 12 weeks using these protocols saw an increase in up to 11% muscle mass.

Lastly, there is thought to be a dampening of catabolic pathways from aerobic exercise, which may help create a positive muscle protein balance. Both FOXO3a and myostatin, regulators of intracellular protein degradation and skeletal muscle atrophy, have been shown to be significantly reduced following 12 weeks of aerobic exercise in older women. This suggests one possible molecular mechanism is to alter protein breakdown, although more studies need to be performed to determine further mechanisms.

# Clinical Significance

In due time, the chronic adaptations of aerobic exercise have an immense impact on all of the body’s organ systems. However, for the sake of consistency and scope, we will focus on the clinical effects of these adaptations on 2 common major disease processes: cardiovascular disease and Type II diabetes mellitus.

**Cardiovascular Diseases**

In 2019, the American Heart Association released a set of guidelines for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. One of these recommendations involves “engag[ing] in at least 150 minutes per week of accumulated moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity physical activity”.

Another meta-analysis by Cornelissen and Smart reported that endurance training had the potential to decrease sBP 6-12 mmHg and dBP 3-6 mmHg in individuals with hypertension.

**Type II Diabetes Mellitus**

The American Diabetes Association noted in their 2016 position statement that individuals should perform “at least 150 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity spread out over 3 to 7 days with no more than 2 consecutive days between exercise bouts”.

A meta-analysis performed by Boule et al. reported 20 weeks of moderate to vigorous exercise (50 to 75% VO2 max) resulted in decreased Hgb A1c.

Other studies have yielded similar findings, noting aerobic exercise may improve intraepidermal nerve fiber density and peripheral nerve function.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

The primary role of acute and chronic adaptations in aerobic exercise is to optimize an individual's cardiovascular system to meet musculoskeletal needs for the human body. This occurs mostly through increased efficiency of the heart and optimization of metabolism. A proper exercise prescription and delivery of the correct information may enhance the ability of an individual to experience clinically significant changes in a timely manner. During evaluation for exercise prescription, a physician will

- Educate the patient about the intended benefits

- Set relevant, achievable personal goals

- Motivate the individual to help reach the established goals

An additional team member such as a trainer, certified by an organization such as the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), may also be involved in the patient's care. These individuals help optimize training frequency, duration, and intensity and ensure proper form to prevent injury.
