While the patient waits for a repair, cover the injured eye with a rigid eye shield.

Perform a basic eye exam cautiously to avoid worsening the injury or causing distress to the patient.

Before a corneal laceration repair, place a drop 5% povidone-iodine ophthalmic solution on the ocular surface as this is the most effective solution to reduce bacteria.
