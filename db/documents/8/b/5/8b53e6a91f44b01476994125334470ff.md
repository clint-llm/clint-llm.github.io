Acute cholangitis occurs most commonly from bacterial infection of the bile ducts. For the development of acute cholangitis, there must be obstruction of biliary flow. Complete obstruction can lead to increased biliary pressure, which frequently leads to bacteremia.Clonorchis sinensis, Fasciola hepatica), roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), tapeworm (Taenia saginata),

The pathogens identified as causative agents of acute ascending cholangitis are gram-negative and anaerobic organisms, the most common including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Citrobacter.
