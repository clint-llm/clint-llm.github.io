A cerebellar infarct (or cerebellar stroke) is a type of cerebrovascular event involving the posterior cranial fossa, specifically the cerebellum. Impaired perfusion reduces oxygen delivery and causes deficits in motor and balance control. In the case of hemorrhagic events, bleeding can directly damage tissue and worsen these deficits. Of all brain strokes, Cerebellar strokes account for 1% - 4%. This activity reviews the workup of cerebellar infarct and describes the role of health professionals working together to manage this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of cerebellar infarcts.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with a cerebellar infarct.
- Outline the treatment options for cerebellar infarct.
- Identify the role of an interprofessional team to optimize outcomes in patients affected by this condition.
