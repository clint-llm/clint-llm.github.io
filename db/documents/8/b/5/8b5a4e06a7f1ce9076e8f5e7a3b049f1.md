The most clinically significant role of the SGR is pain modulation via two primary modes: (1) spinal gate control and (2) supraspinal descending pain pathways.

The gate control theory of pain, first proposed by Melzack and Wall in 1965, posits that the transmission of peripheral nociception from PAFs to second-order projection neurons is not automatic and instead undergoes modulation beforehand at the spinal dorsal horn.

During an injury, local inflammatory mediators depolarize small-caliber nociceptive PAFs - in the absence of stimuli from large-caliber fibers from mechanical manipulation - cause net disinhibition of inhibitory interneurons at the SGR allowing for an “open gate” for unimpeded transmission of noxious stimuli from PAFs to second-order projection neurons.

Additionally, the descending pain pathways complement spinal gate control by augmenting pain modulation via supraspinal input structures at the level of the SGR. The descending efferents, predominantly serotonergic and noradrenergic, synapse onto inhibitory interneurons in lamina II and induce the release of endogenous opioids such as enkephalins, endorphins, and dynorphins.

Due to its role in modulating painful stimuli, the SGR is a prime therapeutic target for multiple medical and pharmaceutical interventions. Peripherally, pain attenuation is achievable through local anesthetics that reduce depolarization preferentially in small-caliber noxious PAFs. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) both at low and high frequencies at intensities up to motor threshold preferentially depolarize large-caliber PAFs (e.g., A-beta), resulting in analgesia via peripheral gate control as discussed above.
