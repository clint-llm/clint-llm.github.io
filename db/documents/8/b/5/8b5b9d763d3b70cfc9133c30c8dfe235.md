The overall rate of complications in central venous line placements is reportedly around 15%.

Complications of CVL placements include arterial puncture, catheter malposition, pneumothorax, subcutaneous hematoma, hemothorax, and cardiac arrest (exceedingly rare). The use of real-time ultrasound guidance can significantly decrease the complication rates of this procedure.

**Periprocedural Complications**

Pneumothorax is a severe complication of subclavian and internal jugular vein catheter placements. However, the internal jugular approach is associated with a lower rate of pneumothorax.

If inadvertent arterial cannulation with a catheter occurs, it is better to leave the catheter in place and attempt treatment with a percutaneous closure device.

**Late Complications**

Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSI) are well-recognized complications of this procedure and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality for the patient.

Central vein stenosis is another late complication of this procedure and is most prominent in chronic hemodialysis patients who often undergo repeated cannulations of the central veins. The highest risk of this complication occurs in the left-sided internal jugular or subclavian vein cannulations.
