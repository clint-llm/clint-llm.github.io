Poliovirus, the virus causing both acute polio and PPS, is a member of the Picornaviridae family and species Enterovirus C. There are three serotypes of wild Poliovirus: Poliovirus 1, 2, and 3.

There are cases of paralytic poliomyelitis due to a loss of viral attenuation in the oral polio vaccine (OPV), known as vaccine-associated paralytic poliovirus (VAPP). VAPP is extremely rare, occurring approximately 3.8 times per million cases in countries using the oral poliovirus vaccine. It is associated with serotype 3 and patient immunodeficiency. It is theorized that circulating maternal antibodies and the timing of the first OPV dose affect the risk of developing VAPP.

Another potential paralytic poliomyelitis is known as vaccine-derived poliomyelitis. This is caused by mutations of the attenuated virus within the OPV, which can lead to increased virulence and allow for naturally selective proliferation in populations with low herd immunity. Due to this risk, there has been a worldwide movement to increase the use of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and remove attenuated type 2 Polio within the OPV formulation to create a bivalent OPV (containing only types 1 and 3).
