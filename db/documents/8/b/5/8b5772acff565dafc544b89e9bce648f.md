The sacroiliac joints are usually considered as synovial joints but can also be classified as a diarthrosis-amphiarthrosis joint. The superior and dorsal portion of the joint is an amphiarthrosis. In this portion, fibrocartilage fills the joint space. The joint's inferior and ventral portion is a diarthrosis with hyaline cartilage covering the joint surfaces and possesses a synovial cavity

Anterior innervation of the sacroiliac joint is from the ventral rami of the L5 to S2 nerve roots. The lateral branches of the dorsal rami of the S1 to S4 nerve roots innervate the posterior part
