Wells described the first patient in 1971 as “recurrent granulomatous dermatitis with eosinophilia.” He later renamed the disease “eosinophilic cellulitis.”

Wells syndrome has a sudden onset. In the classic form, symptomatology is marked by large well limited inflammatory erythematous and edematous patches that are often covered with vesicles or bullae. The lesions are located preferentially on the trunk and the extremities. The eruption is preceded by sensations of itching or burning. General signs are rare. A low fever can be associated with cutaneous symptoms. The evolution in the following days is marked by an extension of the patches, which take an annular configuration, with the center healing while the border becomes purple. Inflammatory signs regress within approximately 10 days while the plaques become indurated. Restitutio ad integrum usually occurs in 4 to 6 weeks. Recurrence is the rule, with variable locations. The period between recurrences varies from a few months to several years; however, the prognosis remains good with long-term recovery.
