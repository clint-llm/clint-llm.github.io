Administration of alfentanil to adults is typically intravenous over three minutes or by continuous intravenous infusion, and administration to children is typically intravenous over three to five minutes or by continuous intravenous infusion. However, other methods of administration of alfentanil have demonstrated efficacy, including epidural (injection into the epidural space), intrathecal (injection into the spinal canal or the subarachnoid space), transdermal (across the skin), and intranasal.
