Enterocutaneous fistulas are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a stoma or wound care nurse, dietitian, and therapist. The key is to replace any fluids and electrolytes promptly because these patients can decompensate quickly. The source of sepsis has to be identified. The decision to treat nonsurgically versus surgery requires clinical acumen and good judgment.

The outcomes depend on the cause of the fistula; malignant cases usually have a poor outcome but those in patients with Crohn's disease can take months or years to close.
