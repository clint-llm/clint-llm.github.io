# Continuing Education Activity

Bot fly is a term referring to any member of the Oestridae family of flies. To reproduce, these flies rely on myiasis, the infestation of host skin for larvae nutrition. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of bot fly infestations and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of botfly medical conditions and emergencies.
- Review the appropriate evaluation for botfly.
- Outline the management options available for botfly.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of patients bitten by botflies and improve outcomes.

# Introduction

Bot fly is a term referring to any member of the Oestridae family of flies.

# Etiology

The most common species of flies that cause myiasis in humans are Dermatobia hominis(human botfly) and Cordylobia species.Dermatobia hominis is native to the tropics of Central America and South AmericaCoydylobia species (tumbu fly) occur in the African tropics.Cuterebra species (Rodent bot) endemic to North America, but they rarely infect humans.

# Epidemiology

Bot fly infections can affect anyone regardless of sex, age, and genetic makeup.

# Pathophysiology

Unique from all other flies causing myiasis, the female human botfly does not directly deposit eggs onto the host

# History and Physical

The most crucial aspect in the diagnosis of bot fly myiasis is travel history. Travel history should include specific locations visited in Central and South America as well as the African tropics. Clinicians should ask about activities done while traveling, which may increase the risk of exposure, such as hiking and other outdoor activities. The examiner should ask about specific encounters with mosquitoes, other flying insects, and ticks. Complaints from patients are typically only related to the region of the infestation.

Patients describe a slow-growing nodule with swelling, usually noticed a week after an initial insect bite.

# Evaluation

Ultrasound can be a useful tool in making a diagnosis of bot fly myiasis.

# Treatment / Management

Most cases will not require surgical management. The clinician should seek a surgical evaluation if larvae are too large or difficult to remove; there is the involvement of the eye and/or orbit or scalp infections of pediatric patients.

Effective home remedies found in the literature include the application of petroleum jelly, paraffin oil, pork fat products, or any other thick jelly to suffocate the larva.

Expectant management is also an appropriate means of management if the patient does not desire removal.

# Differential Diagnosis

Since bot fly myiasis is rare in the United States, it can commonly be mistaken for more common skin lesions.Dermatobia hominis looks similar to an infectious furuncle as they both have erythematous changes to the skin with a purulent appearing center opening.

# Prognosis

Botfly myiasis commonly resolves without any interventions.

# Complications

Secondary infections can occur in the context of extracting the larva in pieces.

# Consultations

An infectious disease consultation may be able to help narrow down the differential diagnosis by ruling out specific infectious etiologies.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Travelers to endemic regions should receive education about how botfly larvae spread and how a botfly infestation looks.

Patient education about myiasis and traveler's health is also available from the CDC's website.

# Pearls and Other Issues

Lack of improvement of a furnicular lesion on appropriate antibiotic coverage should prompt further evaluation into non-infectious etiologies such as botfly myiasis.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Botfly myiasis frequently poses a diagnostic dilemma. Botfly myiasis is often misdiagnosed as a more common cause of furuncular skin lesions. Patients will often receive antibiotics from a primary care physician or an emergency medicine physician without improvement. When a patient comes back to the primary care office or emergency room, it is essential to seek consultation from specialists to make an appropriate diagnosis. Infectious disease physicians should be consulted to rule out more common infectious etiologies. General surgeons should consult on these cases to discuss surgical removal of the botfly larva.
