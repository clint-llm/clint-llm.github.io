The contraindications to standard CXL treatment include a corneal thickness of fewer than 400 microns and prior herpetic ocular infection. Traditionally, corneal thickness less than 400 microns is considered a contraindication for CXL, but hypo osmolar CXL can be performed when corneal thickness varies from 370Â to 400 microns. Other contraindications are concurrent ocular infection, presence of severe corneal scarring, corneal opacity, neurotrophic keratitis, severe dry eye, history of poor epithelial wound healing, autoimmune disorders, and pregnancy.

Price et al., in their analysis of CXL in microbial keratitis, having negative bacterial or fungal cultures but positive for herpes simplex, showed that patients developed dendritic keratitis after undergoing CXL. There have been reports of herpetic keratitis after CXL.
