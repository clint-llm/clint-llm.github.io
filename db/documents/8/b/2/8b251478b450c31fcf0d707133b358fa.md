The most significant post-operative complication is the lack of blood supply to the flap. This lack of blood causes ischemia. After the procedure is complete, the flap is monitored extremely closely for any signs of malperfusion. It is important to monitor the flap for warmth, capillary refill, softness, and color. It is also important to monitor the output of the drains. If the flap becomes congested, observation is the usual treatment. If ischemia or congestion is recognized within the first six to eight hours, the patient can be taken back to the operating room for immediate repair. If congestion and demarcation occur in the first three or four days, the flap can be debrided and local wound care performed. Other complications include wound infection, wound dehiscence, bleeding, abdominal hernias, and lumps in the new breast mound.
