"Pelvic fractures" generally refer to fractures of the pelvic ring but may encompass several other fracture types, including acetabulum fractures and iliac wing fractures, the latter of which can generally be managed non-operatively.

Acetabular fractures warrant a whole investigation on their own, with there being generally 10 accepted classic patterns of acetabulum fractures outlined by the Letournel Classification. Treatment of acetabulum fractures can be non-operative with protected weight-bearing for high-risk patients or minimally displaced fractures. Open reduction and internal fixation is indicated for acute acetabulum fractures with significant acetabulum displacement or hip instability.
