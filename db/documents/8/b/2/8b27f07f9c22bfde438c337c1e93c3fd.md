Treatment of chlorine gas exposure is mostly supportive. Removal of the individual from the contaminated environment is the first step of management. Clinicians will assess the patient’s airway, breathing, and circulation and provide humidified oxygen as necessary. Severe exposures may require endotracheal intubation.  In cases of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), fluid restriction, and diuretics can be used. Bronchospasm is treated with beta-agonists such as albuterol. The management of ocular exposure requires irrigation with copious water or saline.

If irritation continues, clinicians should evaluate for corneal abrasion. Nebulized, 4% sodium bicarbonate may prove helpful as an adjunct treatment of chlorine gas exposure, although experience with this treatment is limited. Research has not yet proven any benefit to corticosteroids nor the administration of systemic nitrites as a treatment for chlorine gas exposure.
