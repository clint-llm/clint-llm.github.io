The principal action of sucralfate is unknown. The following actions of sucralfate have been the object of study in vitro, but the in vivo actions remain unknown:

- **Antipeptic effects**- It prevents hydrolysis by preventing the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. It adsorbs pepsin and decreases its concentration.

- **Site-protective effects**- By forming a polyanion gel, it acts as a physical barrier between luminal contents and mucosa.

- **Effects on mucus**- Increases mucous hydrophobicity, viscosity, sulfation, and aluminum and carbohydrate content, which leads to improved mucosal protection from acid. It also increases the production of mucus by increasing prostaglandin production. Sucralfate prevents the breakdown of mucus by pepsin A, reducing ulcerogenesis.

- **Effect on bicarbonate output**- It increases prostaglandin-dependent and independent bicarbonate production by stomach and duodenum.

- **Effects on tissue growth, regeneration, and repair**- It binds epidermal growth and tissue growth factors to tissues and facilitates repair.

The pharmacology of sucralfate is as follows:

- The time of onset is 1 to 2 hours.

- Only 5% of the dose is absorbed when taken orally; sucralfate is considered a non-systemic medication.

- The drug's duration of action is up to 6 hours.

- Sucralfate is not systemically metabolized and is primarily excreted unchanged in the feces.
