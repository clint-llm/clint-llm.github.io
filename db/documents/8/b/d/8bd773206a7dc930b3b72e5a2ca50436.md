Donepezil hydrochloride is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor most commonly used for the treatment of Alzheimer disease.

**FDA-approved Indications**

- **Alzheimer disease:**Donepezil is FDA approved for the treatment of dementia in mild, moderate, and severe Alzheimer disease. There is no evidence that donepezil alters the progression of the disease. It can, however, lessen some symptoms by improving cognition and/or behavior.

**Off-label (Not FDA approved) Uses**

- **Lewy body dementia:**Some studies have shown the benefits of donepezil for the treatment of cognitive and behavioral symptoms in Lewy body dementia.

- **Traumatic brain injury:**Some research suggests an improvement in memory dysfunction in patients with traumatic brain injury with donepezil use.

- **Vascular dementia:**Studies have shown that donepezil may improve cognition in patients with vascular dementia but not overall global functioning.

- **Dementia associated with Parkinson disease:**Some evidence suggests that donepezil can improve cognition, executive function, and global status in Parkinson disease dementia.

Researchers have also studied donepezil in patients with schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment, ADHD, multiple sclerosis-related cognitive impairments, post-CABG cognitive impairment, Down syndrome, and cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL syndrome), with no proven significant benefits.
