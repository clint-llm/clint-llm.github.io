Apart from wound infection and dysuria (due to bladder spasms), some other surgical complications are possible when the surgery is not performed by an expert.

- Urethral stricture and obstruction: Improper tissue handling and vascular compromise can lead to the formation of strictures. These can be managed by dilatation, but occasionally require urethral substitution.

- Persistent chordee: This can be avoided by performing cavernostomies before medializing and re-approximating the corporal bodies.

- Persistent short length: Release of the corporal bodies, division of the intersymphyseal bands, and advancing the dissection till the bladder neck can increase the length.

- Urethral retraction and hypospadias: During complete penile disassembly, it not uncommon to have a deficiency of the urethral plate. In these scenarios, some surgeons resort to performing a distal preputial tube urethroplasty.

- Partial or complete penile loss: Although the supply of the hemiglans comes from the lateral surface of the corpora and is not based on the urethral plate, there are cases where penile loss has occurred postoperatively, even after careful dissection. This can be attributed to the rare vascular aberrations apart from the precarious blood supply in newborns.
