With dystonia and developmental delay, many patients are initially diagnosed with cerebral palsy.

Hyperuricemia is the initial sign but other enzyme disorders like phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase hyperactivity and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency also result in hyperuricemia with purine overproduction.

Self-injurious behavior can also be seen in Rett syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, Tourette syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, hereditary sensory neuropathy, and familial dysautonomia.
