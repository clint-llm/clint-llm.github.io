External hemorrhoids are managed by a mutlidisciplinary team that includes an emergency department physician, general surgeon, gastroenterologist and an internist. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner play a vital role in educating the patient on preventing these lesions.

Conservative therapy is considered first-line treatment for symptomatic hemorrhoids. This includes increased dietary fiber, stool softeners, and increased water intake.Â  Rubber band ligation is a minimally invasive treatment option for first, second, and some third-degree internal hemorrhoids that do not respond to conservative therapy.
