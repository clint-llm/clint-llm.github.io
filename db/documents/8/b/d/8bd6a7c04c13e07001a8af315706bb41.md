The infraspinatus is most closely associated with the subscapularis, supraspinatus, and teres minor, as they all combine around the shoulder to encircle the glenohumeral joint. These muscles act to stabilize and move the glenohumeral joint. The infraspinatus and teres minor act synergistically as external rotators of the shoulder.

**Infraspinatus**

- Origin: infraspinous fossa

- Insertion: greater tubercle of the humerus

- Action: lateral rotation of the humerus, external rotation of the shoulder, scaption

- Innervation: suprascapular nerve
