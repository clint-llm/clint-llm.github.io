Cellular processes are highly regulated throughout organogenesis. For example, the CNS requires precise cellular pathways to be followed for proper organ system development. Part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes the neural ectoderm, and their columnar appearance distinguishes the cells. The neural tube forms during early development and serves as an embryonic precursor to the CNS. The process by which the neural tube is formed from the neural plate is called neurulation. The neural tube has closed by four weeks of development, and the first neurons of the human body begin to appear. The neural tube forms the brain anteriorly and thespinal cord posteriorly.

During week seven, cells of the ventricular zone of the brain start making neurons of the cortical plate. The ventricular zone is a proliferative cell layer in the brain that surrounds the ventricles and contains neural stem cells for neurogenesis. Neurogenesis describes the formation of new neurons and their incorporation into the CNS. After new neurons are made, they undergo specific pathways of migration and differentiation. These pathways allow for the creation of new structures and continued CNS growth and development.
