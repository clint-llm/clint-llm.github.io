The lower extremity is subdivided into the thigh (between the hip and knee joints), lower leg (between knee and ankle), and the foot (calcaneus and distally).

The thigh compartments and its contents are the following:

- Anterior compartment:

- Sartorius
- Quadriceps, composed of rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medius, and vastus intermedius.
- Superficial femoral artery and vein

- Medial compartment

- Adductor magnus muscle
- Gracilis muscle
- Deep femoral artery and vein
- Saphenous nerve

- Posterior compartment

- Biceps femoris muscle
- Semitendinosus muscle
- Semimembranosus muscle
- Sciatic nerve

*The great saphenous vein and nerve are located in the subcutaneous tissue of the medial thigh and run parallel to the intermuscular septum of the anterior and medial compartments.

The lower leg compartments and its contents are the following:

- Anterior compartment

- Tibialis anterior muscle
- Extensor hallucis longus muscle
- Extensor digitorum longus muscle
- Peroneus tertius muscle
- Anterior Tibial artery
- Anterior tibial vein
- Deep peroneal nerve

- Lateral compartment

- Peroneus brevis muscle
- Peroneus longus muscle

- Deep posterior compartment

- Tibialis posterior muscle
- Flexor digitorum longus muscle
- Flexor hallucis longus muscle
- Posterior tibial artery
- Posterior tibial vein
- Peroneal artery
- Peroneal vein
- Tibial nerve

- Superficial posterior compartment

- Soleus muscle
- Gastrocnemius muscle
- Plantaris muscle
- Sural cutaneous nerve

* The lesser saphenous vein is located in the subcutaneous tissue of the posterior lower leg and runs parallel to the sural nerve.

The foot is composed of seven tarsal bones, five metatarsals, and fourteen phalanges. It is subdivided into hindfoot (talus and calcaneus bones), midfoot (cuboid, navicular, three cuneiform bones) and forefoot (metatarsals and phalanges).Â The muscles of the foot can be extrinsic, originating from the anterior or posterior aspect of the lower leg, and intrinsic muscles, originating from the foot.
