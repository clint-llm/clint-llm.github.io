There are currently no studies comparing central cord syndrome patients who received acute inpatient rehabilitative services with those who did not. Central cord syndrome patients should receive occupational and physical therapy after discharge from acute care facilities. While each rehabilitation program should be tailored specifically to the patient and their functional goals, some generalizations can be made. Physical therapy focuses on maintaining an adequate range of motion, increasing strength, and fine-tuning coordination of the lower limbs and trunk to improve ambulation (with or without assistive devices), transfers, and balance.

Interventions include stretching, therapeutic exercise, aerobic conditioning, stair and transfer training, gait training, functional electrical stimulation, and aquatic therapy. Since upper limb strength and function are more impacted than lower limbs in central cord syndrome, occupational therapy should focus on hand strength and dexterity to maximize patient function with activities of daily living (ADLs) such as feeding, dressing, bathing, and self-hygiene.
