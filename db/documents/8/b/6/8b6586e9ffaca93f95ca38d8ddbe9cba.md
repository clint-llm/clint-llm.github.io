The treatment of KBS can be challenging due to the fact that there is no specific treatment for the condition, and the clinical course will vary from patient to patient. Most of the treatment focuses on managing the symptoms. The main drugs used in the management are:

- Mood stabilizers

- Antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors)

- Antipsychotic drugs

- Carbamazepine

- Leuprolide

Carbamazepine and leuprolide are used to reduce sexual behavioral abnormality, whereas haloperidol and anticholinergics are useful in treating behavioral abnormalities associated with KBS.
