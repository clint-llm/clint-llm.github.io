Caplan syndrome was first described in 1953 by Dr. Anthony Caplan, a provider on the Cardiff pneumoconiosis panel, as radiologic evidence of intrapulmonary nodules in coal miners with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is also called rheumatoid pneumoconiosis. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Caplan syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Caplan syndrome.
- Review the presentation of Caplan syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment options for Caplan syndrome.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by Caplan syndrome.
