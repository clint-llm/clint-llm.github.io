Approximately 1.3 million women in the United States undergo a cesarean section every year. It is the most common surgery done in the US. Following the first cesarean performed in 1020 AD, that patient died. Medicine has advanced significantly since that time, and it continues to do so.

Understanding the risks and benefits of a cesarean section will allow a clinician to counsel a pregnant patient appropriately. Having a clear understanding of evidence-based medicine will enable clinicians to provide the best care and best possible outcomes. Patients sometimes request a cesarean delivery without other indications, and clinicians should be equipped to provide the significant education needed in these cases to ensure the patient is making an informed decision. There is growing pressure to decrease cesarean section rates, so a proper understanding of the indications will assist clinicians in decision-making.
