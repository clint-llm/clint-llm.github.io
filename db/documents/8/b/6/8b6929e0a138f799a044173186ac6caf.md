Coronary angiogram's common indications:

- Stable angina(Canadian cardiology society class II, III, or IV) on maximally tolerated antianginal therapy (preferable > two different classes of antianginals).

- Unstable angina.

- Non-ST-elevation MI.

- High-risk noninvasive testing (more than 3% annual MI or death).

- Stress ischemia involves more than 10% of the myocardium or more than two coronary territories.   
- Stress-induced left ventricular(LV) dysfunction (Ejection fraction less than 45% or >10% drop from the baseline).   
- ST depressions more than 2 mm at low workload or persisting into recovery.
- Coronary artery calcium scores more than 400 Agaston.
- Stress-induced LV dilatation.
- Inducible wall motion abnormalities in more than two coronary artery territories. 
- Inducible wall motion abnormality at low-dose dobutamine or low heart rate.
- Left-main more than 50% or multivessel disease with more than 70% stenosis.
- Exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or ST elevations.

- Successful resuscitation of sudden cardiac death ( if favorable resuscitation features are present).

- Sustained ventricular tachycardia with no clear etiology.

- Chest pain syndrome with unclear etiology and equivocal noninvasive test.

- ST-elevation MI.

- Acute coronary syndrome with mechanical complications like mitral regurgitation and ventricular septal defect.Cardiac shock with hemodynamic instability (In selective cases).

- Before surgical intervention when symptomatic valvular heart disease or pericardial disease is suspected.

- Before surgical intervention to ascending aorta with coronary artery involvement.

- Preoperative and post-surgical evaluation for symptomatic cardiac transplant patients.

- Suspicion for symptomatic congenital coronary anomalies.
