Therapy with daunorubicin generally requires close patient observation and follow-ups. Serial measurement of complete blood count, hepatic, and renal functions is recommended before each chemotherapeutic session. Monitoring for bone marrow suppression and infections requires care and vigilance, and any systemic infection should be treated effectively before the next course of daunorubicin.

The American College of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends cardiac monitoring, including a thorough history and physical exam, screening for cardiovascular risk factors, EKGs, and serial echocardiograms. For patients who become symptomatic, the initial diagnostic test should be transthoracic echocardiography (echo). If the echo is inconclusive, a cardiac MRI or MUGA scan is an alternative. It is also a recommendation to obtain cardiac markers if necessary.
