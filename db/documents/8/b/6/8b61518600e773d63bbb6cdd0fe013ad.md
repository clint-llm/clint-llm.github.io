Swedish pharmacist C. Scheele first identified what we now call "uric acid" as the primary acidic component of bladder stones in 1776.

Nephrolithiasis is a frequent health problem in developed nations with a worldwide estimated 2 to 5% of people affected at least once in their lifetimes. In the United States, the overall lifetime risk for urinary stones in men is 10.6%, and for women, 7.6%. The majority of untreated patients suffer from periodic abdominal pain, urinary tract infections, and loss of kidney function; eventually leading to renal failure. Numerous conditions increase susceptibility to the nephrolithiasis, which includes genetic disorders, dietary and environmental factors.

Uric acid calculi make up 10 to 15% of all urinary tract stones with the overwhelming majority, 79%, presenting in men, most frequently in the 60 to 65 year old age group.
