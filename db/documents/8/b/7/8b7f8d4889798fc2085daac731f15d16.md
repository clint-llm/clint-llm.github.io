The definition of atelectasis is a partial collapse of the lung. It can cause people to feel short of breath. It can be a consequence of several different processes, most commonly when there is a poor inspiratory effort, an obstruction blocking airflow into the lung, extra pressure exerted on the outside of the lung, or deficient production or function of a specific protein in the lung. Treatment aims at the underlying cause of the condition, but mainly involves supportive measures, such as deep breathing exercises, incentive spirometry, and supplemental O2.
