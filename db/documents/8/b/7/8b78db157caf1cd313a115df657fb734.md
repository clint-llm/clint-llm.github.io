To alleviate the burning pain associated with the disorder, patients often will attempt to cool the affected extremity. Some patients even report sitting in front of the refrigerator to alleviate discomfort. Many of the methods used can lead to maceration of the affected tissue, followed by damage to the skin barrier.Â The most commonly reported complication is infection secondary to blistering, ulceration, cyanosis, and gangrene that might lead to amputation in chronic untreated cases. Malnutrition and hypothermia have been seen in a few cases.
