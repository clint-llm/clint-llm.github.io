Early clinical presentation, irrespective of etiology, mirrors the pathological phenomena of rubor, calor, dolor, tumor, and function laesa. A thorough history of location, character, radiation, and exacerbating â€“ relieving factors of pain, duration, and time correlation of symptom are important. The etiology and primary source are not as obvious. History should focus on any alteration from usual activities, including new medications, food intake, exposure, travel, or recreational agents of abuse.

Identification of specific risk factors through history may help prioritize intensive treatment strategies, e.g., preexisting immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus, solid tumors and leukemia, dysproteinemias, cirrhosis of the liver, and extremes of age.

A complete physical examination is not only helpful in localizing the source but also to assess the true extent of involvement and complications related to end-organ involvement. It also helps in guiding the appropriate investigations and imaging studies.

The definition of systemic inflammatory response syndrome has its basis in vital signs other than evaluating leukocyte count. However, vital signs can be falsely altered by the stress of arrival to a healthcare facility in extremes of age or by concomitant use of medications (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers). Hence periodic evaluation of vital signs and evidence of persistent instability becomes important to establish the diagnosis.
