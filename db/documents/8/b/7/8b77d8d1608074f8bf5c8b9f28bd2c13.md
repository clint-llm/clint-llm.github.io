During the 4th and 5th weeks of embryological development, the aortic sac gives rise to the aortic arches. The external carotidÂ artery develops from the 3rd aortic arch and gives rise to the lingual artery.

The intra-embryonic vessels originate from blood islands in the splanchnic mesoderm in front of the protocordal disc, where a plexiform horseshoe-shaped network forms surrounding the cephalic portion of the embryo. At the same time, two groups of angioblastic cells, in a dorsal paramedian position, form two parallel vessels, the dorsal aorta, which connect cephalically connect to the plexiform network. The further development of the vascular system consists of the formation of larger caliber ducts with a primitive plexiform network. The most voluminous of these are the right and left primitive aortas, from which the fetal arterial tree originates and develops parallel to the heart tube and its subsequent evolution.The formation of an anastomosis between the intra- and extra-embryonic vessels completes the circulatory system.
