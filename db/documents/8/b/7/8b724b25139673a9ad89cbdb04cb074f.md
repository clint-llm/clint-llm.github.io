Pemphigoid gestationis, formerly known as herpes gestationis, is a rare autoimmune sub-epidermal bullous dermatosis of pregnancy that shares some clinical and pathogenic features with bullous pemphigoid. Pemphigoid gestationis typically presents during the third trimester, though it can present in any trimester or even after delivery. It manifests with inflammatory skin lesions and severe pruritus. It tends to recur in subsequent pregnancies earlier and with a more severe course. This activity describes the pathophysiology, etiology, evaluation, and management of pemphigoid gestationis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of pemphigoid gestationis.
- Describe the presentation of pemphigoid gestationis.
- Outline the management options available for pemphigoid gestationis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and management of pemphigoid gestationis and improve outcomes.
