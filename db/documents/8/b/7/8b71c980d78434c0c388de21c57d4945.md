The diagnosis of white piedra is based on clinical findings and confirmed by microscopy and culture. Complete blood count, renal and liver function, and urinalysis are usually performed.

In deep infections, identification of Trichosporon spp. depends on biochemical characteristics and cell morphology. Trichosporon spp. should be a diagnosis under suspicion if the following characteristics are present: the organism produces urease, yeast-like, and forms arthroconidia. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by positive blood culture. A dermatophyte test medium that contains cycloheximide should not be used for culture because cycloheximide inhibits its growth. The colonies are raised, waxy appearing, and have radial furrows and irregular folds. Supplementary tests can help confirm the diagnosis, as well as carbohydrate and nitrate assimilation and temperature studies. Trichosporon species assimilate L-arabinose but not melibiose. It grows at 37 degrees C.

Urine cultures may be the first to grow Trichosporon in the setting of disseminated disease. A serum cryptococcal antigen latex agglutination test is occasionally positive in disseminated trichosporonosis.

Some investigational rapid molecular diagnostic methods such as DNA-based microarrays, polymerase chain reaction, and pyrosequencing are emerging methods for faster diagnosis.

Depending on the organ involved, imaging studies may be necessary. A chest x-ray and a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are done in those with invasive disease. An echocardiogram is performed in patients with suspected endocarditis. If lung involvement is suspected, bronchoscopy with lavage is recommended.
