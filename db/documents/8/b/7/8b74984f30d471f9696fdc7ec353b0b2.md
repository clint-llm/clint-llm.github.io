General surgeons, surgical oncologists, or breast surgeons typically perform this procedure. This procedure is done in the operating room, typically with general anesthesia. The usual operating room personnel are required, including anesthesiology, surgical technologist, and circulating nurses. Pathologists will then review the specimen after the procedure is completed. Once pathology is back, surgeons, in combination with radiation and medical oncologists, will decide on the necessary next steps in treatment.
