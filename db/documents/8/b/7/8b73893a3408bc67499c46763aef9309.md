Spontaneous intestinal perforation is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. The mortality rate is approximately 20 to 40%. Prognosis depends on the severity and extent of the spontaneous intestinal perforation.

Infants with spontaneous intestinal perforation are at an increased risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, and growth failure.Â These infants are also at risk of neurodevelopmental impairment.
