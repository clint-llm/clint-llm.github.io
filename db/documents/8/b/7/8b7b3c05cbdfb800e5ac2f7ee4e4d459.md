Cor triatriatum results from the incomplete absorption of the common pulmonary vein, which is normally reabsorbed during the development of a fetus and becomes a part of the left atrium. The incomplete absorption results in the formation of an appendage which subdivides the left atrium into 2 chambers. No known genetic mutations or risk factors are found to be associated with the development of this condition.
