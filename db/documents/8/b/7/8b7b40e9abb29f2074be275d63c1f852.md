Brain abscesses are usually managed with antibiotics and or drainage. Because the condition is associated with high morbidity and mortality it is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes neuro nurses. Recently HBO therapy has been advocated for brain abscesses. However, HBO therapy is not the first-line treatment and should not be undertaken in an unstable patient. It is also not a replacement treatment for antibiotics. Finally, HBO has the potential risk of barotrauma and oxygen toxicity.
