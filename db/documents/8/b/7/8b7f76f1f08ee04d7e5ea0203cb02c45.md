The prognosis of the different cardiac tumors depends on their nature and mechanical disturbances (obstruction/insufficiency).

Primary benign cardiac tumors have the best prognosis unless multiple embolizations occur, especially when systemic because this can cause multiple strokes with different neurological involvement and physical limitations. A similar situation occurs when the tumor causes mechanical abnormalities in the conduction system, inducing arrhythmias that can be life-threatening or valvular disease-causing syncope or heart failure symptoms.

Malignant tumors, especially primary tumors, are the ones with the worst overall prognosis. Survival after the first year of diagnosis is low, especially in the absence of surgical excision.

Secondary cardiac tumors have a poor prognosis but mostly because the primary tumor is likely to be advanced with possible different areas of metastasis. Also, a mechanical compromise occurs in this scenario.
