Latex has several modes of entry, including direct contact with the skin, entrance through mucous membranes or intravenously, or inhalation of latex powder through the lungs.Â A true latex allergy will result in a type I hypersensitivity reaction mediated by IgE antibodies that bind to the allergenic proteins. The binding causes the release of histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and kinins from mast cells and basophils, resulting in an immune response. Within minutes of exposure to latex, the patient may experience hives, wheezing, runny nose, and conjunctivitis.
