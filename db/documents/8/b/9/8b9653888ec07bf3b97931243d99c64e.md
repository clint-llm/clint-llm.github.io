Nursing caries characteristically affect the four primary upper incisors, whereas lower incisors remain sound. The rest of the teeth may be involved but less severely. These children usuallyÂ experience pain and eating difficulties.

At first, the maxillary incisors present a white demineralization band along the gingival margin, usually missed by parents. The demineralization bands gradually progress to cavities that encircle the teeth' necks in a brown-black collar. By contrast, the lower incisors are unaffected - either completely healthy or mildly carious. Severe cases may show the crowns of the upper incisors destroyed, leaving root stumps.
