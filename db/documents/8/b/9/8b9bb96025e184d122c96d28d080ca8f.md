A 24-hour urinalysis is a timed urine collection used in the metabolic evaluation of urinary stone disease, proteinuria evaluation, and estimation of renal function via creatinine clearance, estimating residual renal function in end stage renal disease with urea and creatinine clearance. The testing is usually performed in an outpatient setting while the patient consumes theirÂ usual diet. Results are combined with detailed medical and dietary history, serum chemistry, and stone composition to guide prophylactic stone-reducing treatment. A 24-hour urine study can also be used in the pediatric population when inherited conditions such as primary hyperoxaluria and cystinuria are involved.
