Fluphenazine acts primarily through antagonism of postsynaptic dopamine-2 receptors in mesolimbic, nigrostriatal, and tuberoinfundibular neural pathways. The blockage of postsynaptic dopamine-2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway targets positive symptoms in schizophrenia, such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech. It is also known to have antagonistic properties at alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, contributing to its cardiac and orthostatic side effects (see below). Like most other antipsychotic medications, fluphenazine has relatively strong antagonistic effects at both muscarinic-1 receptors and histamine-1 receptors.

Fluphenazine is part of a class of drugs known as first-generation antipsychotics or conventional antipsychotics.Â It is considered a member of the phenothiazine-derived neuroleptic antipsychotics along with medications such as thioridazine and chlorpromazine. Of the drugs in this class, fluphenazine rates as high-potency.
