Aminophylline is an adjunct to beta2-agonists and corticosteroids in treating reversible bronchoconstriction caused by asthma and chronic lung conditions. However, the drug demonstrates a narrow therapeutic index, and even with regular monitoring, it can lead to adverse effects. Without precise management, the morbidity and mortality from aminophylline overdose are high. Therefore Healthcare workers, including nurses, pharmacists, and prescribing clinicians, should be aware of the complications of aminophylline toxicity.

Clinicians should prescribe aminophylline after risk-benefit evaluation for appropriate indications considering the recent global initiative for asthma(GINA) guidelines and global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease(GOLD) guidelines.

Nursing staff can monitor vital signs and treatment effectiveness and communicate with the healthcare team if they noticeÂ any adverse event. The pharmacist should suggest a safer option for treating asthma to clinicians who prescribe this drug, verify dosing, perform thorough medication reconciliation, alert the team to any issues. Also, drug interactions and concurrent illnesses require strong consideration before initiating treatment as clearance rates vary widely.

In cases of acute overdose, tirage nurses and emergency department physicians should rapidly stabilize patients and promptly initiate treatment. Clinicians should consult intensivists for refractory seizures, arrhythmias, and hypotension. Nephrologist consultation is necessary for hemodialysis. As illustrated above, multiple healthcare providers, including clinicians(MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), specialists, nurses, pharmacists, are involved in taking care of the patient receiving aminophylline therapy. Hence, only through a collaborative, interprofessional team approach can the morbidity of this medication be lowered while achieving improved outcomes. [Level 5]
