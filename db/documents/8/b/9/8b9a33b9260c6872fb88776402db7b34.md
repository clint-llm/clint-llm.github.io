With the increasing number of organ procurement and transplantation, it is essential to know the needs of this patient population's pathophysiology and administer anesthesia to improve graft survival and functioning. This activity will focus on anesthesia for kidney, pancreas, and liver transplant surgeryâ€”the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of recipient and donor.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications and contraindications of kidney, pancreas, and liver transplants.
- Outline the anesthesia monitoring devices used during kidney, pancreas, and liver transplant surgeries.
- Ex[plain pre-transplant screening and optimization in kidney, pancreas, and liver transplant surgery.
- Summarize anesthesia, intraoperative complication, and management in kidney, pancreas, and liver transplantation by an interprofessional team.
