The treatment of all types of purpura fulminans starts with supportive care and adequate hydration. This is important because of the widespread thrombosis associated with this disease can lead to damage of multiple end organs. As this commences, finding and treating the underlying cause is essential. Anticoagulation may be stared to prevent further necrosis. There may need for replacement of blood, factors, and platelets lost because of both the pro-coagulable state and DIC. Finally, early surgical debridement for areas which have become necrotic has been shown to decrease mortality.

In the neonatal form of the disease hydration, platelet transfusion, followed by an assessment of protein C and S levels followed closely with fresh frozen plasma transfusions are the mainstay of treatment. Heparin and warfarin have been used as anticoagulants, and later protein C concentrate can be added if this deficiency is found.

The treatment of idiopathic purpura fulminans is similar to what is described above. Additionally, there may be a role for immunomodulation with corticosteroids.

In the acute infectious form, broad-spectrum antibiotics should include coverage of Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Clostridia species. Often carbapenem or vancomycin with beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitor combinations are used. Clindamycin is often included as it has specific properties which inhibit some of the toxins which allow this disease to progress. IVIg therapy is also used because of antibodies to these toxins. Activated protein C may be administered to reduce the inflammatory cascade, restore the coagulation balance which may decrease the progression of purpuric skin injury. In acute infectious purpura fulminans, the decision to anticoagulated is based on the occurrence of concurrent DIC.

In all forms of the disease repeated tissue assessments with debridement of affected areas are carried out as needed. Repeated surgeries are often required.
