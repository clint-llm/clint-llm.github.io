Primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in pregnancy is associated with the highest risk of trans-placental transmission. Universal screening for pregnant women is not recommended, thus providers must have a high index of suspicion for prenatal testing to identify an infected fetus. Congenital CMV infection is associated with poor long-term outcomes. However, the disease is mostly asymptomatic. This activity reviews the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and describes an interprofessional approach to early intervention and follow up for neonates diagnosed with congenital (CMV) infection.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of congenital cytomegalovirus.
- Outline the prenatal and postnatal diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and collaboration in order to employ better identification, screening, and treatment of congenital cytomegalovirus and improve patient outcomes.
- Explain the importance of an interprofessinal approach to early identification and treatment of a potentially CMV infected neonate.
