HCG levels are reported in milli-international units of hCG hormone per milliliter of blood, or mIU/mL. International unit per liter (IU/L) may also be used.

Urine hCG testing is qualitative, reporting a positive or negative result. The assays detect hCG levels typically starting at 20 to 50 (reportedly as low as 6.3 to 12.5)

Serum assays can measure beta-hCG as low as 1 to 2 mIU/mL.
