Prochlorperazine is a first-generation antipsychotic. FDA indications include schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and other conditions presenting with symptoms of psychosis, as well as nausea and vomiting (post-chemotherapy, post-radiation therapy, pre- and post-operative setting, and other conditions). Non-FDA Indications include migraine headaches. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of prochlorperazine, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating conditions for which it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of prochlorperazine.
- Identify the indications for initiating therapy with prochlorperazine.
- Review the potential adverse event profile of prochlorperazine.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who can benefit from therapy with prochlorperazine.
