The patient is admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for at least 24 hours. Then initial nursing care focuses on evaluating the neurologic status, fluid and electrolyte balance, and pain management. The hematocrit level is closely monitored, and blood transfusions are given if indicated. Pain control is maintained with alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen and intermittent intravenous morphine as needed. Prophylactic antibiotics may be continued for 24 hours postoperatively. The child is evaluated for adequate hemostasis and signs of infection. Postoperative scalp swelling can be uncomfortable and can be reduced by elevating the head of the bed. The child is usually transferred to the general pediatric floor on the first or second postoperative day. The face and scalp swelling will resolve over 1 to 2 weeks.

Preoperative and postoperative photographs are taken to serve for outcome assessment. Follow-up for at least five years is ideal for assessing the progressive skull reshaping. Evaluation of the skull reshaping pattern and the child's age will guide the timing for revisional surgery. In children older than 1-2 years, defects >2 cm diameter usually require calvarial split bone grafts or bone substitutes to fill the cranial defects and prevent permanent defects.
