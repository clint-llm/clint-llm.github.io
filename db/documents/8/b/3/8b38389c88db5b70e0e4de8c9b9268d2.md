One significant difference between prokaryotes' and eukaryotes' DNA structure is that prokaryotic DNA molecules are circular and thus do not have free 5' and 3' ends. Circular DNA molecules are also found in eukaryotic mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA, evidence that supports the endosymbiotic theory of eukaryotic evolution.

However, because eukaryotes have much more DNA than prokaryotes (3234 mega-base pairs vs. 4.4 mega-base pairs), they need to utilize a more complex strategy to position their DNA, which, ifÂ stretched from end to end, would be two meters long, properly inside a microscopic cellular space.
