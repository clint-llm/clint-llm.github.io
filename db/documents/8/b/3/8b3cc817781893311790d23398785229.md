As intrauterine growth restriction is one of the primary outcomes associated with placental insufficiency, most neonates that survive present either prematurely and are known as ‘extremely low birth weight’ (ELBW) neonates or depending on when the insult to the vascular supply occurred, they may present with altered body proportions at birth.

When there is a concern for IUGR, whether it is secondary to placental insufficiency or another etiology, the fetus will benefit from frequent combined monitoring using both Doppler and biophysical profile screens. This combination of screening techniques allows for the recognition of the declining performance observed when IUGR is related to placental problems. Utilizing doppler studies, failed placentation can be visualized by presenting of notching in the uterine arteries as well as increased resistance in the umbilical artery with progression to either absent- or reversed end-diastolic volumes. One of the first signs seen on a biophysical profile when there is a concern for fetal compromise is a non-reactive fetal heart rate tracing. The following will either be poor or loss of fetal body movements, breathing movements, and tone. These features of declining doppler status and poor biophysical profiles are typical when there is fetal distress, which is common when there is placental insufficiency and may indicate that delivery is required.
