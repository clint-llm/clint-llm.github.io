The pectoralis major is a broad, fan-shaped muscle that covers the upper anterior portion of the chest. The innervation corresponds to the lateral (C5-C7) and medial (C8-T1)****pectoral nerves. It is composed of two parts: a sternal head and a clavicular head. The origin of the sternal head is the sternum and the six superior costal cartilages. The origin of the clavicular head is the medial half of the clavicle. The insertion of both is within an anterior and posterior layer at the lateral lip of the bicipital groove of the humerus. The action of the muscle is adduction, forward elevation, and internal rotation.

Traumatic injury of the pectoralis major most commonly occurs due to excessive tension on a maximally eccentrically contracted muscle. This setup typically occurs during the downward portion of a bench press, with the arm in the final 30 degrees of humeral extension and external rotation while pushing against heavy resistance. The most common types of injuries of the pectoralis major muscle are tendon avulsions at the site of insertion by this mechanism. Less common are myotendinous junction tears due to direct trauma.
