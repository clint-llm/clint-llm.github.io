Patients with hemifacial microsomia should be managed by anÂ interprofessional team of otolaryngologists, plastic surgeons, oral maxillofacial surgeons, ophthalmologists, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, primary clinicians, psychologists, and geneticists. Children born with hypoplastic facial defects should be thoroughly evaluated by primary clinicians and geneticists for prompt diagnosis and referral to the reconstructive surgeons.

Other craniofacial microsomia syndromes with similar presentations should also be considered to determine if there are any accompanying vertebral or internal organ malformations. Studies have shown that reconstruction is best performed once children reach skeletal and dental maturity. As patients with HFM often require multiple surgeries throughout childhood and adolescence, they must be closely monitored by their primary clinician and reconstructive surgeons for both immediate and long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes. Finally, patients may develop social and functional impairment due to their condition.

Referral to a speech-language pathologist for speech and swallow, as well as psychosocial support, is recommended. Formal peer support groups with similar craniofacial malformation diagnoses can aid patients and parents in addressing their concerns.
