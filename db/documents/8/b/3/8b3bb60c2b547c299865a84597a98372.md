An esophageal diverticulum is a relatively rare disorder of the esophagus.

There are different ways to categorize esophageal diverticulum. Esophageal diverticulaÂ can be divided into true and false diverticula. True diverticula are outpouchings that include all layers of the esophageal wall while false diverticula only include the mucosa or submucosa.

An esophageal diverticulum can also be characterized by how it is formed: pulsion or traction.

An esophageal diverticulum can also be categorized based on location as pharyngeal (Zenker) diverticula, mid-esophageal diverticula, and epiphrenic diverticula. Pharyngeal diverticula are considered false diverticula.

An esophageal diverticulum can occur in individuals of all ages but overall are most common in adults. Zenker diverticulum is most common in the elderly.
