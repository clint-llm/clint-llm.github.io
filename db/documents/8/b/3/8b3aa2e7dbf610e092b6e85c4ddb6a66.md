The etiology of hyponatremia can be classified based upon the volume status of the extracellular fluid. As mentioned earlier, sodium is the major solute of extracellular fluid (ECF). Based upon the volume of ECF, a patient can be classified into hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic.

Physiological stimuli that cause vasopressin release in adjunct with increased fluid intake can cause hyponatremia. Hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency may contribute to an increased release of vasopressin. Physiological stimuli for vasopressin release include loss of intravascular volume (hypovolemic hyponatremia) and the loss of effective intravascular volume (hypervolemic hyponatremia).

**Causes of Hypovolemic Hyponatremia (TBW decreases more than a decrease in total body sodium)**

- Gastrointestinal fluid loss (diarrhea or vomiting)

- The third spacing of fluids (pancreatitis, hypoalbuminemia, small bowel obstruction)

- Diuretics

- Osmotic diuresis (glucose, mannitol)

- Salt-wasting nephropathies

- Cerebral salt-wasting syndrome (urinary salt wasting, possibly caused by increased brain natriuretic peptide)

- Mineralocorticoid deficiency

**Causes of Hypervolemic Hyponatremia (TBW increases greater than an increase in total body sodium)**

- Renal causes (acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome)

- Extrarenal causes (congestive heart failure, cirrhosis)

- Iatrogenic

**Causes of Euvolemic Hyponatremia (TBW increase with stable total body sodium)**

Nonosmotic, pathologic vasopressin release may occur in the setting of normal volume status, as with euvolemic hyponatremia.

Causes of euvolemic hyponatremia include:

- Drugs, as mentioned below.

- Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)

- Addison's disease

- Hypothyroidism

- High fluid intake in conditions like primary polydipsia; or potomania, caused by a low intake of solutes with relatively high fluid intake

- Medical testing related to excessive fluids such as a colonoscopy or cardiac catheterization

- Iatrogenic

Many drugs cause hyponatremia and the most common include:

- Vasopressin analogs such as desmopressin and oxytocin

- Medications that stimulate vasopressin release or potentiate the effects of vasopressin such as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants morphine and other opioids

- Medications that impair urinary dilution such as thiazide diuretics

- Medications that cause hyponatremia such as carbamazepine or its analogs, vincristine, nicotine, antipsychotics, chlorpropamide, cyclophosphamide, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

- Illicit drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy).
