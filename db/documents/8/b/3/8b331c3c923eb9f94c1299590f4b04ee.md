Orthostatic proteinuria, also known as postural proteinuria, is a condition where an abnormally large amount of protein is excreted in the urine when the patient is in an upright position and normal protein excretion in the supine position.

Proposed mechanisms include some possibilities, such as it is a normal variant, there is a subtle glomerular abnormality, it is an exaggerated hemodynamic response, and it is due to a left renal vein entrapment.
