The tibial nerve is the continuation of the medial trunk of the sciatic nerve. At the ankle, it runs posterior and inferior to the medial malleolus passing through a tunnel created by the flexor retinaculum. Distal to the tunnel, the tibial nerve divides into the calcaneal sensory branches and the two plantar nerves, which are mixed nerves (contain both motor and sensory fibers). The calcaneal nerves are two sensory branches (medial and lateral) that provide sensation to the heel of the sole. The two mixed motor and sensory branches are the medial and lateral plantar nerves.

These nerves provide sensory innervation to the two-thirds of the sole and motor innervation to the intrinsic foot muscles: the lateral plantar nerve supplies motor innervation to the abductor digiti quinti pedis and sensation to the lateral plantar aspect of the foot, including the lateral 1.5 toes. The medial plantar nerve supplies motor function to the abductor halluces brevis, flexor halluces brevis, and flexor digitorum brevis. It provides sensation to the medial plantar aspect of the foot sole and the first three toes. Tibial nerve compression at the level of the tarsal tunnel will lead to sensory and motor disturbances according to its branches' distribution.
