Various laboratory tests can be ordered to test for chronic rejection. These may include the following:

- Twenty-four-hour urine collection

- Blood chemistry

- Complete blood cell count

- Electrocardiogram

- Chest x-ray

- CT (computed tomography) of the abdomen

- Abdominal ultrasonography

- Histological studies

- HLA typing (This will test for histocompatibility between donor and recipient. The most critical loci are HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR.)

- Serology (testing for HIV; hepatitis B and C)

In renal transplantation, urinary samples can prove useful to determine rejection.  Tubular epithelial cells, casts, oxalate crystals (sand-glass shaped), dirty background, increasing erythrocyturia, mixed cell clusters, lymphocytes, and mitoses all may be observed.

"Owl-eye" cells milk-glass nuclei, sometimes with eosinophilic condensation, typically characterize cytologic examination of the voided urine in CMV infection.
