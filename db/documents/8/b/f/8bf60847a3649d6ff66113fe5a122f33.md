The pathophysiology of floppy eyelid syndrome is poorly understood. There are speculations about the underlying mechanisms based on associations from previous studies. These theories remain inconclusive as further studies investigating these mechanisms are warranted. Current evidence suggests genetic inheritance predispositions and anomalies, changes in the elastin structure of the tarsal plates and tendon ligaments, and overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and proteases are the main factors in the pathogenesis of FES.

Some studies have suggested that there may be an associated X-linked pattern of inheritance that could explain the high occurrence of FES in males. Other genetic anomalies in the COL5A1 and COLA52 type V collagen genes seen in Ehlers-Danlos may be associated with FES, as early studies demonstrated comorbidity between connective tissue disorders and FES.

Most notably, there is a strong association between FES and OSA that researchers have tried to explain.
