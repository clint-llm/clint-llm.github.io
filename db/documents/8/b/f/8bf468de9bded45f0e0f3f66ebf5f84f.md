Wet (exudative or neovascular) age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is the most common cause of visual impairment among elderly patients in developed countries. Approximately 10% of patients with dry ARMD will develop choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which is the hallmark of wet ARMD. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drives the development of CNV, which may lead to bleeding under the retina, detachment or atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), or sub-retinal or sub-RPE fluid accumulation with associated vision loss. This activity describes the clinical presentation, evaluation, management of the disease, and the role of an interprofessional team approach in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the risk factors for developing wet age-related macular degeneration.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with wet age-related macular degeneration.
- Review the typical imaging findings associated with choroidal neovascularization.
- Identify the indications for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy in patients with age-related macular degeneration.
