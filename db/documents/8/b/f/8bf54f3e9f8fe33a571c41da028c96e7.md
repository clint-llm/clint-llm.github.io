The lymphatic system is an important and often underappreciated component of the circulatory, immune, and metabolic systems. It is composed of lymphatic fluid, lymphatic vessels, and lymphatic cells. Lymphatic cells include macrophages, dendritic cells, lymphocytes, as well as lymphatic organs such as the spleen and thymus. There are three primary functions of the lymphatic system: first is the maintenance of fluid balance, second is the facilitation of the absorption of dietary fats from the gastrointestinal tract to the bloodstream for metabolism or storage, and third is the enhancement and facilitation of the immune system. The lymphatic vessels reabsorb interstitial fluid from the periphery to return it to the intravascular space, which prevents fluid build up in peripheral tissues. The lymphatics allow for the immune system to function properly as it carries antigens to lymph nodes, and also carries immune cells, such as macrophages to sites of infection to begin the immune process.
