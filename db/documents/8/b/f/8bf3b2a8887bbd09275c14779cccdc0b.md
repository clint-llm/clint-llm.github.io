Patients may have significant vaginal bleeding in the post-partum setting as well. Risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage include multiparity, multiple gestations, prolonged labor, prior history of bleeding, and use of medications known to cause bleeding.

In assessing these patients, the provider should determine if the bleeding is secondary to problems with uterine tone (the uterus being inverted or not contracting) and should treat these patients with bimanual uterine massage, oxytocin, misoprostol, and or ergotamines. If the bleeding does not appear to be related to tone, the provider should look signs of trauma and repair any lacerations or tears. The provider should consider tissue as a source, and manually remove any retained placenta. Finally, the provider should consider the possibility of thrombin dysfunction, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, or underlying bleeding diathesis, which may require treatment with fresh frozen plasma or platelet infusion.
