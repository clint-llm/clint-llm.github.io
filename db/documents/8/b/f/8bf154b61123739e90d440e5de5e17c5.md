Choledochal cyst is a rare anomaly that is considered to be premalignant. It often poses a diagnostic dilemma. The typical presentation of this condition is non-specific. Healthcare teams must have a high index of suspicion of choledochal cysts while investigating patients with jaundice, abdominal pain, and palpable abdominal mass. Due to the vague nature of these symptoms and physical findings, proper imaging studies are crucial for its diagnosis. Choledochal cysts are associated with several complications including cholangitis, pancreatitis, cholangiocarcinoma, biliary and hepatic cirrhosis. Excision of the CC has shown excellent results; hence early diagnosis and managementÂ are recommended.
