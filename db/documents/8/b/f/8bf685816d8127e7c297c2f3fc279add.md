To optimize outcomes, the nurse and/or technician should confirm the patient has not consumed caffeine or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor medications within 12 to 24 hours of the test, respectively. The patient’s vital signs and oxygen saturation should be monitored, recorded, and reported to the team at regular intervals by a dedicated nurse. This nurse should also be responsible for ensuring all necessary resuscitative equipment is in the imaging suite and fully functional before the study begins. For cardiac stress testing, the patient should be on a cardiac monitor with venous access established prior to the administration of atropine and other cardiac stimulants. The risk of radiation exposure to staff is low; however, radiological safety protocols should be made clear to all involved staff and strictly enforced by the designated radiation safety officer.
