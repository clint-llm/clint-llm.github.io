Contraindications to SPG radiofrequency ablation (RFA) include uncontrolled local or systemic infections, coagulopathy, lack of response to SPG block or chemical ablation, and hemodynamic instability. The procedure should be avoided in patients with substantial changes in the local anatomy from trauma or surgery. Pre-procedure cardiac assessment should thoroughly evaluate patients with implanted cardiac pacemakers or defibrillators to improve perioperative safety. Such patients require post-procedural cardiac monitoring.
