Subvalvular aortic stenosis is a rare disorder seen in infants and newborns but is the second most common type of aortic stenosis. It is responsible for approximately 1% of all congenital heart defects (8 in 10,000 births) and 15% to 20% of all fixed left ventricular outflow tract obstructive lesions.

Ten percent to 14% of subvalvar aortic stenosis is observed amongst children with congenital aortic stenosis.

SAS is associated with other cardiac malformations in 50% to 65% of cases

- Ventricular septal defect (VSD) (20%)

- Patent ductus arteriosus (34%)

- Pulmonic stenosis (9%)

- Aortic coarctation (23%)

- Miscellaneous other lesions (14%)
