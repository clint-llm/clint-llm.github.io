Amlodipine overdose and toxicity can lead to massive vasodilation, hypotension, and reflex tachycardia as compensatory mechanisms. Prolonged systemic hypotension can progress to shock and even death. Activated charcoal (AC) should be administered to patients with amlodipine overdose. The hypotension usually remits intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation, IV calcium gluconate, and vasopressor therapy with norepinephrine or dopamine. High-dose insulin is also sometimes administered as research has shown it to lower mortality and improve hemodynamics. Electrocardiographic results, vital signs, kidney function, urine output, and electrolytes require continual monitoring during an overdose.
