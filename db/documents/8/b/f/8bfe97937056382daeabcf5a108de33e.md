Graves disease is a systemic disorder that affects numerous organs; it's presentations are diverse and hence the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team. The natural history of Graves disease is well documented and eventually, all patients become hypothyroid and require hormone replacement therapy. Similarly, the ocular features of the disorder also become quiescent with time. Some patients may develop recurrence of hyperthyroidism after ablation and further therapy with radioactive iodine is needed. While the antithyroid drugs do control the symptoms, they do not cure the disease and hence relapses are common. The condition is best addressed with radioactive iodine. All patients need to be educated about the symptoms and signs of hyper-and hypothyroidism, as well as the side effects of the medications. More importantly, the patient should be urged to avoid over-the-counter medications that contain pseudoephedrine or ephedrine during treatment.
