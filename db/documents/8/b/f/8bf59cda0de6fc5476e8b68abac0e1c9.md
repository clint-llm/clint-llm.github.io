There can be many defects that take place during embryogenesis that affect the GI tract.

- Atresia is the absence or abnormal growing of an opening or a passage.

- Ventral wall defects due to a failure of closure

- Gastroschisis: contents protrude through abdominal folds and not covered by amnion or peritoneum.
- Omphalocele: abdominal contents fail to return to the abdomen and are sealed by peritoneum

- GI atresia is a failure of a portion of the GI tract to develop. The bowel will be distended at the level at the level of obstruction, while distal segments will be less distended.
- Esophageal atresia has an association with tracheoesophageal fistula which allows air to enter the stomach
- Duodenal atresia occurs due to failed recanalization. It has an association with a “double bubble” sign as well as with Down syndrome.
- Jejunal and ileal atresia occurs when there is disruption of the mesenteric vessels leading to necrosis

- Hirschsprung’s disease

- Occurs with altered peristalsis
- Lack of neural crest-derived- ganglion neurons in a part of the colon due to abnormal migration, differentiation, or proliferation of neural crest cells during embryogenesis.

- Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis

- Acquired narrowing of the pylorus
- The presentation includes projectile, nonbilious vomiting with a palpable olive mass in the abdomen
- May include a peristaltic wave after being fed.

- Meconium ileus

- Is associated with cystic fibrosis
- Defined as the lack of passage of stool at birth due to obstruction of meconium.

- Malrotation of the gut

- Improper positioning of the bowel leading to the formation of fibrous bands

- Volvulus

- Twisting of bowel around its mesentery

- Vitelline fistula

- Vitelline duct remains patent.
- Clinical presentation with meconium discharge through the umbilicus.
