Presence of the above symptoms and signs should raise alarms for HTR. HTR commonly gets diagnosed during surveillance endomyocardial biopsies. Typically biopsies are performed every week for the first four weeks followed by every two weeks for the next six weeks, which is subsequently followed by monthly biopsies for three to four months and then every three months until the end of the first year. Routine myocardial biopsies after the first year have not shown superior benefits.

During the first five years, in patients with normal kidney functions, surveillance for CAV is performed with annual coronary angiography. Annual dobutamine stress echocardiography for patients with significant kidney disease is necessary. After five years annual dobutamine stress echocardiography with or without coronary angiography should be done based on the risk status of the recipient. Intravascular ultrasound should be performed when angiographic evidence is insufficient. In comparison to coronary angiography, coronary CT angiography has offered a safer and equally accurate diagnostic approach for CAV.
