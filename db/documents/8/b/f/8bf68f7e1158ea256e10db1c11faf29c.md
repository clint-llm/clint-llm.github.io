Pulmonary papillomas are benign papillary tumors characterized by a fibrovascular core covered by an epithelium. These tumors are rarely multiple. They can be proximal or peripheral. Many mimickers may be suspected as papillomas due to their radiologic appearance but microscopic examination is the basis for making a confirmed diagnosis. This activity describes the presentation of pulmonary papillomas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in their diagnosis and management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pulmonary papilloma.
- Review the presentation of a pulmonary papilloma.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for pulmonary papilloma.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination of care among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients diagnosed with a pulmonary papilloma.
