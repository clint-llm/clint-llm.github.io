Just like in other joints of the body, specific mechanisms are more associated with certain foot dislocations. Dislocations of the foot can occur after either direct or indirect trauma. Common mechanisms include falling from a tall height, motor vehicle collisions, or sports injuries. Lisfranc injuries commonly occur following any of the above-stated mechanisms through indirect rotational forces and axial loading on a foot that is hyper-plantarflexed.Â Subtalar dislocations usually occur following a high energy mechanism such as a fall from heights or a high-speed motor vehicle collision (MVC) with the foot in either inversion or eversion. Midtarsal dislocations are also due to high energy mechanisms and occur when such forces are directed at a plantarflexed foot.
