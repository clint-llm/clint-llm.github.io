Three clinical entities exist along the spectrum of disease including chronic forms, accelerated forms, and acute silicosis. Nodular or pure silicosis can occur after 20 or more years of exposure in occupations. An accelerated form of the disease occurs after a heavier exposure for 5 to 10 years. [8] Acute silicosis is an unusual reaction caused by heavy exposure over a short period to high levels of silica of small particle size.
