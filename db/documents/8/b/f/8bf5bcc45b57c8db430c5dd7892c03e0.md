Chloracne is an acne-like condition that occurs due to the persistence of toxic chemicals and their metabolites. Toxins accumulate within the sebaceous glands and alter their normal physiology from oil-producing glands into the cyst-like structures (hamartomas) of chloracne.

Systemically, chloracnegens can act as endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), in which they behave like other endogenous hormones such as estrogens, progesterone, and androgens. They can also manipulate numerous receptors, like those related to retinoids or aryl hydrocarbons, resulting in overactivation and perturbations of the normal metabolic pathways. As a result, EDCs can lead to thyroid dysfunction, reproductive issues (cryptorchidism, hypospadias, testicular cancer, and female precocious puberty), leukemia, brain tumors, neurobehavioral disorders, type 2 diabetes, and obesity.
