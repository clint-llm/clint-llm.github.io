Metformin is an oral medication typically dosed from 500 to 2550 mg per day and administered with a meal to decrease GI upset. The daily dose is often titrated weekly in increments of 500 mg or 850 mg to reduce this risk. The recommendations are to take metformin at the same time every day. Extended-release tablets are typically taken once daily with an evening meal and should be swallowed with a full glass of water.

**Recommended Adult Dosing**

**Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus type 2**

- The initial dose of 500 mg once or twice a day or 850 mg once a day is recommended for immediate release oral formulation. The daily dose is often titrated weekly in increments of 500 mg or 850 mg to reduce GI adverse effects. The typical maintenance dose is 850mg or 1000 mg twice a day.

- On the other hand, the initial dose of 500 mg once or 1000 mg once a day is recommended for extended-release oral formulation. This daily dose can be titrated weekly in increments of 500 mg for up to 6 weeks. After that, a maximum dose of 2000 mg once or twice a day is recommended for extended-release formulation.

**Off-labeled Uses**

**Prevention of Diabetes Mellitus Type 2**

- The initial dose of 850 mg once a day for a month is recommended for immediate release oral formulation. To achieve the desired outcome, this dose may increase up to 850 mg twice a day.

**Treatment of Antipsychotic-induced Weight Gain**

- The initial dose of 750 mg up to 2000 mg is recommended in two to three divided doses for immediate release oral formulation. A maximum dose of 2550 mg daily is also used in some studies.

- For extended-release formulation, the initial dose of 500 mg once is recommended and may be increased by 500 mg every two to six weeks based on the dose tolerability of patients.  A maximum dose of 1000 mg to 2000 mg daily is recommended for extended-release formulation.

**Treatment of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus**

- The initial dose of 500 mg once or twice a day is recommended for immediate release oral formulation. Then, it may increase up to 2000 mg - 2500 mg in two to three divided doses to achieve the glycemic targets. To achieve glycemic targets, the insulin may be coadministered with metformin therapy.

**Treatment of Oligomenorrhea due to PCOS**

- The initial dose of 500 mg once or twice a day is recommended for immediate release oral formulation. The daily dose is often titrated weekly in increments of 500 mg to minimize  GI adverse effects.

**Specific Patients Population**

**Patient with Renal Impairment:**Dosage adjustment is based on a periodic assessment of renal function. Generally, malnourished, debilitated, and elderly patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose.

- No dosage adjustment is necessary when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is above 60 mL per minute per body surface area. Clinicians should monitor renal function annually.

- If eGFR >45 to <60 mL per minute per body surface area, no dosage adjustment is necessary, and clinicians should monitor renal function every three to six months.

- For patients who have eGFR between 30 to 45 mL per minute per body surface area, initiation of therapy is not recommended in the manufacturer label. However, 500 mg daily dose with evening meal is recommended by some researchers.

- Metformin therapy is contraindicated when eGFR is below 30 mL per minute per body surface area.

**Patient with Hepatic Impairment:**The manufacturer recommends avoiding metformin therapy in a patient with hepatic impairment due to the potential risk factor of lactic acidosis.

**Pregnant Women:**It is considered a US FDA pregnancy category B drug. It is not recommended to use during pregnancy.

**Breastfeeding Women:**Metformin is present in breast milk. Breastfeeding is generally acceptable till the relative infant dose is below 10 mg per kg per day.

**Pediatric Patients:**Metformin is not recommended for patients below ten years.

**Geriatric Patients:**The conservative initial and maintenance dose should be considered for patients with advanced age. This patient population may have decreased renal function, and the dose should be adjusted based on a careful assessment of renal function.
