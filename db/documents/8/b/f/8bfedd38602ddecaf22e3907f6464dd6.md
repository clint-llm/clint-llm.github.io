A central venous catheter (CVC) is an indwelling device inserted into a large, central vein (most commonly the internal jugular, subclavian, or femoral) and advanced until the terminal lumen resides within the inferior vena cava, superior vena cava, or right atrium. These devices and the techniques employed to place them are synonymous with "central line" or "central venous access." The placement of a CVC was first described in 1929.

Various access techniques and devices were developed for many indications, including total parenteral nutrition administration, dialysis, plasmapheresis, medication administration, and hemodynamic monitoring, and to facilitate further complex interventions such as transvenous pacemaker placement.

Despite these advancements, the procedure has remained relatively unchanged since the advent of the (now universally employed) Seldinger technique in the 1960s.
