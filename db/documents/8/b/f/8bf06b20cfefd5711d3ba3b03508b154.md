While optometrists and ophthalmologists are almost always involved in caring for patients with watery eyes, consulting with an interprofessional team of specialists, including an otolaryngologist and a radiologist, is essential. The radiologist plays a vital role in interpreting the radiologic images. In contrast, the otolaryngologist is crucial in diagnosing nasal pathology as the cause of watery eyes and contributes to the surgical management of lacrimal drainage obstructions.

Family physicians and nurses also have an essential role in assessing this pathology, as they are often the first port of call for patients complaining of watery eyes.
