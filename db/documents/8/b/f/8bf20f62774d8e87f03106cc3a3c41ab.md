Communication can be complicated by other factors, including agitation/aggression, psychosis, delirium, and intubation.  For these cases, utilizing therapeutic communication techniques and tailoring the individual patient's interaction can be particularly important.

In agitation, verbal de-escalation techniques are generally accepted as good clinical practice; however, it is an understudied field, especially in the setting of psychosis-induced aggression or agitation.

Other complex communication issues include challenges that occur in critically ill patients, including delirium, intubation, and intellectual and developmental disabilities as well as autism.

Finally, psychosis presents a challenging communication barrier, especially concerning hallucinations and delusions.  Development of a shared understanding in the setting of psychotic experiences becomes particularly challenging, both from the standpoint of the patient communicating their concerns to the provider and the provider reflecting an understanding of these concerns.

One way to develop a shared understanding with patients with psychosis is to understand the meaning of the psychotic experiences to the patient, rather than focusing on the nature and content of the experiences themselves.
