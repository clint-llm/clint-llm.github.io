The main actions of disopyramide, i.e., sodium channel blocking and anticholinergic properties, contribute to its side effects. The maximum rate of depolarization (MRD) decreases by preventing sodium channel entry, hence the reduced contractility of the myocardia. The accompanying rapid component of delayed rectifier potassium channel blocking mentioned previously (see "Mechanism of Action") also contributes to the increase of QT interval. Because of these effects, disopyramide is excluded as a rhythm control treatment option for patients with overt heart failure (with systemic congestion) and long QT syndromes.

Although rare (<1%), some have reported in case reports adverse events such as agranulocytosis, cholestatic jaundice, malignant arrhythmia, and other electrocardiographic abnormalities.
