Patients with mucoceles present with asymptomatic, painless swelling in their mouths.

Patients with oral ranula mostly present with painless swelling in the floor of the mouth. This swelling can interfere with speech, swallowing, mastication, and even respiration as it displaces the tongue in an upward and medial direction. Sometimes, the tongue may put pressure on the lesion, interfering with the saliva outflow, thus leading to obstructive salivary gland signs and symptoms (pain when eating or chewing).

Cervical ranula, however, presents as an asymptomatic mass in the neck. There is usually a trauma to the floor of the mouth or dental surgical procedure leading to the lesion.

On physical examination, mucoceles appear as dome-shaped, non-tender, fluctuant, non-blanchable on applying pressure, and mobile swellings ranging from 0.1-4 cm in size. While superficial mucoceles have bluish to translucent hue, deep lesions have pinkish mucosal color.

Oral ranulas, on the other hand, appear as large, cystic, translucent to blue swelling in the floor of the mouth resembling the belly of a frog.
