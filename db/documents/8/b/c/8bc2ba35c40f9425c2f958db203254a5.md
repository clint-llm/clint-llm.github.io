Diagnosis of a peanut allergy relies on patient history and physical exam. The type/amount of food ingested, onset/duration of symptoms, and relieving factors are key in making an accurate diagnosis. A history of eczema is important as it is a significant risk factor for peanut sensitization. Common symptoms of peanut allergy include skin reactions, such as urticaria, erythema, or edema. More severe symptoms include tingling of the mouth and throat, edema of the lips, and dyspnea. These symptoms will often frequently progress to anaphylaxis.
