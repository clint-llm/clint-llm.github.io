Since the late 1970s, when catheter-based therapy for ischemic heart disease was first introduced, catheters have continued to evolve. Initially, cardiac catheters were used simply as a diagnostic tool. Now, they are used therapeutically and assist in the delivery of stents and balloons. This activity reviews the history and evolution of cardiac catheters as well as the evaluation and management of acute coronary syndrome. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with acute coronary syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the complications that can arise from catheter-based intervention.

- Review why a transradial access approach might be preferred over a transfemoral access approach when performing catheter intervention for acute coronary syndrome.

- Explain the differences between a diagnostic catheter, a guiding catheter, a monorail balloon catheter, and an over wire balloon catheter. 
- Outline the role of the interprofessional team in carrying out catheter based interventions that lead to better outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome.
