NUrses and other ancillary personnel are often the first to interact with a patient, and nurses or interns may even be the ones who take the patient's history. If they encounter circumstantiality, they must be able to accurately recognize it, gently try to guide and redirect the patient back to the central point at hand, andÂ report their findings to the clinician. Therefore it behooves anyone interacting with a patient on a clinical level to understand circumstantiality and note it as a finding in their examination or patient history.
