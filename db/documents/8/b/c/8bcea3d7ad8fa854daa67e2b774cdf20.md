Cystic kidney diseases may present with different clinical signs and symptoms.

ADPKD usually presents with flank pain, intermittent hematuria, cyst hemorrhage, renal infection, nephrolithiasis, hypertension, and chronic renal failure. Also, ADPKD has several extrarenal findings; hepatic cysts are the most common ones, then followed by hepatomegaly, cardiac valve disease, diverticulosis, cerebral aneurysms, pancreatic cysts, and seminal vesicle cysts.

In ARPKD, there are also renal and extrarenal presentations such as hypertension, renal insufficiency, palpable bilateral flank masses, electrolyte abnormalities (usually hyponatremia), and growth retardation. Pulmonary hypoplasia is a severe extrarenal finding and may cause neonatal death. ARPKD is generally associated with hepatic disease, including portal hypertension, varices, and splenomegaly.

Glomerulocystic kidney disease presents with hypertension, abdominal masses, and renal failure in neonates; flank pain, hematuria, and hypertension in adults.

JNPHP presents with growth retardation, polyuria and polydipsia, skeletal dysplasia, anemia, and progressive renal failure.

Tuberous sclerosis has several other findings, including angiofibromas, facial nevi, cardiac rhabdomyomas, epilepsy, and mental retardation.

VHLS is a cystic disease of the pancreas, kidneys, and epididymis, and develops renal cell carcinoma, retinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytomas.

The acquired renal cystic disease usually progresses without any symptom; however, it can present with palpable renal mass, gross hematuria, flank pain, and renal colic.
