In food poisoning and non-foodborne diarrheal disease, a history and physical can help to identify the causative agent and help to create a differential. The onset of symptoms is typically 8 to 16 hours after consuming raw or undercooked meat or poultry. The patient often has diffuse abdominal pain, profuse watery, non-bloody diarrhea, and vomiting.

Rarely will these patients present with abdominal sepsis that may manifest with hypotension, tachycardia, and abnormal thermal homeostasis. In addition to hemodynamic instability, there will likely be signs of abdominal distention with tenderness, a rigid hypertympanic abdomen, and altered mental status. These signs are indicative of a medical and surgical emergency.

Clostridial myonecrosis (gas gangrene) typically occurs after an injury (traumatic) but can develop spontaneously in patients with ischemic vascular disease or diabetes (non-traumatic). The patients present with cellulitis at the site of infection, fever, and chills. The wound has edema, tenderness, and bullae that can have a discharge with a musty odor. Symptoms are disproportionately dominant compared to signs. Infection of the deeper tissues results in necrosis of subcutaneous fat, muscle, or nerves. Symptoms can rapidly progress to septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is associated with high mortality.
