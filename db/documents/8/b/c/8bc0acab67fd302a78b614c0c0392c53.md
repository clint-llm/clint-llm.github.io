Neonatal therapeutic hypothermia is associated with several physiologic derangements. Frequent monitoring is crucial for the early detection and management of complications.

- 
**Cardiovascular:**

- 
              
- Monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and perfusion status
              
              
- Monitor continuous mean arterial pressure (MAP) through arterial lines. 
              
              
- Obtain full EKG if there is significant bradycardia 
              
              
- Consider Echocardiogram if persistent hypotension occurs.

- **Respiratory**:

- 
              
- Infants usually need ventilator support to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
              
              
- Initially, frequent blood gas (q 4hrs) monitoring may be necessary. The partial pressure of gases depends on the temperature. It is essential to adjust the blood gas machine for "actual" core temperature before running the sample.
              
              
- Maintain arterial blood gas pCO2 within normal range at 38-45 mmHg. PaO2 should be > 60 and < 100mmHg.
              
              
- Use humidified and heated gas. 
              
              
- More frequent suction with saline and regular re-positioning might be necessary as secretions tend to be more sticky.

- 
**Neurological:**

- 
              
- Infants on therapeutic hypothermia need frequent neurologic assessment. Check pupils, level of consciousness, and also look for signs of raised intracranial pressure.
              
              
- Neonates may need low dose morphine infusion to optimize comfort and efficacy of the therapeutic hypothermia. Cold stress is quite painful, so the neonates need adequate sedation. Monitor the pain scale using the validated pain assessment tool. Also, monitor for signs of inadequate sedation such as increased heart rate, shivering, or difficulty ventilating. 
              
              
- Watch for oversedation due to possible accumulation because of altered pharmacokinetics, especially if the neonate is on phenobarbitone, as this might mask neurological examination.
              
              
- Commence aEEG monitoring - Seizures can occur in approximately 50% of neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy getting therapeutic hypothermia. 
              
              
- Consider brain MRI at four to seven days of life after the neonate has completed therapeutic hypothermia when any diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities are still apparent.

- 
**Fluid and electrolytes:**

- 
              
- Neonates preferably are kept nil per oral during hypothermia. We can consider giving non-nutritive priming volumes of breast milk if the neonate has adequate urine output and normal liver function.
              
              
- Most neonates are fluid restricted to avoid cerebral edema and fluid overload. Typically, start the total fluid rate at 50-60 mL/kg/day and adjust based on the input-output chart.
              
              
- Maintain glucose and electrolytes within normal limits.
              
              
- Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is also common after perinatal asphyxia. Sodium levels could fall due to increased renal loss in hypothermia.

- **Blood work:**arterial blood gas, electrolytes, renal function test, liver function test, coagulation profile, and glucose need to be done before starting the therapeutic hypothermia and at 4,8,12,24,72 hours.

- **Skincare:**Assessing the integrity of the skin every 6 hours is an integral part of therapeutic hypothermia.

- **Strict infection control measures:**Hypothermia can cause immune dysfunctions; thus, actions should be commenced immediately.
