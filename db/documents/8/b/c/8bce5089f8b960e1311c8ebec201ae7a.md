**Causes of Primary SCVT**

- Effort-induced thrombosis (Paget von Schroetter syndrome)

- Idiopathic (frequently associated with undiagnosed malignancy)

**Causes of Secondary SCVT**

- Mechanical trauma

- Chronic CVC placement
- Pacemaker leads
- Clavicle fracture
- Hemodialysis catheters

- Long term feeds

- Prone position in surgery

- Antithrombin III deficiency

- Factor V Leiden mutation

- Protein C deficiency

- Protein S deficiency

- Surgery

- Superior vena cava syndrome

- underlying malignancies with the following mechanisms; a. cancer-associated thrombosis, b. venous compression, and c. tumoral infiltration

- Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome

- Lung cancer malignancy (rare) - more common with Pancoast tumor

- Catheter-related risk factors include:

- Subclavian venipuncture
- Technically difficult or left-sided catheter placement
- Location of the catheter tip away from the right atrium and caval junction
- Prior central venous catheterization
- Catheters with larger lumens
- Peripherally-inserted central catheters compare to the chemo ports
- Underlying conditions, including chest radiation therapy, bolus chemotherapy, and total parenteral nutrition
