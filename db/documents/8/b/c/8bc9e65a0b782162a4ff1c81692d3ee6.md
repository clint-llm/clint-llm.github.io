Conditions in which in-the-bag PCIOL cannot be implanted include:

**Subluxation/dislocation of the lens (ectopia lentis) â€“**Causes of ectopia lentis include:

- Hereditary ectopia lentis without systemic manifestations - Simple ectopia lentis and ectopia lentis et papillae.

- Hereditary ectopia lentis with systemic associations - Marfan syndrome, Weill Marchesani syndrome, homocystinuria, hyperlysinemia, and sulfite oxidase deficiency.

- Acquired causes - Ocular trauma, high myopia, buphthalmos, anterior uveal tumors, inflammatory causes like chronic cyclitis and syphilis, and pseudoexfoliation syndrome

**Inadequate capsular support -**This is seen in cases of post-surgical aphakia due to intracapsular cataract extraction surgery or complications of cataract surgery such as bag dialysis, zonular dialysis, and large posterior capsular rupture.
