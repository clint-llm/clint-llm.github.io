The diagnosis of S. saprophyticus requires a confirmatory urine culture. A positive culture is indicated by greater than 100,000 colony-forming units per mL, with a sensitivity and specificity of more than 90%.

UTI, in general, may be diagnosed more cost-effectively with a urine dipstick alone. A dipstick that is positive for leukocytes esterase and/or nitrites is the most simplistic method of UTI diagnosis. In cases of negative dipstick results, and high clinical suspicion, a bacterial urine culture should also be obtained.

- An adequate urine sample should be obtained from a mid-stream catch or straight catheterization, which more effectively avoids contamination.

Imaging is not necessary for cases of uncomplicated UTIs. If renal pathology, such as pyelonephritis, is suspected a CT scan is the most sensitive modality for demonstrating complications such as hydronephrosis or renal abscess.
