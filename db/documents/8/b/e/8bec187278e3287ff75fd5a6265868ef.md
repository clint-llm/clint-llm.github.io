Obturator hernias are rarely diagnosed in a non-symptomatic patient, with the majority of cases presenting as an emergency with intestinal obstruction.

The intimate relationship of the hernia with the obturator nerve could lead to the presence of the Howship-Romberg sign. This is obturator neuralgia, causing pain in the medial thigh that is relieved by flexing the hip and exacerbated by extension, adduction, and medial rotation of the hip. The Hannington-Kiff sign is an absent adductor reflex in the thigh. This is elicited by placing a finger on the adductors 5 cm above the knee, then percussing said finger with a tendon hammer. A contraction of muscle indicated an adductor reflex that is present. The Hannington-Kiff sign is more specific than the Howship-Romberg sign, but could be hard to elicit, and is operator dependent.
