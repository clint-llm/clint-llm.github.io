Membranous nephropathy (MN) is an immune complex deposition disease. IgG and complements predominantly deposit beneath the podocytes on the sub-epithelial region of glomerular capillaries. Hence, the sub-epithelial deposits are considered to be pathognomonic for MN. Glomerular basement membrane (GBM) injury due to immune deposition causes podocyte structural damage which results in proteinuria. Autoimmune diseases, medications, malignancies, infections, among others, are responsible for generating antibodies that account for about 25% of MN (secondary MN). In about 75 percent of cases of MN, the inciting events for these immune depositions are not known, but specific antigen-antibody complexes have been discovered (primary MN). This activity reviews the causes, evaluation, and management of membranous nephropathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of membranous nephropathy.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with membranous nephropathy.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for membranous nephropathy.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis and treatment of membranous nephropathy and improve outcomes.
