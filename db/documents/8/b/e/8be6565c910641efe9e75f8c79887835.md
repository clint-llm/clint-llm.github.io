While a pediatric surgeon is always involved in the care of patients with exstrophy bladder, it is crucial to consult with an interdisciplinary team of specialists. The neonatologist or pediatrician, who is involved in the immediate management of the baby after birth, has an important role in the care of the exposed bladder plate and the surrounding skin. Covering of the bladder plate with a saran wrap/plastic wrap not only avoids trauma and bleeding but also aids in surgical closure of the bladder template by preventing the formation of polyps. Consultation with a nephrologist is crucial, as there will be a deterioration in the upper tract function after the bladder closure. Therefore, engaging the nephrologist right from the beginning is always beneficial.

The nurses are also a vital member of the interprofessional group. They play a major role in educating the parents and the patients about clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) and ensure their compliance. The pharmacist might ensure that the patient is on correct formulation and doses of anticholinergic medications. A urologist and a psychiatrist play a crucial role in the management of the psychosexual issues at the time of transitional care. Thus, the demand for precise planning and discussion with the interprofessional team involved in the management of the patient is highly recommended to lower the morbidity and to improve outcomes.
