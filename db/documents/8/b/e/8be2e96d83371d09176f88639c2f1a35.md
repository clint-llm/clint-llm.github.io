The LeFort I osteotomy is a horizontal maxillary osteotomy utilized in the correction of midface deformities allowing movement anteriorly/posteriorly, vertically, rotationally, and with segmentation: expansion. It can also be utilized to facilitate surgical access for the removal of tumors or the reduction of complex midfacial fractures. It is named in accordance with the LeFort I horizontal fracture pattern described by Rene LeFort in 1901.

The earliest maxillary osteotomies were utilized to facilitate exposure for removal of nasopharyngeal polyps, and the first LeFort I osteotomy for correction of dentofacial deformities was described by Wassmund in 1921 utilizing orthopedic traction rather than intra-operative mobilization. Auxhausen first described the osteotomy with intra-operative mobilization in 1934 for the closure of an open bite. Schuchardt separated the pterygomaxillary junction allowing anterior repositioning. Bellâ€™s research demonstrated the revascularization phenomenon, the ability to sacrifice the descending palatine arteries without compromising blood supply, and the ability for osseous healing from a complete maxillary osteotomy, thus providing the biologic basis for a complete down fracture. As the procedure has continued to evolve, incorporating and recognizing the roles of hypotensive anesthesia, orthodontics, tension-free stability, and virtual surgical planning, it has become widely accepted as a common, predictable, and safe procedure.
