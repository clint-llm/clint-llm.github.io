Since not all patients will progress from BE to cancer, an essential area of research is the development of reliable risk-profiling methods to identify patients at higher risk and who will benefit more from therapies. The use of biomarkers to risk-stratify patients is currently undergoing extensive research, with DNA content abnormalities and TP53 and CDKN2A genetic alterations showing the most promise to date.  At this time, though, there is not enough evidence to recommend them for use in routine practice. Novel sampling techniques for screening that show promise include transnasal endoscopy and cytosponge. Many more on-going and future studies should add to our current knowledge base regarding BE and its best management.
