- HVS exists as a clinical triad of neurological symptoms, mucosal bleeding, and visual disturbances.

- HVS can be caused by overproduction of nearly any hematologic component but is most common with hypergammaglobulinemia.

- Symptoms are varied and driven by decreased blood flow through capillary beds.

- Diagnosis of HVS is made by determining an elevated serum viscosity which can be suggested by Rouleaux formation on peripheral smear or repeated malfunction of laboratory testing equipment.

- Treatment is driven first by reversal of dehydration, elective phlebotomy, but most definitively by plasmapheresis until the treatment of the underlying condition can be initiated.
