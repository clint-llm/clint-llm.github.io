Depending upon the trimester of pregnancy, if the fetus is lost during the first trimester of pregnancy, i.e., in the embryonic stage, the mother is most likely to experience the complication of the vanishing twin in the form of vaginal bleeding or spotting, pelvic cramps or back pain. The chances of survival of the viable co-twin are good in such cases.

On the other hand, chances of complications are higher in the existing co-twin if the demise of the twin occurs later in gestation, which may include cerebral palsy of the viable twin, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) of the viable twin, premature labor, and other congenital anomalies accompanied by a fetus papyraceous.

Among neonatal outcomes, fetal malformations were recorded more in vanishing twin pregnancies than singleton and twin pregnancies.

It is advisable to have regular prenatal follow up and have the pregnancy assessed with the help of ultrasonographic examinations, to have knowledge about the fetal anomalies associated with the demise of the twin. However, most of the vanishing twin pregnancies will end up uncomplicated throughout gestation and birth. However, studies show that the birth weight was found to be slightly lower in the co-twin in vanishing twin pregnancy as compared to non-vanishing twin pregnancy.
