Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to infection that can lead to multi-organ dysfunction, failure, and even death. Urosepsis is sepsis caused by infections of the urinary tract, including cystitis, or lower urinary tract and bladder infections, and pyelonephritis, or upper urinary tract and kidney infections. Nearly 25 percent of sepsis cases originate from the urogenital tract. This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, and presentation of urosepsis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of urosepsis.
- Review the presentation of a patient with urosepsis.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for urosepsis.
- Explain the importance of the interprofessional team in ensuring appropriate antibiotic administration in the management of patients with urosepsis.
