Stress ulcers are stress-induced gastritis or gastropathy where the gastric and sometimes esophageal or duodenal mucosal barrier is disrupted secondary to a severe acute illness. It may present in the form of erosive gastritis ranging from asymptomatic superficial lesions and occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleed to overt clinically significant GI bleeding. The stress ulcers secondary to systemic burns are known as Curling ulcers. Stress ulcers in patients with acute traumatic brain injury are known as Cushing ulcers. The gastric body and fundus are common locations for stress ulcerations but can also be seen in the antrum and duodenum.
