Pubic symphysis diastasis (PSD) following childbirth via vaginal delivery is a rare but debilitating condition. Widening of the cartilaginous joint during pregnancy before childbirth is physiologic and assists in expanding the birth canal for successful delivery. However, reports of non-physiologic pubic diastasis exceeding that typically required for childbirth (typically greater than 1 centimeter) can leave mothers with debility and extreme pain. The incidence of complete separation of the pubic symphysis is reported to be within 1 in 300 to 1:30,000, with many instances likely undiagnosed. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and complications of postpartum pubic symphysis diastasis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical presenting features of postpartum pubic symphysis diastasis.
- Review the evaluation of postpartum pubic symphysis diastasis.
- Outline the treatment of postpartum pubic symphysis diastasis.
- Summarize how enhanced coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid recognition of postpartum pubic symphysis diastasis and subsequently decrease the time to treatment.
