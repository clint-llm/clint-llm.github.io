Complications occur either due to untreated disease and subsequent spread of the tumor or commonly due to side-effects of treatment. Surgery involving tumor excision, neck dissection, and free flap reconstruction carries the risk of flap failure, wound dehiscence, damage to local motor and sensory nerves, vocal cord palsy, trismus, dysarthria, and the potential long-term requirement of tracheostomy and/or feeding tubes. Patients may require an extended stay in intensive care.

Chemo or radiotherapy can result in a wide range of debilitating, chronic symptoms. Specifically, in the oral cavity, patients may experience mucositis (inflammation of the mucosa) pain, bleeding, trismus, and dry mouth. Together with dysphagia, this can lead to reduced oral intake and malnutrition. Speech can commonly be affected, requiring therapy from Speech and Language teams. Systemic effects of therapy may also result in neutropenia and subsequent associated infections due to immunocompromise.

The psychological impact of a cancer diagnosis, together with the above complications and side-effects of treatment, can have a devastating and life-long impact on mental wellbeing and quality of life.
