Debriefing serves as a powerful tool and a robust educational technique in medical education. The widespread use of debriefing in simulation programs has correlated with enhanced team performance and improved behavioral and technical skills of providers in simulated settings. The use of debriefing following clinical events has evolved in the last two decades and has improved clinical performance and patient care.

The two common formats of debriefing following clinical events are hot (immediately, minutes, or hours after the event) and cold (days to weeks after the event). Hot debriefing usually relies on participants memories and thoughts processes to discuss the clinical event and incorporates the format of “qualitative” debriefing to assess and address urgent issues following the event, while cold debriefing incorporates the formal of “quantitative” debriefing with a collection of quantitative data and follow-up patient information to enhance quality improvement opportunities and system improvement.

**Conclusion**

Debriefing is the cornerstone of effective simulation-based medical education. While the evidence-based gold standard debriefing technique is yet to be determined, most of these debriefing techniques are likely effective if utilized appropriately by educators and facilitators.
