Fusiform incision is commonly used to remove lesions that are roughly round or oval. Fusiform incisions involve the surgical removal of tissue in a manner that results in the tapering of both ends of the specimen. The technique begins by determining the margins needed around a given lesion, and those margins are marked, forming a circle or an oval. The fusiform incision will include the tissue within the marked boundaries as well as additional tissue at either end to allow for the desired tapering. Removal of tissue in this manner allows the wound to be closed in a linear, side-to-side fashion with minimal surface irregularity. This activity describes the indications and technique involved in fusiform incisions and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures relevant to fusiform incisions.
- Describe the equipment required to perform a fusiform incision.
- Describe the potential complications of fusiform incisions.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for optimizing care coordination and communication to advance the performance of fusiform incision and improve outcomes.
