There are no documented reports about the prognosis of Lp-X induced hypercholesterolemia. In general, patients who have this type of hyperlipidemia get normal LDL -c levels after treatment of the underlying condition. In aÂ case report by Patel AM et al. (2016), it was discussed that a patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis who developed hypercholesterolemia due to Lp-X had normal levels of lipid profile after treatment with steroid and azathioprine.

Palmer xanthomas found in some patients with cholestasis on physical examination also regress months after the Lp-X levels reduce.
