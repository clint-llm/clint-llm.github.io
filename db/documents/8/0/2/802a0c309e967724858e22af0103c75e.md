HIV is a retrovirus that replicates primarily in CD4+ T cells and macrophages. HIV can be transmitted via blood, blood products, sexual fluids, and breast milk. Most people are infected with HIV through sexual contact, before birth or during delivery, during breastfeeding, or when sharing contaminated syringes.
