Carpal tunnel injections are performed because of the extremely high prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome in the general population. Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common peripheral nerve entrapment syndrome, and therapies, both conservative and more invasive, are routinely performed. This activity reviews common injection techniques for carpal tunnel syndrome, evaluates the risk factors for the development of the condition, and describes the common presentation of symptomatology. It also reviews the role of the interprofessional team in this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the technique of carpal tunnel injections. 
- Review of the pain distribution seen in carpal tunnel based on the anatomy of the median nerve.
- Outline the major risk factors for the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. 
- Summarize the appropriate treatment strategy for patients with symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.
