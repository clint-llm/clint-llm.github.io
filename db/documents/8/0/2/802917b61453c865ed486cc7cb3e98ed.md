Two general guidelines are important in evaluating critically ill patients:

- First, measure TSH level only if there is a high clinical suspicion of thyroid dysfunction. If the TSH level is abnormal, then further workup should be done. If the TSH level is greater than 20 microUnits/mL, or if it is undetectable, euthyroid sick syndrome is less likely to cause abnormal lab results, and overt thyroid dysfunction should be strongly considered.

- Second, when serum TSH is not elevated, euthyroid sick syndrome should be considered even in patients with known thyroid diseaseÂ and low serum free T3 or T4 levels.
