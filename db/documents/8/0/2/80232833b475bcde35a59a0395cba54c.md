The European Society for immunodeficiencies (ESID) new criteria for diagnosing selective IgA deficiency include the following constellation:

- Undetectable serum IgA levels (below 0.07 g/l, measured by nephelometry), although normal serum levels of IgG and IgM (evaluated by nephelometry at least twice)

- Enhanced susceptibility to infections, especially respiratory

- Diagnosis at an age older thanÂ four years (reportedly the age at which nephelometry can measure IgA with precision).

- Concomitant autoimmune diseases or a family member with the disease

- Excluded secondary causes of hypogammaglobulinemia

- Normal antibody (IgG) response to all vaccinations

- Exclusion of T-cell defect

If specialized immunophenotyping is being performed, the results may show that some patients possess a lower percentage of switched memory B cells (below 0.4%), whereas others may have a similar profile with healthy control percentages. The former patients classified as group I may demonstrate a higher rate of pneumonia, autoimmunity, and hepatosplenomegaly.

Pulmonary function tests are recommended to follow patients with IgA deficiency. Patients with recurrent diarrhea should undergo jejunal biopsy, which may show blunting of the villi. The histopathology may reveal the absence of IgA secreting cells and the presence of IgM secretory cells in the lamina propria.

**Special Note: Celiac Disease**

Patients with concomitant celiac disease and IgA deficiency can display laboratory incongruencies.
