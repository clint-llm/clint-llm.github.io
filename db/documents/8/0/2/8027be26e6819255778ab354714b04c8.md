Mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms (MCPN) are very difficult to diagnose and successfully treat rare tumors of the pancreas which mostly occur in middle-aged females. The tumors frequently are confused with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN). The interprofessional healthcare team must work together to make the diagnose and successfully treat patients with MCPN. Care should be coordinated by nurses and physicians and pharmacists should provide assistance to the team in managing chemotherapeutic agents. Operative and perianesthesia nurses are involved in patient care and monitoring. Oncology nurses administer treatment, provide patient education, and keep the team updated on patient status. Oncologic pharmacists evaluate prescribed chemotherapy, check for drug-drug interactions, and participate in patient education. Outcomes can be improved by team coordination. [Level V]
