Cleft hands are congenital disorders, and significant deformities are present at birth. An understanding of the exact deformity is critical to guide treatment. Family history for similar malformations will be suggestive of a typical cleft hand deformity, whereas an absence of family history will be more indicative of a sporadic mutation.

Clinicians should perform a careful assessment of the vasculature of the hand, ensuring the hand is well perfused as atypical cleft hands associated with Poland syndrome are a result of vascular hypoplasia. Furthermore, an examination of the ipsilateral chest wall will help to guide management. Absence or hypoplasia of the pectoralis musculature will be further evidence of vascular insufficiency at the subclavian artery and may necessitate staged surgical release of symbrachydactyly given the underlying poor vasculature.
