A large number of fungi can cause the disease. They are dematiaceous, i.e., producing brown pigment. The most common fungi are Cladosporium carrionii, Phialophora verrucosa, and Fonsecaea pedrosoi. Less common pathogens are Fonsacea compactum, Exophiala spinifera, Rhinocladiella aquaspersa, Exophiala jeanselmei, and Wangiella dermatitidis. The fungi have been isolated from wood and soil and enter the body following trauma. The condition is common in rural communities.Cladosporium carrionii reproduces by fission. It produces multiple conidia in long, straight chains that bud off the hyphae, with the youngest conidia farthest from the hyphae.
