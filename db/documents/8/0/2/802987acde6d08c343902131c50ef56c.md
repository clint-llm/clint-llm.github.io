Currently, no antidotes are available for EDTA. In patients who have cerebral edema, increases in intracranial pressure should be treated immediately with osmotic agents. Patients with nephrotoxicity should be given fluids to ensure hydration and be monitored for urine output. Renal function should be continuously monitored even after the development of toxicity. Overall, patients who develop signs or symptoms of toxicity should immediately be discontinued from the drug.
