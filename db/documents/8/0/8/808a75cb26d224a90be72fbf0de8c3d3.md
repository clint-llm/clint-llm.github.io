The prognosis of LC remains poor despite advances in therapy. There is a lack of randomized clinical trials, and treatment methods are derived from lower evidence studies or clinical expert opinions. Treatment focuses on improving neurologic deficits, quality of life, and prolonging survival while minimizing toxicity. Commonly, radiation is applied to bulky or symptomatic anatomical lesions followed by IT chemotherapy. CSF flow obstruction is relieved by surgical interventions; however, surgery has a very marginal role in the management of LC. Systemic therapy can be added to the regimen to treat the primary tumor and potentially prolong survival.

Palliative and supportive treatment are provided as needed with anti-depressants, anxiolytics, and opioid and non-opioid agents. Psychostimulants should always be provided in addition to pursuing the treatment of the disease/cancer.
