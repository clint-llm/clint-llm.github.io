HFS is an effective strategy for teaching, assessing, and evaluating a wide range of learners from all healthcare disciplines.  Pre-licensure students can benefit from participation in HFS, but educators may want to scaffold simulation activities allowing novice learners to build knowledge, skill, and confidence with low-fidelity stimulation (LFS) activities before HFS.

The level of fidelity employed in any simulation activity should merit careful consideration, along with all other aspects of the experience.  The required level of fidelity for any SBLE is the one that is necessary to achieve the desired participant outcomes. Higher levels of fidelity can increase participants’ level of engagement and acceptability of the simulated experience; this will impact the achievement of the desired learning objectives and the ability to transfer the learning to the clinical setting.

Trained simulation educators, versed in the standards of best practice, provide the expertise to develop and implement high-quality SBLE; they understand that level and type of fidelity are key considerations when designing SBLE. The SBLE must be considered in its entirety, recognizing that fidelity is one aspect of the activity.  Some of the current research that attempts to compare HFS to LFS does not account for variances in other components of the activities.  For instance, the inclusion or omission of a structured debriefing will have a significant impact on the effectiveness of a simulation activity, regardless of the level of fidelity.

The role of fidelity and its impact on learning outcomes requires additional research and clarification of the associated terminology. The terms high-fidelity and high-fidelity simulation are used in such wide and diverse contexts, their meaning is either lost
