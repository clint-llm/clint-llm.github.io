**Mortality/Morbidity**

Overall, patients with vascular dementia have a shortened life expectancy. Those who have already had a cerebrovascular accident have the highest mortality, with a 5-year survival of only 39%. Patients with vascular dementia also have coexistingÂ atherosclerotic disease, and death from cardiovascular causes is common.
