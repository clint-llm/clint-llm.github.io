New advances in medicine regularly assist clinicians and their teams in their practice and enable them to think creatively and make healthcare increasingly convenient for patients. Management of infants with respiratory distress syndrome is best with an interprofessional team. While the respiratory therapist may administer the surfactant, the NICU nurse (specifically neonate specialty-trained nurses), critical care specialist, and pulmonologist must be involved in monitoring the neonate. This clinical team can include physician assistants or nurse practitioners who work in pulmonary specialty practices. The volume, viscosity, and mode of ventilation are all vital components for surfactant efficacy. After administering surfactant, the nurse monitors the vital signs and oxygenation. The respiratory therapist must monitor the ventilatory parameters at least for the first 60 minutes after surfactant administration. If they notice any issues, including adverse events or insufficient therapeutic response/therapeutic failure, they should alert the prescribing clinician and/or consult with the pharmacist while recording their findings in the patient's permanent health record.

The pharmacy will be responsible for ensuring proper preparation of the surfactant, verifying dosing and administration, and serving as a drug information resource to the rest of the team. With an interprofessional team approach and open communication, surfactant therapy optimally reduces the morbidity of respiratory distress syndrome in neonates. [Level 5]

Research has indicated that surfactant preparations have anti-inflammatory properties and can aid the immune system in acute lung injury (ALI) secondary to LPS (lipopolysaccharide) endotoxin. Because the surfactant proteins regulate cytokine production by inflammatory cells, animal models have shown that they can effectively limit lung injury caused by LPS endotoxin.

These newer approaches improve patient safety and enhance team performances by improving care coordination. Not only that, but nanotechnology testing is alsoÂ underway to determine whether surfactant may serve as a drug delivery system for administering alternative medications.
