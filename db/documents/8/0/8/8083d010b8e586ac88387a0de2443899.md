Blood flow distribution in anatomic variants:

In patients with unilateral fetal type PCA, the tCBF through the contralateral ACA was 13% compared to 10% in the ipsilateral PCA but flow through the other individual arteries were approximately the same.

CBF changes with age:

The tCBF decreases by approximately 2.6mL/min per year as patients become older irrelevant of whether the cerebrovascular disease exists or not, as shown by recent studies.
