# Definition/Introduction

General anesthesia is a medically-induced loss of consciousness with concurrent loss of protective reflexes due to anesthetic agents. Various medications may be prescribed to induce unconsciousness, amnesia, analgesia, skeletal muscle relaxation, and the loss of autonomic system reflexes.

In the past, when physical examination offered the only clue as to a patient's depth of anesthesia, anesthetic overdose by an inexperienced anesthetist easily occurred. It was not until the 20th century that the anesthesia community developed a truly systematic approach to monitoring. In 1937, Dr. Arthur Guedel created one of the first safety systems in anesthesiology, with a chart that explained the stages of anesthesia with an increasing depth ranging from stages 1 to 4.

**Stages of Anesthesia Based on Guedel's Classification**

- Stage 1 - Analgesia or Disorientation: This stage can be initiated in a preoperative anesthesiology holding area, where the patient is given medication and may begin to feel its effects but has not yet become unconscious. This stage is usually described as the "induction stage." Patients are sedated but conversational. Breathing is slow and regular. At this stage, the patient progresses from analgesia free of amnesia to analgesia with concurrent amnesia.

- Stage 2 - Excitement or Delirium: This stage is marked by features such as disinhibition, delirium, uncontrolled movements, loss of eyelash reflex, hypertension, and tachycardia. Airway reflexes remain intact during this phase and are often hypersensitive to stimulation. Airway manipulation during this stage of anesthesia should be avoided, including both the placement and removal of endotracheal tubes and deep suctioning maneuvers. There is a higher risk of laryngospasm (involuntary tonic closure of vocal cords) at this stage, which may be aggravated by any airway manipulation. Consequently, the combination of spastic movements, vomiting, and rapid, irregular respirations can compromise the patient's airway.

- Stage 3 – Surgical Anesthesia: This is the targeted anesthetic level for procedures requiring general anesthesia. Ceased eye movements and respiratory depression are the hallmarks of this stage. Airway manipulation is safe at this level. There are four "planes" described for this stage.

- Stage 4 - Overdose: This stage occurs when too much anesthetic agent is given relative to the amount of surgical stimulation, which results in worsening of an already severe brain or medullary depression. This stage begins with respiratory cessation and ends with potential death. Skeletal muscles are flaccid, and pupils are fixed and dilated at this stage.

# Issues of Concern

General anesthesia induces physiological responses, potentially resulting in morbidity and mortality when emergency situations are not properly addressed. Therefore, it is regarded as a high-risk activity where the benefits of surgery must outweigh the potential harms. Mortality directly related to anesthetic management is rare but may result from pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, asphyxiation, or anaphylaxis.

# Clinical Significance

Guedel's classification for the stages of general anesthesia was initially established to deliver diethyl ether, the single available volatile anesthetic at the time. While Gaudel's patients were usually pre-medicated with sedative agents such as morphine and atropine, ether was the drug of choice for induction.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

Anesthesia is thought to be best practiced via an interdisciplinary approach that includes anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists, nurses and other operating room staff, recovery room nurses, and anesthesia technicians to ensure patient safety. Because there is no agent capable of instantly reversing the effects of inhaled anesthetics, close monitoring of the patient is necessary during anesthesia. A responsible anesthesiologist, anesthetist, or nurse should attentively monitor vital signs during induction and maintenance periods to confirm that the patient is appropriately sedated without signs of instability.
