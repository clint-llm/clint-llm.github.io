Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and percutaneous endoscopic gastro-jejunal (PEG-J) tubes are common procedures in the management of patients who require long-term nutritional support. This activity outlines the indications, contraindications, and potential complications of this procedure and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in caring for patients who require and undergo placement of percutaneous gastrostomy and jejunostomy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of the placement of percutaneous gastrostomy and jejunostomy tubes.
- Describe the technique required for the placement of percutaneous gastrostomy and jejunostomy tubes.
- Review the potential complications of percutaneous gastrostomy and jejunostomy procedures.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to facilitate the appropriate selection of candidates for percutaneous gastrostomy/jejunostomy and its postprocedure management.
