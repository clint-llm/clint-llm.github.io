The patient should be sat on a chair suited to their habitus and comfort. The chair should ideally be in the center of the room, as part of the examination requires the examiner to stand behind the patient. Before the examination, one must first ask the patient if they are in any pain. The patient should also be asked whether they have any ear-related symptoms (specifically discharge, pain, hearing loss) – and which they think is their better hearing ear. Convention states that one first examines the better ear.

Clear and courteous description of what is required of the patient during the examination will reduce the possibility of discomfort or confusion, especially during tests that require patient cooperation, such as the tuning fork tests.

As with all clinical encounters, the examiner should review clinical notes of previous encounters, any relevant referral letters, and review any investigations such as clinical imaging or hearing tests.

To reduce the risk of cross-contamination of pathogens, the WHO recommended ‘5 moments of hand hygiene’ should be adhered to throughout the examination.
