Potential complications and side effects are dependent upon the type of block performed. However, complications include peripheral nerve injury (although not common, the rate may be as high as 8% to 10%), hematoma, local anesthetic systemic toxicity, allergic reaction, infection, and a secondary injury, which includes reduced sensation after nerve block.
