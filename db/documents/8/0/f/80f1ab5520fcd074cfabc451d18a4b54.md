Several medical conditions might mimic the signs and symptoms of endometrial carcinoma. In premenopausal women, abnormal uterine bleeding might be a result of endometriosis, fibroids, adenomyosis, and ovulatory dysfunction. Conditions such as atrophic vaginitis, endometrial atrophy, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrial/cervical polyps are more common in postmenopausal women and are the potential differential diagnosis for endometrial carcinoma. Systemic conditions such as coagulopathy and infection must also be ruled out in both groups.
