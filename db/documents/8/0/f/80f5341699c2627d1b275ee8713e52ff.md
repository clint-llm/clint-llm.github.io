MicrosporidiaÂ is a spore-forming unicellular organism belonging to kingdom Protista and has recently been reclassified as fungi based on molecular studies.

Among humans, microsporidia can affect various organs, including the eye.

In the eye, the microsporidia can cause epithelial keratoconjunctivitis, deep stromal keratitis, scleritis, and endophthalmitis.
