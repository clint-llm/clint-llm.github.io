WPW pattern arises from the fusion of ventricular preexcitation through the accessory pathway and normal electrical conduction through the AV node. This accessory pathway is thought to arise from chamber myocardium during improper early atrial and ventricular foldingÂ in cardiac embryogenesis. As a result, electrically conductive myocardial bundles violate the normal electrical insulation of the atrium and ventricle, forming the accessory pathway.
