It appears that 75% of the pituitary needs to be damaged to result in hypopituitarism. Clinical features of hypopituitarism may be subtle and ill-defined or severe with the acute presentation. Conditions such as Sheehan syndrome/pituitary apoplexy, pituitary infection, hypophysitis, and traumatic brain injury present with acute findings.

Presenting signs and symptoms may be linked to those of a deficiency of the pituitary hormone, mass effects in the presence of pituitary tumors, and/or features of the causative disease.

Patients with hormonal deficiencies present with the following:

- ACTH deficiency - Adrenal insufficiency

- TSH deficiency - Hypothyroidism

- Gonadotropin deficiency - Hypogonadism

- GH deficiency - Difficult to thrive and short stature in children. Adults are usually asymptomatic; however, they may feel fatigued and weak.

- ADH deficiency - Diabetes Insipidus presenting with polydipsia and polyuria

Mass effects include visual field defects, with the most common being bitemporal hemianopsia. Visual field defects may also occur unilaterally. Patients may present with headaches secondary to the mass lesions.

Physical examination may not reveal any significant findings as the presentation is usually subtle. Variable features may be present owing to the involvement of different target hormones, such as:

- Hypothyroidism - small and soft thyroid gland, dry and coarse skin, thinning of hair and alopecia, delayed tendon reflexes, cold skin with loss of sweating, and non-pitting type edema.

- Adrenal insufficiency - fatigue and postural hypotension

- Hypogonadism -  small and atrophied testes in men; loss of axillary and pubic hair in women

- Neurological and ophthalmic involvement - loss of visual acuity, extraocular paresis, and bitemporal hemianopsia

- Diabetes Insipidus - hypernatremia, polyuria, and diluted urine
