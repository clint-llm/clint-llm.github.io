Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). It is used to treat several different cancers (cervical cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal cancer, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma ). The administration of bevacizumab inhibits microvascular growth and angiogenesis and is used in cancer treatment to inhibit malignant cell growth and blood vessel formation. It is usually administered in combination with other chemotherapy agents. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients with bevacizumab.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the approved indications for bevacizumab.
- Summarize the mechanism of action of bevacizumab.
- Review the potential adverse events of bevacizumab.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance bevacizumab and improve outcomes in cancer treatment.
