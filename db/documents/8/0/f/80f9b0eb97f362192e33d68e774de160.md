Body dysmorphic disorder can be difficult to identify because individuals often have limited insight into the condition or carry feelings of shame and embarrassment regarding the preoccupations.

Assessment questions include:

- Do you feel concerned about your appearance?

- How much time do you spend worrying about this or trying to change it?

- How have you been affected by this in terms of quality of life?

When determining the severity of distress and impairment, it is essential to look at social, occupational, and academic functioning.Â Assess for obsessive thoughts and repetitive behaviors, including the amount of time, level of impairment, and distress these thoughts and behaviors cause. These behaviors can include camouflaging, comparisons to others, seeking reassurance from others, skin picking, frequent mirror checking, and excessive grooming.

BDD can be specified with the degree of insight, which includes good, fair, poor, absent, and delusional.

The current standard of assessment for BDD is the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (modified for BDD), a 12-item measurement conducted by the provider.
