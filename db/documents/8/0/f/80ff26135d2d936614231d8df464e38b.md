Patients with Barton fractures will typically present to the urgent care or emergency department with acute wrist pain, swelling, and deformity following a recent trauma. The examination may reveal ecchymosis, tenderness, and swollen wrist joint. The range of motion of the wrist joint will be limited due to pain. To rule out associated injuries and complications, the distal neurovascular status must be assessed. A younger patient commonly will describe a sporting injury or motor vehicle accident, while older patients may report a lower energy trauma such as a fall from standing. The patient typically describes a history of fall on an outstretched hand. The type of fracture depends upon the position of the wrist joint during impact e.g. volar shear fractures occur when the wrist is in palmar flexion, while dorsiflexion leads to dorsal shear fractures.
