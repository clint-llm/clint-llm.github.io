Conization of the cervix is indicated for a variety of reasons. Excisional procedures are warranted for diagnostic purposes and treatment. A surgeon should perform a diagnostic excisional procedure if there is a lesion that is suspicious for invasive cancer or an adenocarcinoma in situ of the cervix. If there is a histological discordance with the cytological screening test and histological results are less severe, then a diagnostic cone is recommended. Unsatisfactory colposcopic evaluation with evidence of dysplasia present or unexplained high grade or an atypical glandular cell cytology needs an excisional cone or if the entire lesion is not completely visualized on colposcopy. These procedures are also adequate to treat severe dysplasia (CIN 2/3, CIS) and stage 1A1 squamous cell cervical cancer if the patient wants to maintain her fertility.
