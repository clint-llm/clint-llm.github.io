Multiple factors can affect the outcomes or accuracy of pure-tone evaluation. Pure-tone thresholds can vary slightly with different transducers and transducer placement or with variations in patient alertness and attention. In adults, standard diagnostic test-retest variability is typically ±5 dB across frequencies.

A masking dilemma occurs when the amount of masking noise necessary to prevent sound crossover of a tone to the NTE is loud enough to cross back to the test ear and falsely elevate the evaluated threshold.

Otalgia, particularly of the pinna or auditory canal, may prevent the appropriate placement of headphones for air conduction. Supra-aural headphones are necessary in cases of atresia, but when stenotic or partially-occluded canals are involved, the pressure they apply may cause obstruction of the canal and introduce a false conductive component.

Insert earphones can prevent external auditory canals from collapsing during testing and reduce the incidence of masking dilemmas.

Behavioral complications include false positive responses, which can result from confusing tinnitus with the presented tone, responding to a regular rhythm of tone presentation, or over-eagerness to "do well" on the evaluation, particularly when a "passing score" is required for employment qualification. False negatives may occur when a patient does not provide consistent responses to audible tones due to a lack of understanding of testing procedures, a deficit in central processing, or a non-organic deficit caused by malingering or factitious disorders.

If the patient responds because they hear the quiet tone in the better-hearing ear, the Stenger test is negative, and the hearing loss may be considered accurate. If the patient does not respond, which typically occurs because the patient deliberately does not respond to the louder tone in the tested ear and does not realize there is a quieter tone in the NTE, the Stenger is positive and indicates at least some degree of exaggeration in the responses. Stenger testing has a high degree of sensitivity for detecting unilateral non-organic hearing loss.
