Autoantibodies to type VII collagen are involved in the pathophysiology of bullous systemic lupus erythematosus. This results in a weakened basement membrane-dermal adhesion, which appears as subepidermal blistering. Type VII collagen plays a vital role as an anchoring fibril attaching the epidermis to the dermis. The circulating autoantibodies are directed against the non-collagenous domain type 1 and 2 (NC1 and NC2) of type VII collagen seen in the basement membrane zone.
