Incisions for acute compartment syndrome are all left open. Negative pressure wound dressings may be applied if major arteries and nerves aren’t exposed. Dressings should be aseptically changed every 24 to 48 hours to prevent wound infection. Delayed primary wound closure can be used 7 to 10 days after the incision so that the swelling sufficiently subsides.

Precise rehabilitation for Volkmann ischemic contracture varies from surgery to surgery. Immobilization in a cast or splint is recommended for 2 to 4 weeks. Gradual use of the limb may be begun afterward with increasing the level of activity with time.
