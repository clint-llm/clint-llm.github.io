Given the large clinical overlap between HLH and other systemic inflammatory conditions (severe infection, malignancy, and autoimmune disease), presenting symptoms are often non-specific signs of inflammation such as fever, malaise, and fatigue. Further blurring the distinction between HLH and other multi-organ inflammatory diseases is the fact that such disease processes often serve as the trigger for developing HLH. While children can have spontaneous HLH driven by genetic mutations, they can also develop HLH as the result of an antigenic stimulus or trigger, much in the same way it typically presents in adults. The most common trigger in children with primary HLH is an infection, particularly herpesvirus family infections, and even more specifically, Epstein Barr virus.

The physical exam is similarly protean. Many exam findings can be anticipated by remembering that HLH is a disease of hyper-reactive immune cells with particular attention paid to the reticuloendothelial system. To varying degrees, patients can present with cytopenias with associated bleeding, infection, or stressors related to extreme anemia (myocardial infarction, stroke, syncope) and with hepatosplenomegaly and/or diffuse adenopathy. Additionally, the severe systemic inflammation can present as altered mental status (including life-threatening meningoencephalitis), adult respiratory distress syndrome, acute liver failure, and acute renal failure.
