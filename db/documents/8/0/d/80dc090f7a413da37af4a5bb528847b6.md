Erlotinib is available in oral tablets in 25 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg. The recommended starting dose for NSCLC is 150 mg daily, while the standard starting dose for pancreatic cancer is 100 mg daily. The recommendation is that patients take erlotinib on an empty stomach, as studies have shown that bioavailability increases when taken with food. Patients should avoid concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) while taking erlotinib, as a higher stomach pH can alter erlotinib concentrations. H2 blockers and antacids should be given several hours before the administration of erlotinib.

Reduce the dose of erlotinib whenÂ using it with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors to avoid adverse interactions. Increase the dose when using the drug with CYP3A4 inducers.
