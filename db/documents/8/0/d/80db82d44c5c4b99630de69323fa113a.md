The subscapularis is the largest, strongest muscle of the rotator cuff. The rotator cuff muscles are essential in shoulder movement and help maintain glenohumeral joint stability. The subscapularis muscle lies at the anterior surface of the scapula. It originates at the subscapular fossa, specifically the medial and lower two-thirds of the groove on the lateral border. The muscles transition to a tendon, which inserts on the lesser tubercle of the humerus in front of the joint capsule. Some fibers extend to the greater tubercle and bicipital groove.

An outpouching of the glenohumeral joint lies between the subscapularis muscle and the anterior surface of the scapula, functioning as a bursa. The remainder of the rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor) insert into the greater tubercle. When the subscapularis muscle contracts, it will internally or medially rotate the humerus. The subscapularis is the only rotator cuff muscle that has this function. In certain positions, subscapularis has some adduction and extension functions. This function also helps prevent anterior displacement of the humerus.
