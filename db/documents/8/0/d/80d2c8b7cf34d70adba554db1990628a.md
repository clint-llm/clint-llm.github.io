Treatment of PSS is aimed at IOP reduction and reducing intraocular inflammation. More recently, therapy targeting the infecting virus using antiviral treatment has been used. Treatment goals for PSS can be achieved using medical and surgical methods.

**Medical Therapy**

First-line treatment for reduction of IOP during acute attacks includes topical beta-blockers, alpha agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Any of these classes of topical medications or a combination of drugs can be used with a good response. In some cases, systemic medications such as oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are warranted to control the acute rise in IOP. It is best to avoid topical prostaglandin analogs because of the risk of exacerbation of inflammation. If the IOP is reduced to normal, such topical ocular hypotensive could be withdrawn between attacks, especially if the patient is at low risk of developing GON or other ocular complications. Use of topical pilocarpine should be discouraged as this is thought to exacerbate trabeculitis.

Intraocular inflammation, often mild, can be controlled using topical steroids such as prednisolone or dexamethasone. Topical fluorometholone has also been used with good effect to control low-level intraocular inflammation. Topical and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used for the suppression of inflammation. NSAIDs will avoid possible steroid-induced glaucoma and has a desirable anti-prostaglandin effect since aqueous prostaglandin level increase has been associated with attacks.

Patients should be followed up daily to monitor the IOP during an acute episode to ensure lowering of IOP to a safe level. Less frequent visits (weekly or monthly as appropriate) can be adopted when steroid and ocular hypotensive are tapered. Instructions to consult with an ophthalmologist as soon as an attack is noted should be given. In general, at the time of initiation of treatment, documentation of baseline optic nerve parameters (as listed earlier) is required in the absence of apparently significant corneal edema. Topical ocular hypotensive and steroid should be commenced appropriately and tapered if the response is favorable. If the response to maximum therapy is unfavorable (i.e., the patient shows no signs of improvement) or if multiple recurrences occur, a search should be done for the presence of anterior chamber CMV infection using an aqueous tap. Treatment with an antiviral agent should be considered if evidence of CMV DNA is found.

There is evidence of benefit for treating CMV infection of the anterior chamber.

A combination of topical and oral ganciclovir has been used in previous research. The use of topical ganciclovir has resulted in the resolution of inflammation with cessation of topical steroids and reduction in pressure-lowering drops in several cases. However, this treatment did not completely stop the recurrence of future episodes.

While oral valganciclovir was found to be superior to ganciclovir gel in terms of failure rate, the recurrence rate was significantly higher, 80%, compared to 57%.****In this study, a good treatment effect was noted at this dose.****However, recurrence occurred after valganciclovir was stopped. Recurrence following cessation of valganciclovir has been reported to be high. This high recurrence rate can be attributed to the fact that valganciclovir is virostatic instead of virucidal. Also, the eye's immune privilege prevents the total eradication of the CMV infection.****

Long-term valganciclovir treatment resulted in long-term continued disease control in a reasonable number of patients, in doses of valganciclovir, as indicated earlier. Intravitreal injection of ganciclovir 2.0 mg in 0.05 cc, with or without oral antiviral, has also been studied.****Further, oral valganciclovir can achieve similar aqueous CMV reduction, though with a risk of leukopenia.****White cell count should therefore be monitored in those patients on oral valganciclovir.

**Surgical Therapy**

The use of surgery in PSS patients is for lowering IOP after the failure of medical treatment.

Therefore, a practical technique is the augmentation of the trabeculectomy with antimetabolite, such as mitomycin C (MMC). Trabeculectomy with MMC reduces IOP spikes, and a general improvement in the inflammation and PSS disease is noticed.****An explanation for this post-operative improvement in inflammation might be because of draining out of the aqueous chamber inflammatory cells through the filtering bleb, reducing anterior chamber activity and trabeculitis.

Other IOP lowering surgical techniques used in PSS include trabectome surgery, trabeculectomy, and Ahmed glaucoma drainage device insertion.

Cataract surgery will be required in the setting of cataract formation. As a general theme, pre-operative control of inflammation is essential before any surgical procedure is undertaken.

As in post uveitic corneal endothelial insufficiency, penetrating keratoplasty (PK) or Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) can be employed to treat a similar complication in PSS. Also, after corneal surgery in PSS eyes, graft failure rates will mirror the situation in post uveitic cornea grafts (50%), which is higher than for other causes of corneal endothelial insufficiency (13%).
