Initial radiographs should be taken to evaluate congenital femoral deficiency, which includes a full-length standing anteroposterior (AP) view with the patella facing forward and the long lateral film. While assessing an infant or in scenarios where the child is unable to stand, pull-down supine long anteroposterior and lateral radiographs should be obtained, which include the pelvis along with both lower extremities. Both lower limbs are “pulled down” to ensure maximum extension over the knees.

An anteroposterior radiograph helps assess the overall ossific anatomy of lower extremities, classifying the type of congenital femoral deficiency, measurement of femoral and tibial length, and ruling out acetabular dysplasia using acetabular index and center edge angle. A lateral radiograph helps assess the fixed flexion deformity of the knee.

Other imaging studies which have some proven role include magnetic reso­nance imaging (MRI), hip arthrography, and computed tomography scan (CT).

MRI helps assess the integrity of the proximal femur, and it can help differentiate pseudoarthrosis from an intact cartilaginous femoral neck. It can also help evaluate the knee joint for any associated ligament deficiency.

Hip arthrography is performed under general anesthesia, and it helps differentiate the delayed ossification of the femoral head from pseudoarthrosis. After injecting the dye, manipulation of the lower extremity is performed to visualize the proximal femur. If the femoral head and proximal femur move together, it represents the presence of a cartilaginous connection in between, and hence it can be classified as type 1b. It is also helpful in differentiating between Paley types 2a and 2b. The femoral head is present in both types, but the differentiating feature is the fusion of the femoral head with the acetabulum. If a dye can be injected within joint space, it can be classified as type 2a; otherwise, type 2b.

CT scan comes in handy in older children when the ossification of the acetabulum and proximal femur is completed. In addition, 3-D CT reconstruction has a role in comparing the dysplastic acetabulum with the normal side.
