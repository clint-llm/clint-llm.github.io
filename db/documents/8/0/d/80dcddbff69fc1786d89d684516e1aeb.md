Spinal shock is associated with high morbidity and mortality and requires multifaceted comprehensive care to prevent devasting complications in patients who survive. These patients must be managed by an interprofessional team that includes a trauma surgeon, neurologist intensivist, neurosurgeon, ICU nurses, and the emergency department physician. These patients should be admitted to the ICU and closely monitored. The critical care nurse is pivotal in managing these patients, as they require support for all activities of daily living and vigilant monitoring for hemodynamic stability. These patients are at high risk of complications, including aspiration pneumonia, bacteremia, venous thromboembolism, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. The critical care nurse plays an important role in monitoring the patient for these potential complications, preventing their incidence, and communicating with the physicians to ensure early treatment if they occur.

The physical therapy and occupational therapy team is also a crucial part of the interprofessional team caring for these patients. Early therapy can maximize functional recovery and help improve clinical outcomes for these patients.Â A collaborative interprofessional team can maximize clinical recovery, prevent devastating complications, and improve outcomes for these patients.
