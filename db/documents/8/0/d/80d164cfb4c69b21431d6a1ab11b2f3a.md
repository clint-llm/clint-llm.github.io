If VKDB is suspected, it is important to take a proper history. The following points in the history that could lead to a proper diagnosis include:

- Drugs taken during pregnancy- anticonvulsants, anti-tubercular drugs, warfarin, salicylates, etc.

- Gestation period- preterm babies are at a higher risk of having VKDB.

- If breastfed or bottle-fed- as bottle/formula-fed infants are at lower risk due to fortified feedings with essential vitamins and minerals.

- Place of delivery- generally home-delivered infants do not have access to immediate vitamin K prophylaxis and hence are at a greater risk.

Physical findings in a patient with VKDB are:

- Cephalhematoma

- Intracranial bleeding

- Intrathoracic bleeding, which can cause hemoptysis, and associated respiratory distress

- Intra-abdominal bleeding- melena or hematemesis

- Bleeding from the skin- petechiae present over the skin

- Bleeding from mucous membranes, including the gums, nose, etc.

- Bleeding after circumcision

- Bleeding from the umbilical stump after cutting the umbilical cord at birth

- Bleeding from vaccination sites

Intracranial bleeding is mostly associated with late VKBD and presents with a floppy baby, lethargy, feeding difficulties, bulging fontanelles, decreased respiratory rate, altered consciousness, convulsions, or pallor.
