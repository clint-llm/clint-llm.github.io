Treatment of suspected invasive aspergillosis should be promptly initiated while investigations are ongoing due to the rapidly progressive nature of the infection. When selecting an antifungal, one must consider the general resistance profiles of Aspergillus species in the area of practice, the history of anti-mold prophylaxis used (if any), the species of Aspergillus involved, if known, and the patient's comorbidities, such as QT prolongation.A. terreus andÂ A. alliaceus are intrinsically resistant to amphotericin B, and A. calidoustus is intrinsically resistant to azoles.

In most instances, the drug of choice is voriconazole.

For patients receiving mold prophylaxis with voriconazole, liposomal amphotericin B is recommended to be used until susceptibility testing is available.

Treatment of patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis exhibiting pulmonary symptoms and loss of pulmonary function is accomplished with oral therapy with itraconazole or voriconazole.Aspergillus IgE.

Surgery may be required to remove an aspergilloma and should be considered in cases of hemoptysis.

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis exacerbations are typically treated with corticosteroids to control the immune response and itraconazole to decrease the fungal burden.
