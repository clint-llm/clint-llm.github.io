The diagnosis of acute liver failure should start with the history and physical examination followed by laboratories tests and abdominal imaging.

History of prior episodes of jaundice, medication and alcohol use, family history of liver disease, risk factors for acute viral hepatitis are clinically relevant.

Laboratory evaluation is required to establish the cause and evaluate the severity. It should include liver blood tests, INR, renal function, metabolic panel, blood count, viral hepatitis serologies and HIV serology, toxicology screen and acetaminophen level, autoimmune markers and arterial blood gas. Ceruloplasmin level should be required when Wilson disease is suspected. In patients with acute or chronic hepatitis, HBV anti-hepatitis D virus antibodies should be requested.Â In addition, anti-hepatitis E virus antibodies ordered when there is a history of travel to endemic areas. Abdominal imaging evaluation includes studies ultrasonography to rule out underlying chronic liver disease/cirrhosis.
