The outcome of the procedure is largely dependent on patient selection. Information about the patient's physiological ability to tolerate lobectomy will help to risk-stratify the potential operative candidacy. Patients with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) less than 800 cc or diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) less than 40% are considered high-risk patients. These patients are better served with sub-lobar resection or nonoperative therapy.

If possible, lobectomy should also be avoided in patients with recent myocardial infarction and severe cardiovascular disease. VATS lobectomy should also be avoided in patients with tumors larger than 6 cm due to technical challenges.
