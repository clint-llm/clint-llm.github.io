PAM and GAE are very rare disease processes, with only 3.7 cases reported per year worldwide. PAM is more common in warmer regions, such as the southern part of the United States, and generally occurs in the warmer months of spring and summer, possibly due to the increased likelihood of participation in waterborne activities. The mean age of patients affected by PAM was 12 years (range from eight months to 66 years); 79% were males.
