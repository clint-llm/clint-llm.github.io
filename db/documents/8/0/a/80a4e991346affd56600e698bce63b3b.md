Korber noted in 1864 that HbF was resistant to alkali denaturation with NaOH much more so than adult hemoglobin (HbA). It was further determined that, when immersed in a citrate buffer pH of 3.3, the HbF remained intact while the HbA leaked out. Utilizing this property, the KB test was first described in 1957 by Enno Kleihauer and Klaus Betker.
