Typically overall visual morbidity is minimal. Nerve drusen can be followed periodically and do not typically cause visual acuity loss. However, visual field loss is more common, with some estimates stating as many as 50% of children and nearly 90% of adults may have visual field defects, most commonly enlarged blind spots and peripheral constriction, or less commonly arcuate defects. More severe visual morbidity may arise from rare complications associated with nerve drusen, such as ischemic optic neuropathy.

As patients become older, the nerve drusen likely will become more visible clinically. There is a greater likelihood of visual field defects; however, this increase in visibility and visual field defect probability tends to stabilize in adulthood. The presence of visual field defects is significantly more common than the presence of practical visual symptoms.
