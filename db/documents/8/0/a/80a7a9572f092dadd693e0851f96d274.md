The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a form of prolonged respiratory and cardiorespiratory life support has increased worldwide. Common challenges regarding complications from prolonged ECMO use include bleeding and thrombosis. Thrombosis occurs due to the interaction between components of the ECMO system and blood. To circumvent thrombosis formation, strict adherence to anticoagulationÂ monitoring is vital. Understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis formation, the mechanism of action of common anticoagulants, and the monitoring of anticoagulation parameters will decrease thrombosis formation incidence.
