Interactions between herbal supplements and a drug can classify as either pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions. Pharmacokinetic interactions are those that interfere with the blood concentration and pharmacologic action of a certain drug. Pharmacodynamic interactions occur when the herbal supplement directly affects a drug's clinical effects without changing the drug concentration.
