Perivascular tau deposition within the sulcal depths is an essential prerequisite for the diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy as per the first consensus from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB).

Grossly there are features of regional atrophy (most commonly frontal lobe), ventriculomegaly, wasting of the corpus callosum and characteristic fenestration of the septum pellucidum. The regions of atrophy parallel high concentrations of glutamate receptors thereby connoting the role of excitotoxicity in the pathogenesis of the entity.

Microscopically, deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuropil threads (NTs) are predominant findings. However, contrary to other tauopathies, beta-amyloid is seen in only 40% to 45% of patients with CTE, the tau distribution in an uneven fashion within superficial cortical laminae with sparing of the temporal lode. The NFTs in chronic traumatic encephalopathy deposit in perivascular fashion at the sulcal depths.

There are reports of four histomorphologic phenotypes of CTE

- Type 1 - NFT and NTs in cerebral cortex and brainstem only

- Type 2 - Type 1 + B amyloid deposition

- Type 3 - NFT and NTs in brainstem only

- Type 4 - NFT and NTs in the cortex, subcortex, brainstem, basal ganglion but sparing cerebellum
