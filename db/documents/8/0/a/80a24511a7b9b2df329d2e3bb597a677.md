The most important method of prevention for mastoiditis is vaccination. Unvaccinated patients will be more susceptible to pneumococcus, which commonly causes otitis media and thus leads to mastoiditis. Additionally, early treatment for acute otitis media can prevent progression to mastoiditis. Other risk factors for mastoiditis that are not modifiable include age less than two years old, immunocompromised state, recurrent acute otitis media, or incomplete pneumatization of the mastoid process.
