Pierre Ménétrier compared the macroscopic appearance of the pathognomic thickened gastric mucosa related to disease to cerebral convolutions (gyri). On endoscopy, this is evident by marked enlargement of gastric folds and rugae. On histopathological examination, foveolar hyperplasia, oxyntic glands atrophy, reduction in parietal (acid-producing cells) and chief (pepsinogen-producing) cells, and cystic dilation of pits are seen. The overall linear architecture is usually maintained. Edema and hyperplasia of smooth muscle in the lamina propria are observed.
