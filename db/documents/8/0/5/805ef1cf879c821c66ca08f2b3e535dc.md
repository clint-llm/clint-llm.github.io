Recipient site evaluation includes identification of appropriate vessels to perfuse the flap, determining appropriate patient positioning, and choosing the method of bone fixation. All types of implants should be available (e.g., plates, screws, K-wires, external fixators, and intramedullary nails).

Preoperatively, donor site skin, muscle bulk, and vascular status are evaluated. Strong and independent pulses should be present at both the dorsalis pedis and the posterior tibial artery. Any uncertainty about their status should be further investigated with Doppler ultrasonography. In certain cases, CT (computed tomography) angiography or MR (magnetic resonance) angiography may be required to assess the vascular status. Documentation of a preoperative neurological assessment is necessary because transient postoperative peroneal nerve palsy can occur.

For tibial reconstruction, the contralateral fibula is preferred, while the ipsilateral fibula is generally used for femoral reconstruction. Upper limb recipient sites may use either fibula, and the choice of the fibula for head and neck reconstruction will depend on the status of neck vessels, as well as whether the mandible or maxilla is being reconstructed, and whether the skin flap will replace oral mucosa or facial skin.
