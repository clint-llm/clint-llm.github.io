The anal canal serves as a channel connecting the rectum to the end of the gastrointestinal system, the anus. It is located within the anal triangle of the perineum and in between the fat-filled and wedge-shaped ischioanal, or ischiorectal, fossae that accommodate its expansion for the passage of fecal material. The transition from the rectum to the anus can be identified by the anorectal junction, or anorectal ring, which appears as a bend in the gastrointestinal tract and is supported by the puborectalis muscular sling. The anorectal junction is also the site where muscular fibers of its two sphincters blend superiorly with those of the puborectalis muscle.

The two functionally and anatomically distinct sphincters surrounding the anal canal are the internal anal sphincter and the external anal sphincter.

The anal canal is typically divided into superior and inferior segments by the pectinate, or dentate, line. The pectinate line is a visible zig-zagging line formed from the inferior aspect of longitudinal folds known as the anal columns or anal valves. The pectinate line demarcates the superior two-thirds of the anal canal from the inferior one-third. It also serves as an embryologic landmark that explains the differing arterial supply, venous drainage, lymphatic drainage, and nervous supply of the segments of the anal canal.
