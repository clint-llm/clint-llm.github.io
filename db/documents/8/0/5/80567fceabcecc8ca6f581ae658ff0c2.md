Genital evaluation should be performed with a member of the health care team at the bedside to act as a chaperone. This may occur in an outpatient office or in the Emergency Department. It is important to ask the patient if she prefers to have a female chaperone and to consider having at least one female staff member in the room during the examination. This health care team member, if qualified, can also act as an assistant during the pelvic exam by handing equipment to the provider performing the exam.

In pediatric patients, sedation in the operating room may be considered. In these cases, the usual operating staff, including an anesthesiologist and gynecologist, are necessary.

If ultrasonography is used to evaluate for a foreign body, an ultrasound technician may be required to perform a transabdominal or transvaginal ultrasound.
