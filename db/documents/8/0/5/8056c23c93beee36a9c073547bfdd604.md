The bladder plays a critical role in storing and releasing urine. When indicated, cystectomy and urinary diversion can effectively treat bladder cancer while maintaining a good quality of life.Â  However, removal of the bladder is a life-changing event even when it cures the underlying problem as intended. Various urinary diversion options are available after cystectomy, and each has unique considerations in the perioperative and postoperative period. Patient-reported quality of life surveys have shown improvement if patients describe their post diversion related goals and participate in informed shared decision making with their medical team preoperatively.

Cystectomy patients are now living longer with their urinary diversions, and longer-term treatment of associated age-related conditions in these patients is important. Physicians treating patients who have undergone cystectomies should be aware of the short and long term consequences of the various urinary diversion types and be prepared to optimize the surveillance and treatment of these individuals.
