Leukocytosis is the broad term for an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, typically above 11.0x10^9/L, on a peripheral blood smear collection. The exact value of WBC elevation can vary slightly between laboratories depending on their 'upper limits of normal' as identified by their reference ranges. The WBC value represents the sum-total of white blood cell subtypes, including neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, atypical leukocytes that are not normally present on a peripheral blood smear (e.g., lymphoblasts), or any combination of these. The clinician should properly characterize the leukocytosis and determine if further evaluation and workup are indicated.

The broad differential diagnoses of leukocytosis require evaluation beyond basic laboratory workup, and clinicians should be able to perform physical examinations and targeted histories to ascertain the possible causes of the presenting lab abnormality. To evaluate for these causes, careful histories, physical examinations, medication reconciliations, family histories, and the possible need for consultants for procedures (e.g., genetic testing, hematology/oncology consultations, infectious disease, etc.) must be completed depending on what is discovered.
