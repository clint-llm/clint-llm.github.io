All healthcare workers should be familiar with asystole and its management.Â Asystole should be treated according to current American Heart Association BLS and ACLS guidelines. High-quality CPR is the mainstay of treatment and the most important predictor of favorable outcomes. Asystole is a non-shockable rhythm. Therefore, if asystole is noted on the cardiac monitor, no attempt at defibrillation should be made. It is mandatory for all healthcare workers who look after patients to be certified in BLS and ACLS in many hospitals.
