The prevalence of this condition is approximately 6% to 20% in infants. There is a high rate of spontaneous resolution of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction with approximately 70% of affected children being free of the symptoms by 3 months of age, and over 90% recovering by their first birthday. In one study, 20% of healthy infants showed evidence of defective lacrimal drainage during the first year of life. Spontaneous resolution occurs by 6 months of age in approximately 90% of infants with congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO). From those infants with persistent symptoms at 6 to 10 months of age, approximately two-thirds have a resolution within 6 months. The cases that persist beyond 12 months of age are likely to require probing of the lacrimal duct. A study showed that those patients with significant nasolacrimal obstruction, meaning nonresponsive to two or more probing procedures, with or without intubation, 35% have nasolacrimal duct obstruction, 15% have punctal agenesis, 10% have congenital fistulas, and 5% have craniofacial defects.

Infants at increased risk for this condition include those with trisomy 21, ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-cleft lip/palate (EEC) syndrome, branchiooculofacial syndrome, CHARGE (coloboma, heart anomaly, choanal atresia, and retardation, genital and ear anomalies) syndrome, and Goldenhar syndrome.
