The etiology for Refsum disease primarily depends on the presence of aberrant genes for specific enzymes. Both are autosomal-recessive in inheritance.

**Classic/adult Refsum disease**

- Over 90% of CRD patients have a deficiency of phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase (PAHX) encoded by PHYH, and fewer than 10% have a deficiency of type 2 peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS2) receptor encoded by peroxin (PEX)7.

- Gene for PHYH is found on the short arm of chromosomes****10 (p11.2-pter), while for PEX7 is mapped to the short arm of chromosome 6p22-q24.

- The mutations in the PHYH gene lead to an enzymatically inactive protein and dysregulating the downward pathways resulting in phytanic acid accumulation.

- It is noteworthy that the defective PTS2, suggests that the enzyme deficient in Refsum disease is targeted to peroxisomes from cytosol through PTS2.

- Mutations in PEX7 are usually seen with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata but atypically can cause Refsum disease.

**Infantile Refsum disease**

- Mutations in at least 12 different genetic loci have been implicated in IRD, including PEX1 (7q21.2), PEX2 (8q21.13), and PEX26 (22q11.21) that encodes for ATPases, which helps to import cytosolic proteins into peroxisomes.
