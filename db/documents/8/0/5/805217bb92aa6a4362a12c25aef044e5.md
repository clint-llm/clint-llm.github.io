After applying a halo, regular X-rays are required to ensure the fracture is healing. The halo is often required for 8Â to 16 weeks, depending on the rate of healing. Once the halo is removed, a collar is placed, and the patient needs to be enrolled in a rehabilitation program to regain muscle strength.
