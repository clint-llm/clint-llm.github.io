Sebaceous glands are highly sensitive to circulating androgens and have specific androgen-converting enzymes. The pathogenesis surrounding SGH involves the changing hormonal environment that comes with increasing age. In men, this often occurs in the eighth decade of life, while in women, it happens shortly after menopause. Decreasing levels of androgens lead to a decrease in sebocyte turnover, which activates a feedback stimulation of sebocyte proliferation within the gland and sebaceous hyperplasia. The effect is most pronounced over the face. The hormonal influence of insulin, TSH, and hydrocortisone also increase sebocyte proliferation.

Sebaceous hyperplasia has been linked to long-term treatment with cyclosporine in the setting of organ transplantation, and specifically with the lipophilic cyclosporine A, due to a stimulatory effect on undifferentiated sebocytes.

Sebaceous hyperplasia has been documented as a side effect of HIV antiretroviral treatment.

Although SGH is common in the older population, presenile diffuse familial sebaceous hyperplasia (PDFSH) cases have been reported in the literature.
