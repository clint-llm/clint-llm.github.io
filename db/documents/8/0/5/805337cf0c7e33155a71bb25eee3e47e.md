AR causes left ventricular volume overload. An increase in LV end-diastolic volume causes dilation and eccentric hypertrophy of the LV. This allows ejection of a larger stroke volume. In patients with AR, the total stroke volume ejected by the LV is the sum of effective stroke volume and the regurgitant volume.

Decompensation of the LV results in decreased compliance and increased LV end-diastolic pressure and volume. In advanced stages, left atrial, pulmonary artery wedge, pulmonary arterial, right ventricular (RV), and right atrial pressures rise, and the effective (forward) cardiac output falls. Symptoms of heart failure develop, including dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea due to pulmonary congestion.

An increase in LV mass leads to increased myocardial oxygen requirements. Also, coronary perfusion pressure is reduced. This causes myocardial ischemia and exertional chest pain.

In patients with acute severe AR, compensatory mechanisms of the LV do not develop rapidly enough to handle the regurgitant volume load. LV diastolic pressures rise rapidly and may lead to acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. Even diastolic mitral regurgitation can occur as a result of the sudden severe increase in LV volume and pressure.
