Osteoporosis is a worldwide problem causing more than 8 million fractures annually, resulting in an osteoporosis fracture every 3 seconds. Using the WHO definition of osteoporosis, this disease affects 6% of men and 21% of women above the age of 50, with approximately 500 million people being affected worldwide. Secondary osteoporosis describes a finding of decreased bone mass or a fragility fracture affecting any person who has secondary causes for bone loss. Secondary causes for bone loss can involve any underlying process and medical problem as well as the use of certain medications that can either affect achieving peak bone mass as a young adult or result in excessive bone resorption affecting bone health and quality. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the assessment and management of patients with secondary osteoporosis.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the causes of secondary osteoporosis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of secondary osteoporosis.
- Summarize the treatment options for secondary osteoporosis.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to help achieve better outcomes for patients affected by secondary osteoporosis.
