Differential diagnoses of incontinentia pigmenti can vary based on the stage of skin lesions. These include:

**Stage 1 (vesicular)**

- Congenital herpes simplex can present with grouped hemorrhagic vesicles, often on the scalp and at sites of trauma from scalp electrodes. Lesions can be present at birth or appear within the first few weeks of life.

- Bullous impetigo,

- Epidermolysis bullosa, and

- Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma.

**Stage 2 (verrucous)**- linear epidermal nevus and lichen striatus

**Stage 3 (hyperpigmented)**- linear and whorled nevoid hype melanosis

**Stage 4 (atrophic/hypopigmented)**- hypomelanosis of Ito, Goltz syndrome( focal dermal hypoplasia).

Differential diagnoses of retinal features of IP include ROP, FEVR (familial exudative vitreoretinopathy), and Norrie disease. IP is an important cause of leukocoria.
