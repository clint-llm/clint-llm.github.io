The mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (third branch) leaves the cranium through the foramen ovale. Immediately after, it gives rise to two nerves, a nerve to the medial pterygoid muscle and nervus spinosus. The trunk of the mandibular nerve then splits into two branches, anterior and posterior. The anterior branch mostly gives motor innervation, and the posterior branch, mainly sensory, has three divisions: auriculotemporal, inferior alveolar, and lingual nerve. The inferior alveolar nerve enters the mandible through the mandibular foramen, traverses the mandibular canal, and exits through the mental foramen, receiving the name of mental nerve

The mental foramen is most commonly located halfway between the alveolar crest and the inferior border of the mandible in direct line with the second premolar or between the two premolars
