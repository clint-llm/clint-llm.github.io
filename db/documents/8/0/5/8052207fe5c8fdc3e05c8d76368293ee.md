A liver abscess is defined as a pus-filled mass in the liver that can develop from injury to the liver or from an intra-abdominal infection disseminated from the portal vein. The majority of these abscesses are categorized as pyogenic or amoebic, although a minority are caused by parasites and fungi. Although the incidence of liver abscess is low, it is essential to early detect and manage these lesions, since there is a significant mortality risk in untreated patients. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of liver abscess and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the different methods of classifying a liver abscess.
- Describe clinical symptoms consistent with a liver abscess.
- Explain how to systemically and non-invasively evaluate liver abscess.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the recognition and management of liver abscess and improve outcomes.
