The wrist joint also referred to as the radiocarpal joint is a condyloid synovial joint of the distal upper limb that connects and serves as a transition point between the forearm and hand. A condyloid joint is a modified ball and socket joint that allows for flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction movements.

The proximal articulation forms a concave shape composed of a combination between the distal end of the radius and articular disk. The distal articulation is convex, consisting of the scaphoid, lunate, and triquetrum bones of the proximal hand. Note that the ulna is not part of the wrist joint itself, as it articulates distally via the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ).

The radiocarpal ligament is large, present on the dorsal and palmar surfaces of the wrist, and further connects the radius to distal carpal bones.

Scaphoid considerations

The position of the scaphoid in reference to the wrist, carpus, and distal articulations is unique compared to its counterpart carpal bones. Serving as the radial border of the proximal carpal row, the scaphoid is almost entirely covered by articular cartilage which allows it to act as an osseous bridge connecting the proximal and distal carpal row articulations.
