Hiccups can be acute, lasting less than 48 hours, persistent, lasting over 2 days, or intractable, lasting more than one month. They can result from a variety of causes. In particular, hiccups are often caused by gastrointestinal disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux. Other causes include medication side-effects, cardiovascular disorders, central nervous system disorders, ear, nose, and throat disorders, psychogenic disorders, or metabolic disorders. Ths activity reviews the spectrum of hiccups from acute to intractable, outlines the causes, and offers recommendations for medical treatment based on clinical presentation. This activity stresses the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline medications and medical conditions known to cause hiccups.

- Describe useful bedside maneuvers for aborting acute hiccups.
- Identify medical therapies for aborting persistent or intractable hiccups.
- Explain a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by persistent or intractable hiccups.
