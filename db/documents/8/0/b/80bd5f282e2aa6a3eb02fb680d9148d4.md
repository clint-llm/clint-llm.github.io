It is not strictly necessary to shave any hair during this procedure, though it may be helpful to shave the hair 1 to 2 cm beyond the anticipated incision line.

- A Y or T-shaped incision is planned in the preauricular crease and extended several centimeters cranially. Some surgeons prefer to zigzag the vertical portion of the incision in order to improve scar camouflage postoperatively.

- The incision is made through the skin, dermis, and subcutaneous fat. The elevation of the scalp flaps is performed in a subcutaneous plane just below the level of the hair follicles. This step is of utmost importance as it assists the surgeon in maintaining the appropriate depth of dissection and preserves robust temporoparietal fascia flap thickness. Sharp dissection with a scalpel is preferred to avoid thermal injury to the hair follicles and decrease the risk of alopecia.

- Care should be taken to avoid injuring the underlying STA, which courses through the substance of the flap itself. Once the required size of the TPFF is exposed, the surgeon can incise the periphery of the temporoparietal fascia sharply, with care taken to preserve the vascular pedicle. At this step, the distal branches of the superficial temporal artery are ligated. The surgeon may now rotate the flap into the defect. If hair-bearing skin is required, this flap may be harvested in continuity with the overlying skin. NOTE: One should be mindful during anterior dissection to avoid injuring the frontotemporal branch of the facial nerve, which lies either within or just beneath the temporoparietal fascia. (See ANATOMY section above) Dissection performed underneath the hair-bearing scalp is typically not near enough to the frontotemporal branch of the facial nerve for inadvertent injury to be likely.

- The STA may be dissected farther proximally until the middle temporal artery is identified. The surgeon may enter the parotid gland in certain situations to facilitate this step. At this point, the flap may be harvested as a chimeric flap to include the deep temporal fascia and/or temporalis muscle. If desired, the surgeon can extend the dissection beyond the temporal fossa to include the pericranium and/or harvest a vascularized strip of calvarium (outer cortex).

- The surgeon may either rotate or tunnel this flap into the desired defect, or the vascular bundle may be ligated in anticipation of free microvascular reconstruction of distal defects.

- An optional closed suction drain may be placed.

- The skin flaps are then reapproximated with deep absorbable sutures, followed by staples or suture closure of the scalp.

- If the TPFF is used to reconstruct a defect, including skin, but the scalp is not harvested with the flap, a skin graft may be applied on top of the TPFF (e.g., during auricular reconstruction).
