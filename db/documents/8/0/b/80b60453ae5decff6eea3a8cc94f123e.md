Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitors, or GABA antagonists, are drugs that inhibit the action of GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. They predominantly work at the GABA receptor. GABA receptors categorize into the GABA-A receptor and GABA-B receptor subtypes.

Examples of GABA-A receptor antagonists include flumazenil, bicuculline, picrotoxin/picrotoxinin, gabazine, suramin, sepranolone, salicylidene salicylhydrazide (SCS), bilobalide, RU5135, and 4-(3-biphenyl-5-(4-piperidyl)-3-isoxazole (3-biphenyl-4-PIOL).

Examples of GABA-B receptor antagonists include 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP).
