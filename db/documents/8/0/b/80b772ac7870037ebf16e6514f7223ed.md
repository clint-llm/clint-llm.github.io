Inside the host system, the lipid A moiety of LPS is detected at picomolar levels by the receptor on the surface of macrophages and endothelial cells. Initially, LPS binds to the LBP in the serum, which transfers it to the CD14 receptor present on the cell membrane of the immune cells. The CD14 transfers it to the MD2 (a non-anchored protein), which interacts with Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4). Thus, LPS binds with the CD14/TLR4/MD2 receptor complex present in many host cell types, such as monocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. The subsequent response depends on the cell type to which LPS is bound.

1. Production of cytokines like TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, which stimulates prostaglandins and leukotrienes release, finally leading to the inflammation and septic shock that are the significant features of endotoxemia.

2. Complement activation initiates histamine release causing vasodilationÂ with neutrophil chemotaxis and accumulation.

3. Activation of coagulation cascade: Blood-clotting Factor XII activates humoral systems leading to coagulation, thrombosis, acute disseminated intravascular coagulation. Plasmin activation leads to fibrinolysis and hemorrhage; activation of the alternative pathway leads to inflammation. Activation of kinin releases bradykinins and other vasoactive peptides, causing hypotension. Finally, this induces the development of inflammation, hemorrhage, intravascular coagulation, and septic shock.
