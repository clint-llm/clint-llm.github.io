SeveralÂ randomized controlled trials, as well as prospective and retrospective studies, have shown that intrathecal therapy is safe and effective for controlling cancer-related and non-cancer pain as well as severe spasticity. However, intrathecal treatment is not without risk. For this reason, it must be managed in specific centers, by a multi-disciplinary team that can adequately select the patient by evaluating the risks and benefits of an invasive therapy, as well as the complications and costs, to obtain the best results. A team that involves the collaboration of an oncologist, radiologist, surgeon, anesthesiologist, palliative care and pain medicine, and nurses would be desirable. The selection of the patient, the timing of implantation of the catheter, the management of the patient to quickly identify any complications, and side effects are crucial for the success of the therapy.
