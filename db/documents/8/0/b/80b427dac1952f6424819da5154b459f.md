Hyperglycemia is more common in preterm infants than term infants and is generally noted during the first week of life. Usually, the acute hyperglycemia resolves over two to three days in most neonates but can last up to ten days. Hyperglycemia is less common than hypoglycemia among neonates but is associated with increased mortality and morbidity among neonates. Neonatal hyperglycemia is inversely related to birth weight and gestational age.
