**Patient Communication**

Certain communication domains are either too logistically challenging or emotionally fraught to execute in situ. Most prominently, practicing the disclosure of medical errors and bad news is uniquely accessible to the SP approach. To our knowledge, however, it has not been described outside of a controlled environment, reflecting the complicated psychological challenges associated with “surprise” deployments.

A common theme that arises from exploring these reports is the multimodal integration of SPs with traditional didactic methods rather than the strict replacement of the former for the latter. For instance, one should strongly consider a classroom teaching session on communication best practices before having students engage with simulations. Asynchronous study before the scheduled session is also expected to have comparable benefits. Within the SP segment itself, feedback can be obtained from the SP themself, an independent observer, or participant self-reflection, often with similar accuracy objectively while providing valuable variance in subjective perspectives.

**Clinical**

Perhaps the most ambitious but irreplaceable application of standardized patients is the announced simulated patient, where an SP arrives in a clinic under the full pretense of a routine visit. In such cases, there is no pre-brief or other announcement that the encounter is an educational or assessment tool. The benefit is that the entire medical staff is no longer subject to the Hawthorne effect -- the changes in behavior thought to arise from knowing one is being observed.performance during overt assessments differs substantially from true competence, a term which refers to actual clinical practice.In situ, unannounced SPs are perhaps the only means by which a health system can accurately assess the latter on an individual basis.

Incognito SPs (ISPs), as they are sometimes called, have proven remarkably effective for identifying deficits in care across numerous types of providers and expansive geographic ranges. An assessment of the literature yields examples of ISPs in Western nations, Kenya, India, and China, to name a few, consistently demonstrating discrepancies between physician behavior and national guidelines or specialty best-practices, as well as shortcomings in physical exam skills.

Special logistical considerations apply to the use of unannounced SPs. Health care personnel should be informed ahead of time that such patients will be deployed. This step is as much to ensure buy-in with the educational goals as it is about providing informed consent. People are unlikely to respond to feedback well if completely unaware of the project.

The adoption of a rigorous SP program requires substantial resources, both upfront and on an ongoing basis. This likely explains why they are prevalent in the literature in small studies, but it is exceedingly difficult to find descriptions of sustained projects within a health system. This fact may relate to the absence of evidence demonstrating long-term benefits in outcome-oriented or financial metrics. However, this calculus may change as reimbursement increasingly ties to guideline adherence and patient satisfaction, not to mention the fact that patient satisfaction and doctor-patient communication are the key elements in preventing lawsuits. One must wonder how much more evidence is necessary to warrant programs that are known to identify shortcomings in all these domains, especially as large health systems become the norm in the medical landscape and have both the resources and institutional motivation for ongoing quality checks.
