Practitioners use the terms sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and sudden cardiac death interchangeably; however, their definitions are distinct. Sudden cardiac arrest is the sudden cessation of cardiac activity leading to an unresponsive victim who cannot breathe normally and does not have signs of functional circulation. If the condition is not addressed immediately, sudden cardiac arrest progresses to sudden cardiac death. In some patients, the placement of an implantable cardiac defibrillator significantly reduces the risk of sudden cardiac death. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and complications associated with the implantable cardiac defibrillator, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients felt to be at high risk for sudden death.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for an implantable cardiac defibrillator. 
- Outline the contraindications to implantable cardiac defibrillators.
- Describe the complications of implantable cardiac defibrillators. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for optimizing care coordination and communication to advance the management of and outcomes for patients at high-risk for sudden cardiac arrest via the appropriate utilization of implantable cardiac defibrillators.
