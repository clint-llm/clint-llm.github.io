The labyrinthine artery is the main supplier of oxygenated blood to the cochlea and therefore to the organ of Corti. This artery is also known as the auditory artery, or the internal auditory artery. The labyrinthine artery most commonly originates from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA). AICA most commonly originates from the basilar artery. Occasionally, about 15% of the time, the auditory or labyrinthine artery, can branch off directly from the basilar artery. Less commonly, this artery may originate from the superior cerebellar or vertebral artery.

The labyrinthine artery follows the vestibulocochlear nerve from its point of origin into the internal acoustic meatus where it further divides into two branches, the anterior vestibular artery, and the common cochlear artery. The common cochlear artery will then divide into two more arteries, the proper cochlear artery, and the vestibulocochlear artery. The vestibulocochlear artery then gives off the vestibular ramus and the cochlear ramus.
