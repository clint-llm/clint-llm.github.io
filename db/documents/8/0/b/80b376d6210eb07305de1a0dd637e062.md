Gilbert syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder of bilirubin metabolism within the liver.

Disorders of hepatic uptake, storage, conjugation, and excretion can cause unconjugated and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Crigler-Najjar syndrome is characterized by marked unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Other acute and chronic liver diseases typically present with both unconjugated and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
