**Arterial Supply**

The vascular supply to the insular cortex comes from short perforator branches from the superior division of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). These most commonly arise from the M2 segment (i.e., "insular" or "Sylvian" segment), which courses over the lateral surface of the insula within the Sylvian fissure. Some vessels from M1 may supply the limen insulae, while occasionally, branches of the M3 segment supply the peri-insular sulcus. The M3 segment of the MCA travels primarily lateral to the insular cortex and loops around the operculum, supplying the cortex distal to the insula.

**Venous Drainage**

The venous drainage of the insula is complex and somewhat variable as a majority of cadaveric specimens demonstrate a mix of superficial and deep venous connections. The precentral insular vein is the most common drainage area of the superficial system, while the deep middle cerebral vein (DMCV) represents the predominant deep venous drainage conduit.
