Patients with short-term insomnia have a constellation of symptoms and perceived issues with the quantity or quality of sleep. Symptoms include difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, early morning awakenings, and difficulty going back to sleep. It is important to note that these symptoms exist even though the patient has the opportunity to get adequate sleep. The evaluation should include a thorough medical and psychiatric history. A sleep diary kept over a 2 to 4 week period may be helpful to assess sleep patterns.

Another vital aspect of a patient’s history is that the nighttime issues with sleep contribute to daytime consequences such as:

- Decreased functioning/productivity in the academic or work setting.

- Fatigue or low energy

- Frequent napping

- Difficulty concentrating

- Susceptibility to errors and accidents

- Impaired attention, concentration, or memory

- Mood disturbances or irritability

- Impaired interpersonal or social functioning

- General feelings of poor quality of life

Evaluators should also perform questioning to rule out sleep-related disorders such as sleep apnea, narcolepsy, or restless leg syndrome.

New research also indicates that there may be an independent association of insomnia contributing to major depression, and patients may present with depressed mood and complaints of anhedonia.
