Several systemic diseases can result in NVG. Diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and blood dyscrasias require management by an internist. However, the ophthalmologist may alert the internist and patient regarding the need for improved control of their systemic disease. The presence of carotid artery obstruction in ocular ischemic syndrome requires prompt evaluation by an interventional cardiologist or endovascular surgeon.

The presence of systemic or ocular malignancies may require treatment coordinated through an oncologist. The assistance of a caregiver or patient advocate is often helpful in ensuring treatment compliance and follow-up of the ocular and systemic conditions associated with NVG. Thus, for optimal outcomes of NVG, the coordination between different sub-specialties is to be emphasized rather than isolated ophthalmic care.
