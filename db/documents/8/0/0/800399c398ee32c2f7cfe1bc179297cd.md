Necessary personnel must scrub before entering the procedure room. After donning sterile gowns and gloves, the catheterization procedure can begin. Prior to the catheterization procedure, it is important to palpate the femoral pulse and pulses at different sites along the course of the artery, such as the popliteal, tibial, and dorsalis pedis artery. The insertion of a femoral vascular closure device is done either at the beginning of the procedure (especially large bore access) or immediately after the catheterization procedure has ended. The site must be prepared appropriately with sterile drapes around the site of insertion. Ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance may be used.
