Sertraline is contraindicated in patients with documented hypersensitivity to the drug or its components. The coadministration of sertraline with thioridazine, pimozide, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, including linezolid or methylene blue, is also contraindicated. Patients who are taking other serotonergic medications should receive education regarding the risks of coadministration with sertraline.

Sertraline solution is contraindicated with disulfiram as solution form contains 12% alcohol, and it may cause an alcohol-disulfiram reaction.

Sertraline therapy should not start within two weeks of discontinuing any monoamine oxidase inhibitor to prevent toxicity with serotonin syndrome.

There is a US black box warning for use in pediatric patients and young adults. Use caution in patients ages 18 to 24 years old due to the risk of an increase in suicidal ideation.
