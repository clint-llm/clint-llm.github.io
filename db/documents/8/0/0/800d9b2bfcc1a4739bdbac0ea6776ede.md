Following timely detection and treatment, CSS has a favorable prognosis with a 5-year survival of 90%.

The relapse rate is estimated at approximately 20% to 30% and is often minor with fever, joint pain, and constitutional symptoms.

Certain risk factors for relapse include:

- The sudden rise in eosinophil count

- Persistent ANCA positivity

- Gastrointestinal tract (GI) involvement

- The rise in ANCA titers

Just as peripheral eosinophilia is a hallmark of diagnosis, there is an association between the degree of eosinophilia and the extent of vasculitis disease. A sudden rise in eosinophil count also precedes a relapse of vasculitis.

Guillevin et al. identified 5 factors associated with higher mortality

- Proteinuria (greater than 1 gm per day)

- Renal insufficiency (Cr greater than  1.58 mg/dl)

- Cardiomyopathy

- GI tract involvement

- CNS involvement

They became the basis of the Five-Factor Score (FFS) used to define a poor prognosis and higher mortality in EGPA. The absence of any of the five factors carries a good prognosis (RR 0.52; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.62; P <0.03), and the presence of 2 or more increases the risk of mortality (RR 1.36; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.62; P <0.001). Of the 5 factors, cardiomyopathy is an independent risk factor in CSS (hazard ratio 3.39; 95% CI, 1.6 to 7.3).

The Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) is a detailed 66 question tool to assess vasculitic organ involvement and is widely used in clinical trials.

Vasculitis Damage Index (VDI) assesses accumulated organ damage and is a very useful assessment of organ injury due to both disease itself and its treatment. It correlates well with mortality and morbidity.

Some factors associated with a poor prognosis are

- Evidence of severe GI tract involvement

- Cardiomyopathy

- CNS vasculitis

- Renal failure

Cardiac involvement is the most frequent cause of mortality in patients with poor response to therapy.
