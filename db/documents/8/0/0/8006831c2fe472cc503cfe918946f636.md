NRTIs as a class have more cases with resulting hepatomegaly, with some fatalities. Lactic acidosis, a usual NRTI toxicity, is not seen as frequently with lamivudine; however, females who are obese and have been on immunotherapy for an extended time seem to be at an increased risk. If a patient presents with symptoms, lamivudine should be discontinued immediately.

Patients treated with interferon-alpha inhibitors with or without ribavirin when they are co-infected with HCV should be monitored closely for liver toxicities, especially hepatic decompensation, due to their pyrimidine phosphorylation reduction effects.  If decompensation or increased liver toxicity occurs, interferon-alpha inhibitors with or without ribavirin should be decreased or discontinued.

A patient using lamivudine for HBV should have testing for HIV-1, and patients with HIV-1 should be tested for HBV.  If the patient has a co-infection, the lower dose of lamivudine (EPIVIR-HBV) is not adequate for patients and could lead to increased antiviral resistance of either virus for both adults and children.

CD4+ cell count and viral load should have frequent checking to determine HIV-1 disease progression and efficacy and extent of virologic failure resulting in lamivudine resistance in combination therapy.

Kidney indicators require monitored throughout treatment, especially in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. CKD is a natural occurrence as we age, so special attention may be necessary in the treatment of older patients.

Pediatric patients who have a history of antiviral therapy or a history of pancreatitis need monitoring for lamivudine-induced pancreatitis. Pediatric patients should also know to avoid sorbitol-containing medicines when using oral lamivudine because antiviral resistance and lower virologic suppression rates can occur due to lower plasma lamivudine exposure.

Fat redistribution in a "cushingoid appearance," lipoatrophy, and insulin resistance should also be monitored in patients using NRTIs.
