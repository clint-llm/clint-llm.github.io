Immunohistochemical staining targeting differential antigenic expression can distinguish between the neural and supportive components of Meissner corpuscles. Vega et al. reported that double immunolabelling with monoclonal antibodies against human neurofilament proteins (NFP) and S100 could reliably stain the central axon and Schwann cells, respectively.
