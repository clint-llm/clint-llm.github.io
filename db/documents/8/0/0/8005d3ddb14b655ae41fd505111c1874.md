Osteoporosis affects about 200 million people globally. Osteoporosis causes one fracture every 3 seconds.

One study found that 44% of the male and 48.9% of the female schizophrenia patients have osteopenia compared to 9.2% male and 21% female without schizophrenia. Elderly patients with schizophrenia have a double risk of osteoporosis than a matched control.

No significant sex difference in terms of antipsychotic-induced bone mineralization defect was observed since hyperprolactinemia has inhibitory effects on gonadotrophins level. However, hyperprolactinemia prevalence is higher in postmenopausal females. Risperidone causes the early-onset and prolonged duration of hyperprolactinemia.
