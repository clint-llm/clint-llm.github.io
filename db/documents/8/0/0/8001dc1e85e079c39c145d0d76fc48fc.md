The management of cervical disc injuries is best done with a team that includes the trauma surgeon, anesthesiologist, emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, radiologist, neuro/orthopedic surgeon, and neurologist. Initially, the ATLS protocol must be followed while maintaining cervical spine spinal immobilization and minimize neck movement, particularly during transport.

Minor fractures to the cervical spine without neurological deficits can be treated with conservative management of pain management, brace, and follow-up. If the cervical injury is unstable, surgical intervention may be warranted. The surgical intervention will vary, depending on the injury. The fusion of the cervical vertebrae may be warranted with or without internal fixation with metal plates and screws.

The outcomes of cervical disc injury depend on other associated injuries, head trauma, neurological deficit at the time of presentation, GCS score and age. Overall, many patients are left with some disability that may manifest as chronic pain or limited range of motion.
