Tinnitus is classically described as the presence of high-pitched ringing or buzzing that is usually only audible to the affected individual. Most tinnitus is subjective, meaning the examiner cannot hear it. However, objective tinnitus can arise from an aneurysm and can be heard by the examiner. The presence of objective tinnitus should include investigations for aneurysms, temporomandibular joint disease, and tensor tympani muscle spasm. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of tinnitus and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of tinnitus. 
- Describe how patients may describe tinnitus. 
- Describe the management of tinnitus. 
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of tinnitus.
