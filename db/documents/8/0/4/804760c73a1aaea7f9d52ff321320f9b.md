In 2010, over 16 million people in the US required treatment for dysphagia, either in the community or an inpatient setting. It is estimated that nearly 50% of hospitalized patients have a swallowing disorder, exposing them to the risk of aspiration pneumonia (with concomitant increased length of hospital stay), increased re-hospitalization, and increased mortality. By identifying at-risk patients early on, appropriate management can commence, helping reduce the risk of aspiration.

A holistic approach to nutritional needs can improve the patientâ€™s overall quality of life, in addition to their psychological health. In elderly patients, difficulties with swallowing can cause anxiety around a meal, and panic associated with this activity of daily living can result in the individual socially isolating themselves. These can all contribute to chronic malnutrition and inanition. A videofluoroscopic swallow study is considered the gold standard diagnostic tool for the evaluation of dysphagia. It can assess dysphagia that may not be picked up by clinical examination or patient reporting and can be combined with Functional Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) for a comprehensive evaluation of the swallowing mechanisms and mechanics.
