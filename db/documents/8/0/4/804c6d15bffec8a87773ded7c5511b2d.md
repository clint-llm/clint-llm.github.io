The diagnosis of heart failure alone can be associated with a mortality rate greater than many cancers. Despite advances made in heart failure treatments, the prognosis of the condition worsens over time, resulting in frequent hospital admissions and premature death. One recent study showed that patients recently diagnosed with new-onset heart failure had a mortality rate of 20.2% at one year and 52.6% at five years.  The one and five-year mortality rates also increase significantly based on patient age. Another study showed that the one and five-year mortality for patients at 60-year-old is 7.4%, and 24.4% and for patients at 80-year-olds is 19.5% and 54.4%. The mortality rates were similar when evaluated across different cardiac ejection fractions.

The prognosis is worse for heart failure patients who are hospitalized.  Heart failure patients commonly require repeat hospitalizations and develop an intolerance for standard treatments as the disease progresses. Data from U.S. Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized during 2006 showed 30-day and 1-year mortality rates post admission of 10.8% and 30.7,% respectively. Mortality outcomes at one year also demonstrate a clear relationship with age and increase from 22% at 65 years old to 42.7% for patients age 85 years and older.
