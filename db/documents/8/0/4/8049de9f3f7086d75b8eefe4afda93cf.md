The diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris is confirmed with a biopsy of the lesion. Histopathology andÂ Tzanck smear will reveal acantholysis. Direct immunofluorescence is considered the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of PV. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing will show serum IgG against Dsg 1, Dsg 3, or both in 98.5% of samples. ELISA testing for PV is commercially available.
