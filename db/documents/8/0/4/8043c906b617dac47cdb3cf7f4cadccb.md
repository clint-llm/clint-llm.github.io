Activation of key receptors within the pathways is crucial for producing the desired regulatory effect between appetite and satiety. As such, the communication between the GI tract and the hypothalamus requires hormones that act on the appropriate receptors within the central nervous system (CNS). Ghrelin is derived from the GI and targets regions of the hypothalamus to provide the sensation of hunger. Sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways each play significant roles in signaling our brain when to eat. As such, ghrelin acts on the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR-1a) to promote feelings of hunger and food anticipation.

The mechanism by which leptin regulates energy homeostasis and blood glucose levels has yet to be fully understood. Expression of the leptin receptor, LepRb, is higher in the CNS, with studies showing that leptin acting on the CNS is sufficient to lower blood glucose.

Leptin stimulates POMC and inhibits AgRP causing these neurons to project to the ventromedial hypothalamus. POMC activates alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), which then acts to inhibit food intake. Research has also shown that leptin receptors exist in the hippocampus, impacting cognitive function and plasticity.
