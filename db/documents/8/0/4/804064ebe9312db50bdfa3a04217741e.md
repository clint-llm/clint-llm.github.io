Aa high-risk obstetric clinic should follow any patient with thrombocytopenia in pregnancy. A hematology consult is needed if the platelet count drops below 70 x 10^9/L or if a pregnant woman with thrombocytopenia develops bleeding. It is critical to involve a hematologist in the management of TMA not specific to pregnancy (TTP and atypical HUS) and other rare causes of thrombocytopenia.
