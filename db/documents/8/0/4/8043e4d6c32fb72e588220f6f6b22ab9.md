Teamwork is of utmost importance in the prevention, detection, and treatment of urethral strictures. Public education helps reduce the incidence of strictures by educating the public on the causative etiologies and how to prevent them. General practitioners and emergency clinicians should be aware of risk factors and presentation of patients with urethral strictures, providing early intervention when needed. They should also counsel any patient who presents with pelvic, perineal, or penile trauma on how to recognize early signs of urethral strictures and encourage them to seek expert help without delay. When a diagnosis of urethral stricture is made, a team of clinicians, including experienced surgeons, nurses, and social workers, should all work together to provide the most effective and timely advice and treatment. Ideally, in a large-volume center, a specialized interprofessional team should be assembled to care for patients with urethral stricture, as they require expert surgical opinion and treatment and continuous care post-op for a long time.
