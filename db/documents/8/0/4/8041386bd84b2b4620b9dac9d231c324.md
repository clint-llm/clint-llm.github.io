Cervical ectropion usually does not lead to medical complications. Studies show that there is no benefit from the routine treatment of cervical ectropion. Only symptomatic women should consider treatment. Otherwise, it usually resolves itself, overtime.

However, cervical ectropion does increase the vulnerability of acquiring sexually transmitted infections, including chlamydia cervicitis, gonorrhea, and HIV.

Though cervical ectropion may predispose HPV infection, it is not a precursor to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer. Instead, it has been found that not cervical ectropion but the process of squamous metaplasia leads to increased vulnerability to HPV 16 infection, which has malignant potential. This is because the host cell replication and differentiation process during squamous metaplasia may be a favorable ground for HPV virus replication.

Cervical ectropion does not lead to infertility. ItÂ has no adverse effects on pregnancy or the fetus.
