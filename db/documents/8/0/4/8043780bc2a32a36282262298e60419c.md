There is more than one theory to describe the pathophysiology of compartment syndrome.

Vascularisation in the middle of the muscle belly is more affected, and that is when muscle degeneration occurs. Muscles centered around the anterior interosseous artery are the most commonly affected, particularly FPL and FDP. In the acute stage, nerves are involved because of ischemia, and in later stages, damage occurs due to entrapment of nerves in the fibrous tissue. Muscles can retain the electrical response for up to 3 hours. They can tolerate ischemia for up to 4 hours, and irreversible damage occurs at 8 hours. Nerves can conduct impulses for up to 1 hour. They can survive up to 4 hours (neuropraxia), and at 8 hours, irreversible damage occurs.

When sustained vascular compromise occurs, the muscle undergoes necrosis, fibrosis, and contracture. Associated nerve damage causes further muscle dysfunction, sensory deficits, and may result in chronic pain. The result is a dysfunctional muscle compartment with local and distant manifestations that depend on the compartment involved and the degree of muscle contracture and nerve damage.
