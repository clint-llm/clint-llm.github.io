Complications can occur when a cancerous lesion is misdiagnosed as benign and observed without biopsy and histopathological analysis.  Another complication that can occur is if the excision of the lesion causes a functional or cosmetic deficit in the ocular structures.  Finally, poor outcomes can result from a lack of understanding by the practitioner that a benign lesion heralds the presence of a systemic disease affecting other parts of the body.
