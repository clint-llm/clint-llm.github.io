The prognosis of each of the epidermal nevus syndromes (ENS) is based on the degree of extracutaneous involvement. Neurologic manifestations can be debilitating. Conversely, isolated epidermal nevi that lack other significant findings are usually of cosmetic concern with low malignant potential. Various extracutaneous malignancies are reportedly associated with the ENS, and with rapidly evolving guidelines, screening should be based on a case by case basis as evaluated by genetics.
