The differential diagnosis of secondary TCH is extensive; therefore, this section is limited to the 2 most common causes, SAH and RCVS, and comments on the pediatric population.

Approximately 10 to 18% of patients with SAH die before arriving at a hospital. Mortality at one year is 35 to 65%, and 25 to 33% of survivors will suffer reduced activities of daily living, decreased quality of life, and neurological disability.

Importantly, "reversible" in the acronym RCVS refers to reversible vasoconstriction, not necessarily signs and symptoms associated with the syndrome. For example, over half of the patients report headaches years after diagnosis.

In a recent United States population study, patient factors independently associated with a poor outcome or death in patients with RCVS were advanced age, female sex, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, seizure disorder, reversible brain edema, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease.

As mentioned previously, TCH in the pediatric population is very rare. In a 3-year retrospective study of children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years, all patients diagnosed with TCH had a benign course.
