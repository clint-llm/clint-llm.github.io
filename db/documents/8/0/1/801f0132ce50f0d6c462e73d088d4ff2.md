The transglutaminase activity of FXIII has been attributed to wound healing, embryo and uterus interactions, angiogenesis, and bone extracellular matrix stabilization.

Umbilical cord bleeding in neonates may be te earliest presenting symptom of Factor XIII deficiency, while brain hemorrhages are the most common overall cause of death in this blood disorder. Other common manifestations of deficiency include bruising, hematomas, muscle bleeds, and delayed post-surgical bleeds.

Common clinical signs for coagulation factor deficiencies clinically include mucosal bleeding, bleeding pre and post medical procedures, and hemorrhagic diathesis. More severe signs include intracranial bleeding and hemarthroses, fairly specific to low levels of Factor XIII and Factor X, and afibrinogenemia.

Other biological functions of factor XIII are under consideration beyond a "fibrin stabilizing factor."
