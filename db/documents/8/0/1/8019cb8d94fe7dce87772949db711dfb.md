Greater trochanteric bursitis is a self-limiting condition that may cause significant pain and functional impairment. Although conservative management with NSAIDs, activity modification, physical therapy, and weight reduction is often successful, corticosteroid injections are commonly performed to reduce pain and improve functionality.

Utilizing fluoroscopy or ultrasound may help directÂ needle placement and confirm intrabursal injection. However, there is little evidence that imaging modalities improve clinical outcomes.

A study comparing the accuracy of landmark-based injections against ultrasound-guided injections in cadavers demonstrated that ultrasound-guided injections had higher accuracy concerning injection into the greater trochanter bursa.
