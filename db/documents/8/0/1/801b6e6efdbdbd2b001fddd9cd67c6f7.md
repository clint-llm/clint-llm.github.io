Phosgene exists in the gaseous phase at room temperature. The severity of the disease has been previously proposed to follow Haber's law indicating predicted Toxicity by Inhalation Toxicity = Concentration x Time. Once inhaled, the concentration and duration of exposure predict the sequelae of events and the progression of the disease.

Symptom onset is inversely proportional to the concentration exposed; high concentrations of phosgene inhaled confer a more rapid onset of symptoms and a poorer prognosis. However, low doses of inhaled phosgene may present with few or no upper respiratory symptoms but may accumulate enough in the lower respiratory unit to cause delayed respiratory failure. The detection threshold in humans has been reported to be 0.125 ppm/ min. Concentrations exceeding 2 ppm/ min or more have been classified as immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH) by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At 1 - 3 ppm/ min, irritant effects may be expected. Below 50 ppm/ min, clinical pulmonary symptoms are not expected. Between 50- 150 ppm/ min, pulmonary irritation may be expected without manifest edema.

Exposures exceeding 150 ppm/ min should be expected to develop pulmonary edema.
