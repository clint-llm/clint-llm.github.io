It was first described in 1654 by Dr. Erasmus Bartholin and is thought to be caused by the impaction of a gallstone in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract after passing through a biliary-enteric fistula. Gallstone ileus is more common in women (the ratio being 3.5 females to 1 male) and older patients, particularly those older than 60 years. Other factors that contribute to gallstone ileus are a long history of cholelithiasis, repeated episodes of acute cholecystitis, and stones greater than 2 cm. According to literature, approximately 40% to 50% of patients eventually diagnosed with gallstone ileus have a history of recent biliary colic bouts, jaundice, or acute cholecystitis.
