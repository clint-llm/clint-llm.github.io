The skull, also referred to as the cranium, is one of the hardest and most durable structures of the human body. It consists of two parts, one of which is neurocranium encasing the brain, and the other is viscerocranium forming the facial skeleton. The neurocranium is a large neural cavity formed by the tight engagement of the calvarium (cranial vault) and the skull base with each other. The calvarium is made up of flat bones, including frontal bones, parietal bones, the squamous portions of the temporal bones, and the interparietal portion of the occipital bone. Although the calvarium is a monolayer structure at birth, the diploic space emerges in around the fourth year giving the calvarium its characteristic double-layer form. The skull base forms the floor of the neurocranium on which the brain sits smoothly.
