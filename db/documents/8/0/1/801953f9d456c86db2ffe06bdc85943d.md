Pathogenic mechanisms have not been clearly described, but alveolar epithelial injury due to an unknown provocative insult is thought to cause leakage of plasma proteins into the alveolar space resulting in recruitment of inflammatory cells. The subsequent process of organizationÂ occurs in 3 stages. The intra-alveolar stage is comprised of formation of bands of fibrin along with infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells. The second stage is characterized by proliferation of fibroblasts that lay down a reticulin framework. Meanwhile, the alveolar cells proliferate and re-epithelialize the basal lamina, restoring the alveolar basement membrane. The third stage is an organization of fibroblasts and connective tissue matrix. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor play a central role in organizing pneumonia. Matrix metalloproteinases are also up-regulated. In experimental models, glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit the formation of the granulation tissue plugs.
