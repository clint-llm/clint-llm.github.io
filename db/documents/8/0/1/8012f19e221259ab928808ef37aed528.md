Pressure support ventilation is used to deliver oxygen and support ventilation in patients with hypoxemic, hypercapnic, and mixed respiratory failure. It is also used to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) to determine if an intubated patient on control mode ventilation is ready for extubation. The flow delivered by the driving pressure can provide a tidal volume and minute ventilation higher than the patient could achieve without ventilator support. This higher minute ventilation improves oxygen delivery and carbon dioxide offloading. PEEP improves oxygen delivery by keeping distal airways and alveolar sacs open during the expiratory phase, improving ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) matching in the lungs. Also, there is a reduction in oxygen consumption by decreasing the work of breathing.
