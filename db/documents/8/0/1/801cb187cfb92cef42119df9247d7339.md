Two modes of measurement exist in sleep physiology: behavioral assessment and physiological monitoring.

The gold standard of physiological monitoring is the polysomnogram (PSG).

- Alert wakefulness: low-amplitude mixed frequency EEG

- Drowsy wakefulness: alpha waves with 8 to 13 Hz peaks

- N1 stage: 4 to 7 Hz Theta waves (sawtooth)

- N2 stage: 11 to 16 Hz spindles (bursts of waves) and 0.5 to 2 Hz K-complexes (biphasic waves)

- N3 stage: 0.5 to 3 Hz Delta waves (large and slow)

- REM sleep (stage R): theta waves or wave-like patterns

The onset of sleep begins with wakefulness and progresses rapidly to REM sleep by approximately 60 to 90 minutes.

A variety of parameters are used to measure REM sleep, including the time to onset, length of the REM stage, and amount of eye movement that occurs during REM.
