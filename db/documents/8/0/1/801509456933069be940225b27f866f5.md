Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used for cardiac or respiratory failure where conventional management, including CPR, is not successful. ECMO is a circuit comprised of a draining cannula that drains blood from the body that is circulated in the machine and returns back to the body through a returning cannula. Traditionally veno-venous and veno-arterial ECMO are used. During this circulation of blood, anticoagulation monitoring is essential to maintain the balance between clotting or bleeding. Also, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, neurologic complications, sepsis complications should be taken into account. Survival after ECMO usage has improved in cases of cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and ARDS, including COVID-19 infection. This activity includes indications and the use of ECMO by the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for using ECMO circuits.
- Outline the various types of ECMO circuits.
- Explain the monitoring of anticoagulation and weaning off ECMO pertaining to ECMO.
- Review the importance of coordination among the interprofessional team members in a patient on ECMO.
