Dr. Blanco Rafael was the first to use quadratus lumborum anesthesia in surgery in 2007. Both anterior or posterior access are valid approaches, either lateral or intramuscular, with the help of ultrasound-guided assistance.

**Hip Fracture Surgery**

Patients presenting with hip fractures are commonly clinically complicated secondary to advanced age and an increased number of medical comorbidities.  Thus, innovative anesthetic techniques that ideally balance the risk of anesthesia without compromising pain control are a major goal of the overall treatment and management of these patients.  The quadratus lumborum block (QLB) has demonstrated clinical efficacy and, when used in isolation or combined with other analgesic modalities, has demonstrated clinical efficacy in perioperative pain control for this group of patients.
