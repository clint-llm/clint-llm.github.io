Genitofemoral neuralgia is a relatively common pain syndrome observed in both males and females. The patient typically presents with unilateral pain in the lower abdomen. Rarely the pain may be bilateral. The pain is sometimes referred to as the groin area (because of the path of the genital nerve) and the upper medial thigh (because of the femoral branch). The pain varies in intensity from moderate to severe and is worsened by movements that cause extension of the lower back. In most patients, palpation of the lower abdomen in the inguinal region can reproduce the pain. In most cases, the cause is compression of the nerve in the inguinal canal, usually after open hernia surgery. The diagnosis is often difficult in patients who have not had surgery.

The prognosis of patients who suffer entrapment or injury to the genitofemoral nerve is guarded. If the nerve is entrapped in the inguinal canal after inguinal hernia surgery, one may try decompression, but often the scarring makes visualization of the nerve difficult.

In patients with a lacerated nerve, many pain-relieving modalities have been used, but none works effectively. Some patients respond to nerve blocks, but most patients require long-termÂ anticonvulsants and opiates for pain relief.
