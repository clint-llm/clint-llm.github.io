The diagnosis of acute IPH is made clinically, after other known causes of pulmonary and systemic or visceral hemorrhage have been excluded.

IPH should be suspected in patients with recurrent chest infections and persistent, unexplained anemia despite iron supplementation, and bilateral lung infiltrates on chest radiographs, after exclusion of other possible causes of anemia.

Blood tests are non-specific and may show reduced hemoglobin counts and hematocrit, leucocytosis, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

Lung biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of IPH, where the hemosiderin-laden macrophages can be visualized. However, it is an invasive procedure and is often not practicable in children.
