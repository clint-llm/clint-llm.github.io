Laboratory tests (blood chemistries, urinalysis) and diagnostic modalities (X-rays, CT scans, MRI) should be considered to confirm clinical impression and to plan future treatment. According to AAFP guidelines, complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and arthrocentesis for cell count and culture should be done for the evaluation of septic arthritis whereas microscopic evaluation of crystals and uric acid level along with afore-mentioned test are helpful in the diagnosis of crystal-induced arthritis.N. gonorrhea, and blood cultures should be done in case of gonococcal arthritis, while HLA-B27 and radiologic imaging may be used to confirm ankylosing spondyloarthritis.

Radiological imaging should be done in case of trauma or focal bone pain to rule out fracture or necrosis of the bones. X-rays of an affected joint can also help to see other abnormalities, including the presence of effusions, calcifications, tophaceous erosions, and inspection of joint cartilage and space. Ultrasound can also detect joint effusion and guide arthrocentesis procedure for joint areas that are difficult to access. CT-scan and MRI are reserved for deep-seated joints such as hip and shoulder. Overlying cellulitis is a contraindication for synovial fluid aspiration.
