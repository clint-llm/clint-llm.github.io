The prognosis depends on the stage of the disease and compliance of the patient towards the advised treatment. Simple practices like daily eyelid hygiene, keeping surroundings humidified, good hydration, avoiding smoking, regular lubrication, frequent and regular blinking, and sunglasses to protect eyes from direct wind or sunlight are practical ways to prevent worsening of MGD and associated evaporative dry eyes symptoms. Early stages of MGD can be managed with topical medications alone and can be reversed with good compliance from patients.

Advanced stages might need probing, thermal heating devices, or pulsed laser therapy. Severe dry eyes might lead to blurred vision, inability to wear contact lenses, headaches, corneal keratinization, scarring, or corneal ulcers.Â Thus, it is imperative to treat MGD patients effectively and follow up to prevent profound vision-threatening complications.
