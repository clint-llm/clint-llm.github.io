Vitamin C deficiency, also known as scurvy, is a disease primarily associated with socioeconomic status and access to food. Signs and symptoms are often readily visible in individuals who develop this disease. The classic constellation of corkscrew hairs, perifollicular hemorrhage, and gingival bleeding is highly suggestive of vitamin C deficiency. This activity reviews the history, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of vitamin C deficiency. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients and promoting awareness regarding nutritional deficiencies.

**Objectives:**
- Review common exam findings associated with vitamin C deficiency.
- Describe the pathophysiology of vitamin C deficiency.
- Summarize the steps to diagnose vitamin C deficiency.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination, with particular emphasis on communication between interprofessional medical teams, to enhance both preventative management and prompt delivery of care to patients with vitamin C deficiency.
