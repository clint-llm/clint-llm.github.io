Initially, the precise etiology of this syndrome was not completely understood. Occasional reports of heavy metal poisoning like goldStaphylococcus aureus infection in one case

However, presently, there is overwhelming evidence that strongly supports an autoimmune basis in its etiology where a strong association with autoantibodies to voltage-gated potassium channel complex (VGKCs)

The first identified antibody target within the VGKC complex was CASPR2 in patients with Morvan syndrome. Subsequently, LGI1 was also recognized as an additional and significant target in a few cases with MoS and also limbic encephalitis (LE). In addition, a minority of patients have antibodies directed against the third identified antigenic component of the VGKC complex, namely contactin-2
