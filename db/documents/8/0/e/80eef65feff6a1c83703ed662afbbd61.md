Lipoprotein lipase deficiency is suspected in young individuals with the following clinical findings in addition to the supportive laboratory findings.

**Clinical Findings**

- Recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis

- Eruptive xanthoma

- Hepatosplenomegaly

- Retinalis lipemia

**Lab Findings**

- Milky appearing plasma. This occurs due to the impaired clearance of the chylomicrons from the plasma.

- Plasma triglyceride levels exceeding 2000 mg/dL. These levels are considered regardless of the fasting state.

**Diagnosis**

The diagnosis of lipoprotein lipase deficiency is established by molecular genetic testing, which identifies the proband by identifying the biallelic pathogenic variants in the lipoprotein lipase gene.

- Sequence analysis - This identifies 97 % of probands with the biallelic pathogenic variants.

- Gene targeted duplication/deletion analysis - this identifies 4% of probands with biallelic pathogenic variants.

Molecular genetic testing can be done for only lipoprotein lipase gene identification, or to identify the other four genes as well, which can lead to chylomicronemia. It is described as follows :

- Single gene testing - The sequence analysis of only the lipoprotein lipase gene is performed. If one or no pathogenic variant is found, the sequence analysis is followed by the gene-targeted duplication/deletion analysis.

- Multigene panel - It includes the lipoprotein lipase gene as well as of the other four genes, namely, apolipoprotein C- II gene, apolipoprotein A-V gene, lipase maturation factor 1 gene, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein binding protein gene, for the chylomicronemia syndrome. Sequence analysis and gene-targeted duplication/deletion, any method may be used.

**Measurement of Lipoprotein Lipase Activity**

- Assay of the lipoprotein lipase activity in the plasma, after ten minutes of post Intravenous administration of heparin. Here the post heparin plasma is added to VLDL substrate and the liberated free fatty acids are assayed, and the lipoprotein lipase activity is expressed as micromoles of the released free fatty acids released per minute per liter of the plasma, that is, micromoles/l/min, after subtraction of hepatic lipase activity. Carriers of pathogenic mutations in either the lipoprotein lipase enzyme or its cofactor, that is, apolipoprotein C-II, will lead to undetectable lipoprotein lipase activity in the post heparin plasma which is a diagnostic of familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency.

- Biopsies of the adipose tissue may also be used to determine the lipoprotein lipase activity directly.
