Many studies have found that HAP is associated with an increased risk of death. The all-cause mortality associated with VAP ranges from 20% to 50% in different studies. Variables associated with increased mortality include:

- Severity of illness at the time of diagnosis (e.g., shock, coma, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome)

- Bacteremia

- The underlying co-morbidities
