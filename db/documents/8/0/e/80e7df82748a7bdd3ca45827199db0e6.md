Except for congenital blindness, CBS can originate from any factor affecting the visual pathway, extending from the visual cortex down to the eyes.

Common etiologies include

- Diabetic retinopathy

- Age-related macular degeneration

- Cerebral infarctions

- Glaucoma

- Macular degeneration

- Cataract

- High myopia

- Retinitis Pigmentosa

- Optic Neuritis

- Retinal vein occlusion

- Central retinal arterial occlusion

- Occipital stroke

- Temporal arteritis

The proposed theory for CBS is the phantom limb pain theory. Phantom limb pain theory explains a feeling of pain even when the limb has been removed. The patient feels pain even though the limb has been removed. Similarly, patients with CBS may have visual sensations despite being unable to see them.
