The spinal cord that travels through the vertebral canal primarily receives its blood supply from two sources: the anterior spinal artery and the two posterior spinal arteries. As these two arteries traverse the length of the spinal column, they give off branching arteries bilaterally at each vertebral level. These branching arteries are the segmental spinal arteries that enter the vertebral canal through the intervertebral foramina. Spinal branches feed the vertebral column at all segmental levels. These are derived from several arteries, beginning with the vertebral and ascending cervical arteries and continuing with the posterior intercostal arteries, subcostal, lumbar, iliolumbar, lateral sacral, and medial sacral arteries. Venous drainage occurs via the internal and external plexuses.

The artery of Adamkiewicz, otherwise known as the great anterior radiculomedullary artery, is a perfusing branch of the radicular anterior artery arising from the posterior intercostal artery. There are multiple anatomic variants of this artery and at what vertebral level it joins with the anterior spinal artery.
