The incidence of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease is a relatively rare condition in comparison to other leukodystrophies. The worldwide incidence ranges between 1 per 90,000 to 1 per 750,000 live births. In the United States, the incidence is higher at 1.9 per 100,000 male live births.

PMD is an X-linked recessive disorder, and therefore males are mostly affected. Females can be carriers only; heterozygote females do not have neurological symptoms. However, in families where males exhibit the milder phenotype of PMD, SPG2, some of the females tend to have some symptoms of PMD when they are adults.
