The exact etiology of PLEVA is not known, although there have been various hypotheses noted in the literature, including an atypical immune response to infections, an inflammatory reaction to medications, and a lymphoproliferative disorder. In support of these hypotheses, there have been cases reported of PLEVA following infections with pathogens such as Epstein-Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), varicella-zoster virus, Toxoplasma gondii, Group A streptococcus, and herpes simplex virus type 2.

Additionally, PLEVA has been found to erupt in response to receiving the human papillomavirus, influenza, tetanus, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccinations.
