Ensuring thorough patient medication allergy checks is essential to prevent avoidable adverse events when considering antibiotic prophylaxis or administering antibiotics for suspected or confirmed bacterial infections. Furthermore, prescribers should know about the most frequent and severe adverse events associated with commonly prescribed medications. This enables physicians to educate patients, offer appropriate informed consent, and provide necessary counseling regarding potential risks and benefits.

According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), antibiotics were responsible for approximately 142,000 emergency room visits between 2004 and 2005. These visits were attributed to adverse events such as allergic reactions, medication errors, and overdoses associated with antibiotic use. This highlights the importance of appropriate antibiotic prescribing, monitoring, and patient education to mitigate potential harm and ensure safe medication practices.

Here is a concise overview of the common and severe adverse events related to the antibiotics mentioned earlier.

Many oral antibiotics administered for cutaneous infection and prophylaxis, especially penicillins and cephalosporins, have the common adverse effects of gastrointestinal upset, such as nausea and diarrhea. In addition, both medication classes have been associated with hypersensitivity reactions, and the more severe acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS-TEN), and anaphylaxis.

Studies suggest that the cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins in patients with penicillin allergies is relatively low, with estimates indicating that no more than 2% of patients allergic to penicillins will experience cross-reactivity with cephalosporins. It is worth noting that early perceptions of high cross-reactivity were inflated due to the contamination of early cephalosporin preparations with penicillin.

Azithromycin and clindamycin are recommended as second-line agents for prophylaxis of cutaneous infection in patients with penicillin allergies. Azithromycin belongs to the macrolide class of antibiotics and is associated with common adverse effects such as hypersensitivity reactions and photosensitivity. However, it is essential to note that azithromycin can also cause more severe adverse effects, including QT prolongation and a rare arrhythmia called torsades de pointes. Careful monitoring and appropriate patient selection are essential when using these antibiotics as alternatives to penicillin in allergic patients.Pseudomonas infection of the ear and is associated with tendonitis and tendon rupture.

**Rise in Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Spending**

Two other issues of concern include the rise in antimicrobial resistance and healthcare spending. Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing concern worldwide, and studies have shown an increase in MRSA. Rising healthcare costs in the United States have also been a recent concern. According to a 2019 study published in JAMA, healthcare spending wastage was estimated to range from 760 to 935 billion dollars annually, accounting for approximately 25% of total healthcare spending.
