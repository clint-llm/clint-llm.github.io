The use of fluvastatin is contraindicated in patients who have a hypersensitivity to the drug. Active liver disease and unexplained, persistent elevated serum transaminases are contraindications to fluvastatin use. Its use also is contraindicated during pregnancy (Refer to revised FDA labeling 2021) or while breastfeeding. Potentially serious drug interactions may exist with fluvastatin, requiring that the dose or frequency of administration be adjusted. Drug interactions include combining fluvastatin with a fibrate, niacin, or protease inhibitors. Combining fluvastatin with these drugs increases the risk of rhabdomyolysis. The prescriber should obtain a complete medication list from the patient before prescribing fluvastatin.

There are numerous cautions for fluvastatin that bear consideration when a patient is taking the medication as prescribed. Adverse cognitive effects are reversible upon cessation of the drug. Caution is necessary for patients with heavy alcohol use, renal failure, or a history of liver disease. Because there is an increase in the risk of developing diabetes mellitus, prescribers should exercise caution if a patient has increased blood glucose or hemoglobin A1c concentrations.
