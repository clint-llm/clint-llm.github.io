Complications from central venous access can be classified into early and late complications. Again, some of these are not specific to the femoral site and can occur with insertion at other central venous access sites.

**Early**

- Arterial puncture could result in the formation of a hematoma

- Hematoma formation could also result from routine placement

- Bladder puncture. At our institution, we catheterize or insert a foley catheter before placement of a femoral central line

- Hemorrhage

- Catheter fragment resulting in a guidewire embolism

- Cardiac dysrhythmias, particularly from high-lying central lines

**Late**

- Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI)

- Phlebitis

- Thrombosis

- Erosion/perforation

The following are not complications, per se, but can lead to complications:

- Uncooperative patient

- Lack of experience/supervision
