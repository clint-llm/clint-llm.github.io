**Transvaginal Sonogram**

- Baseline assessment of the uterus, ovaries, and adnexa to rule out any pathology like fibroids, polyps, uterine anomalies, hydrosalpinx, or PCOS

- Ovarian reserve assessment- antral follicular count

- Monitoring ovulation induction during clomiphene citrate, letrozole, or gonadotropin cycles with or without intrauterine insemination (IUI) and with in-vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles.

- For timing the ovulation trigger during IUI and IVF

- Assessment of endometrial thickness during IUI and IVF

- For performing oocyte retrievals and sometimes for embryo transfer or other uterine procedures, transabdominal scanning is ineffective.

**Transabdominal Sonogram**

- Women with a large uterus caused by fibroids or adenomyosis, or both.

- When the uterus or ovaries closely adhered to the anterior abdominal wall secondary to scarring from prior surgery, infection or endometriosis.

**Saline Infusion Sonogram**

- To assess the uterine cavity for pathologies such as polyps, submucosal fibroids, intrauterine synechiae or scarring, and uterine malformations.

- To assess tubal patency (instead of a traditional hysterosalpingogram (HSG)).
