A thorough history should be performed for all patients complaining of leakage of fluid. This includes a history of present illness, obstetrical history, gynecologic history, medical history, surgical history, social history, and family history. When obtaining the history of present illness, it is important to inquire about contractions, fetal movement, time of possibleÂ rupture, amount of fluid, color and odor of fluid, vaginal bleeding, pain, recent sexual encounters, recent trauma, and recent physical activity.

Physical exam should be performed in a way that minimizes the risk of infection. A sterile speculum exam should always be performed. During the speculum exam, patient should be inspected for any signs of cervicitis, umbilical cord prolapse, vaginal bleeding, or fetal prolapse. Digital exam should be avoided unless delivery appears imminent or patient appears to be in active labor
