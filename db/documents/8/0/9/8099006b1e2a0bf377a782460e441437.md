The ultimate goal of a prosthetic limb is to enable a patient to fully return to their routine activity. For younger patients, the goals may be activities of daily living and various sports.

Another clinically significant indicator is dynamic balance, as evaluated by a four-square step test, socket comfort, pain, and distance walked in a 6-minute test. Mobility assessments can be performed pre-fitting and post-fitting to check the speed of ambulation. A well-fitted prosthetic limb can have a huge positive impact on improving quality of life and patient care. Quality of life has been shown to significantly improve after lower limb amputation with prosthetic limb use while in the inpatient rehabilitation setting and after 3 months time.
