Ventriculitis is the inflammation of the ependymal lining of the cerebral ventricles, usually secondary to infection (for example meningitis, device-related or a complication of trauma). There is no clear definition for ventriculitis and no accepted diagnostic criteria, which makes the assessment of incidence difficult. Early diagnosis is essential for appropriate treatment; this requires a clinical history, CSF sample, and imaging. Antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment. This activity will review the causes of ventriculitis and the different microbes responsible. It will evaluate the different investigations required for diagnosis and review the treatment options available. It will briefly highlight some of the controversies and gaps in the literature and identifies the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition. This activity describes the pathophysiology of ventriculitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of ventriculitis. 
- Describe the clinical presentation of ventriculitis.
- Explain the treatment and management options available for ventriculitis.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving the diagnosis and management of ventriculitis to improve outcomes.
