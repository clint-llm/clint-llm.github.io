Cardiac rhabdomyoma can be identified as a mass in utero using ultrasonography. The presentation can vary from heart blocks, hydrops fetalis, or pericardial effusion.

Dyspnea is one of the major initial patient complaints. Tumors are diagnosed more commonly in fetal series than postnatal series resulting in an increased sensitivity of fetal echocardiograms.
