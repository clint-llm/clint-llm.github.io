Management of a subungualÂ hematoma is often done by the emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, primary care provider or surgeon, typically with the assistance of a nurse stabilizing the finer. The key is to ensure that the hematoma is not older than 48 hours. In most cases, the hematoma can be drained with a large needle without any complications. Follow up of patients is recommended to ensure that there is no infection and the hematoma has resolved.
