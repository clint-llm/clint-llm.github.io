Atorvastatin contraindications include patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components.

While atorvastatin contraindications also include patients with active liver disease, the benefits of lipid-lowering therapy in chronic liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatitis, likely outweigh the possible risks.

Atorvastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy or in female patients who may become pregnant. All female patients of childbearing age should receive counseling on the potential risks to a fetus should they become pregnant while on atorvastatin. This risk is most pronounced in the first trimester, so current guidelines recommend ceasing statin therapy for at least three months prior to becoming pregnant. The patient should discontinue this medication immediately if they become pregnant. However, a recent meta-analysis has called this restriction into question; more research will be necessary to accurately assess the risk-benefit ratio of using statins during pregnancy.

Female patients should also avoid atorvastatin if they are nursing. If patients require atorvastatin therapy, they should receive direction to discontinue breastfeeding.
