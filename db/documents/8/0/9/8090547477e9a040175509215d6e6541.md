The diaphragm has a robust blood supply. Major arteries include the superior and inferior phrenic arteries, which are the branches of the aorta, the musculophrenic, and the pericardiacophrenic arteries. The musculophrenic and the pericardiacophrenic arteries are, in turn, branches of the internal thoracic artery and the lower internal intercostal arteries. The venous drainage from the diaphragm involves the brachiocephalic veins, azygous system, and veins that drain directly into the inferior vena cava and the left suprarenal vein.
