Acquired flatfoot is a common orthopedic condition, although there is a relative paucity of literature on the epidemiology regarding adult acquired flatfoot. There are 5 million people in the United States affected with adult acquired flatfoot. In the UK, the estimated prevalence is estimated to be over 3% in women over 40 years old.
