Hypervitaminosis E is rare and the least toxic of the fat-soluble vitamins. For adults, the upper limits of vitamin E replacement are 1500 to 2200 international units depending on whether the patient is using a natural or synthetic source, respectively. Daily limits for children depend on the child's age, starting at 200 international units at one year of age to 800 international units by 18 years old. Staying well below these levels, however, is recommended for daily supplementation.

Studies of high-dose Vitamin E supplementation have been small in number but suggest an associated increase in all-cause mortality. Decreased absorption of other fat-soluble vitamins is known to occur with high serum vitamin E leading to impairment of bone mineralization, coagulopathies, and decreased vitamin A storage.
