Mutations in the cavernoma genes can cause activation of downstream Rho-A kinase (ROCK), which causes endothelial barrier dysfunction. Cavernomas typically most often during the 2nd to 5th decades of life with seizures (50%), symptomatic hemorrhage (25%), and focal neurological deficits without radiographic evidence of recent hemorrhage (25%).PDCD10/CCM3 mutations are associated with a greater risk of bleeding. Cavernous angiomas with symptomatic hemorrhage (CASH) include lesions that impact a patient’s life and merit clinical intervention.
