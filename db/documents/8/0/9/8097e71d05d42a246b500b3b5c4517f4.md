The diagnosis and management of extramammary Paget disease is with an interprofessional team that includes an oncologist, pathologist, dermatologist, primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and a surgeon. The condition is very rare and delay in diagnosis are very common. When an itchy or scaly rash is seen that persists, one should always have to to consider a malignant process, especially in older people. While the treatment for localized lesions is surgery, in many patients local spread has occurred by the time diagnosis is made. There is a high rate of recurrence after surgery and in these patients, systemic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy is often utilized. The prognosis for most patients is guarded.

Once treatment is completed, the should be monitored closely on follow up by their oncologist, nurse practitioner, and an oncology nurse. If there is any evidence of recurrence, the patient should be referred back to the specialist. It is important that the oncology nurse arrange regular followup appointments and educate the family on the need for close monitoring. If there is any concern regarding followup or lack of patient/family awareness, the nurse should involve the oncologist. Only with an interprofessional team will the best outcomes be achieved.
