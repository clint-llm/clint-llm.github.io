Pediatric facial fractures are uncommon despite the large incidence of pediatric facial trauma in general. Cases involving fractures are typically evaluated in the emergency room and involve emergency providers and nurses, a facial surgeon, a radiologist, and variably a trauma surgeon, child-life specialist, social worker, emergency medical service (EMS) personnel, and other specialty services. Facial fractures in children are often conservatively managed, though an organized team approach can prevent missing subtle or dangerous injuries and improve patient outcomes.

Much of the data presented above is derived from small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or large cohort studies. [Level 2-3]
