Intra-abdominal adhesions are commonly formed after surgery, but can also be congenital. They are the most common cause of bowel obstruction. The majority of these obstructions will improve with conservative treatment, but some will require surgical intervention and adhesiolysis to relieve the obstruction. This activity describes the indications and contraindications for performing adhesiolysis and the methods for performing the procedure as well as post-surgical care.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of adhesion formation after abdominal surgery.
- Summarize the treatment of adhesions in the setting of bowel obstruction. 
- Review ways in which to prevent further adhesion formation. 
- Outline how various members of the healthcare team are important to the care of patients with intra-abdominal adhesions.
