The migraine patient should be evaluated by an interprofessional team involving a neurologist, psychologist, psychiatrist, surgeon, specialty-trained neurology nurse, and allied health professionals. Appropriate case selection is necessary to have a successful outcome of the surgery. A pharmacist should be involved in helping the team with pharmaceutical selection and maintenance. Nurses should assist in patient education before and after surgery. One should follow the methodology as given in the flowchart.

**Botulinum Toxin**

Botulinum toxin (BT) is a toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. It paralyzes muscles by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine from presynaptic terminals. It has 8 subtypes: A through H, of which type A is safe and effective for therapeutic usage.

Though botulinum toxin can be used short term as an acute and prophylactic treatment,

**Peripheral Neurolysis**

The beneficial effect of peripheral neurolysis of supratrochlear and supraorbital nerves on migraine was discovered when Guyuron found that his patients were relieved of a debilitating migraine after brow lift surgery.

**Neuromodulation**

Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) can have benefits for pain in the distribution of both occipital and trigeminal nerves through the modulatory activity of the trigeminocervical complex. This consists of the trigeminal nucleus and portions of the upper 3 cervical dorsal nerves. It can result in 30% to 50% of patients having more than 50% pain relief.
