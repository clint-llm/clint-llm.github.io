The first description of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) was by Hippocrates around 400 BC. Marchand discovered the association of this disease with pregnancy in 1895. Healthy trophoblastic tissue penetrates the endometrium, which creates a rich uterine vasculature, leading to a close connection between the fetus and the mother, which is called the placenta. Invasion is characteristic of malignant tissue, and fortunately, the malignant behavior of the healthy trophoblast is well controlled. Nevertheless, in gestational trophoblastic disease, the regulatory mechanisms become dysfunctional, resulting in highly invasive, vascular, and metastatic tumors.

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasiaÂ involves malignant entities that include choriocarcinoma, invasive mole, epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT), and placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT). All can metastasize and can be fatal if not treated.
