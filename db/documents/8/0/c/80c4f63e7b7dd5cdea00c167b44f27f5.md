Sciatica is a clinical diagnosis, and therefore, a thorough history and physical examination are necessary for a complete evaluation and diagnosis. Imaging is initially of little value. If warranted, plain films of the lumbosacral spine may evaluate for fracture or spondylolisthesis. A non-contrast CT scan may be performed to evaluate fracture if plain films are negative. Additionally, pain that has been persistent for 6 to 8 weeks and not responding to conservative management should be imaged. In this case, MRI is the imaging modality of choice. In cases where the neurologic deficit is present or mass effect is suspected, immediate MRI is the standard of care in establishing the cause of the pain and ruling out pressing surgical pathology.
