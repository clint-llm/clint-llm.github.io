It is vital to consider other diagnoses before attributing the clinical features to neonatal abstinence syndrome, even if there is a clear history of prenatal drug exposure. In some cases where maternal history is unyielding or unclear, physicians can mistake some signs and symptoms of NAS as a different condition. For example, autonomic instability leading to mottling, sweating, tachypnea, and changes in temperature in NAS can be mistaken for sepsis.

Essential diagnoses to consider in evaluating a patient with NAS include:

- Sepsis

- Birth trauma

- Gastrointestinal reflux

- Hyperthyroidism

- Hypoglycemia

- Hypocalcemia

- Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
