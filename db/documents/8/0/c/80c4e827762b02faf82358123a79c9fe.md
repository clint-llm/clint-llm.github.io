Staging of stress injuries is based on MRI findings which are the most sensitive diagnostic modality. The MRI findings use the Fredericson classification system:

- Grade 1: Periosteal edema only

- Grade 2: Bone marrow edema (only on T2 weighted sequences)

- Grade 3: Bone marrow edema (on T1 and T2 weighted sequences)

- Grade 4: (4a) Multiple discrete areas of intracortical signal changes; (4b) Linear areas of intracortical signal change correlating with a frank stress fracture

One may also visualize a periosteal reaction on x-ray which typically correlates with a grade 3 stress injury on MRI or completed fracture line thatÂ correlates with a grade 4 stress injury.
