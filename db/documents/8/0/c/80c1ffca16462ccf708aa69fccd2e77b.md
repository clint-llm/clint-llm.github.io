Isotretinoin may be prescribed by any clinician, including the nurse practitioner. While the drug is effective for the treatment of acne, all prescribers should be familiar with the drug's adverse effect profile- of which one of the most serious is teratogenicity. Isotretinoin is a pregnancy category X drug and is contraindicated in pregnant women or who may become pregnant. There have been severe, documented congenital disabilities when pregnant women have taken isotretinoin. To prescribe and receive isotretinoin, the Food and Drug Administration requires prescribers and patients to register with the iPLEDGE program. iPLEDGE ensures the meeting of appropriate requirements beforeÂ dispensing isotretinoin to prevent the use of this medication during pregnancy. These requirements include negative pregnancy tests and documented abstinence or the use of birth control before and while taking isotretinoin.

Given the nature of isotretinoin therapy, an interprofessional healthcare team approach is necessary. Pharmacists will play a vital role in working with the patient for iPLEDGE, contacting and keeping in touch with the prescriber, and coordinating with the prescriber's nursing staff to ensure therapy is administered correctly and in the proper situation, particularly in the case of female patients. Nurses also need to provide counsel, monitor for adverse events, and can collaborate with the pharmacist regarding contraceptive measures for female patients. Both the pharmacists and nurses need an open line to the prescriber so any concerns can be addressed immediately. This interprofessional team methodology applies to any medication but is especially necessary with isotretinoin to achieve satisfactory and safe therapeutic patient outcomes. [Level 5]
