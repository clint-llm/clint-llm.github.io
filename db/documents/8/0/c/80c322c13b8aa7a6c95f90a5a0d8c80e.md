Endometrial hyperplasia is a disordered proliferation of endometrial glands. It results from the unopposed estrogenic stimulation of the endometrial tissue with a relative deficiency of the counterbalancing effects of progesterone.

The irregular growth of the endometrium results in an abnormal gland-to-stroma ratio and presents in a continuum of the spectrum of changes in the endometrium. It involves varying degrees of histopathological complexity and atypical features in the cells and nuclei. Endometrial hyperplasia, if not treated, has the propensity to develop into endometrial cancer.
