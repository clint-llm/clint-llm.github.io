Excessive traction on the spinal cord due to TCS results in impaired spinal cord perfusion, oxidative metabolism, reduced glucose metabolism, and mitochondrial failure with corresponding electrophysiologic changes and neurologic dysfunction.

Following the release of spinal cord traction, the pathophysiologic and electrophysiologic changes can recover, resulting in neurologic improvement.
