Management of tracheobronchial tear or injury is a classic example of interprofessional teamwork requiring constant communication and coordination between medical/surgical/nursing and paramedical professionals. Optimal on-site management of trauma can improve the outcomes in most traumas, including traumatic tracheobronchial tears. A high index of suspicion in the emergency room by providers can reduce the incidence of missed tracheobronchial tear, which has got an impact on mortality. Timely support from anesthesia/pulmonary or otorhinolaryngology could ensure safe airway management and requires very close coordination between various specialty teams.

Cardiothoracic surgery/otorhinolaryngologist may have to carefully coordinate various surgical interventions (if indicated) not only for tracheobronchial injuries but also for associated injuries. Interventional pulmonary evaluation, intervention, and follow up will be required in those patients who are conservatively managed due to high risk for surgical repair or those select patients with iatrogenic trauma. Physiotherapy/speech and swallow therapy involvement and follow up is required in most patients after surgery as well as endoscopic management. In essence, close communication and coordination between multidisciplinary professional teamsÂ are necessary for the best outcome in a patient with a tracheobronchial tear.
