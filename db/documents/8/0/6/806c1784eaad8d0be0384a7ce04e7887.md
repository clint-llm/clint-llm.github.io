- **Reason for examination**: the sonographer should validate the indication for the ultrasound examination. The last menstrual period (or the estimated delivery date) should be documented. All this information is critical in targeting specific structures. Choosing whether to use a transvaginal and/or transabdominal technique and whether additional studies may be helpful (e.g., Doppler velocimetry).

- **Patient positioning**: a semirecumbent position is the most commonly used in obstetrics and gynecology. A padded table and pillow are used to ensure maximum comfort. It is preferable to elevate the head of the bed as some pregnant women are unable to lie flat, especially in late pregnancy. For the transvaginal exam, a lithotomy position is used.

- **Special consideration for the obese patients**: in obese individuals, imaging could be improved by placing the transducer on the side rather than on the midline and while the patient is lying on her side. The transvaginal probe is also helpful in those patients.

- **Bladder filling**: This is useful when the lower uterine segment is of interest. It is often of little benefit in obstetric ultrasound examination as it can give a false diagnosis of placenta previa or elongated cervix. Transvaginal sonography is usually performed with an empty bladder.
