Astigmatism is a common refractive error, where refraction changes in different meridians of the eye.

Astigmatism can be regular or irregular. The etiology of astigmatism can be corneal, lenticular, or retinal. Regular astigmatism is divided into with the rule astigmatism, against the rule astigmatism, oblique, and bi-oblique astigmatism. The principle of Sturm's conoid defines the optics of regular astigmatism.

Astigmatism can also be divided into simple, compound, and mixed astigmatism.

Astigmatism can be managed with spectacles, contact lenses, and surgical correction of astigmatism through refractive surgery, toric IOL implantation, and astigmatic relaxing incisions.
