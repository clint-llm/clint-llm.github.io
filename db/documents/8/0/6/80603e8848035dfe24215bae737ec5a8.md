Safe and accurate targeting of the BVN is critical to the success of the ablation procedure. The procedure is performed by a pain physician, spine surgeon, or interventional radiologist with experience in image-guided spinal procedures, preferably with C-arm fluoroscopy or computerized tomography (CT) guidance. A combination of anterior-posterior (AP), lateral, and oblique C-arm fluoroscopic views are utilized to localize the pedicle and to guide the positioning of instruments. A single C-arm is most often used. However, two C-arms may be used, one for lateral and one for AP and oblique images.

In addition to a CT or fluoroscopy imaging, equipment for BVN ablation includes: an introducer diamond or bevel tipped trocar to access the vertebral body through a transpedicular approach; a curved cannula assembly with accompanying straight stylet to create a channel in the vertebral body to the BVN terminus (target site), and a bipolar radiofrequency ablation probe and radiofrequency generator to create the ablative lesion in the nerve terminus (see technique section below for details). Additional supplies include standardized surgical sterile supplies, such as sterile gowns, gloves, sterile hats, shoe covers, masks, appropriate drapes, sponges, laps, and other supplies to minimize risks of infection.
