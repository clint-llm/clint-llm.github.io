Unavoidable post-radiotherapy extractions require careful planning and management. However, ORN risk similar to pre-radiotherapy extractions can be accomplished with HBO before and after extraction. The protocol is 20 pre-extraction treatments and ten post-extraction treatments to 2.4 atmospheres for 90 minutes, one treatment per day, five days per week.

Bisphosphate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is a separate disease sharing some similarities to ORN of the mandible. The etiology of BRONJ is due to bisphosphate usage often combined with trauma to dentoalveolar tissues. Both diseases result in a chronic, poorly healing wound of the bone. Differentiating the two relies on clinical history and imaging. ORN has a history of radiation exposure and has osteolytic lesions on CT imaging. BRONJ has a history of bisphosphate usage and is more likely to have osteosclerotic lesions on CT imaging. Differentiating the two is important as the treatment approach is distinctly oppositional. BRONJ is more likely to respond to medical treatmentÂ without the need for surgical interventions. As discussed, ORN is primarily treated surgically.
