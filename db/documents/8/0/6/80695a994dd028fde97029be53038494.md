HA includes multiple different conditions that may cause HDL levels to be reduced. However, the causes of decreased HDL levels are primarily hereditary.

Some inherited causes of decreased HDL include:

- Tangier Disease

- Familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia

- Caused by a mutation in the Apolipoprotein A-1 Gene

- Familial combined hypolipidemia

- Elevated Cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity

- Lipoprotein lipase deficiency

- Familial lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency

Secondary causes of decreased HDL levels include:

- Severe sepsis

- Inflammatory conditions (such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn disease)

- Monoclonal gammopathies

- Beta-blockers

- Benzodiazepines

- Exogenous testosterone replacement therapy
