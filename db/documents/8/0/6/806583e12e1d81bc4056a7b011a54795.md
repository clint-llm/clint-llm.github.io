The management of tumors in an area as important as the orbit can be quite complicated. A thorough discussion is necessary to inform the patient of the potential causes, treatments, adverse events, and prognosis of the disease processes involved. Whenever cancer is a possibility, it is critical to approach the patient with compassion and empathy. At times this may necessitate multiple discussions so the patient can process the information and make an informed decision. The risks, benefits, and alternatives of any treatment (or lack of treatment) should be explained. The emotional and psychological impact of the diagnoses involved and the treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, long-term monitoring for recurrence, etc.) and especially any complications that arise may require multi-specialty attention from a primary care provider, oncologist, psychologist, or psychiatrist.
