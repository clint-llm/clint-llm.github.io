The only use of V-series nerve agents (other than for research) is a chemical weapon. Thus, patients exposed to these agents may present in large numbers and report a history consistent with a terrorist attack. Symptoms are identical to those of the organophosphate toxidrome and include seizures, salivation, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, urination, diaphoresis, diarrhea, vomiting, miosis, and muscles spasms. Other symptoms include bronchospasm, central apnea, and bradycardia. Most deaths occur because of respiratory failure from the combination of respiratory symptoms. Those who survive nerve agent exposure may experience insomnia, depression, anxiety, irritability, and impaired memory and judgment. Ocular symptoms such as miosis, dim vision, blurry vision, and eye pain may persist for several weeks following exposure. Long-term neurologic effects of nerve agents have been reported.
