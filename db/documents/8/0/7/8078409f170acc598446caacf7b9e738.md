Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE)Â is a diagnosis made mainly from imaging and histopathology; however, few clinical signs in history can suggest this diagnosis. It is crucial to consider the risk factors for PIE, which are mainly premature birth and low birth weight. Some nonspecific clinical signs in both adults and infants that are associated with PIE are increased oxygen requirements, which can progressively and rapidly increase carbon dioxide retention.

There are no physical exam findings specifically to help make the diagnosis. If PIE has already progressed, there can be signs of air leaks, so upon physical exam, it is important to monitor for air leaks such as decreased breath sounds, crepitus heard on the affected side, or over-inflation of the chest wall.
