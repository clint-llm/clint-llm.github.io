Direct vertical trauma, repetitive microtrauma, and childbirth are common causes of coccyx pain. However, more serious underlying causes must be excluded, such as infections (including both soft tissue abscess and osteomyelitis) or malignancy (including chordoma, which has a high fatality rate).

Also, coccydynia can be a referred pain due to lower gastrointestinal or urogenital disorders.

The outcome of direct vertical trauma to the coccyx can vary from contusion to fracture-dislocation of the coccyx. Traumatic or non-traumatic compromise of the coccygeal ligaments can result in coccygeal dynamic instability (excessive movement of the coccyx during weight-bearing or while sitting). Abnormal mobility of the coccyx can result in coccygeal pain. Abnormally mobile coccyges can be either hypermobile (due to lax ligaments) or hypomobile (rigid). The coccyx may be subluxated anteriorly or posteriorly, unstable, or even dislocated.

Coccyxes of certain shapes are more predisposed to coccydynia than others.

A distal coccyx bone spur (spicule) may cause pain when the skin is pinched beneath the spur during sitting.

Idiopathic coccydynia is a 'diagnosis of exclusion' after careful screening for identifiable causes.
