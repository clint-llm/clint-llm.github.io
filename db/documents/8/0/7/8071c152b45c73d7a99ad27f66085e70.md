The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) offers simulation training for continuing medical education (CME) credit for those who attend sessions related to obstetric emergencies, endoscopic surgical simulation, and advanced surgical simulation. ACOG additionally offers other simulations, such as vaginal hysterectomy, etonogestrel implant insertion, shoulder dystocia, to practice the skills necessary to perform these procedures.

Simulation has been formally standardized and incorporated into a laparoscopic simulation program for general surgery in the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Skills (FLS) training program.
