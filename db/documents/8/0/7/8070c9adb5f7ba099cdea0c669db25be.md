An important consideration in myocardial perfusion imaging is the timing of radiotracer administration from the onset of presumed infarction as maximum deposition with infarcted areas occurs at approximately 48 to 72 hours following the ischemic event with a decremental clearance after about 7 days. Hence, studies performed within 24 hours or past 7 days have higher rates of false-negative results. Obtaining serial scans at 48 to 72-hour intervals can increase diagnostic yield.

False-negative results may arise when a heavy burden of diffuse coronary artery disease with poor collateral circulation causes “balanced ischemia” from global hypoperfusion. There may also be a significant delay in radiotracer penetrance within myocardial tissue, in which case repeating a study about 4 to 5 days later may help improve diagnostic yield. The decreased myocardial mass within inferior and posterior walls compared to anterior and lateral walls or smaller territories of infarction may decrease sensitivity, though serial scans can significantly improve the detection of small infarcts.

The presence of intracardiac or valvular calcifications, ventricular aneurysm, infiltrative diseases such as amyloidosis, anthracycline toxicity, radiation therapy, and scarring from prior myocardial infarction can cause false-positive results when technetium pyrophosphate tracer is used in SPECT imaging.

Cardiac PET requires concurrent administration of vasodilators due to the short half-life of PET radiotracers. Other limitations include limited anatomic detail of coronary calcification due to attenuation correction. Many studies have shown high rates of false-negative results in patients with insulin resistance and low cardiac output.

Potential contraindications of cardiac MRI include the presence of metal devices or implants, including cardiac implanted electronic devices, wires, and clips, and foreign bodies. A comprehensive patient screening is mandatory to assess potential risks prior to the MRI. CMR entails longer times for image acquisition in a still position, which may be difficult for certain patients to tolerate.

Heavy coronary calcifications on CTA may cause artifacts that may impact the interpretation of results, and smaller, distal vessels may be poorly visualized.
