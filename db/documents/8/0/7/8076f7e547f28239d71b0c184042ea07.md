Evaluation for myocardial disease in scleroderma is very important, given that the majority of patients have no cardiac symptoms early in the course of the disease. Therefore, cardiac screening for asymptomatic patients with SSc has been proposed. This includes obtaining a baseline cardiac clinical evaluation with history and exam, transthoracic echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, lab testing with troponin, and plasma brain natriuretic peptide. Additional testing is indicated in symptomatic patients include cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, stress testing, and/or cardiac catheterization. Referral to a cardiologist is warranted based on the findings of these studies. An interprofessional approach is recommended with the involvement of rheumatologists and cardiologists to provide comprehensive care and recommendations.
