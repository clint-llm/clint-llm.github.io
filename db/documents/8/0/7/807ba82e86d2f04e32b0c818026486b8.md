Laboratory studies provide further information when diagnosing complications of bisphosphonate use. For instance, a low hemoglobin can be seen with erosive esophagitis. Calcium and vitamin D levels can help identify hypocalcemia, and a rising creatinine is a key feature in diagnosing nephrotoxicity.

Plain X-rays can show atypical femoral fractures appearing transversely, sometimes obliquely, and with a "beaked" appearance on the cortex. Increased uptake in the affected area can be seen on theÂ technetium (Tc)-99m bone scan. In cases with a negative X-ray and a high clinical suspicion, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be useful. A low signal fracture line in T1, T2, and short TI inversion recovery (STIR) images can be seen, while the marrow signal appears low in T1 and high in T2 and STIR.
