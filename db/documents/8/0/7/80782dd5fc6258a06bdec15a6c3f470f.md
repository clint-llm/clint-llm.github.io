Viruses are the most common cause of acute rhinosinusitis. The viral rhinosinusitis (VRS) pathogens include rhinovirus, adenovirus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza virus. The most common causes of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) are Streptococcus pneumoniae (38%), Haemophilus influenzae (36%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (16%).Mucor, Rhizopus, Rhizomucor, and Aspergillus.  It is very important to understand the difference between acute invasive fungal sinusitis (IFS) seen in these patients, and allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS) which presents in immunocompetent individuals as a mass-like lesion occupying a sinus cavity and often causes chronic symptoms.  AFS will be discussed elsewhere and is beyond the scope of this article.
