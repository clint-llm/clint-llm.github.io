The visual field test maps the vision in each eye by measuring the entire scope (central and peripheral) of vision when attention is focused on a central point. A visual field deficit can help to localize a lesion along the visual pathway. These deficits are divided, taking into consideration if they are unilateral or bilateral. Unilateral deficits are caused by retinal and optic nerve disease. Bilateral deficits are caused by chiasmal lesions or lesions affecting the retrochiasmal pathways.

Homonymous superior quadrantanopia, also called “pie in the sky,” causes a field deficit in the superior field of both eyes for the same side. This visual field deficit is bilateral and involves retrochiasmal pathways.
