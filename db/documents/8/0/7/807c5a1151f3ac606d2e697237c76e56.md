Danazol has been historically used to treat endometriosis but has recently been used in several hematological diseases. There is evidence of its effect in steroid-resistant Diamond-Blackfan anemia, where it showed effectiveness in causing erythroid hyperplasia, possibly by virtue of its androgenic nature.

There is also evidence of its efficacy in acquired amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic purpura and immune thrombocytopenia purpura, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, where it is shown to induce apoptosis in leukemic cells.

Recent advances in medicine introduced more effective treatments for endometriosis, for which danazol has been used historically. It is still useful for treatment-resistant varieties of endometriosis, as well as gynecological problems, including heavy menstrual bleeding.

Danazol can prove to be a valuable agent in female patients suffering from both hematological and gynecological problems, as it has shown its efficacy in both fields.

Since danazol is known to cause liver damage, it should be avoided with other drugs that cause hepatotoxicity, especially in the geriatric and diabetic population, most of which are already prescribed statin drugs for their conditions. Clinicians and pharmacists should maintain a watchful eye for drug interactions and combined toxicity. They should work together with other clinicians and closely monitor their medications to save the patient from liver damage and increase adherence.
