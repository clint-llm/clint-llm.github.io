Osteitis condensans ilii (OCI) is often asymptomatic, but can also present as nonspecific lower back pain. If present, pain symptoms are usually reported as worsened with exertion and improve with rest. In contrast, the lower back pain symptoms in spondyloarthritis commonly improve with activity. As previously noted, OCI symptoms are most commonly seen in association with weight gain or pregnancy.

Pain is usually bilateral and may extend to the buttocks and posterior thighs in a non-radicular fashion.

It is important to perform a full musculoskeletal exam to assess for other symptomatic joints, as OCI only localizes to the lower back. Additionally, post-traumatic and congenital causes for the pain, including leg-length discrepancy and spinal malalignment, should also be excluded on physical examination. In addition, there should be no neurologic findings of sensory or motor loss.
