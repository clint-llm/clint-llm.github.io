Borrelia recurrentis, or epidemic relapsing fever, is reported most commonly in areas of overcrowding and poor personal hygiene. It generally causes epidemics and has previously been associated with war, poverty, and famines. It is transmitted via lice and has decreased in frequency, substantially, since the first half of the 20th century. However, it is still commonly seen in the Horn of Africa, and among people who emigrated from Africa to Europe, in recent years. Other species causing relapsing fever in Africa include Borrelia duttonii, Borrelia hispanica, and Borrelia crocidurae. Borrelia hermsii, or tick-borne relapsing fever, is reported in the United States in Colorado, near Lake Tahoe, and near the Grand Canyon. Other species that cause tick-borne relapsing fever in the United States include Borrelia turicatae and Borrelia parkeri. Borrelia miyamotoi causes relapsing fever similar to Lyme disease. It is reported in the northeastern United States, Japan, and Russia, with slight variations in presentation depending on geography.
