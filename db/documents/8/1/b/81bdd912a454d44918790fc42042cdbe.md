The presentation may be variable, depending on the underlying cause.  Symptoms can include:

- Bulging eyes - this may be measured with an exophthalmometer.

- Lid/periorbital swelling - this may be unilateral or bilateral and be associated with conjunctival chemosis or orbital cellulitis.

- Diplopia - the restriction of the extraocular muscles causes this. They may be the source of inflammation (myositis), or a growing tumor may compress them.

- Red-eye - conjunctival hyperemia increases with exophthalmos as a result of dilatation. In severe cases, there may be a secondary exposure keratopathy as a result of incomplete lid closure over the cornea.

- Ophthalmoplegia - typically in infectious conditions, inflammatory processes, or aggressive tumors.

- Reduced visual acuity

A thorough history will help establish the underlying cause. Symptoms such as heat intolerance, weight loss, change in bowel habits, and palpitations may support a diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis. There may be a history of trauma or constitutional symptoms such as weight loss that may suggest cystic or tumoral growth. The rate of onset may provide insight into its etiology. Rapid onset may suggest inflammatory disease, malignant tumors, and carotid-cavernous fistula, while gradual onset implies somewhat benign pathology. The presence of pain may commonly indicate infection (e.g., orbital cellulitis).

The examination should include a general examination of the patient to identify any systemic disease such as Graves' disease, leukemia, visceral neoplasm, or constitutional signs that may give rise to suspicion of malignancy. Clinicians must undertake a full eye examination, assessing a patient's extraocular movements, visual acuity, field assessment, pupil accommodation, and reflexes. Intraocular pressures, anterior segment, and fundoscopy should be performed.

Exophthalmos may be seen on examination and quantified using an exophthalmometer, whereby the extent is measured by the distance from the corneal apex to the midpoint of the anterior rim of the orbit.
