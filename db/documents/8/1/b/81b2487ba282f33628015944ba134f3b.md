Left heart failure can be complicated with severe volume overload leading to respiratory distress and anasarca as well as arrhythmias (tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias), cardiogenic shock due to pump failure and death. It was also reported that pulmonary embolism, acute coronary syndrome, cerebrovascular accidents and rupture of the myocardium are common causes of sudden death in patients with heart failure.
