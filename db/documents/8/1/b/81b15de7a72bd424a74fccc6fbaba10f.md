The etiology determines the management of these patients. The treatment goal is to relieve symptoms and prevent associated morbidity. According to the literature, asymptomatic patients are left alone except for patients with Parkinson disease. These patients should be screened as they have associated impairments in their quality of life and a higher risk of falls. Patients with a medication-related disease need to remove the offending agent and optimize the patient's medication regimen. Many patients require a multidisciplinary approach to address underlying diabetes, hypertension, Parkinson's disease, and other comorbidities. Patients that are suffering from dehydration require timely volume resuscitation.

Patients with neurogenic etiology should be counseled on lower extremity stockings, abdominal binders, adequate hydration, salt intake, and fall prevention. Nonpharmacologic measures are generally sufficient.

Some causes of orthostatic hypotension are permanent, such as Parkinson disease, while others are transient, such as anemia which can be corrected. Providers should address reversible causes, such as infection, drugs, dehydration, and anemia. Consider stopping or altering the dose of the offending medication or switching to a modified-release preparation.

**Conservative Measures to Improve Symptoms**

Providers should educate patients on what orthostatic hypotension is, what causes it, and what makes it worse. Symptoms may worsen with prolonged standing, eating large meals, dehydration, drinking alcohol, a hot environment, straining, and taking hot baths or showers.

**Non-pharmacological Treatments for Postural Hypotension**

- Change position gradually and in phases (from lying to sitting to standing) instead of swiftly.

- Maintain adequate hydration

- Avoid alcohol, warm environments, large meals, and hot showers or baths.

- Sleep with the head of the bed elevated

- Exercise programs

- Cross the legs while standing

- Tense the muscles in the legs and hips after standing

- Lower limb compression

- Abdominal binders

**Pharmacological Treatment**

Pharmacologic treatment should be implemented after a nonpharmacologic intervention has failed to relieve symptoms. According to the literature, fludrocortisone and midodrine remain first-line medications, but many other pharmacologic therapies can be used, including pyridostigmine. Fludrocortisone is an aldosterone analog; midodrine is an alpha-1 agonist, and pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. All of these medications work through different mechanisms to increase vascular tone. In a recent study, midodrine was shown to be more efficacious than pyridostigmine concerning symptomatic relief.
