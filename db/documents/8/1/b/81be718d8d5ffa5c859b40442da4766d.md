Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) happens at a younger age and involves the sacroiliac joints in an HLA-B27-positive male patient. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cases usually involve middle-aged females with symmetrical small hand and wrist joint involvement. Tests for ESR, CRP, rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP antibody, HLAB27, HLA-DR2, and HLA-DR4 are all helpful in diagnosis. The first of these are nonspecific.

Plain x-rays show sacroiliitis in axial AS and most patients with non-axial AS. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows bone edema and more subtle changes of inflammation.

AS and RF can co-exist, however, some studies have indicated that there is no erosion polyarthritis among AS patients who have a positive rheumatoid factor test.
