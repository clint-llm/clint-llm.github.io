Non-dihydropyridines are contraindicated in those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, second or third-degree AV blockade, and sick sinus syndrome because of the possibility of causing bradycardia and worsening cardiac output.

Calcium channel antagonists are also contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or its components. Other contraindications include sick sinus syndrome (except in patients with an artificial pacemaker), severe hypotension, acute myocardial infarction, and pulmonary congestion. Calcium channel antagonists may cause AV blockade or sinus bradycardia, especially if taken with agents known to slow cardiac conduction. There are reports of dermatologic reactions and hypotension with or without syncope with calcium channel antagonist use. Peripheral edema may occur within 2 to 3 weeks of initiating calcium channel blocker therapy. Use with caution in renal and hepatic impairment. Consider starting treatment at a lowerÂ dose.
