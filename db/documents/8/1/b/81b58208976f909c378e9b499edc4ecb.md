Millard-Gubler syndrome (MGS), also known as facial abducens hemiplegia syndrome or ventral pontine syndrome, is one of the classical crossed brainstem syndromes characterized by a unilateral lesion of the basal portion of the caudal pons involving fascicles of abducens (VI) and the facial (VII) cranial nerves and the pyramidal tract fibers. The diagnosis of Millard-Gubler syndrome is confirmed by clinical examination of cranial nerves VI and VIII along with hemiplegia of upper and lower extremities. This activity describes the etiology, presentation and diagnosis of Millard-Gubler syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of Millard-Gubler syndrome. 
- Summarize the presentation of a patient with Millard-Gubler syndrome.
- Review the treatment options for Millard-Gubler syndrome.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to optimize outcomes for patients affected by Millard-Gubler syndrome.
