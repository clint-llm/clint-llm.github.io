The key to phenytoin toxicity is prevention, which is best done by an interprofessional team. Both the nurse and pharmacist should educate the patient on the dangers of a drug overdose and the importance of not changing the dose. Those who intentionally ingest phenytoin for self-harm need a mental health consult prior to discharge. If the older patient has difficulty reading the label on the vial or not capable of maintaining good hydration while on phenytoin, social work should be involved. In addition, the pharmacist should ensure that there is no polypharmacy and the risk of drug interactions is minimal.

**Outcomes**

Data show that death is rare with phenytoin toxicity as long as the patient receives prompt treatment. However, at least 50% will suffer from minor morbidity, and another about 10-20% will have major morbidity (memory loss, confusion, cognitive deficits).Â  Death can occur when phenytoin is ingested with other medications, but fortunately, they are also rare. When ingested by pregnant women, a range of vascular and skeletal anomalies have been reported. The highest risk for phenytoin toxicity is in infants and the elderly because of decreased protein binding and impaired metabolism of the drug.
