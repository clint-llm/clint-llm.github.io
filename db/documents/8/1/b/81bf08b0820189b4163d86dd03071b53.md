The differential diagnosis of a cortical, lytic, expansile lesion can be extensive. In addition to OFD and AD, differential diagnoses include:

- Fibrous dysplasia

- Unicameral bone cyst

- Osteomyelitis

- Nonossifying fibroma

- Aneurysmal bone cyst

- Chondromyxoid fibroma

- Langerhans cell histiocytosis (i.e., eosinophilic granuloma)

- Osteosarcoma

- Chondrosarcoma

- Hemangioendothelioma

- Angiosarcoma

- Metastatic carcinoma

Clinical information, including patient age and history, as well as the location of the lesion in the tibial diaphysis, may help to narrow the differential.
