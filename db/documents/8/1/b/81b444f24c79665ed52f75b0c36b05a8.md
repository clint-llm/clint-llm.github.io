The differential diagnosis for AR includes other forms of rhinitis that are not allergic. Children, particularly those under the age of 2 years, should also be assessed for congenital causes of nasal obstruction, such as choanal atresia and immunodeficiencies.

- Vasomotor rhinitis - noninflammatory rhinitis that can be triggered by a change in temperature, odors, or humidity

- Infectious rhinitis - viral or bacterial infections, most commonly seen in the pediatric population

- Cerebrospinal fluid leak - clear rhinitis refractory to treatment

- Non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES) - infiltration of eosinophils in nasal tissue without allergic sensitization

- Chemical rhinitis - exposure to chemicals through occupation, household chemicals, sport/leisure exposure

- Rhinitis of pregnancy and hormonally-induced rhinitis

- Drug-induced rhinitis - e.g., NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, nasal decongestants, cocaine

- Autoimmune, granulomatous, and vasculitic rhinitis - Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, sarcoidosis, etc.

- Nasal polyposis

- Nasopharyngeal neoplasm

- Sickle cell anemia - in a young child presenting with nasal polyposis and well-controlled asthma, sweat chloride testing is the appropriate next step in management to rule out cystic fibrosis.
