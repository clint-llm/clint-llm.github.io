The best therapy for iatrogenic Cushing syndrome is to taper exogenous steroids. Chronic exposure to steroids can suppress the adrenals functioning and it can take several months for normal adrenal functioning to recover.  Therefore, steroids should be slowly tapered allowing adrenal functioning to recover. Hypercortisolism due to Cushing disease or adrenal tumor or ectopic tumor is best treated with surgical resection.

Radiotherapy is recommended in Cushing disease after failed transsphenoidal surgery or in Cushing disease with mass effect or invasion of surrounding structures.



In the management of Cushing syndrome, it is crucial to treat comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoporosis, psychiatric issues, and electrolyte disorders.

Cushing syndrome due to an ACTH tumor that cannot be resected entirely may require bilateral adrenalectomy followed by lifelong adrenal glucocorticoid replacement (e.g. hydrocortisone) and mineralocorticoid (fludrocortisone).
