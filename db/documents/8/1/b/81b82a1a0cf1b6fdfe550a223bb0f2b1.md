Patients with amyloidosis may present with primary cardiac symptoms, or cardiac amyloidosis may be diagnosed incidentally in patients undergoing evaluation for other systemic involvements.

Primary cardiac manifestations can be dyspnea on exertion, palpitations, chest pain, presyncope, and syncope. The patient may have florid heart failure symptoms such as dyspnea at rest, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, lower limb swelling, and abdominal distension due to ascites.

Patients can also have symptoms of other systemic involvement such as dyspepsia, nausea, constipation, early satiety from gastrointestinal involvement, tongue enlargement, bilateral periorbital discoloration, or symptoms of any neuropathy such as carpal tunnel syndrome or erectile dysfunction.

On physical examination, the patient may have periorbital purpura, pedal edema, raised jugular venous pressure (JVP), ascites, fine lung crackles, macroglossia, neuropathy, orthostatic hypotension, hepatomegaly, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The periorbital purpura and macroglossia are pathognomic for cardiac amyloidosis.
