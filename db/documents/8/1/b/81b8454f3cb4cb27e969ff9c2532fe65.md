Peripheral neuropathy (PN) encompasses a broad range of clinical pathologies potentially presenting with peripheral nervous system dysfunction. Patients with PN often present with varying degrees of numbness, tingling, and/or burning in the extremities. While metabolic disorders represent the predominant etiology of extremity pain caused by an underlying PN clinical pathology, broad clinical consideration is given to many clinical conditions. Although there are many possible causes of peripheral neuropathy, the most prevalent subtype, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, can lead to significant complications. The exact cause of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is not known. Mechanical compression (e.g., carpal tunnel), genetics, and social and lifestyle factors such as chronic alcohol consumption and smoking have been implicated. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of diabetic neuropathy and the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathy.
- Summarize the treatment of diabetic neuropathy.
- Describe the potential complications of diabetic neuropathy.
- Outline the management of diabetic neuropathy and the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.
