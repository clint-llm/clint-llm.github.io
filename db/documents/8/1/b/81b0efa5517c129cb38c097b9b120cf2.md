Patient education should be centered around the avoidance of overcrowding and poor hygiene. Hand-eye contact should be kept to a bare minimum. Frequently scratching the eyes should be avoided. Practicing good hygiene, particularly regularly washing hands, should be encouraged. Infected people should immediately be quarantined from the rest of the members of the family and also friends and associates. Once the diagnosis has been made, a proper understanding of the disease nature, its means of spread, and the preventive measures should be given to the patient. Patients should also be warned regarding the possible complications owing to non-compliance to treatment or treatment failure.
