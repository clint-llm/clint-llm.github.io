Lisfranc injuries can be managed operatively or non-operatively depending on the clinical presentation. Initial treatment includes reduction, splitting, and aggressive elevation. Non-operative treatment is only reserved for anatomically stable and non-displaced injuries. In this case, the patient is immediately made non-weight bearing and put in a cast or boot. Repeat evaluation and radiographs should be performed after two weeks to rule out any diastasis that might convert the patient into surgical management. After at least six weeks if the patient is completely non-tender and radiographs are again negative, then there can be a consideration to begin weight-bearing and a rehabilitation program. If there is any tenderness but still no displacement then the patient should be in a boot or cast again for at least another four weeks before starting rehabilitation. Any diastasis or displacement requires surgical fixation. The patient should be non-weight bearing after surgery for six to eight weeks. At that time re-evaluation is performed and a walking boot or cast can be considered as clinical presentation indicates. This cast or boot is then usually worn for another six weeks. At that time, again as clinical presentation dictates, a progressive functional rehabilitation program can be started.
