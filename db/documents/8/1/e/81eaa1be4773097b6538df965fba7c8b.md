Intramedullary spinal cord tumors are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes and neurosurgeon and neuro-critical care nurses experienced in monitoring these patients. Surgical resection should be performed as soon as possible following a diagnosis of IMSCT, as outcomes correlate with the preoperative neurologic conditions, and observation can lead to further neurologic deficits, some of which are irreversible. The goals of surgical resection are to obtain tissue diagnosis, maximize tumor resection, and improve neurologic functions. When surgeons cannot completely excise the lesion, adjuvant therapy may be tried.
