Here are the management considerations for TORCH infections:

- There are no programs on a large scale that offer both maternal or neonatal screening to identify infection in mothers and infants. No vaccines are present to prevent infection, and no efficacious and safe therapies are available for the treatment of maternal or fetal CMV infection.

- For toxoplasmosis, observational studies have demonstrated an effective reduction in transplacental transmission and/or severity of clinical manifestations in symptomatic infants. The two regimens often used are spiramycin (fetal prophylaxis preventing intrauterine infection) and combined pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine/ folinic acid (treatment of evolving fetal infection).

- Congenital rubella, once developed, cannot be treated. But it is the most common vaccine-preventable neonatal disease. A single dose of rubella vaccine to mother can produce life long immunity.

- Patients with neonatal HSV should be treated aggressively. Clinical trials have demonstrated that high-dose intravenous acyclovir (60 mg/kg/day intravenously divided three times daily) for acute therapy. The length of this therapy varies from fourteen to twenty-one days depending on the severity of disease (10 for SEM/21 for disseminated and CNS) followed by long-term oral acyclovir suppressive therapy (300 mg/m/dose, given orally three times daily for six months is best for the management of neonatal herpes infection. This work has dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality from neonatal HSV.

- Patients with symptomatic cytomegalovirus infections should be treated with ganciclovir and valganciclovir. The primary reason for this therapy is to preserve hearing. Neonates with symptomatic congenital CMV disease with or without central nervous system (CNS) involvement show better outcomes at two years when treated with oral valganciclovir (16 mg/kg/dose, administered orally twice daily) for six months. Dosing should be adjusted as the infant grows.

- The treatment of HIV to prevent mother-to-child transmission depends on whether the mother was treated with viral suppression during the pregnancy. Therapy for children born to well-controlled mothers should include the treatment of the infant with zidovudine (4 mg/kg, twice daily) for the first 4 to 6 weeks of life for term children. Multiple drug regimens are recommended for children whose mother was not on antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy.

- Syphilis must be diagnosed and treated immediately. Expectant mothers should be tested during pregnancy and, if positive, treated.
