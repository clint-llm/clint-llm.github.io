Mucoepidermoid carcinomas are ideally managed by an interprofessional team that consists of a pulmonologist, radiologist, thoracic surgeon, oncologist, and pathologist. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment improve the prognosis for most patients. Oncology nurse practitioners are involved in the care of patients, providing patient care, monitoring response to therapy, and providing feedback to the team.
