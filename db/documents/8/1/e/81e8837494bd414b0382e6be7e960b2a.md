Refractory hypoxemia can occur in a small subset of patients with acute respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most common cause of refractory hypoxemia in patients with acute respiratory failure. Unmanageable refractory hypoxemia remains a most feared condition encountered by intensive care physicians since many of the ventilatory strategies proposed for the treatment of this condition can improve oxygenation but without a mortality benefit. There is no standard definition of refractory hypoxemia, and this term usually considered when there is inadequate arterial oxygenation despite optimal levels of inspired oxygen. There is significant heterogeneity in opinions among intensivists regarding the definition, as demonstrated by a recent survey.

Some of the definitions described in the literature include partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) ≤60 mmHg or a PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤100 on the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.8-1.0 with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of >15 cm H2O or with plateau pressures >30 cm H2O for more than 12 hours despite lung-protective low tidal volumes of 4-6 mL/kg.
