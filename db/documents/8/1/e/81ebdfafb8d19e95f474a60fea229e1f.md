The strength and mobility of the tongue during protrusion is testable by using a tongue depressor. The tongue depressor is held vertically in front of the patientsâ€™ lips, and he/she is then asked to push the tongue against the depressor. Lateral movements of the tongue are also assessable by having the patient push the tongue against the depressor positioned to the right and left of the lips. The rating can be a mild, moderate, or severe weakness.
