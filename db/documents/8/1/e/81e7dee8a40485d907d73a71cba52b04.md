The heart is a four-chamber blood-pumping organ in the chest cavity. Blood flows from one chamber to another through valves. The following are the four valve classifications:

- Tricuspid valve: present between the right atrium and ventricle

- Pulmonary valve: present between theÂ right ventricle and pulmonary article

- Mitral valve: a bicuspid valve present between the left atrium and ventricle

- Aortic valve: present between the left ventricle and ascending aorta

With the ongoing age, any inflammation or infection of the valve or a congenital heart defect causes the leaflets of valves to become stiff and calcified hence causing hindrance in the flow of blood from one chamber to another.
