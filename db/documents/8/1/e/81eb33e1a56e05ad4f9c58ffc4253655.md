A delay in conduction between the atria and ventricles results in an atrioventricular conduction block. This is indicated by a prolongation of the PR interval on electrocardiogram. Conduction blocks are classified as either first-degree, second-degree, or third-degree blocks. There are two types of second-degree atrioventricular blocks: Mobitz type I, also known as Wenckebach and Mobitz type II. This activity examines when this condition should be considered on differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate for it. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of second-degree atrioventricular blocks. 
- Explain how to identify each type of second-degree atrioventricular blocks on electrocardiogram. 
- Explain the management of second-degree atrioventricular blocks. 
- Explain the need for a well-integrated, interprofessional team approach to improve care for patients with second-degree atrioventricular blocks.
