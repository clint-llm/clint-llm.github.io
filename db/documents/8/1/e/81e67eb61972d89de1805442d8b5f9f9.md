In addition to a detailed history and physical, the evaluation of the patients suspected to have a PCNSL should include the following:

- Imaging of the CNS, ideally with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and gadolinium contrast.

- CSF analysis

- An eye exam with a slit lamp

- Testicular exam and ultrasound in male patients.

In immunocompetent patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL, >60 percent of the patients have solitary lesions, and about 35 percent have multifocal lesions. Cerebral hemispheric involvement is the most common, followed by the thalamus, basal ganglia, corpus callosum, and cerebellum.

Computed tomography (CT) of the head with contrast is an alternative in patients who have MRI contraindications. The definitive diagnosis requires a pathologic confirmation with a biopsy. The most commonly used biopsy procedure is the use of stereotactic brain biopsy; rarely, some patients have a partial or total resection. The morbidity related to the stereotactic biopsy is very low and permits rapid detection. The safety of CSF analysis should be considered in patients suspected of having increased intracranial pressure. CSF analysis should include cell count, protein levels, glucose levels along with cytology, and flow cytometry analysis. Along with the slit lamp examination of the eyes, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be obtained for documentation of any other organ involvement or lymphadenopathy. A bone marrow biopsy is also recommended to complete a full staging workup. These systemic staging procedures are important as about 10 percent of patients who are presumed to have PCNSL, have an extra CNS involvement.

Blood work with screening HIV, hepatitis B, and C serology, lactate dehydrogenase, comprehensive metabolic panel, liver function tests, and complete blood counts are recommended.
