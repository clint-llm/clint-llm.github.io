Hepatic adenomas are typically solitary tumors with monoclonal cell lines. In appearance, they are light brown to yellow, soft and sharply circumscribed, but do not have a true capsule enclosing them. They have a "pseudo-capsule" formed by sheets of hepatocytes comprising the outer boundaries. These hepatocytes are compressed by surrounding otherwise normal liver tissue. The tumor is well-vascularized with small thin-walled arterioles. The tumor has no biliary ducts, which distinguishes it from the normal liver tissue in the vicinity.

Genetic mutations and our understanding of them have begun to provide new insight into these tumors' behavior. However, the traditional knowledge based on the link between sex hormones, particularly oral contraceptive pills and anabolic steroids, seems to provide the strongest insight into the etiology of the development of hepatic adenomas. Other drugs have been implicated in the development of hepatic adenomas. Understandably, clomiphene and recombinant human growth hormones play a prominent role. Barbiturates are also linked to the development of these tumors.
