DTs are primarily treated through surgery, however, RT and medical therapy have a role to play as well.

Surgical Treatment: The approach to DT is primarily surgical. The goal of surgery is to preserve the limb function and critical structures. Unlike other soft-tissue sarcomas where the goal of surgical resection is to achieve a microscopic negative margins (R0 resection), an R0 resection is only deemed 'desirable', but not a necessity in the surgery of a DT. The significance of a positive margin (R1 or R2 resection) is highly debated. Positive margins after surgery have been reported as an independent prognostic factor in determining the risk of recurrence, however, guidelines clearly prohibit a morbid surgery in an attempt to achieve an R0 resection. In combination with RT and medical therapy, the surgical treatment of DT has become more and more conservative.

Radiation therapy: RT is primarily used in the adjuvant setting when surgery leaves behind a positive margin, or when surgical resection is not possible. A dose of more than 56 Gy is associated with many complications and hence avoided. Non-randomized and retrospective data have shown a lower local recurrence rate with the addition of adjuvant RT in patients with a positive margin. The role of neoadjuvant RT is not established and currently not recommended.

Systemic Therapy: Systemic therapy is usually reserved for patients who experience rapid growth of DT or for those patients in whom the tumor is threatening a critical structure or the surgery would be extremely mutilating.

- Chemotherapy: DT is not a very chemosensitive tumor, however, few regimens may benefit patients.

- Doxorubicin based regimens have had the best success rates. The combination of doxorubicin and dacarbazine has been shown to induce a partial response. Typically the response in the tumor is slow and may occur for months after chemotherapy has been stopped. In patients with DT associated with FAP, the addition of NSAID (like meloxicam) has been found to be beneficial. Liposomal doxorubicin is also an effective drug inducing long-lasting responses in many patients. 
- Vinca alkaloids with methotrexate (MTX): In the pediatric population, the combination of vinblastine and MTX has been found beneficial; however, this combination is very toxic for adults. Hence, in adults, vinblastine is substituted for vinorelbine and is given along with MTX.

- Targeted therapy:

- Imatinib (800mg PO daily) has been successfully used in patients with DT. However, no definite mechanism or pathway of action is known. Even those patients without any mutation in the KIT, PDGRA, or PDGFRB regions showed a response. 
- Sorafenib is the other drug that has shown some benefit.

- Hormonal therapy: Considering the fact that DT can occur around the time of pregnancy, hormonal therapy like Tamoxifen has been explored and found to be useful. A higher dose of tamoxifen (120-200 mg/day, the conventional dose is 40mg/day) is advocated, however, no controlled studies exist.

- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: Since COX-2 pathways are involved in the growth of DT, COX-2 inhibitors like indomethacin, sulindac, and meloxicam have been proven to induce remission in patients with Dt.
