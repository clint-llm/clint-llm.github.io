- Partial or dorsal agenesis of the pancreas is often asymptomatic. It is sometimes associated with diabetes, polysplenia, malabsorption syndrome, or recurrent pancreatitis.

- Ectopic pancreatic tissue is present in the stomach (most common) or small intestine. This is seen in about 3% to 5% of the general population and is usually an incidental finding on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy or a barium contrast study. Their umbilicated appearance typically identifies them, and they are most commonly clinically insignificant. Very rarely, a pancreatic rest in the small intestine may be the lead point of intussusception or may cause bowel obstruction.

- Pancreas divisum is the most common developmental anomaly of the pancreas

- Pancreatic dysgenesis/dysfunction is a component of certain syndromic associations, including Johanson-Blizzard and Schwachmann-Diamond syndromes.
