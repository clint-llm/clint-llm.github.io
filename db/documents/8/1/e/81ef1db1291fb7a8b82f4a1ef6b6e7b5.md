Solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura may resemble other entities on imaging and histology. Tumors originating in an interlobar fissure may be hard to differentiate from an intraparenchymal mass. Rarely, a solitary fibrous tumor arising from the parietal pleura may appear inverted and resemble an intrapulmonary lesion.

Clinically, solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura may be mistaken for any of the following based on radiographic and histologic appearance:

- Pleural lipoma

- Posttraumatic thoracic splenosis

- Extrapleural hematoma

- Loculated pleural effusions

- Schwannoma

- Sarcomatoid mesothelioma

- Lymphoma

- Organized inflammation

- Solitary pleural metastasis

- Peripheral lung malignancy

Additional tests such as immunohistochemistry can help differentiate these entities from solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura.
