One pathophysiological reason for the occurrence of PVCs is ectopic nodal automaticity. This suggests that ectopic pacemaker cells carry a subthreshold potential for firing. If the threshold is reached via the heart's electrical activity, an ectopic beat occurs.

A second pathophysiologic explanation is re-entrant signaling. If one pathway of the Purkinje fibers is blocked and another path is experiencing slower conduction, this can trigger an ectopic beat on the post-block pathway.

The final explanation for PVCs is that triggered beats occur due to after-depolarizations.

On the molecular level, there are a few changes that create an environment for spontaneous depolarization of the ventricular myocytes. These include hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, excess calcium, and excess catecholamines.

In some cases, the triggered beat may occur in patients with digoxin toxicity and following reperfusion after an MI.
