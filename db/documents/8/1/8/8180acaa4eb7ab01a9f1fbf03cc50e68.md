DEFEAT Mucor was a small randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled study where 20 patients with proven or probable mucormycosis were randomlyÂ given IV liposomal amphotericin alone or liposomal amphotericin plus deferasirox for the first 2 weeks of therapy. The 90-day mortality was found to be significantly higher in the deferasirox group (82% versus 22%). Adverse events were similar in both groups. It is difficult to make strong conclusions given the population imbalances in this small phase II trial. The patients who received deferasirox were having hematologic cancers, neutropenia, or/and pulmonary involvement where the expected mortality is significantly high.
