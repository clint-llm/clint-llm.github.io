Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) occurs more commonly in premature infants within the first few weeks of birth. Premature infants that develop PIE within 48 hours of life usually have a grave prognosis. These infants may have associated low birth weight, premature birth, perinatal asphyxia, and sepsis.

The prevalence of the pathology depends on which population is studied, whether it is patients with low birth rates versus respiratory distress syndrome versus other etiologies. In one study, infants with respiratory distress syndrome born prematurely at less than 30 weeks, PIE occurred in 3% of neonates treated early with the surfactant, 8% of neonates treated with surfactant late, and 25% of neonates that served as control.

A different study that compared surfactant administration as prophylaxis versus early treatment in premature infants showed that there was a higher incidence of PIE in premature infants and those treated with surfactant late.

Premature infants weighing less than 1000g at birth showed the highest frequencies of developing PIE. Infants that weighted 500 to 799g had an incidence of 42% of PIE, infants weighing 800 to 899g had an incidence of 29%, and infants weighing 900 to 999g had an incidence of 20%.
