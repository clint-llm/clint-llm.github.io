Whenever a transfusion hemolytic reaction is suspected, immediately stop transfusion. Check labels on theÂ patient, blood components, and paper work to rule our clerical error, since this is the most common cause. Also check signs of machine/mechanical error like intravenous needle gauge size, any other fluids given to patient and temperature of blood to rule out non-immune causes of hemolysis. Repeat ABO testing on the post-transfusion patient sample. Repeat crossmatch with pre-and post-transfusion specimens using an indirect antiglobulin testing and do direct antiglobulin (Coombs) testing. Order a peripheral smear to look for signs of hemolysis. Trend complete blood counts to monitor the severity of hemolysis. Trend other hemolysis labs like bilirubin, haptoglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase. Coagulation studies to monitor for disseminated intravascular coagulation. Urinalysis and microscopy to monitor for hemoglobinuria. Basic metabolic panel to monitor for signs of renal failure. If ABO incompatibility is negative, then test for other antibodies.
