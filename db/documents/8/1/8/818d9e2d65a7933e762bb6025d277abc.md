Otosclerosis, also called otospongiosis, is an abnormal bone remodeling in the middle ear in which a normal dense endochondral layer of bony otic capsule in the bony labyrinth is replaced by one or more foci of irregularly laid spongy bone and most commonly involves the stapes region. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of otosclerosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of otosclerosis.
- Describe the appropriate history, physical examination, and evaluation of otosclerosis.
- List the management options available for otosclerosis.
- Review some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance otosclerosis and improve outcomes.
