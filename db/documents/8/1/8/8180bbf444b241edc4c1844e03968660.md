Obstetric vulvar hematoma is a concern for the obstetrician, but non-obstetric vulvar hematoma may present to the emergency clinician and primary clinicians. In the case of a small vulvar hematoma, expectant management is appropriate. Although the gynecologist is the primary clinician involved in the care of patients with a vulvar hematoma, if surgery or selective arterial embolization is necessary, an interprofessional team consisting of gynecologists, interventional radiologists, and vascular surgeons may be required. Therefore, it is important for healthcare workers in these fields to be familiar with the recognition and management of vulvar hematoma and to work together so as to provide optimal care for these patients, improve patient outcomes and reduce morbidity.
