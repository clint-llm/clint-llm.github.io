Calcitonin gene-related peptide is a 37-amino acid neuropeptide and a potent vasodilator produced by neurons in both the central and peripheral nervous systems.

In the central nervous system, researchers observed that a raised level of blood and salivary levels of CGRP occur in patients with headache disorders such as migraines and cluster headaches and neuralgias such as trigeminal neuralgia, chronic paroxysmal hemicranias, and even rhinosinusitis. Levels are elevated during a migraine attack and between migraine attacks in patients with chronic migraines. Also, CGRP from exogenous infusions was shown to trigger migraine attacks.

Migraine is a neurovascular disorder characterized by unilateral, throbbing/pounding headache accompanied by photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, vomiting, and disability and usually has a duration of around 4 to 72 hours.

Currently, FDA-approved drugs acting on the CGRP, or its receptor, are those used in the treatment or prophylaxis of migraine. This group includes monoclonal antibodies (erenumab, eptinezumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab) against the CGRP receptor and CGRP receptor antagonists (rimegepant and ubrogepant). In addition, Atogepant and vazegepant are other receptor antagonists undergoing clinical trials and are yet to receive FDA approval.

The monoclonal antibodies (erenumab, eptinezumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab) are used for migraine prophylaxis in episodic and chronic migraine. Rimegepant and ubrogepant are used for acute treatment of migraine with or without aura. galcanezumab and fremanezumab are under development for the preventive treatment of cluster headaches.

CGRP was also shown to have cardio-protective action in pathological conditions, as demonstrated in rodent models of different cardiovascular diseases. Studies in humans have also demonstrated that CGRP decreases afterload and increases inotropy, cardioprotective in heart failure. However, there are no drugs developed to date that take advantage of this effect on the cardiovascular system.

Similarly, newer studies find that CGRP is also involved in several other physiological/pathological phenomenon such as peripheral nerve regeneration, Alzheimer's disease, vascular tone of mesenteric arteries, and pregnancy. However, no drugs have been developed which take advantage of these effects of CGRP.
