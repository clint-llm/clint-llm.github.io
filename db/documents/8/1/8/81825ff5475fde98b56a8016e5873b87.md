It is estimated that twin births account for about 2% to 4% of births worldwide.

Of twin gestations, an estimated 67% are dizygotic, and 33% are monozygotic. Among monozygotic twins, approximately 75% are MCDA. Twin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome occurs at a rate of about 8-10% of MCDA twin gestations, about 6% of MCMA twin gestations, and it is estimated that 1Â to 3 per 10,000 births are affected by TTTS.

As there is a possibility of monozygotic twinning with in vitro fertilization, TTTS can also occur in such pregnancies. There is little data regarding the prevalence of each stage of TTTS. Based upon data from referral centers, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) estimates a prevalence of Stage I: 11% to 15%, Stage II: 20% to 40%, Stage III: 38% to 60%, Stage IV: 6% to 7%, and Stage V: 2%.
