Major thoracic surgery involves interprofessional and multidisciplinary teams for the perioperative and postoperative management of pain. The TPVB should be performed by an anesthesiologist specialized in regional anesthesia with the assistance of a qualified nurse. Communication in this context is essential to provide optimal patient care. A thorough checklist of the patient's medical history is mandatory. Time-out should be performed by confirming patient identification, the surgical procedure to be performed, and the surgical site marked before starting the procedure.

The medical and surgical team involved must manage any complications that may arise during these procedures and help in an emergency.

A nursing and medical team capable of managing pain and establishing optimal pain control strategies is essential for the patient's post-operative recovery.
