Deep brain stimulation is an emerging novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Studies have demonstrated that the deep brain stimulation of the internal capsule/striatum improves the function of the PFC. As a result, deep brain stimulation can be useful in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depression and obsessive-compulsive disorders. The knowledge of the differences in the surface anatomy of the PFC in some genetic conditions is useful when considering surgical intervention. Since the PFC is bounded by different areas that can be tested and mapped, knowledge of this association cortex is important during surgeries to localize defects.
