Lipoprotein lipase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder of lipid metabolism. It is characterized by severe hypertriglyceridemia and chylomicronemia. Early diagnosis and early dietary modification help the prevention of symptoms and medical complications to manifest. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of lipoprotein lipase deficiency and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of lipoprotein lipase enzyme deficiency.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of lipoprotein lipase enzyme deficiency.
- Outline the management options available for lipoprotein lipase enzyme deficiency.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care and improve outcomes for patients affected by lipoprotein lipase deficiency.
