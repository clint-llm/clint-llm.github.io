Patients need to understand that the condition may be self-limiting, and agree to undergo an observation period, most commonly six months. If the patient fails to show any improvement, then surgical correction can be offered. Of course, if there is a known underlying condition, it must be addressed first, and patient counsel will primarilyÂ focus on that issue.
