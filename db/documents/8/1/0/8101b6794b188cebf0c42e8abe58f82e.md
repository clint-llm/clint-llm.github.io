Gestational diabetes etiology is apparently related to 1) the pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction or the delayed response of the beta cells to the glycemic levels, and 2) the marked insulin resistance secondary to placental hormonal release. The human placental lactogen is the main hormone related to increased insulin resistance in GDM. Other hormones related to the development of this disease are growth hormone, prolactin, corticotropin-releasing hormone, and progesterone, these hormones contribute to the stimulation of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in the pregnancy.

It has been reported some clinical risk factors for developing gestational diabetes. Those clinical factors include

- Increased body weight (a body mass index greater than 25)

- Decreased physical activity

- A first degree relative with diabetes mellitus

- Prior history of gestational diabetes or a newborn with macrosomia, metabolic comorbidities like hypertension

- Low HDL

- Triglycerides greater than 250

- Polycystic ovarian syndrome

- Hemoglobin A1C greater than 5.7

- Abnormal oral glucose tolerance test

- Any significant marker of insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans)

- Past medical history of cardiovascular diseases
