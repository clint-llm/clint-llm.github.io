# Continuing Education Activity

Vitamin A is a lipid-soluble compound with several biologic actions to aid in vision and cellular differentiation. The prevalence of vitamin A deficiency is rarely seen in the first world, nutrient-rich countries; however, it can affect those with inflammatory bowel disease and post-bariatric surgery. Vitamin A deficiency can lead to ophthalmological, dermatological, and immune impairment. This activity addresses the complications of vitamin A deficiency and how to treat affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the metabolism of Vitamin A in the body.
- Identify common manifestations of Vitamin A deficiency.
- Identify populations at risk for Vitamin A deficiency.

# Introduction

Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin essential in cell development, metabolism, immune competency, vision, and reproductive functions.

The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin A by the Institute of Medicine in healthy adults is 700 micrograms/day for women and 900 micrograms/day for men.

Vitamin A deficiency-associated ocular symptoms have been shown to develop at concentrations less than 10 micrograms/dL.

A 12 to 1 ratio of beta-carotene to retinol absorption in a diet of mixed fruits and vegetables is the estimated conversion used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

# Etiology

In resource-poor regions of the world, insufficient nutrition complicated by chronic inflammation from regular gastrointestinal (GI) infections leads to frequent micronutrient deficiencies and is the most common etiology of vitamin A deficiency worldwide.

Vitamin A concentration in breastmilk varies based on maternal nutrition status. In resource-poor settings, the average breastmilk vitamin A concentration only meets the infant's minimum daily need. This does not allow the build-up of liver reserves, resulting in high levels of vitamin A deficiency shortly after weaning.

In the developed world, pancreatic, liver, and intestinal pathology are the leading causes of VAD. Similar to the frequent GI infections seen in the developing world, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa, and, when combined with decreased oral intake, it can lead to vitamin A deficiency.

Pancreatic insufficiency can result in VAD due to poor exocrine function and insufficient production of the hydrolases required for absorption.

# Epidemiology

Worldwide, most vitamin A deficiency cases occur in children less than 5 years of age in developing countries. Global vitamin A deficiency estimates in young children are decreasing but have been approximated at 30% in children less than 5 years of age and account for about 2% of all deaths in this age group.

In the United States (US) general population, vitamin A deficiency is rare, estimated at 0.3% in 2013. In fact, the prevalence of vitamin A toxicity in the US is much greater than deficiency.

Patients with liver cirrhosis eligible for transplant have a 70% prevalence of vitamin A deficiency, with a positive correlation between the severity of cirrhosis and the prevalence of VAD.

Seventy percent of patients who had a biliopancreatic diversion had developed VAD at 3 years post-procedure.

# Pathophysiology

Vitamin A has a role in the regeneration of visual pigment, maintenance of mucosal membranes, and immune function. Deficiency can lead to night blindness due to poor regeneration of visual pigment in retinal rods. If the deficiency is allowed to persist, the rods will degenerate, and xerophthalmia will develop, leading to true blindness.

# History and Physical

A well-performed history of a patient can raise suspicion for vitamin A deficiency. The presence of a malabsorptive process, such as IBD, chronic GI infection, cirrhosis, pancreatic insufficiency, prematurity, rubeola infection (measles), a history of living in a resource-poor country, or current pregnancy or lactation in the setting of poor nutrition should raise concern for vitamin A deficiency. The natural progression of chronic VAD most commonly presents with the gradual development of night blindness, increased frequency of GI, pulmonary, and urinary infections, and development of xeroderma and phrynoderma (follicular hyperkeratosis often found on extensor surfaces, shoulders, and buttocks).

As the severity of deficiency worsens, signs of xerophthalmia develop with Bitot spots (conjunctival, triangular or oval, foamy lesions) and conjunctival xerosis (appears as conjunctival wrinkling). If VAD continues to persist, its later stages present as corneal xerosis, corneal ulceration, and eventually keratomalacia as the corneal ulcers heal, corneal scarring and blindness results. In the setting of an infection, particularly measles, patients with an acute deficiency may present with corneal xerosis and ulceration without preceding night blindness or Bitot’s spots.

# Evaluation

A clinical diagnosis of vitamin A deficiency can be made in classical exam findings and confirmatory laboratory testing. The presence of xerophthalmia is nearly pathognomonic for vitamin A deficiency.

The provider can order serum retinol testing for patients with a less clear history and physical exam, with deficiency defined as less than 20 micrograms/dL.

Given the risks associated with liver biopsies, they are not routinely used for evaluating vitamin A levels outside of the research setting.

# Treatment / Management

Treatment of vitamin A deficiency is vitamin A supplementation (VAS). A multitude of studies has concluded that VAS in vitamin A deficient populations reduce childhood morbidity and mortality.

In regions with a high prevalence of VAD, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends universal VAS of select populations. They recommend a one-time dose of 100,000 IU in children 6 to 11 months of age followed by doses of 200,000 IU every 4 to 6 months up to 5 years of age.

International guidelines do not clearly outline dosing of VAS for asymptomatic vitamin A deficiency in resource-rich regions. Instead, dosing of VAS is based on the severity of deficiency and provider discretion. The WHO recommends treating xerophthalmia with VAS of 50,000 IU for children less than 6 months of age, 100,000 IU for children 6-12 months of age, and 200,000 IU for children greater than 12 months of age daily for 2 days followed by an additional dose after 2 weeks. For any patient with a severe case of measles, the WHO recommends the aforementioned dosing once daily for 2 days, regardless of whether the patient is known to be vitamin A deficient or not.

In resource-rich countries, post-bariatric patients and neonates have particular dosing recommendations. Post-bariatric surgery patients are recommended to take 10,000 IU VAS daily and adjust as needed based on regular serum retinol level monitoring. Some bariatric patients have been known to need up to 100,000 IU VAS daily.

# Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating vitamin A deficiency, it is important not to overlook other causes of similar signs and symptoms. Night blindness is the first presenting symptom of retinitis pigmentosa and some rare retinal dystrophies.

# Prognosis

The prognosis of vitamin A deficiency depends on the severity of the disease at treatment initiation.

The early ophthalmologic signs, such as night blindness, conjunctival xerosis, and Bitot spots, will resolve completely within about 2 months of supplementation, while corneal xerosis and ulceration results in scarring that may lead to permanent vision loss despite treatment.

Mortality in children with night blindness is triple the mortality found in children with subclinical VAD. Children with both Bitot’s spots and night blindness have mortality nine times that of children with subclinical VAD. Nearly two-thirds of children with keratomalacia die within months.

# Complications

Severe vitamin A deficiency may lead to permanent vision loss or blindness, increased susceptibility to infections, and impaired immune function, leading to high mortality.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

A well-balanced, nutrient-rich diet prevents vitamin A deficiency in generally healthy patients able to absorb nutrition. In resource-rich regions, the majority of the population has access to vegetables, meats, and staple foods that are fortified with vitamin A. In resource-poor countries, large scale vitamin A supplementation programs have been implemented in attempts to provide high dose vitamin A at the WHO-recommended intervals.

Associated programs educate people on nutrition, breastfeeding, and VAD symptoms. These have had variable success depending on the region.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

An interprofessional team greatly contributes to the effective treatment and prevention of vitamin A deficiency. The initial care in resource-rich settings typically falls to the primary care physician, who then coordinates with dietitians and pharmacists to ensure optimal nutrition and medical treatment. Gastroenterologists, bariatric surgeons, and transplant surgeons can help treat malabsorptive patients, post-bariatric surgery patients, and liver cirrhosis patients, respectively. Ophthalmologists are vital in evaluating and treating the multitude of VAD-related eye disorders. After acute evaluation and management of vitamin A deficiency, the primary care physician resumes preventive care.

In regions of the world with limited medical care, public health nurses are vital in providing high-dose VAS to the most rural areas. They are instrumental in making appropriate specialty referrals for those with more severe disease. Governments and international health organizations play huge roles in providing the funds and organization for continued supplementation, education, and fortification programs.
