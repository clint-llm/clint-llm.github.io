In the middle of the spectrum of increasingly invasive pain treatment modalities lies spinal cord stimulation (SCS), also referred to as dorsal column stimulation. More intrusive than percutaneous injection therapy, yet less invasive than back surgery, this technique uses pulsed electrical energy near the spinal cord to manage pain. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, equipment, preparation, technique, and complications for dorsal column stimulation. Ultimately, this activity highlights how the interprofessional team's role can utilize spinal cord stimulation in managing patients with chronic pain.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the relevant indications and contraindications for spinal cord stimulation.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique involved in spinal cord stimulation.
- Outline potential complications associated with spinal cord stimulation.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving the care of chronic pain treatable by spinal cord stimulation to improve patient outcomes.
