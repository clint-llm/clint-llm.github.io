Polymyxins have been in disuse since the 1970s because of their known toxicity, mainly because of their nephrotoxic effects. With the appearance of gram-negative MDR infections, they have been revitalized. However, there are reports of problems with toxicity and increased resistance to these drugs.

Another class of drugs with toxic potential is aminoglycosides which mainly cause ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. These drugs block cationic channels of the ciliated cells in the inner ear. They have the same action as the mechanosensitive transduction channels of these cells; once inside these cells, they promote biochemical changes that culminate in the elevation of intracellular calcium and the formation of reactive species of oxygen (EROS), which irreversibly damage the cell.

Beta-lactams, including penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, as well as beta-lactam plus beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, are frequently associated with drug allergy, but cross-reactivity rates are variable.
