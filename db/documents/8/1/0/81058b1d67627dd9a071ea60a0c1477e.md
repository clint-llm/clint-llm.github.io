The major differential diagnosis in hypochromic microcytic anemia are:

- Alpha thalassemia

- Anemia of chronic disease

- Iron deficiency anemia

- Sideroblastic anemia

- Lead nephropathy

Beta-thalassemia can be differentiated from sideroblastic anemias because thalassemias lack ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow and lack elevation of erythrocyte protoporphyrin. Iron deficiency is easily ruled out with reference range iron studies (serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, percent transferrin saturation). Hemoglobinopathies typically require hemoglobin electrophoresis or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for diagnosis.
