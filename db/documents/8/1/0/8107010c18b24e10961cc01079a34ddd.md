Another issue regarding the use of drug testing in the clinical setting is the attitude of some patients that the results of a drug test may be used in a punitive way. It is important that clinicians are forthcoming about how drug testing is being used.Â Specifically, in the clinical setting, clinicians should make it clear that a drug test will not be used in a punitive fashion and is being used to help improve the care that the patient is receiving.

Another area of concern is the issue of drug testing adolescents. In particular, the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Substance Abuse has made it clear that involuntary drug testing of an adolescent with decisional capacity is inappropriate.
