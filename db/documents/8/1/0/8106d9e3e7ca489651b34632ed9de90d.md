Electroencephalography (EEG) was first used in humans by Hans Berger in 1924. The first report was published in 1929. It is a tracing of voltage fluctuations versus time recorded from multiple electrodes placed over the scalp in a specific pattern to sample different cortical regions. It represents fluctuating dendritic potentials from superficial cortical layers, which are recorded in an organized array pattern and require voltage amplification to be captured. Deep electrical activity of the brain is not well sampled in an EEG using extracranial electrode monitoring.

Abnormal waveforms seen in an EEG recording include epileptiform and non-epileptiform abnormalities. In order to identify abnormal waveforms in EEG, the reader should have a basic understanding of the normal EEG pattern in various physiological states in children and adults. The electroencephalographer is expected to have the significant skills to recognize artifacts, and also an understanding of normal, benign variants. This article reviews the abnormal waveforms in EEG recordings.
