When a snake bite is suspected, it is essential to present to the nearest emergency center for prompt evaluation. There should be no attempt at local wound exploration or irrigation, and a tourniquet should not be applied. It is important to remain calm following the snake bite and to keep the affected extremity still. Although most snake bites, even when from a venomous species, do not lead to systemic toxicity, the systemic effects have significant morbidity and mortality. The emergency medicine team will monitor the snake bite and any progression to systemic toxicity. The decision to administer an antivenom depends on the development of systemic toxicity as there are some side effects of the antivenom itself. Expect to remain in the hospital for up to 48 hours to monitor symptom progression. Those that do well throughout the observation period typically do not have any long-term effects relating to the snake envenomation. Consultation with a regional poison center or medical toxicologist can assist in the decision of whether to administer antivenom, which agent to use, and when if necessary to repeat dosing.
