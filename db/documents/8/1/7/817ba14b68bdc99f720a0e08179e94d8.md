A complete dilated fundus examination including a slit lamp and indirect ophthalmoscopy exam to check for neovascularization should be performed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula can also be used to check for macular edema. Early fundus features of BRVO on ophthalmoscopy include sectorial superficial retinal hemorrhages that rarely cross the horizontal raphe, cotton-wool spots, retinal edema, and dilated and tortuous retinal vein. Late features of BRVO on ophthalmoscopy include all of the signs mentioned above plus hard exudates, microaneurysms, sclerosed veins, telangiectatic vessels, collateral vascular shunt at the optic disc, narrowing and sheathing of the adjacent artery, vitreous hemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment, retinal neovascularization, optic disc neovascularization, and iris neovascularization.

Patients should have their fasting blood sugar, and hemoglobin A1C, lipid profile, complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelets, PT/PTT, and ESR evaluated. It is appropriate to attain an intravenous (IV) fluorescein angiography after hemorrhage has cleared or sooner if neovascularization is suspected.
