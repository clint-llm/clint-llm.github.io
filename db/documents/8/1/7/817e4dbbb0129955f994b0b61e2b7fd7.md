Identifying the etiology of visual impairment affects overall visual prognosis but is most important in systemic disease management and identifying risks to maternal and fetal life. In addition to prompt delivery of the baby, treatment of patients with HELLP syndrome often requires acute blood transfusions and possible liver transplantation; patients with this serious pregnancy complication can be identified by dilated fundus examination.

Management of visual impairment in preeclampsia is achieved by controlling the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the condition – specifically, pharmacologic stabilization of abnormal vital signs and metabolic imbalances, magnesium sulfate administration for seizure prophylaxis, and labor induction or delivery as soon as feasible.
