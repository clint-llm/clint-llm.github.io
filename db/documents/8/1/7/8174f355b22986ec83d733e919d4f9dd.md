SRY gene, found on the Y chromosome, promotes the expression of SOX9, which plays a crucial role in the development of the testes. Under the influence of SRY and SOX9, the genital ridges differentiate into the testes. Testes are composed of transverse cords that contain Sertoli, germ, and peritubular myoid cells. Sertoli cells induce differentiation of Leydig cells via hedgehog signaling. Leydig cells are present in the interstitium, in between the transverse cords. Sertoli cells reinforce their own differentiation via prostaglandin D2 and FGF9 signaling by maintaining SOX9 expression. SOX9 also inhibits FOXL2, which prevents the differentiation of supporting cells into ovarian granulosa cells.
