The evaluation necessary will depend on the individual patient and where they are in their process. It may be appropriate to gather a wide range of laboratory data, radiographic tests and other diagnostic studies for the patient. It may also be appropriate not to order anything at all for a patient if that is in line with their goals for quality of life.
