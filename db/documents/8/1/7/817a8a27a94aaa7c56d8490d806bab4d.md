During deployment of an intracoronary stent, the vessel anatomy in which the stent is deployed is of utmost importance. The stent is sized to the maximal diameter of the distal aspect of the vessel where it will be placed. If the vessel appears significantly calcified, a further assessment with intracoronary imaging with ultrasound or optical coherence tomography may need to be performed to better assess plaque morphology and the possible need to perform rotational, orbital, or laser atherectomy. Another consideration when deploying a stent is possible side-branch impingement and plaque shift during the procedure.
