Neutropenia can be differentiated according to the etiology as either immunoglobulin disorders, complements system disorders, or disorder of neutrophil formation. Primary AIN is seen in the pediatric population with congenital disorders like chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD), and reticular dysgenesis. Secondary AIN is more commonly seen in the adult population with disorders likeÂ systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), etc. with pathogenesis involving antineutrophil antibodies affecting the immune system, which can be ruled out by antibody levels.

Certain immunoglobin disorders involving severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) also present with recurrent bacterial and fungal infections involving mainly GI and respiratory system, which can be ruled out by Ig levels. Some complement system disorders like C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency can also lead to extracellular bacterial infections, which can be ruled out by testing laboratory complement and enzyme levels, and in clinical manifestations, it resembles neutropenia as well.
