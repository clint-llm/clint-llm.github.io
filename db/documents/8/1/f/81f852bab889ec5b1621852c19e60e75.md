Oxygen saturation levels around 96% to 100% are considered normal at sea level. Normal individuals living at higher elevations may have lower oxygen saturation levels. Pulse oximeters are usually calibrated to a range of saturation from 70% to 100% with an accuracy of 2% to 4%, which means that pulse oximeter is reading lower than 70%, may not be accurate compared to the gold standard invasive blood gas measurements. While they may not demonstrate absolute accuracy, they usually still track the oxygen saturation and display lower numbers. There are some technical reasons for the 70% calibration; however, by that time, the patients usually have clinical signs of hypoxemia that would not need invasive clinical confirmation and treatment to reverse that level of hypoxia would not differ from the treatment for a patient with a saturation of 70%. Critical findings that would prompt intervention for most patients would likely be in the mid to high 80% range at sea level as the partial pressure of oxygen would be in the 60 mmHg range. However, the critical numbers that require treatment may be lower at high altitude or in patients with hypoxic heart defects where venous blood get mixed with arterial blood going into the systemic circulation.
