Infection occurs when the host ingests eggs found in stool-contaminated soil. Once in the duodenum, larvae are released and enter the circulation via the enteric mucosa. Once in the capillaries (venous, arterial or lymphatic), it reaches the liver via the portal vein and then the lungs within the first week. In the lung, they damage the alveolar membrane and mature in the alveolus. Eventually, the larvae are expectorated and swallowed, reentering the gastrointestinal tract. Once in the small intestine lumen, the larvae mature into adult worms in about 20 days. When the adult female and male worms are present, they copulate, and the female can produce approximately 200,000 eggs per day. They are later eliminated in the feces of the soil. In the appropriateÂ conditions of a moist, shady, and warm environment, the eggs mature to infective form in two to eight weeks and remain viable for up to 17 months. They can be ingested and restart the infective cycle.
