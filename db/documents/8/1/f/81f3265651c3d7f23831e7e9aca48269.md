Osteoma cutis or cutaneous ossification is a rare and benign dermatological disease characterized by bone formation in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue. The management of osteoma cutis is complex, and new approaches have been introduced. To achieve satisfactory outcomes, the basic and clinical aspects of osteoma cutis must be clearly defined. This activity reviews the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of patients with osteoma cutis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving healthcare outcomes.

**Objectives:**
