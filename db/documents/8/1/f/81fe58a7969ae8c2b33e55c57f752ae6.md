The normal punctum is chronically exposed to irritant substances in the tear film. In most patients with punctal stenosis, there is inflammation caused by blepharitis, chronic exposure (ectropion), or an external irritant (medications).Â Pathophysiological changes involved in punctal stenosis include chronic inflammation (36.7%), leading to fibrosis (23.3%), and squamous metaplasia (10%). Actinomyces israelii canaliculitis is responsible for inflammatory stenosis in 6.7% of cases.
