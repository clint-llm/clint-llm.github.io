Henoch-Schönlein purpura is a vasculitis involving the small vessels of the joints, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and skin. Henoch-Schönlein purpura can also involve the central nervous system (CNS) and the lungs; however, these findings are rare. It is an acute immunoglobulin A (IgA) mediated disorder that is typically self-limited and managed with supportive care; however, serious complications, such as renal failure, may occur as a result of the disorder.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura is named after two German physicians, Dr. Johann Schönlein and his student Eduard Henoch. Schönlein identified the association of joint pain and purpura, and Henoch identified gastrointestinal and renal involvement. Although Henoch-Schönlein purpura is named after Henoch and Schönlein, an English physician named William Heberden was the first to describe the disorder in the early 1800s.
