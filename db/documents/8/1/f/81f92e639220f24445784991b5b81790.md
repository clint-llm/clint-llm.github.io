Pityriasis rotunda affects both genders equally, although certain authors noticed a slight female predominance. The age for the diagnosis ranges from 20 to 45 years, with extremes of 2Â and 87 years. There is a particular racial and geographic distribution for pityriasis rotunda. Most cases are reported in Japan and among West Indian and South African blacks. Case reports of pityriasis rotunda in black Americans are less common, and the frequency of the disease on the North American continent is not known. Cases of pityriasis rotunda among Caucasians are also rare. Mainly, cases are reported in Mediterranean patients, especially from Sardinia, Italy. Familial cases may also be observed and likely have a hereditary determinism which may be an autosomal dominant transmission.
