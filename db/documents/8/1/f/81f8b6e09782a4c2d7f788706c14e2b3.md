Diabetic neuropathy affects many organ systems and is best managed by an interprofessional team. Because there is no cure for the disorder, the key is prevention. All people with diabetes should have a dietary consult and receive education on what foods they should eat and what to avoid. The diet should be realistic and focused on lowering blood glucose levels. The patients should also enter a rehabilitation program or some exercise. Losing weight makes it easier to control blood sugars and lowers blood pressure and lipids. A podiatry consult is vital as protection of the foot is necessary. Further, all people with diabetes should be informed about avoiding trauma and undergoing any invasive procedure on the feet without prior clearance from the endocrinologist. In addition, the patient should be told to avoid cold or hot temperatures.

A dedicated diabetic nurse should educate the patient about all aspects of diabetes and the importance of euglycemia. Patients should be taught how to monitor their blood glucose and how to use portable glucose monitors. The pharmacist should offer education about the medications, their benefits, and their adverse effects.

Compliance with diabetic medications is vital. Finally, patients who develop neuropathy also tend to have nephropathy and retinopathy- hence, all people with diabetes should be referred to a nephrologist and ophthalmologist. There should be open communication between the interprofessional team so that all patients are provided the available standard of care with minimal morbidity. Foot and nail care nurses monitor patients, provide education, and inform the team of the patient's condition. Pharmacists educate patients about the use of medications and the importance of compliance.

**Outcomes**

In general, patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) who are not compliant with treatment or undertreated usually tend to have a poorer outcome than patients who undergo treatment. The neuropathy frequently results in skin breakdown, ulceration, and, eventually, an infection. Amputation of the toes and limbs is not uncommon. However, the actual treatment of diabetic neuropathy is not perfect, and often most treatments do not work. Complete relief from symptoms of neuropathy is rare. Overall, the mortality rates are highest in patients with DM with autonomic neuropathy, especially those who have cardiac dysfunction. The overall mortality rates are 15% to 30% over ten years, but there is also significant morbidity from limb amputation. Other symptoms that make the quality of life poor include syncopal attacks, diarrhea, constipation, and continuous pain.
