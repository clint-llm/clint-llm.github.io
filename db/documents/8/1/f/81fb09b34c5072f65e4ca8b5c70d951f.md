Intrapartum fetal monitoring is commonly performed in labor on the basis that changes in the fetal heart rate pattern may correlate with the fetal oxygenation status, thereby providing additional information to obstetric clinicians who must decide whether or not any intervention is necessary. This activity reviews the methods for fetal monitoring as well as its indications and physiologic basis. It will highlight the role of the interprofessional care team in implementing and interpreting its results.

**Objectives:**
- Review specific fetal heart tracings associated with a certain pathology.
- Describe the fetal heart patterns on the tracing.
- Identify the pathophysiology of fetal heart tracings.
- Summarize how interprofessional can improve diagnostic results when patients require a fetal heart tracing.
