The patient should have the standard blood work (full blood count and renal function tests), to aid resuscitation and assess the kidney function for a potential computed tomography scan with contrast.

A plain abdominal x-ray will show the dilated colon, and a cutoff in the area of obstruction, as well as a paucity of gas in the rectum, or a classical coffee bean sign in the case of a volvulus.

If a colonic malignancy is suspected, a computed tomogram (CT) of thorax, abdomen, and pelvis will stage the disease and allow for further management.

Oral bowel preparation for colonoscopic evaluation is contraindicated in patients with bowel obstruction. If a histological diagnosis is required, the patient can receive a per rectal enema and an attempt to reach the obstructing lesion with minimal air insufflation using a colonoscope.
