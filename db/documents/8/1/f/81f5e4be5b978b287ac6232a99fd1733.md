Ventricle assist devices are designed to supply cardiac output to perfuse vital organs for patients with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 25%. This is achieved by removing preload from the ventricle and ejecting it into the proximal aorta. This can generate up to 8 to 10 L of blood flow to the system. The first generation of LVAD provided pulsatile blood flow to the systemic circulation, whereas second- and third-generation devices provided non-pulsatile and continuous blood flow. This continuous blood flow improves durability, decreases shear stress due to fewer moving parts, and allows for a smaller device with easier placement. The device is implanted in the thoracic cavity with the percutaneous driveline exposed over abdomen near the umbilicus. Patients with an LVAD usually carry a monitor, a controller, a spare controller, and 2 power sources with them at all times. They should also have an LVAD identification in the front pocket of an LVAD bag. It is important to identify all devices and transfer all pertinent equipment with the patient to the nearby hospital.
