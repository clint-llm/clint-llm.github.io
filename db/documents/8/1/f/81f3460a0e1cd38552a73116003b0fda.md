CaSR-expressing, homeostatic tissues include the parathyroid glands, thyroidal C cells, intestines, bone, and kidney

The loss of function mutations in the (CaSR) gene in the parathyroid gland increases the set point for calcium sensing. It makes the parathyroid glands less sensitive to calcium, and a higher than normal serum calcium level is required to reduce PTH release. In the kidney, this defect leads to an increase in tubular calcium and magnesium reabsorption resulting in hypercalcemia, hypocalciuria, and frequently high normal levels of serum magnesium
