The dimensions of the nasopharynx (height and A-P diameter) vary significantly between individuals. Additionally, asymmetry of the superficial landmarks, such as the eustachian tube openings, describes the major physiologic (anatomic) variants of the nasopharynx. When asymmetry is observed on endoscopic or radiologic imaging, infiltrating tumors or mucosal masses versus benign anatomic variants should merit consideration. Lateral recesses, such as the fossa of Rosenmuller, become more visible with aging, which appears to be a consequence of physiologic degeneration of submucosal lymphoid tissue (adenoids).
