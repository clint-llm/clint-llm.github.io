Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, characterized by painful episodes of arthritis; gout results in substantial morbidity and disability.

As of early 2019, febuxostat is now recommended only for patients with gout who cannot tolerate allopurinol or if allopurinol lacks efficacy; this is particularly pertinent in patients with cardiovascular disease. Pharmacists should familiarize themselves with the patient's gout medication history and verify that febuxostat is appropriate. They can also confirm dosing and perform medication reconciliation, alerting the patient's clinician to any concerns or potential interactions. Nursing will be able to assess treatment efficacy and patient compliance and look for medication side effects, reporting any concerns to the treating physician. All healthcare providers should educate patients regarding lifestyle modifications such as limiting alcohol, purine, and high fructose corn syrup intake. The interprofessional healthcare team, consisting of clinicians (MD, DO, NP, PA), specialists including rheumatologists, specialty-trained nursing, and pharmacy, must work together to ensure that proper dosing and dispensing protocols are in place and be aware of the possibility of adverse effects, which includes informing the patient of the increased risk of gout flares upon treatment with febuxostat and treating the flares appropriately.

Delivering an augmented protocol of urate-lowering therapy by a team of clinicians, pharmacists, and nursing-led interventions to improve the treat-to-target strategy that includes patient education and shared decision-making can optimize the patient outcomes related to febuxostat therapy.
