Various radiotracers act by targeting and localizing to specific biological and physiological processes in the body.

For glucose metabolism evaluation, F18 Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is typically used. FDG normally biodistributes to the entire cerebral and cerebellar cortical structures. It also maps subcortical structures such as the thalami and basal ganglia. FDG enters the cell through glucose transporters (GLUT), mainly GLUT1.

FDOPA is converted to fluorodopamine by a dopa decarboxylase enzyme.
