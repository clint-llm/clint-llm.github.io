As previously mentioned, azilsartan is an ARB in the same drug class as some older antihypertensives such as losartan and valsartan. Pregnancy is considered an absolute contraindication for all ARBs and other drugs that interfere with the RAAS system, such as ACE inhibitors and direct renin inhibitors. Azilsartan is a teratogenic antihypertensive drug; if taken during early pregnancy, the threat of congenital abnormalities rises substantially.****

Although there are no current clinical contraindications to azilsartan medoxomil therapy, it is not advisable to prescribe azilsartan with aliskiren-containing products (direct renin inhibitors) or other medications that impact the RAAS system, such as ACE inhibitors.

If a patient has a history of angioedema with prior ARB use, azilsartan should not be used, as with other ARBs.
