Glucose intolerance (GI) is a metabolic condition that results from hyperglycemia. It can be defined as dysglycemia that includes both prediabetes and diabetes. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of glucose intolerance and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiology of glucose intolerance.
- Describe the pathophysiology of glucose intolerance.
- Outline the use of fasting plasma glucose, two-hour oral glucose tolerance test and the glycated hemoglobin in the evaluation of glucose intolerance.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to educate the patients on lifestyle modifications and adherence to medication to improve outcomes for those with glucose intolerance.
