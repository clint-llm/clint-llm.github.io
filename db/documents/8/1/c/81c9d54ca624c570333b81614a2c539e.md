Imaging techniques for breast cancer screening are best and well accepted from a sensitivity and specificity point of view, keeping into consideration the complications and harms to the screening population. Others are breast self-examination and clinical breast examination. Amongst the imaging techniques, mammography is best accepted. Other commonly used ones are ultrasonography and MRI.

Screening methods like mammography are most effective when targeted screening strategies are used, keeping age into considerations and other criteria like hormonal exposure, family history, and risk factors like radiation, obesity, and genetics.
