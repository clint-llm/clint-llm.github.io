Histopathological characterization of acute pancreatitis depends on the severity of the disease, specifically the absence or presence of necrosis. The disease can be classified as:

- Interstitial (or edematous) pancreatitis

- Hemorrhagic-necrotizing pancreatitis

In acute pancreatitis, the pancreas can be edematous, necrotic and surrounded by fat stranding. In mild pancreatitis, fat necrosis is minimal; whereas, with severe pancreatitis, there are large foci of fat necrosis that have merged. This is associated with parenchymal destruction and focal hemorrhages.

Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by mononuclear infiltrates and fibrosis. There can be calcifications present within the pancreas as well.
