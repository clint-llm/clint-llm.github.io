The EPS is an invasive diagnostic procedure. Discontinue antiarrhythmic therapy for at least five half-lives before the procedure. The patient needs to be after a minimal period of 6 hours of fasting. Anticoagulation therapy should also be discontinued, and hypoglycemic drugs adjusted for the fasting period. One or two peripheral venous access are necessary before the patient arrives in the EP laboratory. Once in the laboratory, surface electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes are attached to obtain a standard 12 leads ECG integrated into the EP acquisition system. Non-invasive arterial pressure monitoring by a standard blood pressure cuff-monitor is needed. Permanent pulse-oximetry monitoring is via a standard pulse-oximeter. As the classical 12 lead surf ECG provides a significant amount of information about the heart's electrical activity recorded from twelve different perspectives corresponding to each of the twelve leads, each of the intracardiac diagnostic catheters collects information from inside the heart in terms of position, timing, and voltage.
