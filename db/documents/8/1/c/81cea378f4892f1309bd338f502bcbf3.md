The odds ratio can be confused with relative risk.  As stated above, the odds ratio is a ratio of 2 odds. As odds of an event are always positive, the odds ratio is always positive and ranges from zero to very large. The relative risk is a ratio of probabilities of the event occurring in all exposed individuals versus the event occurring in all non-exposed individuals. In a 2-by-2 table with cells a, b, c, and d (see figure), the odds ratio is odds of the event in the exposure group (a/b) divided by the odds of the event in the control or non-exposure group (c/d). Thus the odds ratio is (a/b) / (c/d) which simplifies to ad/bc.  This is compared to the relative risk which is (a / (a+b)) / (c / (c+d)).  If the disease condition (event) is rare, then the odds ratio and relative risk may be comparable, but the odds ratio will overestimate the risk if the disease is more common.  In such cases, the odds ratio should be avoided, and the relative risk will be a more accurate estimation of risk.

The relative risk for the above hypothetical example of smokers versus non-smokers developing lung cancer is calculated as:

- Relative Risk = (17/100) / (1/100) = 0.17 / 0.01 = 17

Thus in our example, the odds ratio is 20.5 (smokers have 20 times the odds of having lung cancer than non-smoker); whereas the relative risk is 17 (smokers have 17 times the relative risk to have lung cancer than non-smokers).
