The benefits of captopril in hypertension and heart failure result primarily from suppressing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).

ACE inhibition leads to decreased plasma angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation and decreased aldosterone secretion. Small increases in serum potassium and sodium and fluid loss may occur due to decreased aldosterone secretion.
