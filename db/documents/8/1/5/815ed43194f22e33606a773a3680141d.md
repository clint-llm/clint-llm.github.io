A physical exam is typically the only requirement for diagnosis. The digital rectal exam should be performed and may yield a fluctuant mass. Cellulitis may extend beyond the fluctuant area and should be marked. Computed tomography or MRI may be used in the setting of clinical suspicion without signs discussed above, especially in the setting of unexplained significant anorectal pain, and in the immunocompromised patient who may not mount an immune response. MRI is the preferred method of imaging as a CT scan may miss small abscesses in the immunocompromised patients. Anorectal ultrasound may be used however it is not tolerated well secondary to pain.

Laboratory testing will usually reveal an elevated white blood cell count. However, the absence of a leukocytosis should not deter the physician from the appropriateÂ treatment of an abscess, namely surgical drainage.
