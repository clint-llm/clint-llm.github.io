Three muscles join together to form the Achilles tendon and connect to the calcaneal tubercle. Additionally, six muscles originate from the calcaneal surface and disperse to the areas where they function.

**The gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris:**They are the primary plantar flexors that combine to form the Achilles tendon. The Achilles tendon attaches to the calcaneal tubercle.

**The extensor digitorum brevis:**It originates on the dorsolateral side of the calcaneus and provides extension of the second to fourth digits.

**The abductor hallucis:**It originates on the medial process of calcaneal tuberosity and abducts the first digit.

**The extensor hallucis brevis:**It originates on the dorsal aspect of the calcaneus and extends the first digit.

**The abductor digiti minimi:**It originates on the calcaneal tubercle and provides flexion and extension of the fifth toe.

**The flexor digitorum brevis:**It originates on the calcaneal tubercle and helps provide flexion to the second to fourth digits.

**The quadratus plantae:**It originates on the lateral and medial processes of the calcaneus and helps provide flexion at the distal interphalangeal joint.
