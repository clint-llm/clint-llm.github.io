Ventilator weaning on pressure support mode is a multidisciplinary effort requiring close cooperation and coordination amongst the nurse, respiratory therapist, and the care team. As stated above, these patients are usually initiated on pressure mode of ventilation and their sedation is paused. To avoid complications and self extubations, the team should be available readily and the patient closely monitored. Daily spontaneous breathing trials and sedation vacation are part of the ABCDEF bundle and best practices that should be adopted by all ICUs to improve patient-centered outcomes like decreasing the ventilator days and delirium in the ICU.
