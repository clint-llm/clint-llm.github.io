Endometriomas carry a small risk of developing a malignancy, specifically epithelial ovarian cancers. However, that risk appears low. A meta-analysis of 13 studies and approximately 9000 women with epithelial ovarian cancers showed that a self-reported history of endometriosis was three times as high.

There may be a gene activation of KRAS and PI3K associated with ovarian cancer and a history of endometriomas. In addition, genes such as PTEN and ARID1A have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer in such lesions.
