The diagnosis and management of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration can pose a challenge and requires an interprofessional approach with close coordination between healthcare professionals in different specialties. Patients typically present to their primary care provider or the emergency provider at the onset of symptoms, and their rule is essential in excluding the more common causes of cerebellar symptoms, mainly ischemic strokes, and space-occupying lesions. Patients with normal brain imaging should be referred to a neurologist for further workup.

High suspicion of a paraneoplastic syndrome should warrant an oncological evaluation for prompt identification of the underlying malignancy. Once a malignancy is identified, the patient may need surgical intervention. This interprofessional approach is crucial to achieving better outcomes in patients with PCD. One should also acknowledge the role of physical therapy and rehabilitation medicine in managing patients with PCD.
