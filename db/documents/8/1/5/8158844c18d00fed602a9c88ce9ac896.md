The femoral nerve block (FNB) is indicated for surgery on the anterior aspect of the thigh. It may also be combined with a sciatic nerve block to provide complete lower extremity coverage below the knee, and additionally with an obturator block to provide complete lower extremity anesthesia. Both single injection and continuous infusions provide pain relief following total knee replacement.
