The differential diagnoses for urge incontinence include all of the reversible causes discussed in the evaluation section. Then again, the classification and characterization of urinary incontinence are somewhat challenging. It is most often dependent on history and subjective complaints from the patient due to a lack of adherence to proper history and physical exam technics. Therefore urge incontinence symptoms can easily have a differential diagnosis of either stress or mixed type incontinence. Another more common differential diagnosis can be overactive bladder syndrome (OAB). While urge incontinence and OAB are often used interchangeably, most OAB cases do not have any incontinence symptoms. Other conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, recurrent UTI, and neurological diseases, can also be included in the differential diagnosis for the urge incontinence.
