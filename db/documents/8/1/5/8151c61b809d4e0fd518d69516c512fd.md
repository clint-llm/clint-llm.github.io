**Newborn Screening**

Few countries have adopted this preventive method. Within the United States, it is not universally performed, but steps are being taken to do so. The technique consists of enzyme analysis on dried blood spots through mass spectrometry. Reasoning to perform it universally is that, while diagnosed early, it can improve the prognosis dramatically. This is particularly true in early-onset where cardiac and motor development present remarkable positive results when ERT is administered within the first two weeks of life. Respiratory support is not as needed with patients who receive ERT prior to six months of age. Nonetheless, patients with particular muscle fiber resistance to therapy, antibodies against ERT, or CRIM negativity will prove to be on the poor prognostic side.

Patients with late-onset have a better prognosis overall, with their main factors being muscle weakness and respiratory insufficiency. On ERT, patients showed an optimal response along with increased quality of life.

In both groups, no long-term studies have been performed, given the relative novelty of ERT.

Patients who will be in stressful situations, like pregnancy or surgery, should be monitored closely with cardiac and respiratory surveillance.

Novel therapies are underway, with adenovirus-based gene therapy being one of the most recent ones to improve the respiratory status and reduce the need for ventilatory assistance
