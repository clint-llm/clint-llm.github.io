Gallbladder ischemia as a result of vascular compromise of the cystic artery is the initiating factor in the development of this pathology. Poor perfusion results in ischemia and necrosis of the gallbladder wall. The presence of ischemic tissue results in a secondary infection, with gas-forming organisms, and leads to this condition. Gas produced by the gas-forming organisms is located in the lumen or wall of the gallbladder but can occasionally spread to other parts of the biliary tract as well as peritoneum and retroperitoneum.

A background of diabetes in many of these patients creates a microenvironment which promotes the growth of anaerobic bacteria. A pathological examination of removed specimens of emphysematous cholecystitis shows a higher degree of endarteritis obliterans when compared to acute cholecystitis. The causative organisms are E coli, Aerobactor aerogens, Klebsiella spp, and Salmonella spp. Gangrene and perforation and pericholecystic abscess may ensue. Emphysematous cholecystitis is also reported in patients undergoing hemodialysis, with changes during the procedure causing a compromise of visceral circulation including the cystic artery and leading to ischemia and devitalization of the gallbladder. This form of cholecystitis has a significant mortality, bacteria-produced endotoxin, and the higher incidence of gangrene and perforation of the gallbladder.
