A deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that forms within the deep veins usually of the leg but can occur in the veins of the arms and the mesenteric and cerebral veins. Deep-vein thrombosis is a common and important disease. It is part of the venous thromboembolism disorders which represent the third most common cause of death from cardiovascular disease after heart attacks and stroke. Even in patients who do not get pulmonary emboli, recurrent thrombosis and "post-thrombotic syndrome" are a major cause of morbidity. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of deep vein thrombosis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology pathophysiology of deep vein thrombosis.
- Review the patient risk factors and potential preventative strategies for DVT.
- Summarize the treatment and management options for a patient presenting with deep vein thrombosis.
- Explain possible interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and treatment of deep vein thrombosis and improve outcomes.
