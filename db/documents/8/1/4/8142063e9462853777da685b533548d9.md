Medial epicondylitis, commonly known as golferâ€™s elbow, is an overuse injury that occurs from tendinosis of the medial elbow at the origin of the flexor-pronator muscle group. A corticosteroid injection may be indicated when first-line therapies such as activity modification, bracing, analgesics, and physical therapy have failed. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of medial epicondylitis via corticosteroid injection and highlights the interprofessional team's role in coordinating appropriate care of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review elbow anatomy at the medial epicondyle.
- Outline the presentation and common physical exam findings of a patient with medial epicondylitis and indications for a medial epicondyle injection.
- Summarize the procedure details for a medial epicondyle injection.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients receiving medial epicondyle injections.
