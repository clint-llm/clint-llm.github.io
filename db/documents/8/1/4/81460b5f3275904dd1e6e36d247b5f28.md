SCA can lead to acute complications and chronic complications

Acute complications: Most acute complications are associated with occlusion of the small to medium-sized vessels (sometimes large-sized vessels) due to polymerization of HbS and hemolysis.

- Acute chest syndrome

- Sequestration crises: splenic or hepatic sequestration

- Fat embolism

- Bone infarction/necrosis

- Coagulopathy: increases the risk of both arterial and venous clots- stroke, myocardial infarction, venous thrombosis

- Ophthalmic: vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, retinal artery/vein occlusion

- Aplastic crises: in association with parvovirus infection

- Papillary necrosis

**Chronic Complications**

- Delayed growth and development and growth retardation

- Cardiac: cardiomegaly, cardiomyopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmia, congestive heart failure

- Pulmonary: pulmonary edema, sickle cell lung disease, pulmonary hypertension

- Hepatobiliary: Hepatomegaly, intrahepatic cholestasis, cholelithiasis, viral hepatitis

- Splenic complications: splenomegaly, hyposplenia, asplenia

- Renal: acute and chronic renal failure, pyelonephritis, renal medullary carcinoma

- Musculoskeletal: degenerative changes, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, osteonecrosis, osteopenia/osteoporosis

- Neurologic: aneurysm, mental retardation

- Ophthalmic: proliferative sickle retinopathy, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, nonproliferative retinal changes

- Endocrine: primary hypogonadism, hypopituitarism, hypothalamic insufficiency

- Iron overload due to repeated transfusions and chronic hemolysis
