All visual perception begins with the conversion of light stimuli into neuronal signals by rod and cone photoreceptor neurons in the retina. Rods are capable of generating signals at very low (scotopic) light levels, while cones are responsible for vision at bright, or photopic, light levels. Both rod and cone photoreceptors maintain membrane depolarization and release excitatory vesicles of glutamate continuously in darkness; light encoding occurs by membrane hyperpolarization and a decrease in the rate of vesicle release. Rods are exquisitely sensitive in darkness, but their release rate decreases to the point of saturation and are unable to signal further increases in light levels even at fairly dim intensities. By contrast, cones are incapable of transmitting weak light stimuli in darkness but adapt over a very broad range of light intensities and can perceive elements of a visual scene even at very high intensities.
