Metformin has been suggested as an agent that might help slow down the decline in renal function seen in patients with ADPKD.  This was based on the finding that metformin can impact cystogenesis in preclinical models. In a two year study, ADPKD patients on metformin decreased their kidney function (GFR) by only 58% as much as patients on placebo (1.71 vs 3.07).  Metformin is also known to be safe and tolerable.  These results, while promising, will need to be confirmed by a larger trial to better evaluate efficacy.
