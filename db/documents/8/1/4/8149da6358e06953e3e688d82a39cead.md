The facial artery is a branch of the external carotid artery that supplies the anatomic structures of the superficial face. The facial artery arises from the carotid triangle which is formed by the superior belly of the omohyoid muscle, the sternocleidomastoid, and the posterior belly of the digastric.****The facial artery originates deep to the platysma and quickly becomes superficial. The tortuous course of this artery allows for more stretch during facial actions such as mastication. As it courses on the face**,**the vessel travels deep to the posterior belly of the digastric and stylohyoid muscles.  It then continues along the posterior surface of the submandibular gland.
