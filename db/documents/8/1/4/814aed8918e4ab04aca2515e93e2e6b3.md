The chorda tympani forms from fibers from two brain stem nuclei: the superior salivatory nucleus and the solitary nucleus. The superior salivatory nucleus is located in the pontine tegmentum in the brainstem and innervates the submandibular gland and sublingual gland.

The chorda tympani leaves the intracranial space through the internal auditory canal with the seventh cranial nerve. Immediately after branching off the facial nerve, the chorda tympani runs through the posterior colliculus. It then travels through the middle ear and across the tympanic membrane. The chorda tympani goes between the malleus and incus and re-emerges anterior to the middle ear cavity. It then enters medially into the temporomandibular joint through the petrotympanic fissure. Finally, the chorda tympani joins the lingual nerve after exiting the petrotympanic fissure in the infratemporal fossa.

The chorda tympani carries special visceral afferent fibers that relay taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Additionally, it carries parasympathetic general visceral efferent fibers to the submandibular ganglion that innervate the sublingual and submandibular glands.
