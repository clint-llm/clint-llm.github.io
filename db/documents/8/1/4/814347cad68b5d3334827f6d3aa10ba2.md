The diagnosis and management of chagas disease is complex and best done with an interprofessional team that consists of an infectious disease expert, cardiologist, emergency department physician, gastroenterologist, nurse practitioner and an internist. The disorder is very rare in North America and may be encountered in people visiting the US from South America. The disorder can be treated but most patients have severe residual sequelae. There is currently no vaccine for this disease.
