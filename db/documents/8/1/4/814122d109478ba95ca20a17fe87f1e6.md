Parkinsonâ€™s disease hallmarks include dopaminergic neuron loss in substantia nigra pars compacta and Lewy bodies. The exact mechanism of Parkinson disease is unknown, but it involves alpha-synuclein aggregates, the endo-lysosomal system, and mitochondrial function. Alpha-synuclein is a presynaptic protein that assists in presynaptic vesicle transportation and endocytosis. When it becomes misfolded and aggregates, it becomes toxic to mitochondria and neurons. Increased cellular oxidative stress leads to increased alpha-synuclein aggregation. As alpha-synuclein aggregates, mitochondria and the neuron lysosomal function deteriorate, and the cell eventually dies.

Alpha-synuclein is also involved in other pathologies, such as the Lewy body variant of Alzheimer disease, multiple system atrophy, and brain neurodegeneration with an accumulation of iron (accumulation type I).
