Unfortunately, no treatment is consistently effective for atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini.

Patients with a positive B. burgdorferi antibody titer have shown some response with tetracyclines. Doxycycline, in a dose of 200 mg/day, is reported to prevent the appearance of new lesions. However, the results of treatment with antibiotics in a patient with positive B. burgdorferi are inconclusive. In retrospective sera of 25 patients treated with either oral penicillin (2 million IU per day) or oral tetracycline (500 mg three times per day ) for 2 to 3 weeks showed clinical improvement in 20 patients. The same study demonstrated no progressive disease in four of six patients who did not receive treatment

The therapeutical approach also includes topical corticosteroids and antimalarials, including hydroxychloroquine, which seems to show good response in cases associated with lupus. Furthermore, topical treatments using calcineurin inhibitors were also reported, although with variable responses

Treatment with a Q-switched Alexandrite laser has also been reported to result in the clinical improvement of hyperpigmented lesions.
