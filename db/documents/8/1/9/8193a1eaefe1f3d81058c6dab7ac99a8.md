Leprosy is also referred to as Hansen disease. It is a chronic granulomatous infection generally caused by Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis, both of which primarily affects the skin and peripheral nerves. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of leprosy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of leprosy.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of leprosy.
- Outline the management options available for leprosy.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of patients with leprosy and improve outcomes.
