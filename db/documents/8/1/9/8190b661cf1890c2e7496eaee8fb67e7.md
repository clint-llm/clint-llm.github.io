Ipecac has a high safety profile. Common side effects include prolonged vomiting (greater than 1 hour), lethargy, somnolence, diarrhea, fever, and irritability. More severe complications can consist of aspiration pneumonia, Mallory-Weiss tears, pneumomediastinum, and gastric rupture. Since syrup of ipecac induces vomiting, it can delay the administration of PO medications, such as activated charcoal. Fatalities have been associated with the use of ipecac but are rare.

Abuse of ipecac can lead to cardiomyopathy.
