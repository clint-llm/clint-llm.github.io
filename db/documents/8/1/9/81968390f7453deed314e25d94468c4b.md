The management of congenital femoral deficiency begins with appropriate evaluation and rule out other associated anomalies. It requires a good and focused plain radiograph of the affected part. As such, the radiology technicians should be well-trained in getting the appropriate full-length views done so that whole of the lower extremity is evaluated. Also, consultation with a pediatrician should be promptly sought to assess associated anomalies. The role of physical therapy and rehabilitation cannot be undermined in getting the best functional outcomes after congenital femoral deficiency; hence physiotherapists should be informed about the rehab protocol after each case.
