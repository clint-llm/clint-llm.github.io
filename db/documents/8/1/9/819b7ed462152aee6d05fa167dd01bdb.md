A stepwise diagnostic approach is required for patients suspected to have PA.

- The first step is to test for anemia.

- Complete blood count (CBC) will demonstrate a low hemoglobin level (less than 13 g/dL for men and less than 12 g/dL for women) and an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of greater than or equal to 100 fL.
- The peripheral blood smear will demonstrate large ovalocytes instead of normal red blood cells.
- PA also affects the development of white blood cells, which can be seen on the peripheral smear as the presence of hyper-segmented neutrophils.

- The next step is to establish the presence of vitamin B12 deficiency.

- Serum B12 levels under 200 pg/mL are consideredÂ deficient.
- If this level is borderline low or normal, and suspicion for PA is high, other laboratory tests can be used to establish B12 deficiency. These include homocysteine level and methylmalonic acid level.

- The final step is to confirm the presence of autoimmunity.

- Serum antibody testing for IFA and PCA will be required after B12 deficiency is established.
- Patients will also undergo upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with gastric biopsy to test for the presence of atrophic gastritis.
