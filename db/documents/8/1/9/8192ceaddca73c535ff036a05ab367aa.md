Angiosarcomas occur in every region of the body. However, approximately 60% arise in the skin or superficial soft tissues.Â Cutaneous angiosarcomas usually occur in 3 clinical settings:

- The majority are idiopathic and develop on the head and neck of the elderly, classically the scalp of men

- As a result of previous exposure to ionizing radiation

- In association with chronic lymphedema either from postsurgical complications or seen with congenital abnormalities

A reported 90% of cases of angiosarcoma associated with lymphedema occur following a mastectomy. This is known as Stewart-Treves syndrome.
