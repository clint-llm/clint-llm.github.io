Treatment is the total elimination of galactose from the diet. In infants, this means cessation of breastfeeding or standard infant formula feeding and transition to non-galactose-containing formula, typically a soy-based, casein hydrolysate, or elemental formula. Change in the diet should be made immediately and should not be delayed to await confirmatory testing. This dietary restriction of galactose is required throughout the lifetime, although some fruits, vegetables, legumes, unfermented soy-based products, and mature cheeses with minimal galactose content may be permissible. Currently, there is no enzyme replacement or other therapy available to allow for the safe intake of galactose.

In Duarte variant galactosemia, there is a debate about whether galactose intake should be restricted. Physicians or parents may choose to restrict galactose intake in infancy and early childhood, though the benefits of doing are uncertain.
