A pulse is a rhythmic wave produced by ventricular contraction during systole. A double pulse noticed during systole in the peripheral pulse is called pulsus bisferiens. This is derived from the Latin word, which means strike twice (bis=twice, ferio=strike). It is also called a biphasic wave. Way back in 1952, it was described by Galen in De Pulsibus.

Pulsus bisferiens is associated with severe aortic diseaseÂ accompanied by aortic regurgitation and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).

**Definition**

Pulsus bisferiens is a single central pulse wave with two peaks separated by a distinct mid-systolic dip. An early component percussion wave results from rapid left ventricular ejection. The late component tidal wave represents a reflected wave from the periphery due to an artery's recoil effect.

**History**

Medical literature has made many revelations about the pulse way back in the first and second centuries AD.

- Clinical observations of double-pulse were first made by Galen (1932)

- Mahomed (1872) was the first to describe the terms percussion wave and tidal wave

- Broadbent, in 1900 noticed pulsus bisferiens in context to aortic valve disease

- Bramwell (1937) put forward the theory of the genesis of the abnormal pulse

- Fleming described the mechanism of pulsus bisferiens in 1957
