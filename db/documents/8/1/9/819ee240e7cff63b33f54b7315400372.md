A careful history and physical exam are cornerstones for the diagnosis of anterior MI. Patients typically present with chest pain. Associated symptoms can be dyspnea, palpitations, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis. History should include characteristics and duration of symptoms, aggravating and relieving factors, and functional capacity of the patient. Patients should undergo evaluation for risk factors like diabetes, smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, previous history of CAD, family history, illicit drug use, and medication history and compliance.

The physical exam may elicit clues to cardiovascular disease like hypotension/ hypertension, tachypnea, tachycardia/ arrhythmia, jugular venous distension, heart murmurs, lung crackles, and peripheral edema. A good history and physical exam are critical prior to diagnostic testing to estimate the pretest likelihood of ischemia.
