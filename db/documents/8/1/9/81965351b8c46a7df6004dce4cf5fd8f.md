Granuloma annulare is a benign, often self-limiting condition. Lesions can disappear spontaneously without sequelae, typically within several months to years. There is no satisfactory treatment for GA, but since the lesions are usually asymptomatic, watchful waiting is often acceptable.

For most patients, the condition disappears within a few years. It tends to be more persistent when it spreads to other areas (generalized form) than when it is only in one location (localized form).
