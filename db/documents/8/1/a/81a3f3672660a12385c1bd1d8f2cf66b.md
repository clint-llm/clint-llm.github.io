Several aspects of the patientâ€™s history are pertinent to the diagnosis of, or expectation for, variable decelerations. Small variable decelerations are often present in the fetal heart tracings of premature fetuses. In term fetuses, causes of low amniotic fluid are important to elicit. These include rupture of membranes and oligohydramnios (placental insufficiency, idiopathic, etc.). Other causes of umbilical cord compression may be implicated in the etiology of variable decelerations. For example, the presence of a nuchal cord may increase the risk of cord compression during uterine contractions. Monoamniotic twins are at risk of umbilical cord entanglement, which may manifest as fetal heart rate decelerations. Deep, recurrent variable decelerations may precede bradycardia in cases of uterine rupture. In a patient who presents in labor with an abnormal fetal heart rate tracing, a history of a prior classical cesarean section or previous uterine rupture would warrant immediate evaluation. Worrisome variable decelerations may also be present in cases of umbilical cord prolapse. A history of polyhydramnios, breech presentation, advanced cervical dilation, or high fetal station before the rupture of membranes may raise suspicion for a prolapsed umbilical cord.

Physical exam intrapartum should include an examination of the cervix for dilation, station, and presence of a prolapsed umbilical cord. Palpation of the abdomen, especially if the contraction monitor is insufficient, may identify the presence of uterine tachysystole. Antepartum, the initial exam of the pregnant patient, must include identification of the number of fetuses. If there are multiple fetuses, identification of chorionicity and amnionicity is essential.
