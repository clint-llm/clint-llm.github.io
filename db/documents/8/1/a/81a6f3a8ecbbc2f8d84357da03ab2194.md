**Types of cells:**

The cells are of different types with a unique function of its own. Estimates are that more than 200 different types of cells are present in an adult human. Some of them are as follows:

- **Stem cells:**These are the primary cells from which all the other cells arise. These are again of different types for each kind of cell.

- **Muscle cells:**These are of basically of three types - skeletal, smooth and cardiac cells

- **Bone cells:**These cells make up the bone. They are of three kinds - osteocytes, osteoclasts, and osteoblasts

- **Cartilage cells:**These are three types - chondrocytes, chondroblast, and chondroclasts

- **Blood cells:**They are many types - Platelets, red blood cells, white blood cells, neutrophils, basophils, etc.

- **Sex cells:**They are two types - sperms and ovum. Further, they pass through different stages of development like (in males) the primordial cells, primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, spermatids, and finally reach the stage of mature sperms. Also, we find supporting cells like Sertoli cells and hormone-secreting cells like Leydig cells,

- **Nervous cells:**They are of different types - neuron, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia, etc.

- **Fat cells:**These are lipocytes.

**General functions of the cells:**

As there are many different types of cells, so are their functions. Hence we will summarize some of the essential functions of these into the following.

- **Structure:**The cells help in giving, and maintaining the specific shape and structure for each part of the body.

- **Growth:**The stem cells give rise to the development of new types of cells by cell division. There is a spurt in growth in the size/number of the cells during childhood, but get limited when reaching adulthood. This process is regulated by growth-promoting genes that are different for each organ and tissue of the body.

- **Apoptosis:**It is a process of self-digestion and removal of the dead and worn-out cells.

- **Metabolism:**This takes place by protein, carbohydrate, and lipid synthesis necessary for the cells for growth and their proliferation.

- **Regulation of temperature:**The metabolism helps in the production of the energy by the mitochondria essential for the function of the cell and body. And with the production of energy, there is an increase in temperature.

- **Communication:**We always think of neurons playing a significant role in transmitting information from the brain to different parts of the body. But there are also other types of communication between the cells and within by the enzymes, hormones, and others. It is a well-known fact that cells are in continuous interaction with each other for different purposes like metabolism, growth, development, division, transport, etc.

- **Transportation of the substances**across the membrane: The membrane around the cell show selective permeability. Transport can be active or passive. Some of the elements, like water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, glucose, etc.

- **Reproduction:**The cell division and multiplication take place in almost all cells of the body. But when the male and female sex cells come in contact and fuse, it leads to the production of a totally new individual, in the form of a zygote.

**The Cell Cycle:**

The changes taking place in a cell in a repeated cyclical manner leading to the production of daughter cells is called the cell cycle. Most of the cells of the body divide and replicate, but not all cells show similar patterns of cell cycles. Some cells divided mitotically throughout life like the stem cells, some do divide at an early age and later stop dividing even when damaged like neurons, but some cells divide when there is a demand like the liver cells.

The cell usually divides by two methods:

- Mitosis

- Meiosis

**Interphase:**It is a state between two mitotic divisions. It further subdivides into the G1 stage, S stage, and G2 stages (G=Gap).

Mitosis takes place in somatic cells of the body. This process is necessary for two reasons: the growth of the organism and the replacement of the dead/worn-out cells. Here the cells divide to produce two daughters that are exact copies of the mother cell.

Meiosis: This kind of cell division takes place in the germ cells - the sperms in the males and the ovum in the females. These germ cells are in the sex gametes - the testis in males and the ovaries in females. In this kind of cell division, the mother cell produces daughter cells, not the copies but unique of its own.

**Mitosis**(M stage)**:**It subdivides into four stages:

- Prophase

- Metaphase

- Anaphase

- Telophase

**Meiosis:**It has first and second meiotic divisions.

First Meiotic Division:****It is a lengthy division and is divided further into the following four stages

- Leptotene

- Zygotene

- Pachytene

- Diplotene

Second Meiotic Division:****It is said to be similar to mitosis except that:

- The DNA content reduces to half.

- The daughter cells are not identical to the mother cell.
