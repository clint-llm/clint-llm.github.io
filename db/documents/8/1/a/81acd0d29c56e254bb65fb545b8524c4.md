The VNS is placed by placing two incisions - one 2-3 cm below the left clavicle and the other skin crease incision on the left side at the level of the thyroid cartilage.

The battery is placed deep into the subcutaneous fat in the chest wall through the former incision.

Via the latter incision, the subplatysmal plane is dissected and sternomastoid muscle is retracted posteriorly and the carotid sheath is identified. Within this sheath, the vagus nerve is usually found deep and medial to the internal jugular vein and lateral to the common carotid artery. The nerve is dissected off the surrounding tissues and the leads of the stimulator are coiled around the nerve. The leads are connected to the stimulator via a silicone sheath passed through a subcutaneous tunnel connecting them both. Both the wounds are closed in layers.

The working of the VNS is confirmed by comparing the heart rate measured from the vagus nerve with the heart rate from the anesthesia monitor.
