Buckle fractures present uniquely in the pediatric population, and a multidisciplinary approach is necessary. This approach would include triage and initial treatment through the emergency department, casting or application of a wrist splint by plaster technicians, and though not necessarily required, almost invariably review in the fracture clinic by an orthopedic surgeon.

The key to efficiency in their management is recognition of this injury in the emergency department and treatment into a splint/soft cast and discharge to avoid unnecessary hospital visits. The parents must receive adequate counseling on the child's condition and recovery.
