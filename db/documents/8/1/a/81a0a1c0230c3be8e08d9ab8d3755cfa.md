VFS is the most frequent adverse reaction to intravenous vancomycin. It occurs in 4% to 50% of infected patients treated with intravenous vancomycin. Patients under 40 years of age are at the greatest risk of severe VFS reactions. Severe reactions include angioedema, hypotension, tachycardia, weakness, muscle spasms, and chest or back pain, in addition to a rash of the face, neck, and upper torso. VFS usually is mild and easily managed. There are rare cases of life-threatening VFS reactions.
