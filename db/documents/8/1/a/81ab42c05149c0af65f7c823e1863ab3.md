The pathophysiology of DCO is controversial, but according to Schwarzkopf et al., Cahill presented the most widely accepted theory, which described microfractures of the subchondral bone and repeated attempts at repair.

Repetitive stress increases osteolytic and osteoblastic activity, further disrupting the articular cartilage and metaplastic bone formation. Kassarjian et al. further supported the atraumatic repetitive stress hypothesis in their MR evaluation which demonstrated that all patients with apparent DCO displayed a hypo-intense line in the distal clavicle most consistent with a subchondral fracture.

Additionally, findings include subchondral cysts and increased osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity.
