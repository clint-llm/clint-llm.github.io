Subtalar dislocations of the talus and calcaneus are the more common of the foot dislocations but are also very rare overall, accounting for around 1% of all dislocations. They are more common in young or middle-aged males. Midtarsal dislocations are the second most common fracture-dislocation involving the midfoot following those involving the Lisfranc joint.
