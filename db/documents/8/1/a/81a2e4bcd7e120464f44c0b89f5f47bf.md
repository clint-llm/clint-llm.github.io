Optic nerve sheath meningiomas (ONSM) are rare benign tumors of the central nervous system. Although their growth is slow but progressive, their location is critical as it directly affects the anterior visual pathway and can lead to a severe visual loss. Treatment of this condition is still considered controversial, as the proximity of the tumor to the optic nerve makes it difficult to completely remove without secondary complications and sequelae.
