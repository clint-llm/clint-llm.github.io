It is essential for patients and the parents of infants diagnosed with congenital pulmonary airway malformation to understand the prognosis, natural history, and various complications of the disease. Because of the ability to diagnose prenatally, the education may begin early on and therefore prepare the families in advance for the course of management. Having a multidisciplinary approach to the care of the infant will help offer the families a seamless transition from prenatal to postnatal care.
