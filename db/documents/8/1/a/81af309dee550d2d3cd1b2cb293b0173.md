The main function of the femur is weight bearing and gait stability. The upper body’s weight sits on the 2 femoral heads. The capsular ligament is a strong thick sheath that wraps around the acetabulum periosteum and proximal femur.

The knee is a hinge joint between the distal femur and proximal tibia. Medial and lateral meniscus stabilize and cushion the tibiofemoral articulation. Medial and lateral ligaments prevent valgus or varus deformity. Within the knee joint, anterior and posterior cruciate ligament allow for some rotational movement of the knee while preventing anterior or posterior displacement of the tibia. The patellofemoral joint is used in knee extension.
