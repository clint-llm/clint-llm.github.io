Dopamine administration affects the cardiovascular system, as well as other organs, including the kidneys and the brain. Contraindications include specific pharmaceutical agents, lifestyle, and nutrition factors that can impact similar organs with DA treatment. These factors and medications include psychopharmacological agents, neuroleptics, general anesthetics, and even physical therapy-induced cardiac challenges. Communication among all interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and therapists, is critical to ensuring proper application of DA to mitigate potentially harmful or chronic adverse effects while considering a holistic healthcare approach along with specific outcome objectives. By engaging in interprofessional teamwork and communication, dopamine therapy can achieve its best possible outcomes with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]
