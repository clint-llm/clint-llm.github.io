The prime objective of treating gingivitis is to reduce inflammation. This is achieved byÂ the use of different instruments to remove dental plaque deposits

If it is a drug-induced gingival overgrowth, the physician can change the medication to improve the outcome of treatment of the condition. If it is due to nutritional deficiency, supplements can be prescribed. Medications in the form of antiseptic mouthwash that contains chlorhexidine can also be prescribed in conjunction with the mechanical removal of plaque. It has been suggested that the use of chlorhexidine mouthwashes in addition to the usual toothbrushing and interproximal cleaning leads to a significant decrease in the build-up of dental biofilm. The concentration of the chlorhexidine rinse does not affect its effectiveness

There are studies on the effect of medicinal or herbal plants on the management of gingivitis. The mechanism of action of these plants on gingivitis is due to their anti-inflammatory property. Such medicinal plants include pomegranate, tea, and chamomile. The flavonoids and tannins present in these plants are potent anti-inflammatory and astringent phytochemicals. Therefore, they can resolve both gingival bleeding and inflammation
