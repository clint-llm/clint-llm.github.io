Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT), which is the gold standard method in measuring IOP,Â  is usually performed by the ophthalmologist and optometrist. Other applanation methods that do not require local anesthesia and fluorescein can also be carried out by nurses, ophthalmic technicians, or emergency medicine.

Proper training and communication are needed in tonometry when managing patients, especially considering that accurate IOP measurements at diagnosis and follow-up examinations are of utmost importance in determining therapeutic strategies.

GAT needs to be mounted on a slit lamp and tonometry performed on patients in an upright position. Topical anesthesia and fluorescein are used to obtain accurate measurements. Alternative methods can be considered when GAT may prove to be less suitable, which include: open globe wounds; patients that do not tolerate anesthesia drops or fluorescein; eyes with keratoconjunctivitis or central corneal scarring, elevated irregular astigmatism, unhealed corneal abrasions, and/or corneal ulcers. Alternative tonometers may be used in bedridden and non-collaborative.

Tonometry readings should be accurate and precise, so choosing the correct instrument to measure IOP when managing patients is crucial. Glaucoma and other ophthalmic conditions can give rise to irreversible vision loss and reduced peripheral vision, which is why IOP needs to be properly assessed at periodic examinations to provide thorough management of patients.
