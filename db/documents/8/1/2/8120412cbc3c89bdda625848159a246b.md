Although multiple theories highlighting the etiology and pathogenesis of bladder exstrophy have been published, the exact cause still eludes us. Of all these theories, the one by Marshall and Muecke is the most accepted. An abnormally large cloacal membrane causes a wedge effect and prevents the medial migration of the mesenchymal tissue. As a result, the lower abdominal wall is not well-formed. A subsequent rupture of the cloacal membrane results in herniation of all the contents and leading to the clinical picture of bladder-exstrophy-epispadias complex.

It has been suggested that 'the wedge-effect' can also occur due to abnormally cephalad origin of the primordia of the genital tubercle. Some experimental models suggest premature rupture of the cloacal membrane to be a significant contributing factor.

Several other theories, including the caudal displacement of the genital tubercle, abnormal fluid retention leading to rupture of the embryonic bladder, etc., have been proposed as possible mechanisms in the occurrence of exstrophy bladder.
