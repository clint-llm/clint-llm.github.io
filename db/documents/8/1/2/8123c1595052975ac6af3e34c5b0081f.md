Brachialis syndrome results from a permanent injury to the median nerve following poor patient positioning during surgery, particularly due to a decompression of the median nerve in the antecubital fossa.

According to the literature, the brachialis muscle could be one of the causes of the alteration of the arthrokinematics of the shoulder (thanks to the anatomic-myofascial continuum), causing pain to the movement and disturbance to the rotator cuff of the shoulder. The presence of trigger points in the brachialis muscle could be a clue. In some patients, injecting drugs in the brachialis muscle can solve the shoulder problem.

Myositis ossificans in the sporting field generally involve specific muscle areas, including the brachialis muscle.

Angiosarcoma formation can affect the brachialis muscle, particularly in deep tissues.

Tendinopathy of the brachialis muscle at its insertion is a rare event. Generally, the symptom is a pain in the antecubital area, and conservative therapy (steroid injection) is the recommended approach to management.
