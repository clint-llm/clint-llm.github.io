Velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) is a disorder of the velopharyngeal (VP) sphincter or valve, which functions to separate the nasal and oral cavities during speech, swallowing, vomiting, blowing, and sucking. When the soft palate and pharyngeal walls are unable to form an effective seal, an abnormal connection between the nasal and oral cavities leads to hypernasal speech, increased nasal resonance, nasal regurgitation, nasal emission, and decreased intraoral pressure during speech. The overall result is decreased speech intelligibility and significant functional and social impairment.

Diagnosis and treatment require a multidisciplinary approach centered around speech-language pathology, otolaryngology, and plastic surgery. Velopharyngeal dysfunction is the favored nomenclature, as it denotes a deficit of the velopharyngeal closure without implying a specific cause. It can be further subdivided into velopharyngeal insufficiency, incompetence, and mislearning, which provides additional information on the causation. Velopharyngeal insufficiency suggests a structural defect, incompetent us due to neurologic dysfunction, and mislearning is due to learned errors in articulation.
