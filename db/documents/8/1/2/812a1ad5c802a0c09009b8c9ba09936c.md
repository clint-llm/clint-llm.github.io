The approach to a choking patient should begin with an assessment of the ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation). The clinician should focus on skin color, level of consciousness, and work of breathing, noting chest wall retractions, nasal flaring, and the use of accessory muscles.

The classical physical exam features include stridor and hoarseness for laryngotracheal foreign bodies and unilateral wheezing and decreased breath sounds for foreign bodies in the bronchi. A pharyngeal examination should is necessary, and if there is a visible foreign body, it may be removed but avoid blind finger sweeps. The pharyngeal exam should also evaluate for other causes of stridor and respiratory distress such as epiglottis and peritonsillarÂ abscess.

While a history of sudden coughing and choking is most predictive of FBAO, providers must have a high clinical suspicion for FBAO as a significant number of patients present with no cough, stridor, or wheezes. In the absence of these physical exam findings, providers should pay particular attention to risk factors such as age or disability and chest x-ray findings of atelectasis, lung hyperinflation, or pneumonia. While the sudden onset of symptoms is most common, the diagnosis cannot be excluded based on the duration of symptoms as many patients present greater than 24 hours after foreign body aspiration.
