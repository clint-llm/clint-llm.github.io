Since its initial introduction, indications for UKA has continued to expand. Data from large case series, registries, and meta-analyses have consistently demonstrated the long-term efficacy and survivorship of UKA in the appropriate patient populations. When performed for the correct indications and in the appropriate settings, UKA is a minimally invasive surgery that can return the patient to their previous level of recreational activity. Heightened patient expectations especially in younger and more active patients, however, can lead to early wear of the implant and the need for revision. Nevertheless, conversion of a failed UKA to total knee arthroplasty is associated with lower morbidity compared to revision of a TKA.
