Diagnosis and management of tor turf are made by an interprofessional team that includes a sports physician, orthopedic surgeon, podiatrist, nurse practitioner, radiologist, and an emergency department physician. The initial treatment is conservative, but most severe injuries require some type of surgery. The symptoms often take months to subside. The majority of patients have a good outcome, but future protection of the toe is highly recommended to prevent a recurrence.
