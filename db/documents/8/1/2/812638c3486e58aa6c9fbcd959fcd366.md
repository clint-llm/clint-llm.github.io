The thoracic body wall is composed of a bony framework of the bodies and transverse processes of thoracic vertebrae articulating with ribs, the superior ten which form a bony ribcage around the thorax joining with the sternum and its costal cartilages anteriorly. Ribs 11 and 12, the “floating ribs,” form the posteroinferior most bony body wall of the thorax but terminate within the abdominal wall musculature anteriorly.

The musculofascial components of the thoracic wall form a three-layered intercostal membrane between the ribs consisting of external intercostal, internal intercostal, and innermost intercostal muscles which have a primary respiratory function.

Homology in muscle fiber orientation of the three muscle layers in both the thorax and abdominal body walls suggests that there is a primitive chordate bauplan that provides “plywood-like” integrity to the body wall.

Neurovascular structures travel in the interval between innermost and inner intercostal muscles within the intercostal space, piercing as lateral cutaneous branches near the mid-axillary line and as anterior cutaneous branches parasternally.
