While the incidence of chorea in specific disorders is known, the global incidence of chorea is lacking. The incidence of chorea in some common disorders isÂ as follows:

- **Huntington disease**is a neurodegenerative autosomal dominant disorder with a prevalence of about 5-10 cases per 100,000 individuals in the US. The disorder is most common in Caucasians but is now being seen in expats who have settled in South and Central America.

- **Wilson disease**is a multisystem disorder that is autosomal recessive and has a prevalence of about 30 cases per million people.

- **Benign hereditary chorea**is a rare disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance with a prevalence of 1 case per half a million people.

**Age**

Chorea can occur at any age. In young people, the most common causes of chorea are infections, trauma, and inflammatory causes.

Huntington chorea usually presents in the fourth to fifth decade of life and is progressive. It is rarely seen before the third decade of life. Individuals who have early onset of the disorder usually inherit the gene from the father, whereas late onset is most likely due to a gene inherited from the mother.
