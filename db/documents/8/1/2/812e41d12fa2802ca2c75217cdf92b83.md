- Patellofemoral arthritis is a common cause of anterior knee pain.

- Development is often multifactorial and involves overuse and biomechanical components.

- It may be unicompartmental, meaning limited to the patellofemoral joint space, or bi- or tri-compartmental, involving the femorotibial joint space.

- Diagnosis is usually made clinically in conjunction with standard knee radiographs.

- Conservative management includes physical therapy, activity modification, analgesics, bracing, and injections.

- Surgical management is an option in select patients.
