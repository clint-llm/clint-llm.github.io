Managing traumatic genitourinary injuries requires an interprofessional team approach. The emergency department and trauma surgery teams should recognize the risk factors for genitourinary injuries and involve the urology and gynecology teams early when injuries are identified. It is important to have open communication with all consulting services, including urology, gynecology, and orthopedics. Potential complications should be common knowledge for the teams involved for early detection. Physical and occupational therapy should be involved early in care. Psychologists should be employed early in the care of patients with genital injuries. Patients with genitourinary injuries truly do require an interprofessional team to achieve the best results.
