Pigmented purpuric dermatoses are largely diagnosed based on the clinical presentation. However, with atypical presentations or to rule out cutaneous vasculitis, dermatitis, or cutaneous t-cell lymphoma, skin biopsy by punch technique can be helpful. CBC and coagulation studies can be performed to rule out thrombocytopenia or clotting disorders. Medication history should also be obtained to screen for drug hypersensitivity as a cause. To rule out concomitant allergic contact dermatitis, patch testing can be performed.
