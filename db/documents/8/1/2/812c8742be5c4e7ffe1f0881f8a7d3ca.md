The causes of intussusception are not known. About 90% of cases of intussusception in children arise from an unknown cause. They can include infections, anatomical factors, and altered motility.

Known causes may include:

- Infections

- Anatomical factors

- Altered motility

- Meckel's diverticulum

- Duplication

- Polyps

- Appendicitis

- Hyperplasia of Peyer patches

- Idiopathic

An early version of the rotavirus vaccine that is no longer used was thought to cause intussusception, but the current vaccines are not clearly linked.
