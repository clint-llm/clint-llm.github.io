The patients suffering from high-velocity injuries, particularly to the hip and pelvic region, should keenly observe for and report any soft tissue swellings noticed near the orthopedic injuries. Also, as the treatment might entail placing an indwelling drain in the lesion for around 2 weeks, proper patient counseling should be done to ensure patient compliance. Moreover, as the less invasive options of percutaneous aspiration are associated with high rates of local recurrence, adequate information needs to be provided to the patients before they can agree on the more invasive option of open debridement. Also, proper rehabilitation and physical therapy are paramount in getting the best functional outcomes after surgical and conservative management of these lesions and the concomitant orthopedic injuries.
