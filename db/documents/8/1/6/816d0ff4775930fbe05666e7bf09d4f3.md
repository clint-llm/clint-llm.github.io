The POSNA, the Canadian Task Force on DDH, and the AAOS, the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommends periodic surveillance for DDH throughout infancy. The reasonable screening goal is to prevent late presentation beyond six months.

The 2000 AAP clinical practice guideline recommended the hip ultrasound (US) at six weeks of age or Xray of the hip at four months of age in girls with a positive family history of DDH or breech presentation at third trimester. Universal screening is controversial, as most of the instability if found self resolves.

Diagnosis depends on local resources and the availability of expert guidance.

**Newborns**

- Normal exam with risk factors - US hip at six weeks (allowing time for resolution of physiologic immaturity and laxity)

- Inconclusive exam or hip clicks - Repeat exam in 2 to 4 weeks.

- Positive Ortolani or Barlow - Refer to an orthopedic specialist with experience.

**Four Weeks to 4 Months**

- Inconclusive exam - Refer to a specialist or Hip US at six weeks.

- Positive Barlow or Ortolani - Refer to an orthopedic specialist with experience.

**Beyond Four Months**

- Clinical examination is limited as capsule laxity decreases; the Barlow and Ortolani maneuvers may not be positive. Limited hip abduction becomes the most crucial screening method in older children.

- Femoral head nuclei usually appear between 4 to 6 months (range 1.5 to 8 months), so X-ray is the preferred diagnostic tool over the hip US.

- Normal pelvic radiographs at four months can reliably exclude DDH in children with risk factors.

**Imaging**

The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine and the American college of radiology recommend the US of the hip.

Criteria for DDH has been established for static imaging (Graf classification)

GRAF classification:

- Alpha angle-angle between bony acetabulum and Illium (Normal > 60 degrees)

- Beta angle-angle between labrum and ileum (Normal < 55 degrees)

Based on these angles, DDH is classified into four types.

X-ray: anteroposterior (AP) of the pelvis - lines of mensuration:

- Hilgenreiner's line: a horizontal line through the right and left triradiate cartilage, head of the femur should be inferior to this line. (Figure 1)

- Perkin's line: Perpendicular line to Hilgenreiner's line through a focus at the lateral side of the acetabulum. The femoral head should be medial to this line. (Figure 2)

- Shenton's line: Smooth arc that connects the femoral neck to the superior margin of the obturator foramen. Any disruption indicates an abnormality. (Figure 3)

- Acetabular index: the intersection between Hilgenreiner's line and a line drawn tangential to the lateral ossific margin of the roof of the acetabulum. The normal index is less than <35 degrees at birth and <25 degrees at age one. (Figure 4)

- The center-edge angle of Wiberg: Formed by Perkin´s line and a line coming from the center of the femoral head to the lateral edge of the acetabulum. This measurement is reliable in patients older than 5 years old. Values should be > 20 degrees.
