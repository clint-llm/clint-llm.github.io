There are no prostatic diseases that are contraindications to transrectal ultrasound. However, unrelated conditions may preclude the insertion of the probe, such as rectal mass or other anorectal diseases (i.e., hemorrhoids, local dermatologic condition, stricture). These are assessed on the digital rectal exam performed before probe insertion.
