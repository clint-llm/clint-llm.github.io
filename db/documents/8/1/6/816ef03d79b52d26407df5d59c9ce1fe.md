Chronic angle-closure glaucoma must also be differentiated from open-angle glaucoma (primary and secondary) as well as causes of nonglaucomatous optic neuropathy such as ischemic, compressive, and hereditary optic neuropathies.

Primary angle-closure consists of other subtypes which must also be considered in the differential diagnosis:

- Primary angle-closure suspect

- Acute angle-closure

- Intermittent angle closure

- Status post-acute angle-closure attack
