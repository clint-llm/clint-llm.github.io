**Non-operative Treatment**

Wearing a wide, soft-soled, laced shoe with a low heel can effectively relieve pressure on the nerve. Some surgeons recommend a firm-soled shoe instead. Soft metatarsal support with a metatarsal pad, or neuroma pad, placed just proximal to the metatarsal heads, can help to spread the metatarsal heads and relieve mechanical pressure on the neuroma. In the presence of synovitis, instability, or deformity of the toe, a Budin splint or canopy toe strapping can decrease secondary neuralgia. Anti-inflammatory medications, tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, and anti-seizure medications such as gabapentin can be administered to lessen the severity of related nerve symptoms. Blind or ultrasound-guided steroid injections can occasionally help, but their effect is rarely long-lasting. Atrophy of the subcutaneous fat and plantar fat pad, discoloration of the skin, and disruption of the joint capsule adjacent to the injected site causing deformity of the toe, are some of the reported side effects. Radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, and alcohol nerve injections have been proposed as less invasive and more conservative methods of treating neuromas.

**Surgical Treatment**

If non-operative management fails, then surgery is indicated to treat recalcitrant cases. The neuroma is excised using a dorsal or plantar approach. The dorsal approach is better tolerated by patients as the plantar scar can be painful. A 3 cm to 4 cm incision is made just proximal to the involved webspace in the midline to prevent injury to the dorsal cutaneous nerves. The incision is deepened to the transverse metatarsal ligament, which is transected. The common digital nerve is identified in the proximal portion of the wound and is traced distally to its bifurcation, and any soft tissue adhesions, if present, are released around the nerve. At this point, nerve decompression or neurolysis has been performed, and some surgeons will end the dissection here without any further intervention to the nerve itself. Previous reports in the literature noted satisfactory results with decompression alone.

To intervene on the nerve, the common digital nerve is cut proximal to the metatarsal heads and then traced distally past the bifurcation, where both branches are transected. Some surgeons suture the cut ends of the nerve to the side of the metatarsal or one of the intrinsic muscles to prevent the formation of a painful stump neuroma. As little plantar fat as possible should be removed. A postoperative shoe is worn till the stitches are removed at about 7 to 14 days, and a compressive wrap is used for 2 to 6 weeks.

The plantar incision is mainly reserved for recurrent neuromas or when the patient has a proximal focal tender trigger point for neuralgia. It decreases the rate of missed neuroma, and it does not require an incision of the transverse metatarsal ligament. The plantar approach permits a more direct exposure of the nerve and allows its more proximal resection. The artery and vein can be better visualized and preserved. The main disadvantages are painful plantar scars and plantar keratosis in about 5% of cases.
