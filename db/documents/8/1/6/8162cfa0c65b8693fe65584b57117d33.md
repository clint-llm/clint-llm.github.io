Disturbed rostrocaudal migration of the neural crest cells (NCC) alongÂ a variable length of the intestine is responsible for HD. GC first migrates to the myenteric plexus and then to the submucosal plexus.

HD affects the rectosigmoid colon in approximately 80 percent of patients. This is short-segment disease. The aganglionosis extends proximally to the sigmoid colon In 15 to 20 percent of patients. This is long-segment disease. The entire colon is affected in only 5%. This is known as total colonic aganglionosis.
