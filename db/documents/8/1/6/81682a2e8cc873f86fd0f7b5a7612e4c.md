Strychnine has been used for years as a medicinal remedy for a broad range of complaints. Strychnine is responsible for inhibiting postsynaptic glycine receptors, mostly in the spinal cord, causing painful, involuntary skeletal muscle spasms. Patients present with episodic muscle contractions with normal mental status and no post-ictal period. Treatment is mainly supportive with benzodiazepines and the management of complications from excessive muscle contractions. The following activity emphasizes the essential knowledge necessary for interprofessional teams to have while treating patients with strychnine toxicity.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of strychnine poisoning.
- Outline the signs and symptoms of strychnine poisoning.
- Summarize the treatment options available in strychnine poisoning.
- Describe the value of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes in the treatment of strychnine poisoning.
