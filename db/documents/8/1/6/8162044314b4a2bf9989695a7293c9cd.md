The two staging systems worth mentioning are the Masaoka-Koga staging system for thymoma and the Ann-Arbor staging system with Cotswold modifications for Hodgkin lymphoma.

The Masaoka-Koga staging system for thymomas has as its basis the local extension of the tumor. Stage I represents an encapsulated tumor. Stage IIA and IIB represent invasion through the capsule and into the surrounding fatty tissue, respectively. Invasion into neighboring organs, such as the pericardium, is denoted by stage III. Stage IVA and IVB encompass pleural or pericardial metastasis and lymphatic-hematologic metastasis, respectively.

The Ann-Arbor staging system with Cotswold modifications has classically been used to stage Hodgkin lymphoma. Stage I disease involves one lymph node region. Stage II disease involves two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm. Lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm denote stage III disease. Stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma encompasses involvement at extranodal sites. In addition to staging, other disease characteristics, or modifications, must be specified. The Ann-Arbor Cotswold modifications include the absence of symptoms (A), presence of B-symptoms (B), bulky disease denoted as greater than 10 cm in diameter (X), and involvement of a single, contiguous, or extranodal site (E).
