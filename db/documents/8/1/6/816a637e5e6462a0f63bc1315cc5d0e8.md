Idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage is a rare condition caused by bleeding into the lower respiratory tract, usually the alveoli. Its classical presentation is a clinical triad of hemoptysis, iron-deficiency anemia, and pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging in the absence of any other identifiable cause of pulmonary or systemic hemorrhage. Early diagnosis leads to prompt treatment and a reduction in mortality and complications. This activity describes the clinical course of the disease and discusses the evaluation and management of patients presenting with idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage.
- Describe the clinical presentation and examination findings of patients presenting with idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage.
- Review the management and treatment options for idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage.
- Summarize the interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination of patients with idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage and improving outcomes.
