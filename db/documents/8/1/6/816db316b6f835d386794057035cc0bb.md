As is commonly the case, most over ingestions involve multiple agents; hence, one must maintain a high index of suspicion.

Immediate initial management must begin with an assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation.  Many patients present with hypotension, bradycardia or tachycardia and altered mental status.  An endotracheal tube or other advanced airways should be placed in patients who are unable to protect their airway.

The cornerstone of treatment is the administration of sodium bicarbonate. It is indicated for patients with an ECG demonstrating a QRS duration >100 ms or any suspicious QT prolongation or dysrhythmia.

Management of hypotension requires a combination of volume resuscitation and vasopressor and inotropic support. Use of inotropic agents such as dobutamine helps increase cardiac output while the effects of the toxicity dissipate. Addition of vasopressors such as norepinephrine, vasopressin, or epinephrine might be considered for hemodynamic support.  These agents lead to vasoconstriction and an increase in the systemic vascular resistance, resulting in increased systemic blood pressure.

Patients with sodium channel blocker toxicity from lidocaine have benefitted from the administration of 20% lipid emulsion if they are hemodynamically unstable.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used in a refractory case with reported survival.

Seizure management is accomplished with benzodiazepine medications, such as lorazepam and midazolam.  For refractory seizures, loading of antiepileptic medications such as levetiracetam is recommended.  Phenytoin and its derivatives should be avoided in this situation as phenytoin is itself a sodium channel blocker and will likely lead to clinical deterioration. Intubation and sedation with propofol should be considered for seizures refractory to other management.
