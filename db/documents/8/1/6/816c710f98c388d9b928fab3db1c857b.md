Estimating the time since death is among the pertinent challenges faced by forensic pathologists and law enforcement agencies worldwide. While this is primarily the bailiwick of the forensic pathologist or medical examiner in collaboration with law enforcement, as is demonstrated in the preceding discussion, this requires collaborative efforts from an interprofessional team, including bio-chemist, pathologists, anthropologists, in addition to the already mentioned forensic pathologist and law enforcement personnel. Other health care practitioners, such as clinicians and nursing, need to understand the processes to provide input when requested and be aware not to damage any evidence accidentally.
