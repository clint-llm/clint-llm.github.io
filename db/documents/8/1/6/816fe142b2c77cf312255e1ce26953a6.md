T-PLL (T Prolymphocytic leukemia) is a mature and aggressive T-cell leukemias characterized by the proliferation of small to medium-sized prolymphocytes that show mature or post-thymic T cell phenotype. T-PLL involves peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and skin. The name "prolymphocyte" is inaccurate, as the tumor cells in this disease are of post-thymic T cell in origin. T-PLL increases in ataxia-telangiectasia (ATM) patients. Whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing have demonstrated mutations in the following genes: IL2RG, JAK1, JAK3, STAT5B, EZH2, FBXW10, and CHEK2. This activity reviews the evaluation of T cell prolymphocytic leukemia and identifies the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the evaluation of a patient with T cell prolymphocytic leukemia.
- Describe the presentation of T cell prolymphocytic leukemia.
- Outline the treatment of T cell prolymphocytic leukemia.
- Summarize the evaluation of T cell prolymphocytic leukemia and identify the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.
