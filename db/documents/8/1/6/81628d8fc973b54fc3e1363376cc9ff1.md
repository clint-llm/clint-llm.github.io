Endemic to China, the malignancy shows a variable rate of occurrence ranging from high incidence in the Southern part of China to a low rate in the White population and Northern China. This activity describes in detail the incidence, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, evaluation, and treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer and highlights the role of the interprofessional team healthcare team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx.
- Review the management options available for squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance care and allow early detection of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and improve outcomes.
