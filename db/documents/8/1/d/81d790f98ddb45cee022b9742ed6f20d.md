Posterior urethral valves are a complicated condition causing a range of pathology across organ systems at different stages in life, requiring different approaches from the healthcare team. The diagnosis of posterior urethral valves requires a multidisciplinary approach. The presentation based on presenting age or previous management history may range from an unwell neonate with pulmonary hypoplasia and urinary retention to managing chronic kidney disease in children in the community. A critical step is transitioning from pediatric to adult services, and effective handover of care is associated with improved long-term outcomes.
