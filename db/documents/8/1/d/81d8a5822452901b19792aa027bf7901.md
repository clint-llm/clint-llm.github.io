The artery of Adamkiewicz is significant in that it is the only major arterial supply supplying the anterior spinal artery along the lower thoracic, lumbar, and sacral segments of the spinal cord. Injury to this artery can cause neurologic damage manifesting asÂ fecal and urinary incontinence, and impaired motor function, although the sensory function is usually preserved.
