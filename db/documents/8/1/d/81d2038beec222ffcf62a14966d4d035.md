Intestinal perforation, defined as a loss of continuity of the bowel wall, is a potentially devastating complication that may result from a variety of disease processes. Common causes of perforation include trauma, instrumentation, inflammation, infection, malignancy, ischemia, and obstruction. Early recognition and prompt treatment are critical to prevent the morbidity and potential mortality of peritonitis and its systemic sequelae that result from the spillage of intestinal contents. This activity reviews the cause and presentation of intestinal perforation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of intestinal perforation.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with suspected intestinal perforation.
- Summarize the treatment of intestinal perforation.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by intestinal perforation.
