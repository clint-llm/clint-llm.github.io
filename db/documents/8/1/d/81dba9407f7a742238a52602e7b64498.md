Limited literature reports a histopathological correlation between anlage ducts and congenital lacrimal fistulae. The most common finding in numerous studies is a hypertrophic squamous epithelium lining. Occasionally, translational epithelium and granulation tissue have been reported.

Anecdotal reports have reported a columnar epithelium with intervening goblet cells. Subepithelial layers are generally affected by a chronic inflammatory process with infiltration or fibrosis. The epithelium lining with the lacrimal sac generally transforms into cuboidal cells.
