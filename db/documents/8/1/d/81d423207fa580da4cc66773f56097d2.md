After meeting the clinical criteria for diagnosis, lab tests help direct physicians towards making a correct diagnosis.

Erythropoietin levels will be elevated in Diamond Blackfan anemia due to a lack of EPO receptors in the setting of erythroid aplasia. Other biological tests may include immune phenotyping and Igg/IgA agglutinin titer.

For molecular diagnosis, the first step is to characterize the phenotype with a bone marrow evaluation.

Molecular tests are done to identify a heterozygous pathogenic variant in genes commonly involved in DBA.

Three types of molecular testing include serial single-gene testing and multigene panel.

Parvovirus B19 is a common cause of bone marrow failure, making it mandatory to have parvovirus B19 serology or blood parvovirus B19 PCR done in patients where DBA is suspected.

Common hematological workup includes complete blood count with differential, hemoglobin F, ADA, erythropoietin level, reticulocytes count, peripheral blood smear.
