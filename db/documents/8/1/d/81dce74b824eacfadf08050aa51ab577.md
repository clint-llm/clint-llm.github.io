Gastrointestinal bleed is the most common diagnosis among GI-related hospital admissions. Of all the GI hemorrhages, nearly 50% are due to upper GI bleeding. The most common causes of upper GI bleed include peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal varices, esophagitis, angioectasia, and vascular lesions. The etiology is unknown in about 8% of the cases.

Cameron lesion is a rare cause of occult upper GI bleed. Cameron lesions are linear gastric ulcers or erosions on the mucosal folds at the diaphragmatic impression in patients with a large hiatal hernia. Cameron lesions were first described in 1986 by Cameron and Higgins. The lesions were seen in people who had the chest X-ray showing one-third or more of the stomach above the diaphragm. Of the total cases, 50% were found to be anemic.
