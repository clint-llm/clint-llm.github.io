The primary adverse effects of albuterol therapy are tremors and nervousness, mostly seen in children who are 2 to 6 years of age, though can be seen at any age. Tremors are the result of activation of the beta-2 receptors found on the motor nerve terminals which increases intracellular cAMP. These side effects occur in approximately one in every five patients. Other side effects include insomnia and nausea, which occur in approximately 1 in every ten patients. Less common adverse effects may include fever, bronchospasm, vomiting, headache, dizziness, cough, allergic reactions, otitis media, epistaxis, increased appetite, urinary tract infections, dry mouth, gas, hyperhidrosis, pain, dyspepsia, hyperactivity, chills, lymphadenopathy, ocular pruritus, sweating, conjunctivitis, and dysphonia. Albuterol also has been shown to increase blood pressure and may cause hypokalemia. Increased blood glucose concentrations and prolonged QTc interval and ST-segment depression have occurred, although rarely.
