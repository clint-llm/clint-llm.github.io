Ultrasound is a tool that is widely available, relatively inexpensive, and timely, which makes it invaluable in evaluating emergency situations. One of these medical emergencies is ovarian torsion, in which there is twisting about the vascular pedicle of the infundibulopelvic ligament and utero-ovarian ligament.

Because of variability in blood flow appearance secondary to setting adjustment, the contralateral normal ovary should be compared.

Seeing some or all of these findings on ultrasound will strongly suggest ovarian torsion. However, there are a few caveats. Due to the dual blood supply from both the ovarian artery running through the infundibulopelvic ligament and the uterine artery from the abdominal aorta, a patient without symptoms may demonstrate an apparent lack of blood flow to the ovary.

Furthermore, the ovary may alternate between being torsed and reconfigured to its original position, which means that some of the aforementioned signs may not be present at the time of the ultrasound.
