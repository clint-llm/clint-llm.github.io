The most common presentation for VF is sudden collapse from cardiac arrest leading to SCD. This results from improper ventricular contraction resulting in low cardiac output. Patients may demonstrate signs of acute MI such as chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, and vomiting before the event. Patients with a known history of coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure may show a worsening of chronic symptoms such as angina, dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and pedal edema. At the time of presentation, patients are unconscious, unresponsive, and have no palpable pulse. Without prompt action, this leads to death within the next few minutes. Patients with ICD for primary or secondary prevention can experience shock from ICD firing at the time of experiencing VF.
