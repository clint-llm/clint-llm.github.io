Diagnosis of rectal prolapse is most commonly made based on history and physical alone. As mentioned above, prolapse often resolves by the time the patient reaches medical attention, and thus the clinician must rely on history for diagnosis. Patients with constipation as the likely cause of their prolapse should receive contrast radiography of the colon and anorectal manometry.
