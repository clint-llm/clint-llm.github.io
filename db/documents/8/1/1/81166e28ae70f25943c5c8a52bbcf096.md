**Transport Across the Blood-Brain Barrier**

Cerebral capillary ECs are unique from peripheral capillary ECs in that they contain a significant number of tight junctions, have fewer cytoplasmic vesicles, and have a higher concentration of mitochondria. These tight junctions limit paracellular movement and divide the membranes of ECs into two distinct sides with different membrane compositions.

**Diffusion**

The diffusion of substances into the brain is achieved via paracellular or transcellular pathways. To a minor extent, small water-soluble molecules can use simple diffusion to travel through the tight junctions of the BBB. Similarly, small lipid-soluble substances, such as alcohol or steroid hormones, can transcellularly penetrate the BBB via the dissolution of their lipid plasma membrane. For all other substances, including glucose and amino acids, specialized transport routes are needed to cross the BBB.

**Transport Proteins**

Transport proteins are essential for specific solutes, such as glucose or amino acids, to cross the BBB. These solutes bind to a protein transporter on one side of the membrane, triggering a conformational change in the protein and the subsequent transport of the substance from high to low concentration. Should a charged compound need to be moved against the concentration gradient, ATP supplies the energy for this process.

**Efflux Pumps**

Efflux pumps are responsible for expelling both endogenous and exogenous compounds, such as drugs, from the brain into the blood. Of particular importance, active drug efflux transporters of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) gene family are important determinants of drug distribution to and elimination from the CNS. This mechanism is seen as a significant obstacle in that it can limit the distribution of medications that are beneficial to treat CNS diseases.

**Receptor-Mediated Transcytosis (RMT)**

Receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) allows for the selective uptake of macromolecules. Cerebral ECs have receptors for the uptake of specific molecules, including the insulin receptor, transferrin receptor, and lipoprotein transport receptor. Selective molecules bind to their receptors in clathrin-coated pits, specialized areas of the plasma membrane. These coated pits invaginate into the cytoplasm and are pinched free to form coated vesicles. The ligand can dissociate from the receptor once acidification of the endosome is complete and cross to the other side of the membrane.

**Adsorptive-Mediated Transcytosis (AMT)**

Adsorptive-mediated transcytosis (AMT), also known as pinocytosis, is triggered by the interaction between a positively charged protein and the negatively charged surface of the plasma membrane. In essence, cationic molecules can bind to the luminal surface of endothelial cells and subsequently undergo exocytosis at the abluminal surface. The high mitochondrial content in cerebral endothelial cells provides the necessary means for the molecules to move through the endothelial cytoplasm.

**Cell-Mediated Transcytosis (CMT)**

Cell-mediated transcytosis (CMT) is a well-established mechanism for pathogen entry into the brain via the "Trojan horse" model, which utilizes immune cells, such as macrophages and monocytes, to travel across the BBB. While the other previously mentioned transport pathways allow only molecules with specific properties to cross the BBB, CMT can be used for any type of molecule to cross the BBB. For example, HIV-infected cells utilize CMT via diapedesis through intact endothelial cells of the BBB. This route of transport has more recently been identified as a possible route of drug transport for pharmaceutical uses.
