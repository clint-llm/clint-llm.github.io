The choice of biopsy site depends on the location of the lesion of interest. However in widespread disease, it is wise to avoid problematic areas that may yield unremarkable histopathologic results or may result in a cosmetically unfavorable outcome. For example, surgical sites below the knee have a higher risk of infection or poor healing, and sites on the back tend to stretch and deform. Other unfavorable sites include the central face and ventral forearm.
