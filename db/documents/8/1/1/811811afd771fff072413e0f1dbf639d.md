Since each patient is different, there is no way to predict how detrimental nasal polyps can be to someone's health and personal circumstances. In many situations, people live daily with nasal polyps without knowing it and do not seek medical care for their bothersome symptoms. Once identified, patients with nasal polyps should undergo a complete medical evaluation. Besides the improvement in their nasal breathing, patients should understand that the etiology of the nasal polyps should be narrowed down and that additional clinical evaluation by a pulmonologist and allergist will help in the management of the disease and in identifying and treating additional undiagnosed comorbidities such as asthma.

One important remark towards patient education is adherence to treatment. It has been shown that consistent use of high-volume low-pressure nasal saline irrigation, in addition to twice-daily intranasal corticosteroids, improve the QOL of those affected. Many patients with nasal polyposis will experience recurrence due to a lack of adherence to the daily nasal spray. It is important to follow-up with patients closely and reiterate the importance of compliance with the medication to see optimal results.
