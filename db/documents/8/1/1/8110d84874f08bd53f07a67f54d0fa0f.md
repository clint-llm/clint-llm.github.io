M. pneumoniae has adherence proteins that can attach to epithelial membranes, particularly the respiratory tract epithelium. Once attached, M. pneumoniae produces hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, causing injury to epithelial cells and their associated cilia. Antibodies produced against M. pneumoniae may act as autoantibodies since they crossreact with human brain cells and RBCs. The pathogenesis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae includes the activation of inflammatory cytokines.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae has a gliding movement and specific tip organelles that help in burrowing between cilia in respiratory epithelium, leading to the sloughing of the respiratory epithelial cells. The prolonged refractory cough is considered to be due to inhibition of the ciliary movement.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae causes extrapulmonary illnesses and respiratory tract infection, including immune thrombocytopenic purpura, acute hepatitis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, arthritis, and transverse myelitis.
