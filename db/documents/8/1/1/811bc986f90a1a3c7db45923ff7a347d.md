The five histologic subtypes encountered in medulloblastoma include:

- classic

- desmoplastic-nodular (D/N)

- large-cell anaplastic (LC/A)

- melanotic

- medullomyoblastoma

In classic medulloblastoma, sheets of small round cells, possessing a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, are noted. They have a high invasive tendency and possess occasional neuroblastic differentiation. The classic type constitutes approximately 70% of medulloblastomas. Nodules of tumor cells displaying neurocytic differentiation on a collagen-rich matrix characterize the desmoplastic variant; these tumors are less aggressive than the classic variant and account for 15% of medulloblastomas. Large-cell anaplastic medulloblastomas, as the designation suggests, demonstrate features of anaplasia. These features are large tumor cells with abundant cytoplasm, pleomorphic nuclei, and prominent nucleoli. These tumors are typically located in the cerebellar vermis and are highly aggressive, demonstrating high mitotic and apoptotic activity with large areas of necrosis. Consequently, the prognosis is especially poor with short survival times after diagnosis. They constitute approximately 10% of medulloblastomas.
