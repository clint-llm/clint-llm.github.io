Breast reconstruction is often performed following breast cancer surgery. While the actual procedure is typically performed by a plastic surgeon, the patient is often followed by a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or other members of the surgeon's clinical team. The primary care provider remains an essential member of this team and will likely see such patients in the perioperative period as well as long-term. Hence, these healthcare workers need to be familiar with the potential complications of the procedure. Additionally, before the procedure, they should advise the patient regarding smoking cessation and overall health in preparation for one or more surgical procedures.
