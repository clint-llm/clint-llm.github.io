Follicular lymphoma is an incurable B-cell neoplasm characterized by substantial biochemical and clinical heterogeneity. As the most prevalent indolent lymphoma and the second most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), it has a relapsing and remitting course with the potential to progress to aggressive disease. About 20% of the patients with follicular lymphoma develop disease progression within the first two years of chemotherapy, with an overall 5-year survival rate of 50%.Â The duration of remission appears to have prognostic significance, as those who relapse within 24 months of chemotherapy or within 12 months of rituximab are reported to have a poor prognosis.

While anti-CD20-based chemoimmunotherapy remains an essential standard of treatment, more biologically active agents are increasingly used. This review explores the different diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma.
