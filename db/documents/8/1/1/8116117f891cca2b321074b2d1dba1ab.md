Altitude-related conditions can range from mild and discomforting to severe and life-threatening. Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a common entity in those who have had a recent change in elevation above 8000 ft and is usually mild, but it may be severe enough to warrant EMS activation, especially in a challenging environment.  High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) and high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) are life-threatening diagnoses, and EMS will almost certainly be involved in these cases.  EMS is in a unique position to assist in these cases as evacuation is not simply getting patients to treatment; evacuation; specifically, descent from the affecting elevation and hypoxic environment is the treatment.  Any EMS system that will potentially be operating at altitudes near or over 8000 feet above sea level should be prepared to deal with altitude-related conditions.
