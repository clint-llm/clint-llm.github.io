Goodpasture syndrome also referred to as anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease, is an autoimmune disease that affects both the kidneys and lungs by the formation of autoantibodies that attack their basement membranes. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of Goodpasture syndrome and explains the interprofessional team's role in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the role of autoantibodies against glomerular basement membranes in the pathophysiology of Goodpasture syndrome.
- Explain the use of kidney biopsy in the evaluation of Goodpasture syndrome.
- Review the management of Goodpasture syndrome.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by Goodpasture syndrome.
