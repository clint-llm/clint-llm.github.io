Eptifibatide is a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa class platelet inhibitor drug used to reduce ischemic cardiac events in specific patient populations. A protein found in the venom of a southeastern pygmy rattlesnake is used to make eptifibatide. FDA has approved this medicine for the medical management of unstable angina (UA) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). FDA also approved eptifibatide for patients undergoing PCI, including intracoronary stenting. The IMPACT-II trial proved that eptifibatide use with heparin and aspirin reduces ischemic events following a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), especially in individuals with unstable angina. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, administration, adverse effects, contraindications, warnings, precautions, monitoring, and toxicity of eptifibatide.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of eptifibatide.
- Describe the adverse effects of eptifibatide.
- Explain the appropriate monitoring of eptifibatide.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the use of eptifibatide and improve outcomes.
