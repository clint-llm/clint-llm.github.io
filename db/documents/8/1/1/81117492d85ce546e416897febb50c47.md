A duodenal biopsy is performed during endoscopy in either a directed or random manner. The biopsy results further characterize visualized areas on endoscopy and can also diagnose abnormalities, such as celiac disease. This activity describes duodenal biopsy and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients who undergo duodenal biopsy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of duodenal biopsies for clinical management.
- Explain the typical findings in duodenal biopsies of patients with celiac disease.
- Summarize the complications associated with duodenal biopsy.
- Review the importance of communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate clinical management and treatment after duodenal biopsy interpretation.
