A well-balanced, nutrient-rich diet prevents vitamin A deficiency in generally healthy patients able to absorb nutrition. In resource-rich regions, the majority of the population has access to vegetables, meats, and staple foods that are fortified with vitamin A. In resource-poor countries, large scale vitamin A supplementation programs have been implemented in attempts to provide high dose vitamin A at the WHO-recommended intervals.

Associated programs educate people on nutrition, breastfeeding, and VAD symptoms. These have had variable success depending on the region.
