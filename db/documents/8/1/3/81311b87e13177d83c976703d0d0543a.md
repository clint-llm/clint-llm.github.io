Pre-operative evaluation should include echocardiography for detailed anatomic definition. Additional imaging with magnetic resonance imaging and/or cardiac catheterization may be helpful to provide a further anatomical and physiological evaluation in complex defects, although these are generally not required for simple defects such as a VSD. The focus of pre-operative management should be to minimize left to right shunt by providing systemic afterload reduction and aggressive diuresis, especially in patients with congestive heart failure symptoms. In patients with severe pulmonary over circulation, respiratory support may be required, and adequate oxygenation and ventilation are maintained using mechanical ventilator support, especially in the setting of pulmonary edema. Attention to avoid excessive oxygen is important, as the pulmonary vasodilatory effective of inspired oxygen will act as a pulmonary vasodilator that will augment pulmonary flow.
