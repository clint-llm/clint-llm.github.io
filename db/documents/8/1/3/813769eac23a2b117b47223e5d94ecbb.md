Evaluation of suspected myotonia should involve the exclusion of other more common pathologies that may present similarly, followed by confirmatory testing if negative. The patient will most commonly present with muscle hypertrophy, a positive family history, and muscle stiffness with repeated activity. The creatine kinase may be elevated. Abnormal thyroid function should be ruled out due to a similar presentation. Other etiologies, such as inflammatory or toxic myopathies, should be considered in the right clinical context. Testing for dystrophic and non-dystrophic myotonia will require a needle electromyogram (EMG) study, with long and short exercise testing. However, genetic testing is the gold standard and can identify over 130 mutations known to result in non-dystrophia myotonia.

For a patient with suspected hypokalemic or hyperkalemic period paralysis, evaluation should include a laboratory test demonstrating high or low levels of potassium in the blood, along with the history & physical rxam findings noted in that section above. The patient should first be evaluated for other more common causes of increased or decreased serum potassium. At a minimum, the patient should be evaluated for renal dysfunction, iatrogenic causes of hypo/hyperkalemia, gastrointestinal loss, and basic endocrine function. Confirmatory testing for the periodic paralyses also requires needle electromyogram studies or genetic testing, with genetic testing as the gold standard.
