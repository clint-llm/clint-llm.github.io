The corpus callosum is the largest white matter structure containing 200 million axons, connecting the two hemispheres of the brain. Agenesis of the corpus callosum is one of the most common congenital cerebral malformations, which is morphologically the complete or partial absence of corpus callosum and is not defined by functional or behavioral abnormalities (as in autism). This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of corpus callosum agenesis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the various genetic etiologies of corpus callosum agenesis.
- Review a full diagnostic workup for agenesis of the corpus callosum, including any diagnostic imaging studies.
- Summarize the limited options for the management of patients with agenesis of the corpus callosum.
- Explain possible interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and treatment of corpus callosum agenesis and improve outcomes.
