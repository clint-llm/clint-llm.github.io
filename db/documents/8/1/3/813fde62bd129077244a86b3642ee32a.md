The midgut development is a multifaceted process requiring regulatory genes and signaling pathways. The interaction among embryologic tissues and growth factors involved in this process of midgut differentiation is subject to a variety of insults that can be the source of specific pathologies diagnosed either in utero or postpartum. A sound understanding of theÂ embryonic development of the midgut helps in a deeper understanding of the basis of many congenital gastrointestinal conditions.
