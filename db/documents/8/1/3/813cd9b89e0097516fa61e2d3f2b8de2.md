As previously mentioned, the underlying etiology of the sign of Leser-Trelat is believed to be an internal malignancy. The sign of Leser-Trelat may precede, occur concurrently, or start after the diagnosis of malignancy. The most commonly implicated malignancies include gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas (gastric, colon, rectal), with gastric adenocarcinoma being the overall most common malignancy, followed by breast cancer, and lymphoproliferative disorders/lymphoma. Additional malignancies reported to display the sign of Leser-Trelat include melanoma, prostate, lung, kidney, laryngeal, ovarian, mycosis fungoides, hepatocellular carcinoma, bladder cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.

Curth's postulates are a well-known set of clinical criteria that were created to help evaluate the temporal relationship between an underlying malignancy and a specific dermatological condition. The criteria are as follows:

- Both the neoplastic and paraneoplastic process began concurrently

- Both the neoplastic and paraneoplastic processes have a parallel disease course (i.e., paraneoplastic process resolves with treatment of the underlying malignancy, and paraneoplastic process relapses if malignancy returns)

- The paraneoplastic process is associated with specific types of malignancy

- The skin lesions are not associated with any potential underlying genetic syndromes

- The skin lesions are not common in the general population

- There is a strong statistical association of the paraneoplastic process with truly having an underlying malignancy.

As previously mentioned, the sign of Leser-Trelat has been met with an abundance of skepticism by many physicians, likely due to the inability of the sign of Leser-Trelat to confidently fulfill all of Curth's postulates.
