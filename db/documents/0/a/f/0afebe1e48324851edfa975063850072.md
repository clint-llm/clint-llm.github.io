Gilbert syndrome presents in patients as a mild, intermittent, and prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia without hemolysis. It also presents with normal LDH and haptoglobin  levels and reticulocyte counts in addition to normal liver function tests. Liver ultrasound is normal . In fact, Gilbert syndrome is most commonly asymptomatic, and it is often found incidentally on routine blood testing conducted for other reasons. Upon physical exam, this syndrome can manifest as jaundice. Nonspecific symptoms of abdominal cramps, fatigue, and malaise may also present with the disease. A thorough history should be taken to ascertain whether the patient is taking drugs that are metabolized through glucuronidation such as tolbutamide, rifamycin, HIV protease inhibitors, gemfibrozil, and statins, which could contribute to drug toxicity.

Crigler-Najjar type 1 syndrome presents with jaundice in infants several days after they are born. This jaundice becomes rapidly more severe in the second week of the infant’s life. Patients have the potential to develop kernicterus and show symptoms such as extrapyramidal dystonia, hearing loss, and oculomotor paresis. Crigler-Najjar type 2 syndrome is most often asymptomatic but can present with jaundice and kernicterus during times of stress, illness, or fasting when bilirubin levels exceed more than 15 mg/dl.
