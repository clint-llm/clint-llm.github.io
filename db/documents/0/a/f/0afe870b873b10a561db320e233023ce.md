Patient education programs are fundamental to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and their complications. They are designed to allow people with chronic conditions to actively participate in managing their condition, promoting self-care behavior, and modifying risk factors. The goals are to improve health outcomes and decrease the incidence of complications for patients by supporting, not replacing, medical care. Educational interventions in cardiac care have been shown to increase physical activity, healthier dietary habits, and smoking cessation. The delivery of patient education programs can vary substantially: locations can be in clinics, classrooms, or homes; the target could be an individual or groups, and content could be tailored or generic. Common topics include nutrition, exercise, risk factor modification, psychosocial well-being, and medications.
