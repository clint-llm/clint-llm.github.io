Erythrasma is most commonly observed in the toe webs followed by the groin crease. It is less commonly found in the axilla. Patients may give a history of mildly pruritic skin discoloration in any of those areas. Patients may also complain of scaling skin. The skin is usually dark red and moist. The intensity of pruritus can vary. The skin lesion is well demarcated as a macular patch. Often the skin will have a wrinkled appearance.

**Interdigital**

C. minutissimum is the most common cause of bacterial infection of the interdigital spaces of the feet. It will cause maceration and scaling. It most often occurs between the fourth and fifth toes. It is mostly asymptomatic but can be pruritic. It does occur occasionally with dermatophyte or candidal infections. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation may be necessary to assess for coexisting infection.

**Intertriginous**

Also either mildly pruritic or asymptomatic. It occurs as patches or plaques in intertriginous areas and results in a "cigarette paper" appearance of the skin. It may have a fine-scale.

**Disciform**

A rare form of erythrasma that may affect any part of the body. It is more often seen in black women in tropical climates. It is characterized by well defined scaly plaques on the trunk and proximal parts of the limbs that have coral-red fluorescence under Wood's lamp.
