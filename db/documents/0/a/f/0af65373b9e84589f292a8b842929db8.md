While there is no consensus regarding criteria for evaluating POI, it is important to evaluate any female who presents with primary or secondary amenorrhea. POI is associated with various disease processes that may lead to either primary or secondary amenorrhea.

In the setting of secondary amenorrhea, first and foremost a pregnancy test must be completed to exclude pregnancy. Following a negative pregnancy test, it is appropriate to evaluate for any chronic medical conditions that affect the overall health of the patient (eg. uncontrolled diabetes, heart disease) as well as evaluation for any evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary axis depression in situations of extreme physical activity levels, depression, or anorexia.

It would be appropriate to order various laboratory work such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and prolactin to aid in the evaluation and diagnosis of an endocrine abnormality.

If the etiology of POI remains undetermined after all of the aforementioned diseases have been appropriately excluded, then the next step in the evaluation of suspected POI would be to perform genetic screening. It is possible to use a patient’s family history to guide the physician in ordering the correct genetic screening test. However, it is important to remember that the impact of these associated gene mutations on POI has not been robustly determined.
