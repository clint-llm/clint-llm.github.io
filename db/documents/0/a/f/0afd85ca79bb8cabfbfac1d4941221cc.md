The thalamus is a paired gray matter structure of the diencephalon located near the center of the brain. It is above the midbrain or mesencephalon, allowing for nerve fiber connections to the cerebral cortex in all directions — each thalamus connects to the other via the interthalamic adhesion. The thalamus forms the upper and lateral walls of the third ventricle while the dorsal surface is part of the floor of the body of the lateral ventricle. Laterally, the thalamus limits with the posterior arm of the internal capsule. Anterolaterally, it limits with the head of the caudate and ventral nucleus with the subthalamus and hypothalamus.

While the thalamus is mostly gray matter (cell bodies of neurons), there are some areas of white matter (axons). The external and internal medullary laminae are white matter structures of the thalamus. The external medullary laminae cover the lateral surface of the thalamus, and the internal medullary laminae divide the thalamic nuclei into anterior, medial, and lateral groups.

The thalamus is made up of a series of nuclei which are responsible for the relay of the different sensory signals. These nuclei are formed mainly by neurons of excitatory and inhibitory nature. The thalamocortical neurons receive sensory or motor information from the rest of the body and present selected information via nerve fibers (thalamocortical radiations) to the cerebral cortex. The thalamus also has connections with the hippocampus, mammillary bodies, and fornix via the mammillothalamic tract.

Generally, the thalamus acts as a relay station filtering information between the brain and body. Except for olfaction, every sensory system has a thalamic nucleus that receives, processes, and sends information to an associated cortical area. The lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus receives visual sensory information from the retina to route to the visual cortex of the occipital lobe. The medial geniculate nucleus receives auditory sensory information from inferior colliculus and projects it to the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe. The ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus is subdivided further by three. The spinothalamic tract is the sensory pathway for pain, temperature and crude touch that originates in the spinal cord and feeds into the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus for further processing, while the ventral posteromedial nucleus receives sensory information from the trigeminal nerve about the face. Lastly, the ventral intermediate nucleus has correlations with pathological tremors.

The reticular nucleus is in the ventral portion of the thalamus and forms a capsule around the thalamus laterally. Interestingly, this nucleus does not project to the cerebral cortex; rather, its function is to process and modulate information it receives from other thalamic nuclei. The reticular nucleus also receives disinhibitory input from the globus pallidus allowing for the initiation of voluntary movement.

Functionally, the thalamus divides into five major functional components as

- Reticular and intralaminar nuclei dealing with arousal and pain regulation

- Sensory nuclei regulating all sensory domains except olfaction

- Effector nuclei governing motor  language function

- Associative nuclei connoting cognitive functions

- Limbic nuclei encompassing mood and motivation
