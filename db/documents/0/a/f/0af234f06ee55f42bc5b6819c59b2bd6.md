Vestibular rehabilitation exercises have few complications, with associated nausea or symptom increase being the most prevalent. Exercises can be modified through duration and intensity, and sometimes antiemetic medication may be necessary in conjunction with exercises in the case of prolonged vertigo following vestibular exercises. In rare cases, those undergoing canalith repositioning for BPPV can suffer cervical and vascular injury if underlying pathologies are present, which is why a thorough cervical screen and history review are imperative.

Unresolved vestibular hypofunction and failure to habituate the vestibular system can lead to compensatory strategies, namely, reducing cervical mobility to avoid provocative motions. This reduction in mobility can lead to long-term changes in the cervical spine and overall deconditioning due to a lack of regular mobility.
