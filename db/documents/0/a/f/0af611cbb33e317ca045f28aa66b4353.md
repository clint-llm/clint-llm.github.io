**2011, ACCF/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention**

**Indications of percutaneous coronary intervention to improve mortality**:

- In unprotected left main artery with ST-elevation myocardial infarction: If distal flow to vessel less than TIMI III and percutaneous coronary intervention can be done much quicker and safer than CABG (Class II-a)

- In unprotected left main artery with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction or Unstable angina: If CABG can not be performed (Class II-a)

- In unprotected left main artery with stable ischemic heart disease: If two of the following present 1) LOW-risk PCI (Syntax<22) and ostial or trunk involvement 2) Increase risk of surgical adverse events ( STS score < 5 (Class II-a)

- In triple vessel coronary artery disease with or without Proximal LAD: (Class II-a)

- In two-vessel disease with proximal LAD: (Class II-b)

- In two-vessel disease without proximal LAD: (Class II-b)

- In one vessel disease with proximal LAD: (Class II-b)

- For patients with the survivor of sudden cardiac death with presumed ischemia-mediated ventricular tachycardia (Class I)

**Indications of percutaneous coronary intervention to improve symptoms:**

- Percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with persistent angina despite optimal medical management to improve symptoms with single or more significant (>70% diameter) coronary artery disease and amenable to revascularization. (Class I)

- Percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with persistent angina to improve symptoms with single or more significant (>70% diameter) coronary artery disease and medical management can not be given because of medication contraindication, adverse effects, or patient preferences. (Class II-a)

- Percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with persistent angina despite optimal medical management to improve symptoms with single or more significant (>70% diameter) coronary artery disease and associated with ischemia. (Class II-a)
