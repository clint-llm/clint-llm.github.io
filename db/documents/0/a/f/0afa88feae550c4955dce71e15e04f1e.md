Fibroblasts stem from a mesenchymal origin and have an elongated spindle or stellate shape with a multitude of cytoplasmic projections. Within the cytoplasm is an abundance of rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) and a large Golgi apparatus. Myofibroblasts appear similarly to both fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells with additional distinguished features of nuclear membrane folds and long collections of microfilaments connecting to surrounding myofibroblasts and the extracellular matrix.
