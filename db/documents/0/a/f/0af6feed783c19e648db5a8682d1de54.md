Diagnosis and management of the epiretinal membrane (ERM) require appropriate diagnostic and surgical skills in addition to the availability of special equipment. Even though the diagnostic procedures are done by trained personnel, interpretation and diagnosis are made by a trained ophthalmologist. Hence appropriate referral to an ophthalmologist is mandatory for patients who present to primary eye care with decreased visual acuity and metamorphopsia unresolved by refractory correction. Surgical management needs intervention from a retinal surgeon, and hence a liaison between a general ophthalmologist or optometrist is mandatory in the care of patients with epiretinal membranes.
