The diagnosis of nevus anemicus requires practitioners to rule out other conditions on the leukoderma differential diagnosis. These includes but is not limited to vitiligo, pityriasis alba, nevus depigmentosus, tinea versicolor, tuberous sclerosis, halo nevus, piebaldism, Hansen disease (leprosy), and physical leukodermas (mechanical, chemical, or thermal). Vitiligo is characterized by well-demarcated depigmented macules and patches with irregular borders which may have a surrounding rim of hyperpigmentation or erythema, along with white hairs within the lesion. Nevus depigmentosus presents as hypopigmented patches within the first three years of life but will not show the characteristic lack of redness in response to trauma, heat, or cold which is seen in nevus anemicus. Pityriasis alba is most often diagnosed in patients with associated atopic dermatitis, while tinea versicolor presents as hypopigmented maculesÂ after increased episodes of diaphoresis. The latter two lesions do not have the congenital onset seen in nevus anemicus.
