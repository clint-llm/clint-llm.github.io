EMS zones of care are dynamic and fluid. Each zone has its inherent risks, equipment, and requirements for personal protective equipment. Responders must also take into account the effects of weather and how this can alter the zones of care in real-time. The environment can be chaotic and messy, which can lead to further injury to the provider or patient.  Safety is paramount and the goal is to effectively transition the patients from the location of potential harm to definitive care.
