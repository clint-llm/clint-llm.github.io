Pulmonary atresia with the intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS) is a rare and complex form of congenital heart defects with a broad spectrum of presentation. An insult during sensitive stages of embryological development is proposed to lead to PA-IVS. The presentation of this entity is similar to other complex cyanotic congenital heart defects with decreased pulmonary blood flow like tetralogy of Fallot.

The echocardiogram plays a vital role in diagnosing PA-IVS. Cardiac catheterization provides additional information regarding the status of the coronary circulation.

The management of patients with this heart defect is complex.Â Many therapeutic algorithms guide the medical team in the management of these patients.
