Complications related to TAP blocks are rare. Given that abdominal wall blocks are field blocks, relying primarily on the volume of the local anesthetic to facilitate adequate blockade rather than targeting a specific nerve, neurological injury is rare. Neurologic injury may arise due to direct nerve trauma from the needle, hematoma, or local infection.Â Excessive needle insertion may also lead to complications such as intraperitoneal injection, visceral trauma, vascular injury, and liver trauma. Reports have also described transient femoral nerve palsy.
