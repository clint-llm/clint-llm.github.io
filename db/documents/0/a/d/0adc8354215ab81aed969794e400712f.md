It is important to keep in mind that the presentation of history and physical exam findings is often ambiguous and may evolve. When taking a history, focus the interview on diving and symptom history. Diving history includes asking about the frequency of dives, depth of dives, a history of rapid ascent or other problems during the dive, the experience of the diver, the quality of equipment used, and history or prior decompression illnesses.

Ask the patient about their symptom history, specifically when the first symptoms started. The stage of the dive when symptoms occur can help differentiate barotrauma from gas toxicity and decompression illness. Barotrauma is more likely to occur on descent, gas toxicities will be most prominent at depth, and decompression illness(DCI) usually occurs on or after ascent.  AGE symptoms occur within a few minutes of surfacing while DCS symptoms usually take hours to present. Another helpful distinguishing factor between AGE and DCS is the type of symptoms. AGE usually presents with pulmonary and cerebral problems. DCS presents more often with joint and spinal cord involvement. Other items to address are past medical history and risk factors for dysbarism such as dehydration, URI, allergies, high workload, poor fitness, and increasing age. A physical examination should include an ear, pulmonary, skin, joint, and neurological evaluation. Many minor DCS patients will have a normal exam, vitals, and mental status. More serious cases may involve significant neurological abnormalities such as paralysis. During the ear and pulmonary exam, look for signs of otic or pulmonary barotrauma. A thorough neurologic exam is mandated so as not to miss subtle findings of injury including cranial nerves, motor, sensory, reflexes, vestibular, cerebellar function, and a mini-mental status exam.
