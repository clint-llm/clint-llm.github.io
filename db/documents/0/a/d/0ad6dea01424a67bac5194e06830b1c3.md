The cerebral venous system divides into a superficial and deep component. The superior sagittal sinus is the major component of the superficial cerebral venous system and knowledge of this structure, and its variations are of practical clinical importance to neurosurgeons, neurologists, and radiologists in the treatment of a number of conditions. A strong anatomical understanding of the superior sagittal sinus is crucial for the clinician, as this dictates the treatment approach for the patient. The superior sagittal sinus is a midline vein without valves or tunica muscularis that courses along the falx cerebri, draining many of the cerebral structures surrounding it.
