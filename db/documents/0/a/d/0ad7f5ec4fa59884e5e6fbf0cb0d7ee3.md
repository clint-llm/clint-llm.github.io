The clinical relevance of prescription drug advertisements significantly impacts prescribing decisions and, ultimately, patient care. In a cross-sectional survey of seventy-eight physicians, physicians judged that prescriptions due to DTCA drug requests were substantially more unlikely to be indicated for similar patients compared with drug prescriptions not requested by patients.

To minimize inappropriate prescriptions, it can be helpful to implement a systematic approach, such as the eight-step approach advocated by the World Health Organization.

- Evaluate and clearly define the patient’s problem

- Specify the therapeutic objective

- Select the appropriate drug therapy

- Initiate therapy with appropriate details and consider nonpharmacologic therapies

- Give information, instructions, and warnings

- Evaluate therapy regularly

- Consider drug cost when prescribing

- Use computers and other tools to reduce prescribing errors

Clinicians must interpret drug advertisements and have a good understanding of the risks and benefits of any new medication. This includes indications for the drug as well as its contraindications. This information is often highlighted in the last section of an advertisement, which may include a list of co-prescribed medications or medical conditions that have been found in clinical trials to be correlated with adverse events. A thorough medical history must be obtained, and drug contraindications and safety profiles must be reviewed with patients before starting a new medication. When starting a new medication, the clinician should discuss with the patient the risks and benefits of starting the drug and other treatment options that may be worth considering.
