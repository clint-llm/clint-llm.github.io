Due to the aggressive nature of HIVAN, prompt diagnosis and treatment should be made in cases of suspected disease. An interprofessional team approach will improve patient outcomes. The team should include a primary care provider, a nephrologist, and an infectious disease specialist. Frequent renal function testing as per HIV association guidelines should be followed in every patient with HIV. Biopsy should be considered after considering alternative diagnoses and the risks associated with the procedure. An interventional radiologist and pathologist will need to be a part of the team at this point. CD4 count and viral load should be measures to take into consideration for the initiation of cART in patients with HIVAN.
