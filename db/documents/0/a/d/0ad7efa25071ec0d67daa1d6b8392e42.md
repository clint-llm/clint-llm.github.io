The exact etiology for the development of IPF is unknown, but risk factors like exposure to tobacco smoke, metal, wood, dust, and gastroesophageal reflux have been implicated. The current theory on the etiology of IPF is that recurrent injury to the alveolar epithelium triggers a cascade of signaling by the immune system leading to fibrosis. A dysregulated response to the injury can cause tissue remodeling.  The onset is likely caused by multiple mechanisms.  While inflammation is present, there is debate about whether this is the cause or an effect of fibrosis.
