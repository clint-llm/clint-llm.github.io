A retrospective study of 51 patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia and liver abnormalities who underwent liver biopsy showed 84% of them had non-fibrosing architectural features consistent with nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH). Other histopathologic characteristics in the liver include intrasinusoidal lymphocytic infiltration, abnormalities of portal vessels, and epithelioid granulomas that were observed in 90% of the patients.
