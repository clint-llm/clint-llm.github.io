The classification of hiccups is by their duration. Acute hiccups are of less than 48 hours duration, persistent last over 2 days, and intractable last over a month. As acute hiccups are self-limited and usually unreported, most of the research has focused on persistent and intractable hiccups. There are various causes of hiccups including organic causes, psychogenic, idiopathic, or medication-induced. Persistent and intractable hiccups may signify a more serious underlying etiology.

Gastrointestinal processes, particularly gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and associated hiatal hernias, are implicated as the most common cause of acute hiccups.

Many drugs correlate with hiccups, especially alcohol. Some drugs, such as benzodiazepines, have a dose-dependent and an inverse relationship with hiccups. At low doses, benzodiazepines correlate with the development of hiccups. At higher doses, they may be useful in the treatment of hiccups. Chemotherapeutic agents and some glucocorticoids have shown a strong association with hiccups. Nearly 42% of patients taking both cisplatin and dexamethasone develop hiccups.

Numerous reports exist of persistent and intractable hiccups due to a multitude of etiologies, including:

- Cardiovascular disorders: atrial pacing, aortic aneurysm (thoracic or abdominal), catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, pericarditis, temporal arteritis

- Central nervous system (CNS) disorders: aneurysms (especially posterior inferior cerebellar artery), encephalitis, lateral medullary syndrome,

- Drugs: alpha-methyldopa, aripiprazole, azithromycin, benzodiazepines (diazepam, midazolam), chemotherapeutics (carboplatin, cisplatin, etoposide, fluorouracil, irinotecan, levofolinate, oxaliplatin), dexamethasone, donepezil, ethanol, levodopa, methohexital, morphine, pergolide, piribedil, sulfonamides, tramadol

- ENT disorders: a cough, foreign body irritation of tympanic membrane (e.g., hair), goiter, laryngitis, neck cyst, neoplasms, pharyngitis, recent intubation

- Infectious disorders: Helicobacter pylori, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, influenza, malaria, neurosyphilis, tuberculosis

- Intrathoracic disorders: asthma, bronchitis, diaphragmatic tumor or a hernia, empyema, lymphadenopathy, mediastinitis, neoplasms, pleuritis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolus

- Gastrointestinal disorders: aerophagia, bowel obstruction, gastric distention, esophageal cancer, esophagitis (infectious or erosive),

- Metabolic/endocrine disorders: hypocapnia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, diabetes mellitus, uremia

- Psychogenic disorders: excitation, hyperventilation, malingering, somatization, stress

- Surgery: anesthetic agents (barbiturates, bupivacaine epidural, isoflurane, methohexital, propofol), bronchoscopy, gastric insufflation during endoscopy, post-operative,
