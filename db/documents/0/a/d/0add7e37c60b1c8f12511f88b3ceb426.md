Although there are many anatomical variations, the most common configuration of the popliteal artery is with the first branch being the anterior tibial artery.  Then after the first branch point, the popliteal artery becomes the posterior tibial artery (also known as the tibioperoneal trunk or the tibiofibular trunk).  The posterior tibial artery (tibioperoneal trunk) then bifurcates into a posterior tibial and a peroneal artery.

The peroneal artery originates from the posterior tibial artery (tibioperoneal trunk) roughly 2 to 3 cm distal to the popliteal fossa.  The peroneal artery is usually the posterior lateral branch of the posterior tibial artery (tibioperoneal trunk).  The peroneal artery then courses towards the fibular bone and descends down the lower leg along the posterior surface of the interosseus membrane between the fibula and tibia.  The peroneal artery is located at the posterior aspect of the intermuscular septum of the lateral compartment between tibialis posterior and flexor hallucis longus muscles or within flexor hallucis longus muscle belly in the posterior compartment.

The peroneal artery descends to the level of the ankle at the inferior tibiofibular syndesmosis where it divides into the calcaneal arterial branches at the posterior lateral aspect of the calcaneus.  Distally the peroneal artery is contiguous with the dorsal artery of the foot, the lateral tarsal artery, the lateral malleolar artery, and the lateral plantar arteries.

The distal peroneal artery gives off a communicating branch which anastomosis with the communicating branch of the posterior tibial artery.  The distal peroneal artery also has anterior branches that anastomosis with the distal anterior tibial artery.  Arterial anastomosis provides collateral circulation in the hindfoot and ankle.

Inferiorly, through perforating branches, the peroneal artery penetrates the posterior intermuscular septum of the lateral compartment (also known as the peroneal compartment) to supply the peroneus brevis and peroneus longus muscles with blood flow.  Superiorly, the anterior tibial artery penetrates the anterior intermuscular septum of the lateral compartment to supply the peroneus brevis and peroneus longus muscles with blood flow.

The lateral compartment of the leg is one of the four compartments in the lower leg.  The four compartments of the lower leg are the lateral, anterior, superficial posterior, and deep posterior compartments.  Muscles residing in the lateral compartment of the leg function to cause foot eversion.  The anterior boundary of the lateral compartment is the anterior intermuscular septum.  The posterior boundary of the lateral compartment is the posterior intermuscular septum.  Medial and lateral boundaries of the lateral compartment are the fibular surface and deep leg fascia, respectively.
