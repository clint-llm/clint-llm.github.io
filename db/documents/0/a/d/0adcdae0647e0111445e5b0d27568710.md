Typically, the ribs have the following anatomical components:

- Head with two articular facets

- Tubercle

- Neck

- Shaft

- Costal groove

Most of the ribs are typical ribs; which means that they have all these features. The atypical ribs which do not have all these features are:

- FirstÂ rib

- Second rib

- Tenth rib

- Eleventh rib

- Twelfth rib

The first rib is atypical because it is wide and short, has two costal grooves, and one articular facet.

The second rib is thin, long, and has a tuberosity on its superior surface for the attachment of the serratus anterior muscle.

The tenth rib has only one articular facet.

The eleventh and twelfth ribs have only one articular facet with no neck.

The functions of the ribs are critical, as they protect the contents of the thoracic cavity and mediastinum, move superiorly, inferiorly, anteriorly and posteriorly to facilitate breathing, provide a place where some muscles originate or attach, and play a role in erythropoiesis during development.

The ribs are critical in breathing since their flexibility in their movement increases/decreases the size of the thoracic cavity; assisting the lungs in respiration. Control of these movements is via the diaphragm, external intercostals, and the intercartilaginous portion of the internal intercostals.
