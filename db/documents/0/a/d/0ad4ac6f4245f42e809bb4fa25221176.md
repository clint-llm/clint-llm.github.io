There are no known complications asÂ dysdiadochokinesia is a clinical finding of cerebellar dysfunction.

Complications of cerebellar dysfunction include frequent falls, dysarthric speech, swallowing problems, visual-spacial coordination. Surgery for the cerebellum may become complicated by hemorrhage, edema, and hydrocephalus. As the posterior fossa is a small compartment, any complication that can potentially cause hydrocephalus or brainstem compression requires emergency treatment. Delay in the management can cause irreversible brainstem damage producing coma or death.
