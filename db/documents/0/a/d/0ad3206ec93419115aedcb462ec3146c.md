Treatment for frotteurism is usually not sought due to a lack of clinical or functional impairment. Additionally, individuals with frotteuristic disorder rarely seek treatment on their own. It may make individuals uncomfortable, feel ashamed, or guilty about their behaviors while seeking help. This paraphilic disorder often comes to light after being "caught" for sexual assault and mandated to seek treatment by the legal system or are asked to do so by their friends or family members. Since the literature on this topic is sparse, treatment modalities are often generalized for all paraphilic disorders.

A multi-modal approach is recommended, i.e., one which includes individual and family or community participation, in addition to psychotherapeutic and pharmacological interventions.

Several different therapeutic models, including â€“ psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, solution-focused therapy, psychoanalysis, relaxation therapy, biofeedback, have been explored with some success. Additionally, the clinician needs to be aware of his/her counter-transference during this process.

As pointed earlier, frotteuristic behavior has been associated with several other mental health disorders like depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.

Ethical challenges requiring informed consent before administering GnRH analogs must be addressed. Additionally, since impulsive hypersexuality is thought to be a factor in this disorder, certain serotonergic antidepressants such as Fluoxetine, Sertraline, and Paroxetine have had modest success in mitigating increased sexual drive and in those who may have comorbid conditions like depression or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders (OCD).
