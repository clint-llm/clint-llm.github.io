Suction drains are appliances used to collect blood, pus, or body fluids. They are active drains that maintain a negative pressure gradient. The collection reservoir of an active drain collects fluid by exchanging negative pressure, and the drain may become ineffective if the vacuum is lost. The type of drainage system is based on the needs of a patient, type of surgery, type of wound, expected amount of drainage, and surgeon preference.
