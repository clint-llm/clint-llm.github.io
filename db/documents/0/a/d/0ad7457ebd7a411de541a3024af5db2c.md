The prognosis is good in patients, with thiol-drug-induced pemphigus, who lack cell surface autoantibodies. Once the thiol-drug is discontinued, at least 50% of patients will see an improvement. Unfortunately, a significant number of patients with drug-induced pemphigus also have cell surface autoantibodies, and these individuals will have a chronic course similar to pemphigus vulgaris. While mortality rates for drug-induced pemphigus are not known, isolated deaths have been reported. However, when chronic pemphigus persists, it carries very high morbidity and a poor quality of life. Patients often develop extensive skin lesions marked by burning sensations and pain. When the oral cavity is involved, it can lead to decreased oral intake, dehydration, and significant weight loss.
