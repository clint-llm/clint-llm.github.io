Life expectancy in patients with systemic sclerosis depends on the extent and severity of internal organ involvement. During SSc, the rate of death is 3.5 times higher compared to healthy subjects of the same age. The overall survival of patients with SSc is in the range of 75 to 80% after five years, 55% after ten years, 35 to 40% after 15 years and 25 to 30% after 20 years.  Factors correlating with a higher risk of death are advanced age at diagnosis, male patients, diffuse skin involvement, and visceral involvement (pulmonary, cardiac, renal). The pulmonary involvement is the main prognostic factor: five-year survival is greater than 90% in the absence of ILD and about 70% if ILD is present. The one-year survival is 55% in PAH associated with SSc. Autoantibodies also have a prognostic value: survival after ten years is 93% in the presence of anti-centromere antibodies, 66% in patients with anti-Scl70 and only 30% in patients with anti-RNA-polymerase III. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has transformed the prognosis of SRC, which remains an important cause of death.

In localized scleroderma, the hardening of the skin generally ceases in the two years after the onset of the disease, and the lesions do not extend to other parts from the body. However, the disease can sometimes last several years, and some plaques may become more marked even after the end of inflammation.
