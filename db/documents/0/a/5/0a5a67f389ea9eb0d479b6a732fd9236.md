It is also important to note that the efficacy of metoclopramide can be diminished if the patient takes anticholinergics or narcotic analgesic medications because these drugs decrease the gastric emptying rate.

Metoclopramide is included in the KIDS list (Key Potentially Inappropriate Drugs in Pediatrics), a referenceÂ tool to identify medications associated with a high risk for adverse drug reactions. Monitor when metoclopramide is used in pediatric patients.
