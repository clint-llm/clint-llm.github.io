The disease is treatable at the point of cure. Early intervention will yield better results with little morbidity. Long-standing cases that are over joints and with lymphatic involvement have relatively high morbidity. Disseminated disease, with the involvement of the central nervous system, has the worst prognosis. Prolonged treatment with hepatotoxic drugs is another factor that has to be a consideration. Best results are achievable in small lesions that are amenable to surgery and followed up with antifungal therapy.
