From conception, the cells from the primary cardiac crescent form bilaterally within the embryonic disc and migrate to the cervical region to form the primary heart tube. Subsequent divisions and contributions from the bulbus cordis develop into the right ventricle while the primitive ventricle of the primary cardiac crescent forms the left ventricle. During subsequent weeks, the primitive heart folds into an "s" shape, which places the chambers and major vessels into alignment and shape that mirrors an adult heart. The partitioning of the atria and ventricles by the interatrial, interventricular, and atrioventricular septum proceed, followed by the formation of the semilunar valves.

Congenital defects of the left ventricle include hypoplastic left heart syndrome. This condition is characterized by an underdeveloped left ventricle secondary to a small, poorly formed mitral valve, aortic valve, and/or ascending aorta. The number of affected structures coincides with the severity of this defect. The underdeveloped left ventricle is unable to adequately pump blood to the body, so the newborn will undergo surgery to bypass the poorly functioning left side of the heart, and make the right ventricle the main pump to the body.
