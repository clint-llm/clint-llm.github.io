The most common presentation is acute urinary retention (suprapubic pain associated with total inability to void) which typicallyÂ is preceded by various urinary symptoms such as weak stream, hesitancy, and frequency. Chronic urinary retention can be more gradual in onset with no associated pain. Usually, it is found with relatively small amounts of voided urine and overflow incontinence. There may be obvious suprapubic distension or fullness, but confirmation with a bladder ultrasound or catheter is required.
