This activity describes the evaluations, diagnosis, and management of pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) and pigmentary glaucoma (PG). It describes the important clinical signs and symptoms in patients at risk and how to follow patients over time. To avoid irreversible glaucomatous optic neuropathy and visual field progression, periodic examinations are of utmost importance for patients with this condition. Management and early diagnosis should include slit-lamp examinations, tonometry, gonioscopy, visual field assessment, and optical coherence tomography. This activity reviews the epidemiology, physiopathology, risk factors, assessment, diagnosis, and management of this condition and highlights the important role of periodic and interprofessional ophthalmological team collaboration in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) and pigmentary glaucoma (PG).
- Outline the typical presentation with signs and symptoms of a patient with pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) and pigmentary glaucoma (PG).
- Summarize the management, differential diagnosis, complications, and prognosis of pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) and pigmentary glaucoma (PG).
- Explain the role of interprofessional collaboration in improving outcomes in patients with pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) and pigmentary glaucoma (PG).
