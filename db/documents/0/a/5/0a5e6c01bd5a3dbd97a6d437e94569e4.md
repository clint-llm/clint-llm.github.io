CT is exquisitely sensitive for acute intracranial bleeding. In a patient for whom there is concern for serious traumatic brain injury, CT should be obtained as rapidly as is safely possible. In an effort to minimize unnecessary CTs, there are several decision rules to aid in deciding which TBI patients need a head CT. These rules aim to identify patients who will require neurosurgical intervention. They do not identify patients who will have short or long term neurologic sequelae from TBI. The two most commonly utilized rules for adults are the Canadian Head CT Rule and the New Orleans Criteria. Both are 100% sensitive for clinically significant traumatic intracranial injuries, though the Canadian Head CT Rule is more specific. Notably, patients on antiplatelets and anticoagulants were excluded from these studies. For patients less than 18 years old, the most commonly used tool is the PECARN Pediatric Head Injury/Trauma Algorithm, which is also nearly 100% sensitive for clinically significant intracranial injuries. C-spine imaging should be strongly considered as well, especially in comatose patients. MRI may detect subtle lesions not picked up on CT or further define those seen on CT; however, as MRI may be difficult to obtain and has not been shown to be of significant value in the early evaluation of acute CHI, it is not a routine part of the initial evaluation. MRI may provide more information about chronic hemorrhage.
