Our knowledge of somnambulism is still in its early stages. Polysomnography is the most reliable method to diagnose somnambulism. However, it is not recommended for an initial assessment of the condition because of its high cost and inconvenience. There are difficulties in capturing infrequent and irregular behavior, such as sleepwalking. In most cases, a detailed history and reports from close contacts are enough to make a diagnosis of somnambulism. Polysomnography can be applied in forensic cases or when the differential diagnosis is uncertain.
