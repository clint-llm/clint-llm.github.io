There are no specific laboratory, radiographic, or other tests required to diagnose panic disorder. The DSM 5 criteria can be used to diagnose panic disorder which has been mentioned earlier. Certain rating scales designed by the clinicians are used in practice to assess the severity of the panic attacks.  It is, however, important that health care providers perform a thorough examination of the patient to rule out an alternative diagnosis. Panic disorder occurs in the absence of other medical or psychiatric conditions that can better explain the symptoms.
