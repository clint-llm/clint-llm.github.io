When utilizing lung isolation to facilitate surgery, a plan should be mapped out in advance with input from the surgical team. The patient should be well pre-oxygenated before the induction of anesthesia to compensate for underlying lung disease and because the placement of a DLT typically takes longer than an SLT. The anesthesia team should have all necessary equipment available, including that which may be needed for the patient with a difficult airway, if applicable.

**Equipment List for DLT Placement**

- Several sizes of DLTs

- SLTs as back-up

- A fiberoptic bronchoscope (including antifog solution and lubricating gel or spray)

- Tube exchanger

There is a lack of uniformity and objective guidelines in the selection of DLT sizes. Selecting the proper size DLT reduces the incidence of complications. Tube size recommendations can be based on gender and height. A 39F is recommended for men 165 cm or less in height, and a 41F for men taller than 165 cm. A 35F is recommended for women 160 cm or less in height, with a 37F being used for women taller than 160 cm. Radiologic measurement of the trachea's diameter or left mainstem bronchial diameter measurement from a computer tomographic (CT) scan can also be considered when selecting a left-sided DLT.

**Equipment List for BB Placement**

- Preferred BB device

- SLT of adequate diameter

- A fiberoptic bronchoscope (including antifog solution and lubricating gel or spray)

Once anesthesia is induced, and mask ventilation is verified, paralysis is typically administered to facilitate DLT placement. If the patient requiring lung isolation is unlikely to tolerate long periods of hypoxia or hypercarbia, such as those with severe pulmonary hypertension, then the most experienced practitioner available should secure the airway and achieve lung isolation. Bronchodilators should be available for patients with suspected reactive airways, and soft-suction catheters should be utilized to clear excess secretions and promote oxygenation.

If lung isolation is needed urgently or electively in the ICU setting, the approach to preparation should be similar to that described for surgical procedures. However, if lung isolation is needed emergently, such as in the case of significant unilateral pulmonary hemorrhage, the most expedient method to achieve lung isolation should be used with the most readily available equipment. For example, if the hemorrhaging patient is in an ICU remotely located from the operating rooms, procuring a DLT may take too much time; an SLT advanced into the unaffected bronchus should be used instead.
