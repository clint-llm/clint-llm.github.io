Outcomes after flexor tendon repair are variable and dependent upon the nature of the disease, the patient’s individual biological response to injury, timing, and method of repair, and patient compliance with the postoperative therapy regimen. Good functional outcomes result from satisfactory tendon repair with full participation and compliance in tendon repair aftercare programs. Early initiation of postoperative mobilization protocols promotes intrinsic tendon healing, increases tensile strength, decreases adhesion formation and edema, and improves tendon gliding, thus optimizing flexor tendon repair prognosis. The most common complication is digital stiffness. Repair site ruptures are, fortunately, uncommon; however, they generally indicate non-compliance with suggested therapy protocols.****

Age, language barriers, smoking, mechanism and extent of injury, additional associated injuries, zone of injury, the time elapsed from insult to surgery, surgical technique, postoperative rehabilitation protocol, and adherence to therapy are factors implicated in the outcome of flexor tendon repair.

Additionally, in high-volume, specialized hand centers, patients are likely to undergo surgery sooner after the injury than in lower-volume facilities; therefore, a difference in postoperative functional outcomes between patients treated in either type of facility may exist.

Zone 2 injury is a well-documented risk factor for poorer outcomes, likely secondary to the challenging anatomy containing both FDS and FDP within a narrow fibro-osseous sheath.
