There is no treatment to cure autism spectrum disorder, but early diagnosis and early intensive management have the potential to produce favorable outcomes in all aspects of the disease. The screening tests should be carried out anytime during child development if there are concerns for autism and other pervasive developmental disorders. It is usually done at 18 and 24 months during well-baby visits. The overall basis for management of autism spectrum disorder is 3-fold: (1) improve quality of life maximize function, (2) promote a child’s independence, and (3) maximize function.
