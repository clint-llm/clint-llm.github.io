Up to 80% of patients with primary CNS lymphoma present with focal neurologic deficitsÂ and symptoms often correlate with the location of the lesion.

They present as focal mass lesions in almost 50% of cases and present predominantly with:

- Neuropsychiatric signs

- Features of raised intracranial pressure

- Seizures

- Ocular symptoms (pain, decreased visual acuity, photophobia, blurry vision, floaters), and

- Rarely with B symptoms.****

The predominant anatomical locations of involvement include:

- Cerebral hemisphere

- Thalamus/basal ganglia

- Corpus callosum

- The periventricular region, and

- Cerebellum.

Neurologic signs and symptoms develop acutely with the following patterns of cranial and extra-cranial involvements:

- Frontoparietal lobes (39%)

- Eyes (15% to 25%)

- CSF (7% to 42%) and

- Rarely the spinal cord.
