A simple kidney cyst is the most common type of renal cyst. It is a fluid-filled sac that originates from the surface of the kidney. One or more simple cysts may form within the same kidney. These cysts are usually asymptomatic and detected incidentally upon radiological exams of the abdomen. Management is not required unless the cyst becomes infected or enlarges and causes symptoms. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of simple kidney cysts and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the population in which simple renal cysts typically occur.
- Outline the differential diagnosis of a simple renal cyst.
- Explain how to manage a patient affected by simple renal cysts properly.
- Review the importance of communication between interprofessional teams in assuring proper diagnosis and management of simple renal cysts, which will improve outcomes for patients.
