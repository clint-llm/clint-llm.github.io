Tardive dystonia often has an insidious and progressive presentation. Although associated with a latent and thus “tardive” onset, the presentation may occur anywhere from days to years following initial exposure to dopamine receptor antagonism. Patients have reported that unusual sensory symptoms, along with strange somatic sensations, have preceded the onset of tardive dystonia. For example, neck pain has been found to precede the onset of cervical dystonia. Furthermore, research has determined that the development of tardive manifestations presents as focal dystonia, most notably torticollis or blepharospasm, followed by pharyngeal dystonia, oromandibular dystonia, and dystonia of the lips and tongue.

Dystonias of the arms, legs, and trunk are less frequent. On examination, pharyngeal dystonia will present as dysphagia, whereas oromandibular dystonia may present as a severe speech disturbance.
