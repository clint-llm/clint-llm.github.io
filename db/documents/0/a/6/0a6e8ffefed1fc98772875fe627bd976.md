In patients suffering from lateral epicondylitis, the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle is the most commonly affected. Therefore, in patients who present with increased pain or burning on the lateral aspect of the elbow and/or a weak grip strength that worsens with activity, lateral epicondylitis with extensor carpi radialis brevis involvement should be considered.

Wrist drop is a condition that results from palsy of the radial nerve. In cases of compromise of this nerve, the extensor muscles of the wrist and digits are affected., which causes the hand to ‘drop’ or hang in a position of flexion due to the unopposed actions of the extensor muscles. If the injury involves the radial nerve proximal to its bifurcation into the deep and superficial branches along the lateral border of the cubital fossa, these patients may experience some sensory deficits.
