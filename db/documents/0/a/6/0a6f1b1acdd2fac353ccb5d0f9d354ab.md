Treatment strategies of triplane ankle fractures depend on the residual displacement following reduction. Post-reduction CT scans should be obtained to assess the quality of reduction and articular step-off. Ertl et al. demonstrated that in a series ofÂ 23 triplane ankle fractures managed nonoperatively at a single institution, residual articular displacement of more than 2 mm results in poor outcomes if managed nonoperatively.

Triplanar ankle fractures require an interprofessional team approach. The primary care practitioner should immediately enlist an orthopedist for evaluation and eventual treatment. Following any procedure or with non-operative management, an orthopedic specialty-trained nurse is invaluable. They can assist during surgery, provide post-surgical care, and help with conservative, non-operative management, monitor progress, and coordinate with physical therapy when necessary, serving as a coordination point between the treating clinician and other providers. This type of interprofessional collaboration will result in better outcomes and improved patient care. [Level 5]
