Overall complication rates from laparoscopic surgery for colorectal surgery are similar to open surgery.

**Anastomotic Leak**

Leak rates from laparoscopic right hemicolectomy are around 4% and represent the major risk to morbidity in patients undergoing this operation.

**Ureteric Injury**

The ureters become difficult to identify in patients with obesity, diverticular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and those with previous abdominal surgery/resection in close proximity. Preoperative placement of ureteric stents can aid the identification of ureteral injury.

**Conversion to Open**

Indications for open surgery include extensive adhesions, T4 tumors with surrounding invasion, hemorrhage. Conversion to open is associated with worse overall survival in curable resections.

**Bleeding**

Laparoscopic surgery reduces blood loss.

**Wound Infection**

Wound infection is reduced in laparoscopic surgery.
