Atelectasis is usually clinically diagnosed in a patient with known risk factors. If an X-ray is warranted, a chest film, chest CAT scan (CT), and/or thoracic ultrasound may be useful to diagnose atelectasis. A chest x-ray will show platelike, horizontal lines in the area of atelectasis. Atelectasis is not usually seen on convention chest X-rays until it is significant.

On chest X-ray, the displacement of interlobar fissures, pulmonary opacification, and/or tracheal shift toward the affected side is seen with atelectasis.

Chest CT  shows densities in the dependent lung and decreased volume in the affected side.

Fiberoptic bronchoscopy may allow direct visualization of atelectasis.  It can be both diagnostic and therapeutic, as it may reveal the cause of an obstruction causing the atelectasis (i.e., tumor, mucous plug, or foreign body).

Arterial blood gas may demonstrate arterial hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis with normal PaCO2. PaCO2 may be lower due to increased minute ventilation often seen in atelectasis.
