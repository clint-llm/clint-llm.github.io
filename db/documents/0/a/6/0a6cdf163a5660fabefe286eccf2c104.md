Discharge planning for patients with HF must include patient education onÂ medication management, medication compliance, low-sodium diet, fluid restriction, activity and exercise recommendations, smoking cessation, and learning to recognize the signs and symptoms of worsening HF. Discharge planning for patients with HF must also include follow-up appointments to ensure patients have a close medical follow-up after discharge. Nurse-driven education at the time of discharge has been shown to improve compliance with therapy and improve patient outcomes in heart failure.
