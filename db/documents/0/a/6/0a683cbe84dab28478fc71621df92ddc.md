As the infantile variety is a severe one, it progresses into permanent deformity if it left unattended at its early stages. So early diagnosis is a must for this type of variant. Adolescent variety also causes deformities but less severe compared to the infantile variant.

Proper fit of the brace should be checked periodically as older braces tighten with increasing age leading to superficial skin abrasions and pain. Osteotomy related complications like compartment syndrome will occur. Alternation in extensor mechanism functions will occur if osteotomy is done above the tibial tuberosity level. Residual deformity persists, or recurrence of deformity occurs if overcorrection of deformity is not done as medial physeal growth still persists.
