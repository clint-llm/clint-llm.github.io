Acute proctitis occurs within the first few months of radiation treatment in 10% to 15% of patients. It is self-limited, lasting for only a few months. It is an inflammatory process of rectal mucosa with a loss of microvilli, edema, and ulceration. Symptoms include abdominal pain, tenesmus, diarrhea, incontinence, and urgency.

Chronic proctitis, often with bleeding, develops months to years after radiation treatment and is often progressive. Severe acute proctitis is a risk factor for chronic proctitis development as are diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease, connective tissue disease, hypertension, smoking, peripheral vascular disease, and chemotherapy.
