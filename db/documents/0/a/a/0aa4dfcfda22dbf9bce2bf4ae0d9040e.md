Here are some important points of which to take note:

- CMTs are common inherited neuromuscular disorders characterized by progressive weakness, wasting, and skeletal deformities.

- Electrophysiological tests are useful to confirm the diagnosis of neuropathy and exclude alternative conditions that present with foot drop and/or foot deformities such as distal myopathies, muscular dystrophies, and idiopathic pes cavus, among others.

- Electrophysiological tests are useful to screen other family members for asymptomatic neuropathy.

- Patients of demyelinating CMTs have slowed conduction velocities within the first few years of life. Clinical manifestations of weakness, wasting, and deformities arise from axonal loss over the years.

- There is striking phenotypic variability suggesting the potential role for modifier genes and epigenetic factors.

- A detailed pedigree chart covering three or four generations is essential to find the pattern of inheritance. This is necessary before carrying out genetic studies.

- All patients should have genetic counseling before genetic testing.

- In the case of demyelinating neuropathies, the patient should first undergo testing for PMP22 duplication since it is the commonest genetic abnormality. After excluding copy number variations in PMP22, they need targeted gene sequencing or whole-exome sequencing.

- In the case of axonal neuropathies, the patient is first tested for mutations in MFN2. Alternately, the patient can directly undergo target gene sequencing or whole-exome sequencing.

- Establishing the genetic diagnosis is crucial for genetic counseling, reproductive planning, and considering the patient for potential upcoming therapies.

- Patients need to undergo specific tests to detect subclinical involvement of other organs/ systems to recommend timely prophylactic measures.

- Patients should avoid using drugs that worsen neuropathy.

- Patient education and counseling, regular follow-up, emphasis on rehabilitation measures, and consideration for therapeutic trials by a multi-disciplinary team are very important.
