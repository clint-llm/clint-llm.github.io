Possible complications to TAVR include conduction disturbances and the need for a permanent pacemaker, stroke, paravalvular leak, vascular site complications, bleeding, annular rupture, left ventricular perforation, cardiac tamponade, need for surgery, acute myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, infection, hypotension, and death.

A recent meta-analysis revealed statistically significant evidence of lower rates of both acute kidney injury and major bleeding, and a non-statistically significant trend favoring TAVR over SAVR on overall mortality and stroke. Additionally, there was a statistically significant reduction in length of stay. To the contrary, TAVR was associated with higher rates of vascular injury, paravalvular regurgitation and the need for permanent pacemaker placement. One caveat, being that high-risk patients in the TAVR cohort of the PARTNER 1-A trial had higher rates of stroke.
