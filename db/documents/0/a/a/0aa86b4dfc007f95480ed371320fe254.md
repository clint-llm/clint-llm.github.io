A thorough history and physical are important to ensure a proper diagnosis. As stated earlier, isolated fibula shaft fractures are rare but, when they do occur, commonly are the result of direct trauma to the leg. A patient presenting with a history of recent trauma to the leg with tenderness to palpation, especially over the fibula on the lateral leg, should be considered capable of suffering fibula shaft fracture. It is also pertinent to examine the skin for any lacerations, abrasions, or bruising that would be consistent with trauma to the leg. The entire extremity should be examined for any signs of trauma, including range of motion of the joints above and below the area to rule out any potential intra-articular pathology. The quality of pain is likely to be acute and sharp, not longstanding, or have qualities more consistent with nerve pathology, like burning or shooting pain.
