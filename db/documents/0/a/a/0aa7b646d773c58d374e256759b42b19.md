Management of C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency is mostly in response to airway compromise. If only mild symptoms present and the patient has a known diagnosis, it is reasonable to manage conservatively with observation. If more severe symptoms and impending airway compromise are present, a definitive airway is necessary. Presumptive treatment with epinephrine, steroids, and antihistamines is recommended of the undifferentiated patient with airway compromise secondary to laryngeal edema. However, in the setting of C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, this is ineffective but should be attempted as allergic airway compromise is more common, and these methods have a high reward with relatively little downside.

Specific therapy for C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency with laryngeal edema involves replacing the deficient enzyme. The easiest way is to give human plasma, which contains C1 esterase inhibitor. An initial dose of human plasma is 2 units. C1INH concentrate derived from human plasma may be a therapeutic option. The initial dose is 1500 units.

More specific, less widely used medications include Icatibant and ecallantide. Icatibant is a synthetic bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist, while ecallantide is a recombinant plasma kallikrein inhibitor.
