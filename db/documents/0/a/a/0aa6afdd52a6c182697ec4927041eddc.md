An advanced trauma life support approach should be adopted when assessing patients with suspected facial trauma. Airway patency and stability are key priorities alongside cervical spine immobilization and hemorrhage control, as 10% of complicated facial fractures are associated with significant bleeding.

Examination of the NOE complex begins with a visual and manual inspection, which often will reveal severe swelling and periorbital ecchymosis that make examination a challenge. Excessive tear overflow in the eye and face (epiphora) can be associated with lacrimal duct damage or obstruction. A more reliable assessment of lacrimal canalicular function uses dye tests or dacryocystography (radiological contrast assessment of the lacrimal apparatus) if epiphora is persistent following surgery.

Assessment of the MCT is a fundamental aspect of determining the severity of an NOE complex injury. Telecanthus, also known as pseudohypertelorism, is a cardinal sign of MCT rupture; it appears as an increased distance between the medial canthi with an unchanged interpupillary distance. The intercanthal distance is, on average, 30 to 31 mm, and the average interpupillary distance is 62 mm for females and 64 mm for males. An intercanthal distance greater than 40 mm is noticeably wide and constitutes an indication for surgical correction.
