Successful drainage of an imperforate hymen satisfactorily resolves symptoms. Rarely, the imperforate hymen has been associated with neonatal death due to respiratory failure from the abdominal distension.

In another study, 86% of women conceived after hymenectomy without dyspareunia.

Vaginal adenocarcinoma is rare and was reported in a patient who had vaginal adenosis and a prior history of imperforate hymen.Â  Vaginal adenosis, the persistence of columnar epithelium in the vagina, was reported on colposcopic biopsies two years after hymenectomy in a 13-year-old patient who did not have estrogen exposure in utero. Another 20-year-old female who underwent hymenectomy and found to have granulated vaginal walls had colposcopy with biopsies positive for vaginal adenosis, which can be a precursor to vaginal adenocarcinoma. Another 14-year-old female presented for vaginal discharge and was found to have a red granulated vaginal wall with biopsies demonstrating adenosis. The authors hypothesized that vaginal adenosis associated with imperforate hymen may be related to undifferentiated paramesonephric tissue during development.
