The eyelid is composed of multiple layers. From superficial to deep, these layers are skin, muscles of protraction and the orbicularis oculi, orbital septum, orbital fat, muscles of retraction, tarsus/tarsal plate, and conjunctivae.

Multiple nerves supply the eyelid. The nerves supplying the superior lid are the infratrochlear, supratrochlear, supraorbital, and lacrimal nerves of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V division V1). The nerves that supply the lower eyelid are the infratrochlear and infraorbital nerves of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V division V2).

Anastomoses of the lateral and medial palpebral arteries give rise to the blood supply of the upper and lower eyelids. These arteries originate from the lacrimal artery and the ophthalmic artery, respectively.

The tarsus, orbicularis oculi, lid retractors, and canthal tendons support the lower eyelid. The canthal ligaments and tarsal plate horizontally stabilize the lid; any weakening of these structures permits the inversion of the lid. The lid retractors support the eyelid vertically. The levator aponeurosis and the Mueller muscle support the upper eyelid. The lower lid retractors connect to the orbicularis oculi muscle and skin overlying the muscle.
