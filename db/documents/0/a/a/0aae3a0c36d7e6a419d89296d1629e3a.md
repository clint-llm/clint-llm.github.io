Chest X-rays are the initial modality of choice for imaging the mediastinum. Typically an outpatient X-ray consists of a two-view PA (posterior-anterior) and lateral views of the chest. It can be used to diagnose emergent conditions such as aortic dissection, pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, and pneumothorax, as well as infections or masses such as cancer. Single view portable AP (anteroposterior) x-rays are performed in the ICU, in patients with mechanical ventilation, after placement of lines and tubes, or those who cannot tolerate obtaining PA views.

Mediastinal widening refers to the width of the mediastinum being more than 8 cm on a PA chest radiograph.

The hilum overlay sign is a useful sign for evaluating mediastinal masses on a plain radiograph. When the normal hilar structures are seen through the mass, it suggests that the mass is either anterior or posterior to the hila allowing for the hilar structures to be seen.

Chest fluoroscopyÂ is continuous real-time imaging using X-rays. It is used for the detection of diaphragmatic paralysis. A special study performed under fluoroscopy includes barium swallow, which can help diagnose esophageal diseases such as ulcers, hiatal hernia, achalasia, or esophageal cancer.
