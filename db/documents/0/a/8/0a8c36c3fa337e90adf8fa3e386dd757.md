Pelvic pain is a frequent symptom related to PFD. Other common etiologies for pelvic pain should be considered including prostatitis, prostatodynia, urinary tract infection, urolithiasis, urethral diverticula, bladder neoplasm, myofascial pelvic pain, interstitial cystitis, endometriosis, adnexal tumors, uterine leiomyomas, ovarian retention syndrome, pelvic congestion syndrome, vulvodynia, gynecologic neoplasm, chronic intermittent bowel obstruction, chronic constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rectal neoplasm, pelvic abscess, pelvic hernias, spinal/sacral neoplasia, neuropathy or entrapment in the pelvis, abdominal epilepsy, and abdominal migraines. Urinary incontinence might be related to overflow incontinence due to excessive urinary volume. Similarly, fecal incontinence can be secondary to encopresis with retained stool. Hemorrhoid prolapse is often mistaken for rectal prolapse.
