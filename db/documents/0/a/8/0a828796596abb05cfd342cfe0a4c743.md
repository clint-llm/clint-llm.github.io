The distinction between atypical carcinoid and typical carcinoid is the most important prognostic factor. Atypical carcinoid has a worse prognosis than typical carcinoid. Atypical carcinoids are more likely to metastasize than typical carcinoids. Typical carcinoid tumors metastasize to hilar nodes in 10% to 15%.
