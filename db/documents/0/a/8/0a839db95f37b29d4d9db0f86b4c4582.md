Diagnosis and management of Tapia syndrome require a multidisciplinary approach to achieve the best outcomes and ensure patient safety. This involves surgeons, anesthesiologists, radiologists, neurologists, otolaryngologists, and speech and language therapists. Due to its relative scarcity, reaching a diagnosis early on should be taken with caution. Surgeons and anesthesiologists are most likely to be consulted on the initial presentation. Neurology input is recommended both for diagnosis and treatment, particularly if steroids are being considered. Requesting and reviewing cross-sectional imaging with radiologists may also be necessary to combine clinical and radiological findings. Also, otolaryngologists can perform airway endoscopy and provide a different perspective on potential diagnoses. Ultimately, rehabilitation forms the cornerstone for recovery, and this is primarily handled by the speech and language therapists.
