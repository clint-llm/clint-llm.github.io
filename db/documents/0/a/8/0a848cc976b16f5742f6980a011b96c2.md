Medical threat assessment is a vital component of pre-mission planning. The purpose of threat assessments is to identify all potential medical threats to the team. Completing a medical threat assessment and discussing the findings with the mission commander is an integral part of the responsibilities of a Tactical Emergency Medical Services (TEMS) provider. Attempts should be made to mitigate all reasonable threats identified in the pre-mission stage. During the mission, the TEMS provider should conduct assessments for new medical threats as frequently as possible, before team deployment. The TEMS provider should participate in the development of standard operating procedures to mitigate common medical hazards likely to be encountered on tactical missions.
