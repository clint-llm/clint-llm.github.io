**Weaning from Mechanical Ventilation**

Mechanical ventilation can be a lifesaving intervention and has impacted millions of lives since its invention, but it is not without complications. Shortening the ventilator time has shown to reduce ventilation-related complications like pneumonia, so actively pursuing liberation from mechanical ventilation (the so-called ventilation weaning) is imperative in every ventilated patient.

There are simple criteria that should be satisfied before a patient is determined to be ready for extubation:

- The indication for intubation and mechanical ventilation must be resolved

- The patient has to be able to maintain adequate gas exchange on its own without the help of positive pressure ventilation

- There must be no auto-PEEP

- The patient must have an adequate cardiovascular reserve (for example, in heart failure patients in which removing the vent can precipitate new pulmonary edema)

- There should not be copious amounts of secretions in the ET tube that could generate high airway resistance and obstruction after extubation

- The patient must be able to protect his or her airway.

After these criteria have been satisfied it is time to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Two processes have to be completed to perform this:

- A sedation holiday should be done daily to assess readiness for extubation with appropriate mental status and ability to protect the airway as well as to permit spontaneous breathing. This is usually protocolized in all intensive care units (ICU) and should be performed in every patient who is stable and in whom the indication for mechanical ventilation has resolved. During these daily trials, sedation is reduced to a minimum or completely eliminated until the patient is awake and cooperative but comfortable.

- The second parameter is the SBT itself. To perform this, ventilator support should be reduced to a minimum. This can be done either via T-piece or pressure support. CPAP has been used in the past although it has been suggested to be inferior to the other two methods. A recent Cochrane review (2014) concluded that there are no major differences between T piece or pressure support trials on extubation success, reintubation, ICU mortality, or ICU length of stay. Nevertheless, pressure support was found to be superior for performing spontaneous breathing trials among patients with simple weaning (meaning patients successfully weaned in the first attempt) as it was shown to have a shorter weaning time.

SBT should be performed for 30 to 120 minutes, and the patient should be monitored closely for any signs of respiratory distress. If these signs are found, the patient should be placed back on his or her prior ventilator settings. If after this time patient meets criteria for successful SBT (RR < 35bpm; no signs of distress; HR <140/min and HR variability less than 20%; O2 sat greater than 90% or PaO2 greater than 60 mmHg on FiO2 less than 0.4; SBP greater than 80 and less than 180 mmHg or less than 20% change from baseline), then the assessment for airway removal should be done by performing a cuff leak test when indicated.

If the patient is determined to be ready, the ETT should be removed and the patient should be monitored closely. In patients with high risk for reintubation (failure of two or more SBTs, CHF, CO2 greater than 45 after extubation, weak cough, pneumonia as a cause of respiratory failure), the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation after extubation as a bridge to ventilator free-breathing, has been shown to reduce ICU mortality and lower risk of intubation. This effect was not seen if the patient had already developed respiratory distress. High flow nasal cannula has also shown reduced reintubation rates, although no effect on mortality has been seen.
