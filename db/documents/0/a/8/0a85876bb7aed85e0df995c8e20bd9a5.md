The clinical presentation for patients on antiplatelet therapy will be bleeding complications. The differential diagnosis will differ depending on the source of bleeding. Gastrointestinal, genitourinary, intracranial, or other types of bleeding will each have distinct differential diagnoses. It is reasonable, therefore, to consider antiplatelet drug toxicity and perform medication reconciliation for all patients presenting with bleeding-related complaints.
