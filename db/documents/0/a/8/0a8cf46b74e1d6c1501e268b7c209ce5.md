Temporary cardiac pacing is a potentially life-saving procedure for refractory dysrhythmias that can bridge patients to a destination therapy. However, TCP is not without risks, and a team-based, interprofessional approach can improve outcomes, decrease adverse events, and increase patient safety. All members of the healthcare team should be aware of the indications for TCP to improve patient selection, therefore reducing the exposure of patients to the risks associated with this procedure unnecessarily. Fostering a culture of open, bidirectional communication may allow all members of the healthcare team to voice their concerns, potentially preventing adverse events.

During TTCP, a team-based approach involving physicians, nurses, and emergency medical technicians (EMTs) is essential for timely deployment. A coordinated approach to defibrillation pad and ECG electrode placement, including rolling the patient for anterior-posterior pad placement, is necessary. After initiating TTCP, nurses should frequently evaluate the patient for pain and communicate their concerns to the provider if additional analgesia or sedation is required. The entire healthcare team should know how to assess for signs of mechanical capture and alert the appropriate provider if a loss of capture is suspected.

Temporary transvenous pacing also requires an interprofessional team-based approach. An interprofessional approach to central venous catheter placement and maintenance has been shown to decrease the complication rate.

Temporary cardiac pacing is a bridge from a variety of diseases to definitive therapy and often requires an interprofessional approach. Cardiology and electrophysiology specialists should be involved early to prepare for permanent pacemaker placement, percutaneous coronary intervention, or other definitive care. In suspected overdoses, toxicology consultation can guide the initial treatments, provide information on the expected course and the suitability of a particular poisoning for TCP. In post-cardiac surgery patients, intensive care management by intensivists and cardiothoracic surgeons has been shown to improve outcomes and decrease adverse events.
