Diaper dermatitis is one of the most common dermatologic conditions in the newborn period and early infancy. It is of great importance that all healthcare professionals at any level be familiar with the characteristics of the disease and how to manage it, and to be able to provide appropriate guidance to the parents and caregivers.

Management of diaper dermatitis does not necessitate the involvement of an interprofessional team to achieve appropriate treatment; however, as some cases can be more challenging, it is important to obtain timely consults whenever the need arises.
