Lung torsion is a rare pathology that is classically seen when there is a disruption in the thoracic cavity. Disruptions can include thoracotomy, lung transplantation, and trauma. Lung torsion is a life-threatening disease that requires a timely diagnosis because lung rotation can cause vascular compromise and airway obstruction, which can result in necrosis of the lung tissue. With immediate management, the affected lung or pulmonary lobe can be salvaged. Overall, lung torsion has a poor prognosis due to misdiagnosis and delay in treatment. If detorsion occurs and the lung is fixed in place, then it can recover to full function.
