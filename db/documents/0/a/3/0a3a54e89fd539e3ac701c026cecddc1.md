The internal thoracic artery functions to supply the anterior chest wall, from the clavicle to the umbilicus. This area of supply also includes supply to the sternum and breasts. The internal thoracic artery also gives off the pericardiophrenic artery which travels along the length of the pericardium towards the diaphragm, where it anastomoses with the musculophrenic and superior phrenic arteries. It functions to supply the mediastinum, thymus, and pericardium.

There have been cases reported of malignancy of these internal thoracic lymph nodes as an incidental finding during mobilization of the internal thoracic artery for coronary artery bypass grafting.
