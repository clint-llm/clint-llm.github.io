The interpleural analgesic technique was first described by Reiestad et al. for the treatment of acute postoperative pain. It is believed that this technique enables the spread of injected anesthetics to multiple intercostal nerves using a single interpleural injection site. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and complications of interpleural analagsia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of postoperative thoracic pain.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the technique involved in providing interpleural analgesia.
- Describe the indications for interpleural analgesia.
- Review the complications of interpleural analgesia.
- Explain the importance of optimizing care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve analgesia for patients undergoing thoracic surgery.
