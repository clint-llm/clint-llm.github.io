Clear cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix commonly presents with abnormal per-vaginal bleeding due to cervical ulceration (postcoital bleeding, intermenstrual bleeding).

Physical examination usually depicts cervical abnormality often described as a “Fullness” of the cervix.

The tumor is not palpable during the rectal examination.

Clear cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix correlates with genitourinary malformations such as

- Double uteri and vagina with unilateral renal agenesis

- Atretic hemicervix and ipsilateral renal agenesis

- Bicornuate uterus
