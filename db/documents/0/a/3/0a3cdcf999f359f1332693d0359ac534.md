The genetic basis for the development of the ENS has been a topic of significant research over the last 10 years. What was once thought to be spontaneous, is now known to be a picture of somatic mosaicism. Post-zygotic mutations in the specified genes appear to result in epidermal nevus syndromes, however when germline mutations in the same genes occur there is significant variability in their phenotypic presentation, sometimes with very little to no overlap with the findings in the ENS. Keratinocytic EN harbor many known mutations including RAS, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), and keratins.

- More specifically, both Schimmelpenning and phakomatosis pigmentokeratotica are RASopathies.

- Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) mutations are believed to cause nevus comedonicus syndrome, however when germline mutations in FGFR2 occur this leads to the development of Apert syndrome.

- Interestingly, actin gene (ACTB) mutations have been identified in some smooth muscle cells of non-syndromic variants of Becker’s nevi more commonly than in the syndromic form.

- Proteus syndrome is well classified as a phosphoinositide 3 kinase-AKT-related overgrowth syndrome.

- CHILD syndrome is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the gene that encodes 3-b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, the NSDHL gene.
