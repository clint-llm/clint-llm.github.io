The success of hiatal hernia surgery can be measured by relief of symptoms, improvement in esophageal acid exposure, complications, and need for reoperation. One prospective study followed 100 patients who underwent antireflux surgery over 10 years. They found a 90% reduction in symptoms at 10 years. Over the past 2 decades, the collective experience with operative management has continued to improve outcomes. With increased experience, symptom improvement has increased while perioperative complications have decreased. This is especially true in high-volume centers.
