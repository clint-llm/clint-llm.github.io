Pelvic exenteration is performed as a palliative or curative option for patients with recurrent or locally invasive pelvic cancer. Pelvic exenteration allows patients with significant tumor burden, an option for improved quality of life, even though the morbidity of the procedure is high. Most cases are performed via laparotomy. However, laparoscopic and robotic approaches are becoming more common. The main indication is for en bloc removal of recurrent or locally invasive pelvic cancer. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of locally invasive or recurrent pelvic cancer and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for performing pelvic exenteration.
- Describe the technique in regard to pelvic exenteration.
- Explain the clinical significance of pelvic exenteration.
- Review some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance pelvic exenteration and improve outcomes.
