Sputum analysis quality control is essential and directly affects the diagnostic results. From sputum specimens collection, samples transport, samples storage, diagnostic test procedures environment, to tests results reporting, every step should be strictly performed under the standard guidelines. In 1988, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) was passed by the Congress of the United States of America. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) was established to minimize the analysis errors and maximize the control of test variables. Similar bills are present for other countries. During the diagnostic tests, a standard positive, sensitivity, and negative control should always be performed when the laboratory technician carries out the sputum samples tests. No diagnostic results should be reported when measurements of the quality control are not authorized.

Strict lab safety rules and measures should be conducted by the staff working in the lab. Depending on specific diagnostic tests, the results of the procedural risk assessment may be different. It is always good to consider the sputum samples as potentially infectious, and essential biosafety measures should be set to limit or reduce the risks of laboratory infection when specific procedures are performed. The CLSI has provided new practice guidelines for applying risk management to both QC plans and statistical QC.
