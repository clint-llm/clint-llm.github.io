Pulmonary artery hypertension, as well as pulmonary hypertension, can cause a variety of complications. Beginning with vascular complications, patients can have pulmonary artery dilatation secondary to the increased volume and shearing stress on the vessel wall. The potential effects of a dilated pulmonary artery include extrinsic compression of the left main stem coronary artery.

A rare complication is pulmonary artery dissection, usually diagnosed in post-mortem exams. While rare, it is associated with congenital heart disease and idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension.

Chronic pulmonary artery hypertension leads to increased pulmonary artery resistance, which puts increased stress on the right ventricle' this causes the right ventricle to hypertrophy and then dilate to accommodate the increased preload. Should these mechanisms fail, then tricuspid regurgitation, pericardial effusion, and potentially cardiac cirrhosis can develop.

Iatrogenic causes of complications from pulmonary artery hypertension come from line infections in patients being treated with prostacyclin analogs. Administration of this drug must be via a central line, and due to the chronic nature of the disease, the line becomes a nidus for infection.
