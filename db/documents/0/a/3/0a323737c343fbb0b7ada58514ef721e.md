Full-thickness skin grafts include both the epidermis and the dermis. The selection of the donor site is carefully considered for optimal cosmetic outcome and control of discomfort. Cosmetic outcome is based on desired pigmentation, texture, and skin thickness.

Full-thickness grafts are chosen from the flank, groin, hypothenar eminence, pre- and post-auricular areas, or the forearm.

- The skin is shaved, and the tumescent is injected into the tissue below the intended donor site.

- The skin is then gently harvested using a scalpel, customizing the shape to that of the area to be grafted. Sharp dissection is preferred as electrocautery can damage the donor graft very easily.

- Some of the subcutaneous tissue is removed with the graft, it is then taken to the back table and “defatted” to remove the excess tissue. The donor site is then closed primarily.

- When placing the full-thickness skin graft, it is sutured along the edges using rapidly dissolving sutures. Many surgeons use quilting sutures to help hold the graft in place, preventing both shear and empty space in which a hematoma or seroma could develop. Larger grafts (>3 cm diameter - Stephenson) risk failure because the surface area will be too large for adequate imbibition.

Split thickness skin grafts (STSGs) are the most common type of wound graft placed. They are ideal because smaller amounts of harvested skin can cover a larger area. The dermis and epidermis from the donor site also heal quickly (10-14 days), and that location can be used as a donor site again if necessary. The ideal donor site is the anterolateral thigh because it is easily accessed on the supine patient, it is easy to use the dermatome in this location, and the dressings required are in an easily accessible location.

STSGs are generally meshed to allow for increased coverage when limited donor skin is available. This is useful for decreasing the amount of skin harvest, but the interstices also allow for the egress of serum and blood buildup, minimizing the risk of losing the graft because it will maintain contact with the underlying wound. The most common ratios utilized in meshing are 1:1 to 3:1. Increasing this to 4:1 or higher can be done but there is an increased risk of the graft not taking because the distance between the interstices is too large for the skin to heal between them.

Sheet grafts are STSGs that are unmeshed. The largest disadvantage of STSGs is the cosmetic outcome. The meshing is scarred into place at the wound site. They also have increased rates of contracture during healing. Sheet grafts are used in areas greater than 3 cm on the face and hands to reduce the contracture and improve cosmetic outcomes. They are also used in areas that are more commonly exposed, such as the forearms and legs, if possible. The risks of seroma and hematoma buildup resulting in loss of the graft are similar to those associated with full-thickness grafts, so they must be monitored closely.

- Infiltrate subcutaneous tissue with tumescent infiltrate.

- Ensure the dermatome is at the correct height for the desired thickness. This can be as thin as 1/1000 of an inch, but the most common thickness utilized is between 8/1000 and 12/1000 of an inch. This can be easily checked with a #10 scalpel blade. If the blade falls into the space between the dermatome and the dermatome blade, the harvested skin will likely be too thick. The scalpel blade should fit into space easily and then become snug as the scalpel blade thickens. It is essential that appropriate thickness is checked every time, even if the settings are the same.

- The area to be harvested is covered in mineral oil to decrease resistance. Tension is applied to the donor site to make it as even and flat as possible. The dermatome is introduced at a 45-degree angle and advanced while placing downward pressure. It is essential to place appropriate pressure to keep the dermatome in the dermis. Too much pressure will result in a skin graft that is too thick, and the donor site will need more time to heal or may even require primary closure if a full-thickness graft is taken. Too little pressure will result in a skin graft that is too thin, uneven, and irregular. Once the desired length is obtained, the dermatome is lifted off the surface, generally amputating the graft from the adjacent skin left in place. If it does not amputate, it can be severed with a scalpel. The donor site is then covered with a 1:1000 epinephrine and a normal saline pad to allow for hemostasis.

- If the graft is to be meshed, it is taken to the back table where it is placed in the mesher at the desired ratio.

- Once meshed, the STSG is placed on the wound with the dermis side contacting the wound bed. It is then either sutured or stapled into place to reduce shearing and improve contact with the wound. It can also be secured with fibrin sealants, but these are often used in combination with staples and sutures.

Dressings

- Graft site

- 
              
- The graft must be immobilized to prevent shear injury to the healing areas. Shearing of the graft results in failure of neovascularization and leads to graft death. This is especially important with full-thickness grafts and sheet grafts.
              
              
- Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is an ideal dressing choice because it pulls all excessive fluid out from under the graft while keeping it in place. This minimizes risks of shearing. This is the preferred dressing method to protect the skin graft of many surgeons and has been demonstrated to be superior to bolstered dressings.
              
              
- If NPWT is not available, bolstered dressings can be placed and tied or sutured into place to ensure that the underlying graft does not move. The bolster is generally an absorbent gauze to assist with the egress of exudate that will occur.

- Donor site

- Donor site dressing options are numerous and often surgeon dependent. A commonly used dressing is vaseline gauze. It is important to use nonadherent dressings that will not pull off the healing skin when changed. It is usually changed around postoperative day 5.
