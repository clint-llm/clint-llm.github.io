A bicornuate uterus is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes like preterm labor, recurrent abortions, malpresentation.

Strassman metroplasty is indicated in women with recurrent abortions. In a prospective study done over seven years, open Strassman's metroplasty reports improvement in the fetal viability from 0 % to 80%.

Laparoscopic metroplasty has now replaced abdominal metroplasty in most places. A case series performed on patients post-laparoscopic metroplasty reported an 85% pregnancy achievement rate. Seven women with bicornuate uterus carried the pregnancy from twelve weeks to the term.Laparoscopic metroplasty is also associated with a decrease in uterine adhesions and increased uterus compliance, thus decreasing the chances of rupture.
