In 1996, criteria for the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome (MFS) were originally proposed, known as Ghent nosology. These criteria relied on major and minor clinical manifestations of the syndrome. Aortic root dilatation and ectopia lentis are cardinal features of the disease, and other systemic features involving the skeletal and cardiovascular organ systems, ocular, and vertebral anomalies support the diagnosis. Major criteria included: ectopia lentis, aortic root dilatation involving the sinuses of Valsalva or aortic dissection, and lumbosacral dural ectasia by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, family or genetic history, and four of eight typical skeletal manifestations. These criteria underwent revision in 2010 due to various limitations, including insufficient validation, limited applicability to children, and an inability to exclude syndromes such as LDS and SGS. The 2010 revised Ghent nosology puts greater weight on aortic root dilatation/dissection and ectopia lentis as the cardinal clinical features of MFS and testing for mutations in FBN1.

**Systemic Score**

The revised Ghent nosology includes the following scoring system for systemic features

- Wrist and thumb sign: 3 points

- Wrist or thumb sign: 1 point

- Pectus carinatum deformity: 2 points

- Pectus excavatum or chest asymmetry: 1 point

- Hindfoot deformity: 2 points

- Plain pes planus: 1 point

- Pneumothorax: 2 points

- Dural ectasia: 2 points

- Protrusio acetabuli: 2 points

- Reduced upper segment/lower segment ratio and increased arm span/height and no severe scoliosis: 1 point

- Scoliosis or thoracolumbar kyphosis: 1 point

- Reduced elbow extension (equal to 170 degrees with full extension): 1 point

- At a minimum, 3 of the following five features: Dolichocephaly (reduced cephalic index or head width/length ratio), enophthalmos, down-slanting palpebral fissures, malar hypoplasia, retrognathia): 1 point

- Skin striae: 1 point

- Myopia greater than 3 diopters: 1 point

- Mitral valve prolapse: 1 point

- A systemic score equal to 7 indicates significant systemic involvement.

In patients with no family history of MFS, the presence of one of any of the following criteria is diagnostic for MFS:

- Aortic criterion (aortic root dissection or diameter Z equal to 2) and ectopia lentis*

- Aortic criterion (aortic root dissection or diameter Z equal to 2) and a causal FBN1 mutation

- Aortic criterion (aortic diameter Z equal to 2 or aortic root dissection) and a systemic score equal to 7*

- Ectopia lentis and an identified causal FBN1 mutation in an individual with an aortic aneurysm

In patients with a family history of MFS, the presence of one of any of the following criteria is diagnostic for MFS:

- Ectopia lentis

- A systemic score equal to  7 points*

- Aortic criterion (aortic diameter Z equal to 3 below 20 years old, Z equal to 2 above 20 years, or aortic root dissection)*

For criteria with an asterisk (*), the diagnosis of MFS can be made only in the absence of discriminating features of Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, or vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and after TGFBR1/2, collagen biochemistry, or COL3A1 testing if indicated. Later data suggest that additional gene mutations should also be excluded, including those in SMAD3, TGFB2, and SKI.

The revised Ghent nosology recommends the following categories for individuals younger than 20 years old with features of MFS who do not meet diagnostic criteria for MFS:

- Nonspecific connective tissue disorder applies if the systemic score is less than 7 or aortic root measurements are borderline (Z less than 3) in the absence of an FBN1 mutation.

- Potential MFS applies if an FBN1 mutation is identified in a sporadic or familial case, but the aortic root Z-score is less than 3.
