Delayed neurologic sequelae may occur similar to that seen in patients with carbon monoxide poisoning. This syndrome can lead to learning difficulties, short-term memory deficits, personality changes, a parkinsonian-like gait, or tremors. Prompt treatment with hyperbaric oxygen can alleviate and prevent the development of neurologic sequelae.
