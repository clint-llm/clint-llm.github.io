Research is still ongoing concerning optimal treatment selection and sequencing of various options in the course of treatment. For example, one recent study evaluated patients in the early stage of chronic lymphocytic leukemia who were not in an active disease state.

However, findings on ibrutinib have also shown increased toxicity.Â Unfortunately, the available research is still limited, and in this case, the long-term outcomes are unclear, including survival rates and widespread clinical application of these interventions early on. Therefore, guidelines remain that patients in early-stage who are not showing any signs of active disease should remain in observation.
