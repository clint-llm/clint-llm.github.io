Erythema infectiosum is a benign viral illness in children and often managed by the pediatrician, emergency department physician, internist, and nurse practitioner. However, if the infection is diagnosed in a pregnant female an obstetric consult should be made. The virus is known to cause aplastic crises and hydrops fetalis. The pregnant female will need monitoring until delivery. Nurses should isolate immunocompromised patients and monitor them closely. Patients should be educated about the importance of handwashing and infection control techniques. Parents should be told that the rash is not infectious and the child should not be prevented from attending school. The pharmacist should educate the family that there is no specific treatment and that the rash will resolve on its own. If the patient is immunocompromised or pregnant, consultation with the appropriate specialists is highly recommended to ensure good outcomes.

For healthy people, the outcomes are excellent.
