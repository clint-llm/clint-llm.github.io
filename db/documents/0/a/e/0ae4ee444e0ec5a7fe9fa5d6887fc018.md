Background pathophysiology mechanism of macronodular adrenal hyperplasia, which is generally described as the state of elevated level of cortisol, along with the decreased level ofÂ plasma adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) has been implicated with several possible mechanisms including:

- Extraordinary increased expression of aberrant G-protein-coupled receptors which are located through the membranes of specific cells that are capable of producing estrogen via specific corresponding ligands.

- The indirect function of the abnormally enlarged adrenal tissue via the paracrine effect.

- Specific mutations with a couple of variable types, including germline and somatic ones that are evident in approximately 50% of those affected with bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (BMAH).
