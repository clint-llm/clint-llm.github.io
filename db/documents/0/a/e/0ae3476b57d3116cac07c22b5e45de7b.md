Congenital junctional ectopic tachycardia is a more difficult arrhythmia to treat with higher morbidity and mortality as compared to postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia. POJET usually responds better to treatment and is self-limited within 72 hours of its onset. Earlier reports showed CJET causing deaths in up to 35% of the cases as opposed to more recent reports of 4% to 9%.
