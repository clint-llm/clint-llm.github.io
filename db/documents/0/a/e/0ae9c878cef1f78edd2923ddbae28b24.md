**Doppler Signal:**Place the doppler probe over the fistula to obtain a signal. Doppler signals may be described as monophasic, biphasic, or triphasic.

**Thrill:**Place the tips of the fingers lightly over the fistula. A thrill is a vibration felt over the fistula and implies patency.

**Pulsation:**Place the tips of the fingers lightly over the fistula. Pulsation is a strong heartbeat felt over the fistula, which may indicate possible outflow stenosis.

**Overlying Skin Changes:**Erythema, warmth, edema, or drainage may all be signs of possible fistula infection and can lead to loss of vascular access. These findings should be promptly reported to a physician.

**Bleeding:**Continuous oozing at the cannulation site may suggest outflow stenosis or may be the result of coagulopathy secondary to uremia.
