Tay-Sachs disease is a rare autosomal recessive progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Patients usually exhibit a severe clinical course with death in early childhood. Early diagnosis of Tay Sachs is clinically very challenging because of the subtle clinical features and nonspecific biochemical markers. Accurate diagnosis is important both for proper management and to reduce morbidity and also for parental counseling and prenatal diagnosis. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of Tay-Sachs disease; and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of Tay-Sachs disease.
- Outline the evaluation of a patient with Tay-Sachs disease.
- Outline the management options available for Tay-Sachs disease.
