It is essential to gather a thorough history from the patient (or patient’s legal guardian) regarding their past medical history, current medications, and social history (obtain a developmental history if the patient is a child). An interprofessional healthcare team consisting of the patient’s primary care provider, psychiatrist, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, social workers, therapists, school teachers, and pharmacists should oversee the patient case. Communication between each member of the healthcare team is crucial as medication combined with non-pharmacologic treatment measures provide the most long-term success. Evaluation of side effects requires close monitoring at each visit. If the patient is a child, it is crucial to give patient’s legal guardian education regarding the medication and its side effects. This interprofessional approach will optimize therapeutic results while limiting adverse events. [Level 5]

**Outcomes**

Studies have shown that medication alone is not as effective as when methylphenidate is combined with non-pharmacologic treatment measures. Patients with ADHD managed on both medication, and non-pharmacologic treatments have been shown to have higher self-esteem and social functioning skills versus those untreated. Long-term beneficial effects have been shown in adults with ADHD who continue to take methylphenidate. Further long-term studies are still in progress.
