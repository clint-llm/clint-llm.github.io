Although uncommon, the number of carpal bones may vary in the presence of accessory bones, split bones, anatomical variants, or congenital anomalies. Reports exist of over twenty accessory carpal bones, with the most common variants being the os centrale carpi, the os radiale externum, the triangular bone, and the styloideum bone. Other cases of additional carpal bones may involve split bones of the scaphoid, lunate, and even the hamate. Anatomical variants causing extra carpal bones arise due to a failure of fusion from carpal bone ossification centers. Last, congenital anomalies causing fewer carpal bones can occur either due to congenital absence of normal bone (which mainly occurs with the scaphoid, lunate, or triquetrum) or from a coalition between two carpal bones, which most commonly involves the lunate and triquetrum.
