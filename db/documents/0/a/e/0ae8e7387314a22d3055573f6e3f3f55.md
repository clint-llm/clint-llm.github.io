The repair of thoracic aortic injury is associated with known complications. Common to all procedures are the risks of hemorrhage and infection. The most discussed complication following thoracic aortic injury repair is spinal cord ischemia. This occurs due to the interruption of blood flow from the aorta to the anterior spinal cord. Either aortic clamping or covering branches with a covered stent graft can result in spinal cord ischemia. The dreaded result of this ischemia is paraplegia. Considerations for minimizing the risk of spinal cord ischemia include the length of time of aortic clamping, the length of covered stent-graft, level of stent-graft deployment, duration of hypotension, distal aortic pressure, and the number of ligated intercostal branches. Several adjunctive measures have been enlisted to decrease the risk of spinal cord ischemia. Placement of a lumbar CSF drain, corticosteroid administration, and induction of hypothermia have been described to minimize the risk of spinal cord ischemia.

The other primary source of complications is related to the stent-graft device. Preliminary data suggested that 18% of endovascular pairs had a graft complication. The need for a repeat intervention after thoracic endovascular stent deployment is only 1.8% in the trauma setting.

The complication profile differs between open and endovascular approaches. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has been shown to have less early mortality, paraplegia, renal injury, blood product transfusions, reoperations, cardiac complications, pneumonia, and length of stay compared to anÂ open approach.
