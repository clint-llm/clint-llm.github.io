Optimizing outcomes for fibular grafting patients requires coordination among interprofessional team members spanning the entire perioperative period, from initial evaluation to long-term follow-up. Sonographers and radiology technicians, as well as radiologists, are crucial for evaluating perfusion to the distal lower extremity before surgery. Primary care providers must ensure patients are healthy enough to undergo a complex and lengthy operation under general anesthesia. Other medical specialists, such as cardiologists, may be required to confirm candidacy for surgery in patients with more complicated medical histories.

Intraoperatively, the surgeon, anesthesia provider, and nursing staff all play critical roles, with surgeons and nurses continuing to provide care throughout the admission. Physical therapists will also contribute to in-hospital care, providing the patient with strategies and techniques for conducting activities of daily living despite the functional limitations of an operated leg.

Postoperatively, the surgeon and outpatient nursing staff, along with a physical therapist, if necessary, will continue to care for the patient until recovery is complete. Fibular grafting is typically performed for complicated defects, and the degree of technical difficulty during surgery is generally commensurate; recovery afterward can be just as challenging. For this reason, having an interprofessional team whose members possess expertise across the spectrum of the patients' needs will minimize complications and optimize functional outcomes. [Level 1]
