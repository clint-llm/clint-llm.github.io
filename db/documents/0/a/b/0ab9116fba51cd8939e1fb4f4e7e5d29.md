Providers treating TB patients with INH must be cognizant of the patient's baseline liver function and the hepatotoxic risks associated with INH. Although estimates of fatal hepatitis associated with INH treatment are only 0.023%, these cases correlate with continued administration despite symptoms of hepatitis during treatment.

Tuberculosis is a disease with widespread and high-burden effects, both for individual patients and communities. Appropriate treatment is crucial for curing sick patients and limiting the spread of TB and preventing drug resistance. Therefore, a provider treating TB has a responsibility not only to prescribe the appropriate treatment regimen but also to ensure adequate adherence to and completing treatment.

A growing concern is INH-resistant strains of TB, and it appears that these may serve as precursors to multi-drug resistant strains. Thus, providers should monitor patient progress to rapidly detect those who are not responding to INH treatment and, therefore, may harbor a resistant strain. INH-resistant strains require an altered regimen and increased efforts to prevent disease transmission.

Public health departments typically provide TB treatment. They frequently collaborate as part of an interprofessional healthcare team with other entities such as private providers, community health centers, shelters, and others to ensure the completion of treatment. A patient-centered approach should tailor a treatment plan specific to each patient's needs to provide the best opportunity for treatment completion. This approach often involves social workers and case managers in addition to medical professionals, and communication and coordination of services are essential. One way to maximize adherence is direct observation of therapy (DOT), which provides the medications directly to the patient and watches as they swallow them. This approach has become the preferred method of drug administration in TB. DOT offers a close connection to the healthcare system and allows for early identification of nonadherence and adverse effects of treatment or worsening the patient's condition.
