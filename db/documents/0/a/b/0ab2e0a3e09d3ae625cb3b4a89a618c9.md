The differential diagnosis for alcohol toxicity is very broad and includes anything that can cause an altered mental status. Considerations include trauma, sepsis, CNS infections, seizure, nonalcoholic toxicologic ingestion, hypo- or hyperthermia, hypo- or hyperthyroidism, hypoxia, and metabolic derangements. Many of these can coexist with alcohol toxicity, so it is important to have a low threshold to obtain laboratory workup and CNS imaging. Complicating the diagnosis of alcohol toxicity is the potential for the patient to ingest non-beverage alcohol such as cologne, cough syrup, and isopropyl alcohol. This can be accidental, such as in pediatrics, or intentional, such as in patients with alcohol use disorder who do not have access to alcohol. Ethylene glycol, methanol, and isopropyl toxicity are discussed in separate articles, and please see these articles for further details. Once alcohol use has been confirmed, further diagnoses have to be considered, such as Wernicke encephalopathy and hepatic encephalopathy.
