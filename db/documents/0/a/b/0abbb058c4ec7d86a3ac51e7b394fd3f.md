**Classification**

- Collar-stud keratoprosthesis with 2 skirt plates, e.g., Boston KPro, Auralab KPro, which has donor cornea between the plates.

- Soft optic and skirt made from polymers with an intracorneal securing of the skirt within the stromal layers, e.g., Legeais, AlphaCor, KeraKlear.

- The keratoprosthesis device is secured on the external cornea and sclera, with a central clear optical core, e.g., osteo-odonto-KPro (OOKP).

**Boston KPro Type I**

Early models of the Boston KPro had a solid backplate, resulting in higher rates of cornea tissue melt with follow-up. This was due to reduced aqueous flow and penetration to the donor carrier cornea tissue and delivery of nutrients, leading to tissue necrosis and device extrusion or leakage and endophthalmitis. Therefore the backplate was modified to have holes, and a bandage contact lens changed at regular intervals to avoid ocular surface desiccation with long-term prophylactic topical vancomycin administration. This increased biointegration of the KPro with the donor cornea, reducing rates of leakage of pathogenic microbes into the eye.

**Osteo-odonto-Keratoprosthesis (OOKP)**

Previously, porous and nonbiological KPro skirt materials have been trialed, including Teflon, ceramic, Dacron, PTFE, hydrogel, and hydroxyapatite.
