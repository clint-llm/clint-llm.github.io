Lipids have diverse structures but are all similar in that they are insoluble in water. Fatty acids usually possess an even number of carbon atoms, are 16 to 20 carbons in length, and can be saturated or unsaturated (the latter applying to contain double bonds). They are described by the number of carbons they contain and the positions of the double bonds, if any. For example, arachidonic acid has 20 carbons and four double bonds and is written as 20:4, Δ5,8,11,14, or 20:4(ω-6).

All naturally occurring fatty acids possess double bonds in the cis configuration. Polyunsaturated fatty acid classification is often according to the position of the first double bond from the omega-end (the carbon farthest from the carboxyl group). Common examples of these are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Monoacylglycerols (monoglycerides), diacylglycerols (diglycerides), and triacylglycerols (triglycerides) contain one, two, and three fatty acids esterified to glycerol, respectively.
