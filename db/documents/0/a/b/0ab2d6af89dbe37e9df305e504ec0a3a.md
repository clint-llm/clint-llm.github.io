Interictal epileptiform discharges include:

- Paroxysmal fast activity

- Beta frequency activity

- Electromyographic artifact

It is important to differentiate the breach rhythm from interictal epileptiform discharges by scrutinizing the surrounding background activity. Polyphasic interictal discharges are complex with a slow wave and have a characteristic morphology that does not resemble the background activity. Breach rhythm can be differentiated from beta activity by their distribution. Normal beta activity is bilateral but may vary in distribution. The breach effect has a clearly circumscribed region of increased amplitude. The paroxysmal fast activity appears in bursts with an intervening return to asymmetric baseline. EMG artifacts occur in regions with overlying muscle, most commonly frontal and temporal regions. EMG artifacts can be differentiated by their inconsistent presence and much higher components.
