The human body has two SI joints, situatedÂ between the ilium and sacrum on each side of the body. The SI joint is auricular and has characteristics of both diarthrosis and synarthrosis joints. The ligaments form a capsule that follows its auricular margin, with an extracapsular articulation between the sacrum and ilia supported by the interosseous sacroiliac ligament. During pregnancy, relaxin is released, and this can cause the ligaments to loosen. The SI joint innervation is complex, and conflicting information exists. According to some sources, the sensory fibers constitute the lateral branches of the posterior rami of L5 through S4, which serve as the pain generators for the joint.
