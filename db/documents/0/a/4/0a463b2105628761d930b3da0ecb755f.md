Tympanocentesis can be a challenging concept for some clinicians, especially as the advent of antibiotics has made the procedure less common as before and so they may be uncomfortable in performing it. However, this procedure does have a place in our modern medical practices, and familiarity with it can provide the astute clinician with an additional tool in their armamentarium to treat challenging patients.

Tympanocentesis is generally performed by pediatricians, otolaryngologists, and family physicians, according to their expertise and skills. Once mastered, the procedure is easily performed and is a relatively safe, simple, and very effective procedure with a very low complication rate and also few contraindications. Studies have shown that the tympanocentesis skills of the otolaryngologist are superior to those of the pediatricians and the family physicians, a cordial interprofessional relationship among these healthcare professionals would lead to the best patient outcome.

Currently, tympanocentesis is ardently advocated for by pediatric infectious disease experts when managing refractory otitis media.Â Also, the role of tympanocentesis is well-established as a method of intratympanic medication administration for many conditions.
