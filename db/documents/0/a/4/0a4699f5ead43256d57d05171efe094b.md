Surgical interventions involving the scapula occurs most commonly in shoulder arthroplasty, as the glenoid fossa and labrum compose the scapular portion of the shoulder joint. Indications for shoulder arthroplasty include shoulder osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthritis refractory to conservative management and other proximal humeral or rotator cuff pathologies refractory to conservative management. During shoulder arthroplasty, particular caution should be taken to avoid axillary nerve injury.
