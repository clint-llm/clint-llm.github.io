Observation is required for infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis during and at least up to one hour following infusion completion.

Imdevimab and casirivimab are mAbs that are not renally excreted or metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, interactions with concomitant medications that are renally excreted or substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely.
