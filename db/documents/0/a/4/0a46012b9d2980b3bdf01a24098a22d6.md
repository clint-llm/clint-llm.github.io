In the pre-vaccine era, the peak incidence of rubella was in children aged 5 to 9 years, and the peakÂ rates usually occur in late winter and early spring, with sporadic cases appearing year-round in temperate climates.

Rubella affects both sexes equally in children, whereas in adults, rubella affects more women than men.

In countries where rubella is endemic, it is estimated to occur at a rate of 1.30/100,000 in the general population.
