Treatment initially should focus on correcting the acute presenting problem or injury. However, it is crucial to address the social and psychological components of elder abuse as well. Social interventions may include coordinating home health services, meal delivery, transportation for appointments, helping set up insurance, or connecting the older adult with adult daycare or senior centers.

If the patient is in immediate danger, it is vital to protect the patient. This action could require the involvement of law enforcement or hospital security, social work, the hospital legal team, and possibly applying for emergency guardianship.

Most health care professionals qualify as mandatory reporters of suspected elder abuse, although specifics vary some by state. However, many cases of possible elder abuse go unreported. Some reasons for not reporting abuse include concern for the loss of physician control, loss of patient trust, unintended negative consequences, the subtlety of the findings, and retaliation of perpetrators against the victim.
