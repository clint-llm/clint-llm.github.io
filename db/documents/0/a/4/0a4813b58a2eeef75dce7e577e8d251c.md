Mirabegron has been shown to have a very broad safety level in humans. Caution is advisable with drugs that exert effects on or are metabolized by the liver, as mirabegron is also hepatically metabolized. Though safe in humans, studies have shown toxicity in dogs in the form of tachycardia and erythema.
