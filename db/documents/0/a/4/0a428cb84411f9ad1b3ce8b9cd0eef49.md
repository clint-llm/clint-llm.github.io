Fractures of the radial head and neck comprise 1% to 5% of pediatric elbow fractures. The most common fractures involve the epiphysis and the metaphysis.

Distal radial fractures are much more common than radial head and neck fractures. Most commonly, distal radial fractures occur when a patient falls on an outstretched hand resulting in the dorsal displacement of the fragment. These fractures often heal without required surgical intervention; however, more complex fractures require an orthopedic consult. A complex fracture of the distal radius occurs when there is a presence of ligamentous instability, carpal fracture, or articular involvement, or volar displacement. These fractures often require operative treatment.
