Achilles tendon rupture is the most common tendon rupture in the lower extremity. The injury most commonly occurs in adults in their third to fifth decade of life.

Achilles tendon injuries typically occur in individuals who are only active intermittently (i.e., the "weekend warrior" athletes). The injury is reportedly misdiagnosed as an ankle sprain in 20% to 25% of patients. Moreover, patients in their third to the fifth decade of life are most commonly affected, as 10% report a history of prodromal symptoms, and known risk factors include prior intratendinous degeneration (ie, tendinosis), fluoroquinolone use, steroid injections, and inflammatory arthritides.
