Facial reconstruction after MMS is indicated for any patient wishing to undergo a more complete closure of their post-excisional wound (i.e., any reconstruction other than healing by secondary intention). Reconstruction options should be explained to the patient, and include primary closure, skin grafts, local flaps, interpolated flaps, free-tissue transfer. Additionally, other grafts (e.g., cartilage grafts) may be required when additional support is necessary to create a satisfactory reconstruction.

Although the indications are beyond the scope of this paper, MMS is particularly useful for aggressive BCC subtypes, aggressive SCC subtypes (e.g., evidence of perineural invasion), large BCC/SCC, recurrent BCC/SCC, select melanomas, and when lesions exist in areas of aesthetic concern (i.e., the face).
