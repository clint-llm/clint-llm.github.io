Lumbar puncture is a commonly performed procedure in the emergency department and can be of great clinical importance when diagnosing potentially lethal diseases such as meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage. With proper preparation, technique, and care, the risks of complications can be significantly reduced. Mental visualization of the anatomical landmarks before insertion of the spinal needle will aid in the successful completion of a lumbar puncture. Informed decision making and discussion of risk-benefit with the patient will help reduce patient anxiety and lead to better outcomes.
