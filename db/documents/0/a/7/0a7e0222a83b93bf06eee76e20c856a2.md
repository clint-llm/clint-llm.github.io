A nonoperative approach can initially be attempted with wrist immobilization and close observation. This allows for optimal healing and reduction of inflammation and will often be curative. If the pain is persistent, steroid injections can be considered. If these more conservative options for relatively stable LT injuries are unsuccessful, more aggressive surgical options are warranted if symptoms persist.

Surgeons may implement many operative paths, and each has slightly different indications. Arthroscopic intervention is considered the first line treatment, particularly in athletes with isolated LT ligament tears. The best view of the LT ligament in arthroscopy is the 4-5, 6R, and midcarpal portals. Closed reduction and percutaneous pinning with Kirschner wire fixation are indicated when there is acute instability. Direct, open primary repair of the LT ligament is indicated if there is gross instability of the ligament upon inspection during arthroscopy and occasionally capsulodesis can be considered. Another option is LT fusion which is indicated for chronic instability, but has fallen out of favor and nonunion is often a complication.

Post-operative management includes a short arm cast for up to 12 weeks with subsequent removal of K-wires when fully healed.
