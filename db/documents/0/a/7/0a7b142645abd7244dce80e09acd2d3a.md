Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP), also known as polymorphic eruption of pregnancy (PEP) is the most common gestational dermatosis. It is a benign, pruritic, inflammatory skin disorder that is characterized by a polymorphous clinical presentation in the setting of normal laboratory tests and negative direct immunofluorescence. PUPPP usually affects primigravidas in their third trimester of pregnancy. It is less frequent in the immediate postpartum period and has no tendency to recur in subsequent pregnancies. This activity examines when pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy should be considered on differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate a patient presenting with signs/ symptoms of this condition. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical presentation of pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy.
- Explain whether the presence of pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy warrants dermatology referral and/or biopsy.
- Describe the management of pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy.
- Incorporate a structured interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients with pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy.
