Dysdiadochokinesia is an important definition to understand cerebellar dysfunction in the context of clinical disease. It should be routinely assessed in patients who elicit deficits in the coordination of speech and movement, as it is a common finding. As it can be present or absent in cerebellar disease, no incidence or prevalence has been reported.Â Tapping performance showed a decline with increasing age, and male subjects were faster than females in forearm diadochokinesia.

Dysdiadochokinesia can be present in small children without other focalizing neurological deficits or mental retardation. Children under the age of 13 years can present dysdiadochokinesia in 8 to 20% of the cases if tested.
