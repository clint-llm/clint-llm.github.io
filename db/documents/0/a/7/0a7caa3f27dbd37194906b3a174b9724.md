A position statement on drug-assisted prehospital intubation published by the National Association of Emergency Medical Service Physicians (NAEMSP) refers specifically to sedation-facilitated intubation. The organization recommends that the same training, monitoring, and quality assurance standards be adopted by emergency medical service agencies performing sedation-facilitated intubation as those performing rapid sequence intubation. NAEMSP also notes that since the drugs used as induction agents are frequently used for other indications by emergency medical service (e.g., midazolam used to treat seizures), training should emphasize providers’ understanding of the role of these agents in airway management.
