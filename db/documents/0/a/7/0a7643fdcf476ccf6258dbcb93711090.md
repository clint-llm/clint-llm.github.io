Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition that leads to the destruction of pancreatic beta cells which in turn causes insufficient insulin production, resulting in hyperglycemia. Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease requiring insulin replacement and intensive effort by the patient. Treatment is geared toward decreasing hyperglycemia while simultaneously minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia. The complex balance of glucose is affected by food, insulin doses, body stresses, exercise, and dozens of other factors. Patient and family education is key, as is an acknowledgment of the normal developmental stages and the challenges this brings in the context of daily living with a chronic disease. With proper care and support, children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes can expect to lead long and fulfilling lives. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Contrast the etiologies of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
- Contrast the risk factors for the development of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
- Explain how management of type 1 diabetes mellitus differs in children versus adults. 
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care for children affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus.
