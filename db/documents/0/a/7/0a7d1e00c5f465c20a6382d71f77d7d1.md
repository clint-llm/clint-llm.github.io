Methylxanthines have a narrow therapeutic index, and as such, patients receiving them must be watched closely by all members of the care team. Effective communication regarding harbingers of toxicity is crucial. Careful monitoring and awareness of changes in patient condition may play a significant role in early recognition of and intervention for methylxanthine toxicity. However, with the advent of safer, more effective bronchodilating therapies, clinicians should not use methylxanthines routinely.
