The greatest concern with vitreous floaters is the potential for related retinal pathology that is sight-threatening. Two examples are a macular hole or retinal detachment. These occur when the fibers in the vitreous do not break as it is shrinking and pull violently on the retina. If left untreated, both of these problems can lead to significant, permanent loss of sight.

It is best to be evaluated by an ophthalmologist urgently if vitreous floaters develop to minimize the risk of permanent vision loss.
