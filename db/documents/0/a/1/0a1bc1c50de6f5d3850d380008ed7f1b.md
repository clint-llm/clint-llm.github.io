Vascular insufficiency at the planned amputation site is the most significant contraindication to performing a non-urgent BKA. This contraindicates elective or semi-elective procedures until the condition can be optimized. These patients should undergo a thorough preoperative workup, including measurement of pulse volume recordings in bilateral distal extremities to determine adequate vascular flow.

Doppler may assess for gross blood flow, and ankle-brachial indices can evaluate an individual and lower versus upper extremities. Oxygen pressures in the toes and transcutaneous oxygen pressure are useful for determining oxygenation on a microvascular level. In cases of profound vascular insufficiency, bypass grafting or the placement of stents may be necessary before performing a BKA. Some researchers used indocyanine green near-infrared (ICG NIR) fluorescence imaging to predict postoperative skin flap necrosis.

In patients in extremis due to sepsis, blood loss, acute major organ failure, or other causes, every attempt should be made to stabilize the patient before starting a major surgical procedure. The one exception to this is the case of uncontrolled, spreading necrotizing infection, where the source control is often life-saving. Conversely, in cases of acute hemorrhage, local tourniquets may be applied for several hours while resuscitation occurs.
