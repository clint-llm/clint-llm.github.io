On electron microscopy, which has much higher magnifying power than light microscopy, the extensive multinucleated appearance of osteoclasts can be visualized, along with a closer view of the ruffled border adjacent to the bone undergoing resorption. The lacunae in which osteoclasts are contained, resorbing bone, are known as Howship's lacunae. Lying under the ruffled membrane are numerous visible vacuoles. Some of the vacuoles contain cells visibly undergoing apoptosis.
