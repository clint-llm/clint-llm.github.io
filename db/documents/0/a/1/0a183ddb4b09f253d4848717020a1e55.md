**Indications**

There are currently 15 approved indications accepted by the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society. There are both urgent and non-urgent indications

**Urgent**

- Air or gas embolism (can be the iatrogenic or diving related type of injury)

- Central retinal artery occlusion

- Carbon monoxide poisoning

- Clostridial myonecrosis (gas gangrene)

- Compromised surgical grafts and flaps

- Crush injuries/skeletal muscle compartment syndrome/acute arterial insufficiency

- Decompression sickness

- Intracranial abscess

- Necrotizing soft tissue infections

- Exceptional blood loss anemia

- Specific acute thermal burns

- Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (urgent)

**Non-Urgent Indications**

- Delayed radiation injuries for soft tissue or bony necrosis/osteoradionecrosis

- Chronic refractory osteomyelitis

- Enhancement of healing in a problematic wound (diabetic foot ulcers Wagner grade 3, 4, or 5)

After confirming that a patient has an indicated diagnosis, the next step is to perform a thorough history and physical to determine if the patient is an appropriate candidate for hyperbaric chamber treatment. The first ethical obligation to a patient is nonmaleficence ("do no harm"). Healthcare professionals need to review any contraindications or relative contraindications for hyperbaric oxygen treatment.

**Contraindications**

The one absolute contraindication to hyperbaric oxygen treatment is a patient with an untreated pneumothorax. All patients should have lung imaging before treatment. If a patient receives pneumothorax treatment, the risk-benefit ratio would need evaluation before placing the patient in the chamber based on their indication. During pneumothorax management, a chest tube with the Heimlich valve open before initiation of treatment would be an acceptable approach for pre-chamber management in an emergency clinical situation.

Relative contraindications to evaluate before treatment include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure can increase during treatment)

- Diabetes mellitus with glucose levels greater than 300 or less than 100

- Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction less than 35% (hyperbaric can exacerbate congestive heart failure and/or flash pulmonary edema)

- Claustrophobia/confinement anxiety (more common in monoplace chambers, may require multiplace chamber or pharmacotherapy to tolerate treatments)

- Congenital spherocytosis (hyperbaric oxygen can cause severe hemolysis)

- Current upper respiratory infection  (concern for ability to equalize on the descent, or risk of reverse sinus block on the ascent, both of these situations can lead to barotrauma)

- Fever (can lower the seizure threshold during treatment)

- Chronic sinus condition (concern for ability to equalize on the descent, or risk of reverse sinus block on the ascent, both of these situations can lead to barotrauma)

- Pacemaker/implantable device (possibility of malfunction under pressure, if the device delivers a shock in 100% oxygen environment could ignite a fire, need to coordinate with the safety officer and call manufacturer to make sure device has been pressure tested to the treatment depth you are going to recommend)

- Recent eye/retinal/cataract surgery or optic neuritis (buckle procedure can have air trapped, other procedures can leave bubbles inside and usually require a few months waiting period before initiation of treatment)

- Recent thoracic surgery (recommend imaging to rule out pneumothorax)

- Obstructive lung disease/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD)/asthma (lose the hypoxic drive to breathe, can screen with pulmonary function tests and xenon washout study to evaluate for risk of air trapping)

- History of seizures (recommend that the seizures need to be controlled before initiation of treatment, monitor therapeutic levels, may require lower treatment pressures)

- Untreated cancer (controversial topic, but there are no studies to date showing that hyperbarics promote malignant cell proliferation)

- Contact lenses (need to be gas permeable, no hard contact lenses)
