The SLIL consists of three regions of the dorsal, proximal, and palmar regions. The dorsal and palmar regions histologically represent true capsular ligaments. The proximal region is made of fibrocartilage with occasional collagen fascicles. The dorsal region is histologically composed of transversely oriented collagen fascicles and is surrounded by connective tissue containing neurovascular bundles.
