Following the discovery of mycobacterium tuberculosis by Robert Koch in 1882, several other mycobacteria were identified as well. However, they were not recognized as causing disease in humans until the 1980s. Non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous in the environment. They are responsible for opportunistic infections that affect not only the immunocompromised host but also an immunocompetent individual. The incidence of the disease from NTM has been gradually increasing worldwide, becoming, in recent years, an emerging public health problem.
