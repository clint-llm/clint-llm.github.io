Acute psychosis can develop in patients receiving high-dose glucocorticoids. Immediate cessation of the drug on the appearance of symptoms is the first step. Although many drugs, including antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and hydrocortisone, have been tried with variable success, currently, there is no consensus on the ideal therapeutic remedy to stop and reverse the corticosteroid-induced neuropsychiatric adverse effects in adults or children. Their specific adverse effects further limit the use of the medications mentioned above.

Physiologic doses of hydrocortisone have shown to improve mild to moderate psychosocial disturbances and insomnia experienced by children who developed severe behavioral problems with dexamethasone-based treatment regime administered to treat ALL.
