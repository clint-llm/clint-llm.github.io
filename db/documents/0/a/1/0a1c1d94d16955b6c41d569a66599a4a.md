A patient's history plays a significant role in the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis. An extensive history, over multiple years, is helpful. An in-depth review of the patient's activities, including occupation and hobbies, is key in the identification of a source for dermatitis. Close attention should be given to the products and objects of personal use (e.g., cosmetics, hair dyes, fragrances, eyeglasses, clothing, jewelry). The incidence of allergic contact dermatitis increases with age but does not spare any age group. Nickel allergy dermatitis is often a diagnosis that will require multiple visits within the healthcare system. Physical examination findings can include lesions consisting of erythema, induration, scaling plaques, vesicles, bullae, and edema in the acute phase. The spectrum of physical findings can progress to include dryness, scaling, hyperkeratosis, hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and fissuring in the subacute or chronic phases.
