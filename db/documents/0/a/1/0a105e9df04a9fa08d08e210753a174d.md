Typically, pleuropulmonary blastomas involve the lung and the pleura. The CT-scan shoes either a mass or a consolidation. There may also be multiloculated cystic or solid changes. Fifty percent to 60% of type I lesions are limited to the lungs. Spread beyond the lung is more common in type II and III lesions.

PPB appears to have a constitutional and heritable predisposition to other dysplastic or neoplastic diseases in approximately 25% of the patients. Associated conditions include medulloblastoma, thyroid neoplasia, malignant germ cell tumor and others. Thus, all patients with pleuropulmonary blastomas and their families should be evaluated carefully.
