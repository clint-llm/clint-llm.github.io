Galactocele, also known as lactocele, or a lacteal cyst, is a rare benign retention cyst of the breast, defined as a milk-filled cyst. The term galactocele is derived from the Greek words 'galatea,' meaning milky white, and '-cele' meaning pouch. It occurs almost exclusively in lactating females presenting as painless rounded swellings, either unilaterally or bilaterally.

Although a galactocele can occur anywhere along the milk line extending from the axilla to the groin, it has a predilection to form in the retro-areolar region of the breasts. It is important to differentiate galactoceles from other diseases of the breast, e.g., cysts, fibroadenomas, abscesses, or carcinomas. Ultrasound is the preferred modality for the diagnosis. Fine needle aspiration (FNA), resulting in a milky fluid, is often diagnostic and therapeutic.
