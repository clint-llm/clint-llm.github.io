Drug or pill-induced esophagitis is esophageal mucosal injury caused by the medications and usually refers to a direct toxic effect on esophageal mucosa by the culprit medication. Common symptoms include retrosternal pain, dysphagia, or odynophagia. It was first reported in 1970 by Pemberton when a patient was found to have esophageal ulcers after taking potassium chloride tablets.
