LM is characterized by a proliferation of atypical melanocytes along the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ). Early LM may be difficult to distinguish from benign changes of chronic solar damage, which also induces melanocytic hyperplasia.

Lymphocytes are usually seen in the superficial dermis, although prominent lymphocytic inflammation may be a sign of tumor invasion and should therefore prompt closer examination. As LM becomes more invasive (i.e., progresses to LMM), junctional nests become larger and more spindled. Invasion is typically superficial, consisting of isolated or small aggregates of spindled cells in the papillary dermis. Desmoplasia and perineural invasion may occur, and the desmoplastic component may be mistaken for a scar. Rarely, a storiform growth pattern may be present, which may be mistaken for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP).
