Ameloblasts are responsible for enamel synthesis during amelogenesis, a tightly regulated process involving multiple phases in which hydroxyapatite crystals are produced.

Exposure to high plasma fluoride levels during amelogenesis results in the formation of porous hypomineralized enamel.

During the maturation phase, enamel matrix proteins, including amelogenin, are hydrolyzed by proteinases. This process is delayed in fluorosed enamel. Fluoride has also been shown to induce apoptosis in ameloblasts during enamel maturation which is thought to contribute to the enamel pitting found in severe cases of dental fluorosis.
