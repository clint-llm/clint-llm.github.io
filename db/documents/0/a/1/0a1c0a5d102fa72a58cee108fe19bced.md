Airway obstruction secondary to a foreign body is often easily treated, as the foreign body can be removed, and the patency of the airway restored. However, airway obstruction caused by trauma, malignancy, or an infectious process may lead to delayed recovery and hypoxic brain damage. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of airway obstruction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiologic basis of airway obstruction.
- Outline the expected history and physical findings for a patient with airway obstruction. 
- List the treatment options available for airway obstruction.
- Review the need for an interprofessional team approach to caring for a patient with airway obstruction.
