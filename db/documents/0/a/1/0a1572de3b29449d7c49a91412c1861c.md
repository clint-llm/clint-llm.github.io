The exact etiopathogenesis of schizencephaly is not yet clearly understood in the scientific world.

Possible etiological factors include:

- Exposure to teratogenic agents or viral infections prenatally

- Genetic factors

- Stroke in utero

- Young maternal age

Some environmental exposures have been implicated:

- Teratogens such as alcohol, warfarin, or cocaine

- Viral infection, especially cytomegalovirus (CMV), and recently Zika virus

- Attempted abortion

- Hypoxia in the eighth week of gestation

- Amniocentesis, or chorionic villus biopsy

- Maternal trauma

Fetal intracranial hemorrhage caused by abnormal type IV collagen has also beenÂ implicated.

Some genetic mutations have been reported as possible etiological factors for schizencephaly. The main genes identified in this regard are the following:

- COL4A1 mutations

- EMX2-germline mutations

- SHH gene

- SIX3 gene
