The most common cause of Broca aphasia is a stroke involving the dominant inferior frontal lobe or Broca area. A stroke in Broca area is usually due to thrombus or emboli in the middle cerebral artery or internal carotid artery. Other causes of Broca aphasia include traumatic brain injury, tumors, and brain infections. Aphasia is a symptom of degenerative dementing illnesses such as Alzheimer disease. With dementing illness, patients develop gradualÂ progressive language deficits as opposed to a sudden onset of loss of language function that is seen in an ischemic stroke.
