Clinicians evaluating patients with suspected CGD often consider other disorders such as cystic fibrosis (CF), hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, glutathione synthase (GS) deficiency, and Crohn disease.

Patients with CF develop complex infections. However, these infections are typically limited to the lungs with significant bronchiectasis, which is not common in CGD. Patients with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome develop Aspergillus lung infections only when lung cysts are present, typically unseen in patients with CGD.Â  These patients also have elevated IgE levels, whereas CGD patients do not. G6PD deficiency and GS deficiency affect neutrophil respiratory burst and increase susceptibility to bacterial infections. However, G6PD deficiency is associated with hemolytic anemia, and GS deficiency is characterized by hemolytic anemia, increased 5-oxoprolinuria, metabolic acidosis, mental retardation, and other neurological manifestations which are not seen in CGD. Both G6PD and GS deficiencies can be confirmed by showing deficiencies of the respective enzymes in cells. Crohn's disease presents similarly to CGD colitis. However, Crohn's is not associated with severe infections and presents without lipid-laden macrophages, highly characteristic of CGD colitis. Additionally, since the CGD phenotype can be variable, CGD can be mistaken for pyloric stenosis, food allergies, or iron-deficiency anemia.
