For diagnostic pure-tone testing, patients are seated in a sound booth and counseled regarding the testing method and expected response. With young children, parents are instructed on how the behavioral testing will occur, typically with the patient seated in the parent's lap. A young child may receive basic instructions to assist in understanding and comfort with the test procedure.

The audiologist will place appropriate transducers on the patient's head or ears before closing the sound booth door and relocating to an adjacent booth to control the audiometer. The audiologist can observe the patient through an insulated window and hear feedback from the patient via a microphone inside the booth.
