Computed tomography (CT) is one of the primary diagnostic modalities for identifying the appendix and diagnosing any disease present. Diagnosing appendicitis on CT has a sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 76%, respectively.

There has been a debate about the exact criteria for diagnosis; however, as some recent studies argue, a criteria cutoff of greater than 6 mm diameter is too small and leads to negative appendectomies.

For the diagnosis of neoplasms, CT has a sensitivity of 95% in symptomatic patients.
