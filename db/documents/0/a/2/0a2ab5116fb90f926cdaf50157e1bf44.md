- Most CML patients are asymptomatic in the chronic phase and are found by routine complete blood count showing leukocytosis with bimodal increases in myelocytes and mature segmented neutrophils.

- The diagnosis of CML requires the BCR-ABL1 translocation. A traditional karyotype can detect most cases; however, a small subset of cases are cryptic and require FISH.

- CML is divided into 3 phases: chronic, accelerated, and blast phase.

- The BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein acts as a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. The mainstay of treatment in CML is tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Risk stratification scores are useful in determining first-line therapy choices.

- The mutational analysis may be important in cases with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Ponatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor especially useful for those with a T315I BCR-ABL1 mutation.

- Allogenic HSCT is an important consideration for resistant chronic phase and advanced phases of CML.
