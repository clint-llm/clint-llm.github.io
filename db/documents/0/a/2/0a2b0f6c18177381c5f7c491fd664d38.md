The causes of stuttering priapism are similar to the causes of ischemic priapism. They can be classified as hematological, pharmacological, neurological, and malignancy. Sickle cell disease is the commonest cause of stuttering priapism. Although stuttering priapism is not common in the general population, it is relatively frequent amongst males with Sickle cell disease (SCD). It affects between 30% and 45% of all adult males with SCD.
