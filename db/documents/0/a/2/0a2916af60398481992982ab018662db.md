The corneal epithelium provides a smooth optical surface and maintains a protective barrier against infectious agents and damage, serving as the first line of ocular immune defense. Any breach in the continuity of the epithelium renders the eye susceptible to infection, ulcers, and even perforation.

Though uncommon, their management is quite challenging since they are refractory to standard therapy and require a long-term follow-up. Without appropriate treatment, they can have potentially blinding consequences like scarring, infection, vascularization, and vision loss.
