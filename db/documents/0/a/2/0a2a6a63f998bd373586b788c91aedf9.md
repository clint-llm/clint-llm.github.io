Biliary strictures are characterized by narrowing of a segment of the bile duct associated with proximal ductal dilatation. Obstruction of bile flow leads to elevation of serum bilirubin levels with clinical and laboratory features of obstructive jaundice. Stasis of bile is a major risk factor forÂ ascending cholangitis.

As observed from magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), benign strictures have tapered margins with smooth and symmetric borders. On the other hand, malignant strictures have shouldering of the margins with irregular and asymmetric borders.

The strictures can be classified according to the Strasberg-Bismuth classification. Classification helps in guiding management.

Type E injuries lead to strictures of the hepatic ducts, which are further defined by the proximal extent.

- E1: Common hepatic duct division greater than 2 cm from the bifurcation.

- E2: Common hepatic duct division less than 2 cm from the bifurcation.

- E3: Common bile duct division at the bifurcation.

- E4: Hilar stricture involves confluence and loss of communication between the right and left hepatic duct.

- E5: Involves aberrant right hepatic duct with concomitant stricture of the common hepatic duct.
