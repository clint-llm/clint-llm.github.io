Postoperative fever is very common. The exact incidence of postoperative fever is not known, but the numbers are high. Estimates from different surgical procedures reveal that fever occurs early in the postoperative period anywhere from 20% to 90% of patients. In the majority of these cases, the fever usually occurs on the first or second day after surgery and has been linked to benign causes. Postoperative fever is known to occur after all types of surgical procedures, irrespective of the type of anesthesia. The fever also occurs in children and both genders. Postoperative fever can occur after minor surgical procedures but is rare and depends on the type of procedure. Overall, both abdominal and chest procedures result in the highest incidence of postoperative fever.
