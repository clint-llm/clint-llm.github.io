Worldwide, many women do not report abnormal uterine bleeding to their healthcare providers, so it is important to foster an environment of open discussion on menstruation. Primary care physicians should ask women about their last menstrual cycle, regularity, desire for fertility, contraception, and sexual health. If abnormal uterine bleeding canÂ be identified at the primary care level, then further history, examination, and testing can be performed, and the proper consultations can be arranged.

Patients with abnormal uterine bleeding should be educated on any pertinent lifestyle changes, treatment options, and when to seek emergency care.
