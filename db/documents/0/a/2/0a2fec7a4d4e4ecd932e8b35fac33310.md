Causes of clonorchiasis are mostly limited to the ingestion of fish encysted with C. sinensis in endemic regions of the world, including East Asia.

**The Lifecycle ofC. sinensis**

Eggs of C. sinensis enter the water environment from feces. These eggs are then consumed by the first intermediate host, the freshwater snails, in which the eggs release miracidia which undergo a series of developmental stages to sporocyst, rediae, and subsequently cercariae. The cercariae are released from the snail and are free-swimming in the water until they penetrate a freshwater fish. These cercariae encyst then into the flesh of freshwater fish and continue to mature to metacercariae. The infected fish is then ingested by a higher mammal such as humans, where the metacercariae encyst as juvenile flukes in the duodenum. Hermaphroditic adult C. sinensis ascends through the ampulla of Vater into the bile system and can often be found in the intrahepatic bile ducts. Complete maturation can take up to a month.

Snails, including Bithynia fuchsiana, Alocinma longicornis, Parafossarulus striatulus, are important intermediate hosts. These snails are often found in the local waterways, ponds, lakes, and paddy fields. It is eating raw or uncooked freshwater fish (mostly of the Cyprinidae family) that can lead to parasitic infection, but contamination of utensils and food with Metacercariae is also a potential route of infection, which is especially seen in children and women.
