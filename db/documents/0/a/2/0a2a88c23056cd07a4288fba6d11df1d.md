The management and prognosis of oligohydramnios vary greatly depending on the underlying etiology, the gestational age at diagnosis, and the severity of oligohydramnios. Diagnosis of oligohydramnios during the second trimester is more likely to be associated with fetal or maternal anomalies, whereas diagnosis in the third trimester is more likely to be of unexplained origin. In one study, the etiology of oligohydramnios was unexplained in just 4% of second-trimester gestations, whereas 52% of those diagnosed in the third trimester were idiopathic. Only 10.2% of fetuses diagnosed in the second trimester survived, while the survival rate was 85.3% in those diagnosed in the third trimester.

In cases of oligohydramnios diagnosed in the second trimester, pulmonary hypoplasia is the most significant predictor of fetal mortality. The mortality rate of second-trimester oligohydramnios can be as high as 90%, with pulmonary hypoplasia accounting for 87% of those deaths. The most severe pulmonary hypoplasia occurs with oligohydramnios before or during 16Â to 24 weeks gestational age, when the terminal sacs of the fetal lung are developing. Low AFV during the second and early third trimester also increases the likelihood of limb contractures and birth defects due to compression of fetal parts.
