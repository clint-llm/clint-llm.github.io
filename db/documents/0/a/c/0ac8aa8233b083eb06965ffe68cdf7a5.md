The presence of acquired renal cysts increases withÂ advancing age. Simple renal cysts are the most common cystic renal lesions. They are thought to be present in up to 5% of the general population. This prevalence increases to more than 25% in people older than 50 years of age. In the elderly population, renal cysts can account for up to 65%-70% of the renal masses. The prevalence of renal cysts was found to be higher in men compared to women in a retrospective magnetic resonance imaging study of 2000 patients. They also reported a higher prevalence in patients with hypertension and smoking history.
