The FDA-approved indications for desflurane are induction or maintenance of anesthesia in adults. It may also be used to maintain anesthesia in pediatric patients following induction with agents other than desflurane. Desflurane is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. Desflurane is very resistant to defluorination. For this reason, it is not associated with nephrotoxicity, as is the case with other inhalational anesthetic agents. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of desflurane, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients where anesthesia is appropriate.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for using desflurane for anesthesia.
- Describe the possible adverse effects of desflurane.
- Outline the anesthetic mechanism of action of desflurane.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients when using desflurane as an anesthesia agent.
