The transcriptome analysis of germ cell tumors recognized a specific genetic range of alteration, with some differences between histotypes. Molecular studies [9] discovered a teratoma-specific gene signature.CDH11, NCAM1, VCAM1, CLDN4, ITGA2, ITGB7, SDC1, SLC6A6), extracellular matrix-associated proteins (CYR61, COL1A1, COL3A1, COL6A3, THBS1, LGALS4, MFAP4, MGP, SPARC, SPON1), several enzymes and signaling mediators (MMP7, SERPINA1, SERPINA3, PLA2G2A, PLAT).

Two important genes are commonly up-regulated in teratomas (MMP7, EGR1). MMP7 is a metalloproteinase involved in tissue remodeling, mainly cleaving extracellular matrix components and nonmatrix proteins. EGR1 is an anti-apoptotic gene that promotes cell survival even after DNA damage. It is a possible molecular determinant of chemoresistance in teratomas.

Teratoma with malignant transformation (MT) is an entity in which a component of teratoma undergoes malignant transformation (ex. adenocarcinoma, sarcoma, etc.) that is identical to a somatic malignancy.
