DLRPN is a rare presentation of diabetic neuropathy, occurring in approximately 1% of all diabetic patients. This disorder is more frequently seen in males and type II diabetic patients, as compared to type I.

The median period from the initial diagnosis of diabetes, to theÂ onset of DLRPN, is estimated to be approximately 4.1 years.

A population sample studied at Olmsted County, MN, estimated the incidence of LRPN at approximately 4.16 per 100,000 per year, while the estimated incidence of DLRPN was approximately 2.79 per 100,000 per year. This data may differ from the general US population, as a less ethnically diverse population was studied.
