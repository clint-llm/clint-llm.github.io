Following are some necessary preparatory steps to be taken when measuring blood pressure:

- The patient should be explained the need to take their blood pressure and the procedure itself to take informed consent.

- It is also essential to reassure the patient and alleviate anxiety to avoid false readings.

- Ensuring the correct size of the cuff is crucial, as incorrect size may give inaccurate readings. Most guidelines advocate the use of a large cuff for all patients.
