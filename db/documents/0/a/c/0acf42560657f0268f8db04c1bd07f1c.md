Serotonin is a direct-acting neurotransmitter that is commonly stored in presynaptic vesicles. Upon activation of the nerve by adjacent nerve impulses, serotonin is released into the synaptic cleft, where it can bind to postsynaptic receptors.

An estimated 90% of the serotonin in the human body is stored in enterochromaffin cells located in the gastrointestinal tract. Upon luminal and basolateral secretion, the compound is absorbed by circulating platelets. Once activated, serotonin functions to mobilize intestinal contraction and direction via the stimulation of myenteric neurons.

When excessive serotonin is released from the enterochromaffin cell, it frequently is introduced to the bloodstream, where it interacts with blood platelets. The platelets absorb the serotonin and store it until clot forms.Â However, once a clot forms, the serotonin is re-released in the blood, where it can regulate hemostasis and blood clotting.
