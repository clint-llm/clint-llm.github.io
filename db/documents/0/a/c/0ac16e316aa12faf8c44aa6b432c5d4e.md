Cannon A waves are related to rhythm disturbances causing changes in the normal cardiac blood flow causing a large pressure vein in the jugular vein. Different dysrhythmias may cause cannon A waves. Heart block may lead to cannon A waves, in particular, third-degree (complete) heart block. It may be seen with ventricular tachycardia (VT) as a result of the underlying atrioventricular (AV) dissociation. Another cause is Pacemaker syndrome without proper synchronization of atria and ventricles.

Cannon A waves need to be distinguished from giant A waves that occur in right heart structural changes such as tricuspid valvulopathies, right ventricular hypertrophy, and pulmonary hypertension. To the observer of the jugular, venous-pressure giant A waves and Cannon A waves may appear similar. From physical exams alone it might be difficult to differentiate between them.
