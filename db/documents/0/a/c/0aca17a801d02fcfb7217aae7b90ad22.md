The characteristic clinical feature helps in the easy diagnosis of PWS. It usually presents a diagnostic challenge when associated with other cutaneous or visceral vascular malformations and skin/soft tissue/visceral anomalies. Ultrasound with color doppler is a useful tool in determining the flow resistance and thus identifying arteriovenous malformations (fast-flow vascular malformation) that clinically mimick PWS.

Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography can be used to detect any superficial or deep tissue anomalies that could be associated with PWS in the setting of a combined vascular malformation or a syndrome.

Imaging delineates the extent of these anomalies, assesses their severity, and ascertains the diagnosis. A lesional biopsy is routinely not done to confirm the diagnosis; however, it can be used to differentiate from its clinical mimickers, prove the diagnosis of acquired PWS, and to sample tissue for genetic studies.
