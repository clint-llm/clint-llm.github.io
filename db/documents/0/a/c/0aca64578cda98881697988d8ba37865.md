The epiphysis cerebri is surrounded by the pia mater. The following are the cells in the pineal gland.

The pineal gland has a structure called the corpora arenacea (brain sand) located in the gland. These bodies are prone to an increase in calcification with an increase in age. They are visible on x-ray and can be used as landmarks. Chemical analysis of the calcium deposits shows the different compositions, including calcium phosphate, magnesium phosphate, calcium carbonate, and ammonium phosphate.
