The most common method of diagnosing color vision defects is with ‘pseudoisochromatic’ plate tests, such as Ishihara plates, due to the ease of access and use. However, these tests often fail to differentiate different types of dyschromatopsia. Another diagnostic tool, ordering tests, requires patients to sort different disks based on color progression. Compared to plate tests, these tests are typically more sensitive at detecting color vision abnormalities, as well as better at determining specific diagnoses. Additional diagnostic methods of interest include matching tests, which are attractive due to the possibility of administering and scoring them on a computer. Genetic tests, the examination of retinal morphology (including fundoscopy and OCT), and electrophysiological tests (such as ERG) can also aid in the diagnosis and characterization of color vision defects.
