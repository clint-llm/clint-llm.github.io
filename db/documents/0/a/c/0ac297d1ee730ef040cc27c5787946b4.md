**Adverse Effects:**Succinylcholine use should be avoided in patients with severe hyperkalemia, significant burns, denervating disease, and a history of malignant hyperthermia.

**Drug Interactions**

- Antimicrobials - Aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, polymyxins, and clindamycin can potentiate neuromuscular blockade.

- Inhaled anesthetics can potentiate neuromuscular blockade when used with nondepolarizing NMBAs.

- Anti-seizure drugs - Chronic treatment with anti-seizure medications can make a patient resistant to nondepolarizing NMBAs.

- Lithium can potentiate neuromuscular blockade in both depolarizing and nondepolarizing NMBAs.

- Local anesthetics can potentiate neuromuscular blockade in both depolarizing and nondepolarizing NMBAs.
