Tennis elbow is often an overuse injury primarily due to repetitive strain from tasks and activities that involve loaded and repeated gripping and/or wrist extension. It historically occursÂ in tennis players but can result from any sports that require repetitive wrist extension, radial deviation, and/or forearm supination. It is also seen in athletes who play squash and badminton, and other sports or activities that require similar movements. This condition is often precipitated by poor mechanics and technique or improper equipment in the athletic patient population.
