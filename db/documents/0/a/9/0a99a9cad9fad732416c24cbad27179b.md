A 2014 consensus statement published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine stated that successful treatment of athletes and exercising women is contingent on an interprofessional approach for recovery from the triad, including a primary care and/or sports medicine physician, a sports dietitian, and a mental health nurse/practitioner. These patients have multiple organ dysfunction and yet at the same time remain noncompliant with therapy. The treatment is often prolonged and these patients need long term monitoring including bone density. The outcomes of these patients is guarded; despite mental health counseling, relapses are common.
