Patients with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy may present to the primary caregiver, nurse practitioner, or the internist. It is important for the healthcare professional to know that the cause may be an underlying malignancy. Thus, a thorough history and physical exam are necessary. A chest x-ray may reveal a lung lesion. Depending on the findings, an appropriate referral is necessary.

HOA is a poor prognostic indicator in certain diseases and may justify more aggressive therapy for specific conditions such as stage I non-small cell lung cancer.

An interprofessional team is the best approach to addressing HOA (both PHO and SHO). This team includes physicians, specialists, and specialty-trained nursing staff, working and communicating together to achieve optimal care and patient outcomes. [Level V]
