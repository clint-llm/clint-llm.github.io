The initial presentation of a patient with cystine stones is identical to any patient with obstructing urolithiasis except that they will often present at a younger age or even as children. They typically will develop acute flank pain with hematuria, often associated with nausea and vomiting. The pain will radiate around the flank towards the groin, and they often have costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness. Microscopic or gross hematuria is frequently present, but up to 15% of patients with obstructing stones may not have microscopic hematuria. The strongest element in the patient's history is a positive personal or family history of cystinuria or cystine stone formation.
