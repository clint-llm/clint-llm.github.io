A developing topic in palliative and hospice care is that of assisted death. A handful of countries have legalized the practice which includes the patient filling a prescription from a provider for a lethal dose of medication after the appropriateÂ screening. In the United States of America, California, Montana, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington have laws that allow for terminally ill patients to choose assisted death if appropriately screened.
