The healthcare team, e.g., physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, needs to work together to ensure that the patient correctly receives linezolid and is monitored for adverse drug reactions. Educate the patient about signs of significant adverse drug reactions, e.g., wheezing, chest tightness, seizures, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat and severe diarrhea, etc. Encourage the patient to consult the healthcare team for questions about linezolid treatment. To prevent the inappropriate clinical use of linezolid, most hospitals have a committee that includes a pharmacist and an infectious disease expert who must first authorize its use.
