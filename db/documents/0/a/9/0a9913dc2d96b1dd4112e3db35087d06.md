Narcolepsy is a rare sleep disorder that has no cure and is difficult to manage. The condition needs lifelong monitoring by an interprofessional team that may include a social worker, sleep specialist, neurologist, psychiatrist, mental health nurse, caregiver, and the primary provider. The condition is managed with both medications and behavior modifications. Not everyone has a good response to medications and many people have a poor quality of life. Many patients remain homebound, are not able to drive or perform daily living activities for fear of injuring themselves during the sudden bouts of sleep or cataplexy.

Patient and caregiver education is vital regarding treatment and its adverse effects. In addition, these patients should be told not to drive since a sleep attack can occur at any time.

Patients with narcolepsy may face difficulties with work-related issues and psychosocial support. They may have difficulty with work or social engagements and struggle with misconceptions regarding their disease. Patients may benefit from a support group and a mental health nurse consult. The pharmacist must educate the patient on medication compliance as this therapy can reduce symptoms and improve the quality of life. At school or on vacation, all patients with narcolepsy must wear a life jacket before undertaking any water-related activity.

Open communication between the team members is vital if one wants to improve outcomes.
