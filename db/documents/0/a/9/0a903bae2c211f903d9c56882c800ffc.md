The detection of RTK gene mutations, amplifications, and rearrangements is of the utmost clinical importance, as they have significant therapeutic and prognostic implications. The DNA sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) are the main laboratory tests that detect these gene alterations. DNA sequencing using the Sanger method continues to predominate in clinical labs, although the use of next-generation sequencing techniques is increasing. These high throughput methods use parallel sequencing to produce large volumes of short sequence data more quickly and at a lower cost than traditional methods. They are most useful in detecting single-nucleotide mutations.

FISH utilizes fluorescent probes that complement a gene or DNA sequence of interest and is particularly helpful in the case of gene amplification, deletions, or translocations. Lastly, IHC employs antigen-specific antibodies linked to either a fluorescent molecule or an enzyme that reacts with its substrate to form a colored product. This method does not directly identify genetic aberrations like the previous two methods, but indirectly by detecting the abnormal expression or overexpression of a gene product on a cell’s surface.
