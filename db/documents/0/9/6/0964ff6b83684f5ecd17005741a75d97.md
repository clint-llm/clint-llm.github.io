Doxycycline hyclate has proven to have an effective therapeutic spectrum. Oral administration is most common, but delivery can also via an IV if necessary. An oral dose of 100 to 200 mg is absorbed rapidly. Data shows doxycycline was detectable in the blood as soon as 15 minutes after administration. It has a reported peak plasma concentration of 1.7 to 5.9 mg/mL after 2 to 3 hours and an elimination half-life of 15 to 30 hours.

There are no standard routine tests to monitor the use of doxycycline. The most significant side effect is hepatic injury, which can be avoided by administering doxycycline hyclate at the recommended dosage and keeping contraindications and adverse effects in mind.

Tetracyclines are contraindicated in pregnancy, lactation, and children under 12 due to proven human teratogenic effects, yet there is no evidence against doxycycline specifically.
