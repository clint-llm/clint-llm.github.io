It is essential to approach hypercalcemia history and physical examination by focusing on the signs and symptoms relevant to the disease and the underlying causative disorder.Â Symptoms can easily be remembered by using the mnemonic: bone (refers to bone pain, pathological fractures), groans (gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting), stones (often kidney stones), moans (malaise, generalized weakness/ fatigue), and psychiatric overtones (i.e., confusion, depression).

Clinical manifestations can be summarized as follows, depending on the severity of hypercalcemia and the chronicity of the disease. Renal manifestations include polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and renal failure. Gastrointestinal manifestations include anorexia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, constipation, and pancreatitis. Neuromuscular manifestations include depression, lethargy, cognitive dysfunction, coma, and fatigue. Cardiac manifestations include short QTC, Heart blocks, bradyarrhythmia, and hypertension.
