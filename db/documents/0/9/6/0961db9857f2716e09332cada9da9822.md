The most common clinical manifestations of Proteus infection are urinary tract infections (UTIs). In general, UTIs are more common in individuals aged 20 to 50 years and most common in women of this age group. In otherwise healthy women, Proteus accounts for 1% to 2% of all UTIs (E.Â coli being the most common), while in hospital-acquired UTIs, Proteus accounts for 5%. Complicated UTIs (i.e., secondary to catheterization) have an even higher association with Proteus infection at 20% to 45%.

Risk factors for UTIs include sexual activity in both men and women, unprotected anal intercourse in men, an uncircumcised penis, or immunodeficiency (e.g., CD4 count less than 200/uL).

Other factors that may increase the risk of infection by P. mirabilis include female sex, longer duration of catheterization, improper catheter cleaning or care, underlying illness, and lack of availability of systemic antibiotics.

In the United States, gram-negative bacteremia occurs as a result of genitourinary tract infections in 35% of patients.
