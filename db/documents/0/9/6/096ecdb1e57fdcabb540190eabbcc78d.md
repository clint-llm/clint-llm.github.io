As with other methylxanthines, theophylline toxicity can lead to gastrointestinal distress, insomnia, and tremor. Reports also exist of severe nausea and vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, and convulsions, more commonly in cases of overdosage. Very large overdoses, such as those during suicide attempts, could potentially be lethal because of the development of arrhythmias and convulsions.

- Activated charcoal may prevent absorption by adsorbing the drug in the intestine.

- Beta-blockers could potentially help in reversing the severe cardiovascular toxicity caused by theophylline.

- Intravenous benzodiazepines may abort seizures.
