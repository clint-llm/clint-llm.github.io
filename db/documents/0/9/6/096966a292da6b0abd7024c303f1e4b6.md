- Isolated PMI is difficult to diagnose owing to the absence of traditional STEMI criteria and standard 12-lead positioning

- ST depressions in the precordial leads, deepest in V1-V4, are concerning for PMI and require further immediate attention

- Posterior ECGs should be performed when investigating PMI; however, posterior leads may be falsely negative and should not dissuade against emergent reperfusion if there are concerning findings such as ST depression in the anterior leads

- Occlusion MI affecting the posterior wall frequently does not meet STEMI criteria, requiring the practitioner to develop ECG interpretation skills beyond the current STEMI vs. NSTEMI paradigm to deliver optimal care to patients with ACS.
