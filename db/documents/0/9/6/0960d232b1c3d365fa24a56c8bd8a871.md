The gelastic seizures associated with hypothalamic hamartomas are complicated to treat or manage.

If precocious puberty is the isolated finding with the hamartoma, then medical management is focused on suppressing the pubertal development. An example of this treatment plan would be the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog.

There are no proposed treatment algorithms for behavioral and psychiatric symptoms in patients with hypothalamic hamartoma.

Behavioral symptoms are common in children with epilepsy. Often parents report their children being more restless and irritable before seizure onset. Controlling seizures ultimately controls aggressive behavior in children. The literature describes this phenomenon in several places. Surgical removal of hypothalamic hamartoma is the more definitive treatment in controlling seizures. After surgical removal, three patients became seizure-free, eight had over 90% reduction in seizures, and all of these eleven patients experienced a dramatic improvement in behavior and cognition.
