The most common toxic side effect of rosuvastatin is myalgia. If the patient has mild to moderate muscle symptoms, the drug should be discontinued to evaluate other causes of myalgia. If there is a resolution of the underlying etiology, the patient can restart the original or a lower dose of rosuvastatin; however, if symptoms reoccur for a second time, then discontinue rosuvastatin indefinitely. Switching to a different statin medication at a lower dose may relieve muscle symptoms.

It is clear that if severe muscle symptoms or fatigue occur, the provider should discontinue the medication and order a creatinine phosphokinase level, serum creatinine, and a urinalysis to evaluate for myoglobinuria.
