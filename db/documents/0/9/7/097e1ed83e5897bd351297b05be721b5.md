Electrophysiologic testing is indicated in patients with different arrhythmias. Even the genesis of arrhythmia is more complicated; it can be summarized in three significant mechanisms: automaticity, triggering, and reentry. Most arrhythmias are reentrant, necessitating a critical isthmus to maintain.

**Indications of the EPS**

- **Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)**The SVT or narrow complex tachycardia is frequent and associated with a heart rate above 100/minute and a QRS complex shorter than 120ms.
- **Narrow QRS complex SVT******Narrow QRS tachycardia that usually needs EPS:**regular narrow QRS tachycardias**- sinus tachycardia, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, sinus nodal reentrant tachycardia, focal atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter with stable atrioventricular conduction, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, junctional ectopic tachycardia, orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia and irregular narrow QRS tachycardias- atrial fibrillation, focal atrial tachycardia with variable atrioventricular block, atrial flutter with variable atrioventricular block, multifocal atrial tachycardia. EPS should be performed to diagnose SVT, particularly when anticipating catheter ablation. Because of the narrow QRS complex, a high septal ventricular tachycardia can mimic an SVT. Accessory pathways- the majority of accessory pathways conduct both anterogradely and retrogradely. The 2019 ESC Guidelines (the first guideline update in 16 years) regarding the management of patients with SVT recommends (class I) EPS in asymptomatic patients (including athletes and patients with high occupational risk) for assessment of sudden cardiac death risk. Catheter ablation is indicated when EPS with the use of isoprenaline identifies high-risk features: anterograde effective refractory period below or equal to 250ms, RR minimal pre-excited interval during atrial fibrillation less than or equal to 250 ms, multiple accessory pathways, induction of an accessory pathway-dependent tachycardia.
- **Wide QRS complex SVT**- regular (SVT with an QRS complex over 120 ms): antidromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, all supraventricular tachycardias with aberration or preexisting or rate-dependent bundle branch block, atrial tachycardia with preexcitation having the accessory pathway as a bystander and irregular: atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or tachycardia with variable atrioventricular block, conducted with aberration, antidromic atrioventricular tachycardia due to a nodo-ventricular or nodo-fascicular accessory pathway with variable ventriculoatrial conduction. The EPS in those patients aims to establish the underlying mechanism and to guide catheter ablation.

- **Ventricular tachycardia (VT)**
- **Non-sustained VTs.**The absence of structural heart disease, non-sustained VT, is not considered a risk marker for sudden death. The situation changes dramatically when a structural cardiac disease and LV failure is present because in association with non-sustained VT results in a negative prognostic. The EPS is indicated in symptomatic patients with non-sustained VT to identify potential candidates for radiofrequency ablation or ICD implantation (class II).
- **Sustained monomorphic VTs.**Patients with structurally normal hearts the most frequent VT is the right ventricular outflow tract VT. An EPS should take place before catheter ablation in those patients. In patients with structural heart disease, the most common underlying mechanism associated with VT during or after the healing of myocardial infarction is reentry. Two essential conditions must occur for reentry- successful conduction in one direction only (unidirectional block) and a circuit cycle length superior to any effective refractory period of the structures implicated into the circuit. The clinical tolerance of a ventricular tachycardia relates to the heart rate, retrograde conduction through the AVN, the basal ejection fraction of the left ventricle, and other compensatory mechanisms. The EPS is a vital investigation mainly because it identifies patients at risk for sudden cardiac death, identifies those patients eligible for ICD implantation, and guides catheter ablation (class I). It is useful to assess VT recurrence under chronic antiarrhythmic treatment and to guide the catheter ablation in case of recurrence. The ICD implantation is recommended as the first intention in several cases: the patient has multiple episodes of VT, which are hemodynamically not tolerated, the patient is receiving chronic optimal antiarrhythmic treatment at the moment of multiple episodes of a stable VT, and the ejection fraction is under 35%.
- **Polymorphic VTs-**is an unstable rhythm with continuously changing QRS morphology. It is usually associated with the acute setting of the myocardial infarction, but it can present in association with cardiomyopathies (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy) and other channelopathies (Brugada syndrome, short QT syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic VT)**.**The EPS is not routinely recommended in patients with acute myocardial infarction. However, it might play a role in patients with inherited diseases. In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the EPS can guide radiofrequency ablation of associated arrhythmia like SVT and preexcitation (class I) and to identify the indication for catheter ablation in symptomatic patients with monomorphic, sustained VT. In patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, the EPS is considered for sudden cardiac risk stratification (class II).
- **Premature ventricular contractions.**The current consensus specifies that isolated PVC with a structurally normal heart is considered benign. In patients with structural heart disease and left ventricular dysfunction, more than 10 PVCs/hour and runs of non-sustained VT represent a marker of increased risk for sudden death. More than 24% PVC per 24h and a short coupling interval < 300ms or R on T phenomenon are also markers of risk. EPS is necessary in the case of symptomatic PVCs associated with increased markers of sudden death to guide radiofrequency ablation.

- **Sinus node dysfunction**includes sinus bradycardia, sinoatrial block, sinus arrest, chronotropic incompetence, sinus pause. The EPS is used to assess the link between the symptoms and the sinus node dysfunction and sinus bradycardia in which non-invasive methods cannot establish a direct relation (class I).

- **Conduction abnormalities.**
- **Atrioventricular block**. Symptomatic patient associated with the entire situations when the non-invasive diagnostic fail to specify the level of block.
- **Bundle branch block/ /bifascicular block/trifascicular block/ intraventricular conduction disease.**
- Bifascicular block is classically one of the two following variants: right bundle branch block (RBBB) + left anterior hemiblock (LAHB) or RBBB + left posterior hemiblock(LPHB)
- Trifascicular block is one of the three following variants: alternation of RBBB+ LAHB and RBBB+LPHB, alternation of LBBB and RBBB or combination of bifascicular block and a type I atrioventricular block with an infrahisian location
- Left bundle branch block (LBBB) can be considered as a variant of bifascicular block. EPS performed in this patient aims to identify the patient at risk of a complete atrioventricular block and the need for pacemaker implantation.
- Nonspecific intraventricular conduction disease is a prolongation of the QRS complex, which does not accomplish the criteria of LBBB or RBBB.


- **Syncope**-patients with unexplained syncope, bi-fascicular bundle branch block, and an HV interval greater than or equal to 70 ms determined during the EPS, the implantation of a pacemaker is recommended (class I, level of evidence B) according to the 2018 ESC Guidelines on diagnosis and management of syncope. An EPS is indicated when syncope remains unexplained after non-invasive evaluation in patients with syncope and previous myocardial infarction or other scar-related conditions (class I, level of evidence B). Whereas a positive EPS predicts the cause of syncope, a negative study cannot exclude an arrhythmic syncope; therefore, further evaluation is necessary. EPS is generally useful in patients with syncope, abnormal ECG, structural heart disease, and palpitations.

- **Other indications for EPS**include patients with progressive cardiac conduction disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, muscular dystrophies (Duchenne, Becker), post antiarrhythmic surgery, sarcoidosis, congenital heart disease, survivors of cardiac arrest, undocumented palpitations, guiding drug therapy, conduction disorders after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
