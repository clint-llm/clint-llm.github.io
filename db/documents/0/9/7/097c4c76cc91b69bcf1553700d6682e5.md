Various sites around the body can be successfully cannulated with a peripheral venous line. The non-dominant upper extremity is commonly chosen, because of comfort, reduced risk of dislodgement, and lower incidence of thrombosis or thrombophlebitis.

- In the upper extremity, potential sites start distally with the metacarpal veins on the dorsum of the hand, which drain proximally through the dorsal venous arch, becoming the cephalic and basilic veins in the forearm. Near the antecubital fossa, these are connected by the median cubital and median antebrachial veins before continuing up the arm.

- In the lower extremity, lines may be placed starting with the dorsal venous plexus of the foot, which becomes the great and small saphenous veins in the leg.

- The scalp may be appropriate in neonates or infants, particularly where previous attempts at the limbs have failed or are likely to be unsuccessful. Frontal, occipital, superficial temporal or posterior auricular veins are an option.

Preferred veins are straight, distal and non-branched (venous valves are commonly near branching points). When using an access site on a limb, a tourniquet may be placed proximally to the site to engorge the vein, and it should feel spongy and non-pulsatile on palpation; veins that feel hard are more likely to be thrombosed, and pulsatile flow indicates an artery rather than a vein.

Identifying access sites may be more difficult in specific patient populations such as children, the obese, pregnant women, those with dark-toned skin, patients in shock, or those whose veins have been compromised by previous chemotherapy or by intravenous drug abuse.
