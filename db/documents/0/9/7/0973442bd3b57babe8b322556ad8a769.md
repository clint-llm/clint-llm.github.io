Emerging treatments include the following:

**Fungal Beta-galactosidases**

Two fungal beta-galactosidases from Aspergillus carbonarius ATCC6276 are beta-gal 1 and beta-gal 2. They can be given alone or in combination and may be used as an enzyme supplement for lactose intolerance.

**Nutrigenomics**

Nutrigenomics may be used in the future management of hypolactasia through prompt identification of specific mutations or haplotype patterns that modulate dietary responses in affected individuals.
