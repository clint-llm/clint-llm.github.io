Preterm birth is a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. One of the most significant risk factors for preterm birth is a history of preterm delivery, and one etiology of preterm birth is cervical insufficiency. Cervical cerclages have been used to prevent preterm birth since the 1950s, yet their efficacy continues to be questioned and studied. A 2017 Cochrane review supports that “pregnant women with cerclage were less likely to have preterm births compared to controls before 37, 34, and 28 completed weeks of gestation.”

A meta-analysis showed that patients undergoing elective cerclage delivered at a significantly higher gestational age and had significantly higher birth weights compared to those undergoing emergency cerclage. Additionally, there was a higher incidence of premature rupture of membranes in the emergency cerclage group.
