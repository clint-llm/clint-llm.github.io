Wounds generallyÂ heal in 4 to 6 weeks. Chronic wounds are those that fail to heal within this timeframe.

Many factors can lead to impaired healing. The primary factors are hypoxia, bacterial colonization, ischemia, reperfusion injury, altered cellular response, and collagen synthesis defects. These may result from a systemic illness, such as diabetes, or chronic conditions, such as smoking or malnutrition. Local factors that can impair wound healing are pressure, tissue edema, hypoxia, infection, maceration, and dehydration.

Bacterial biofilm, a slime created by a bacterial community to protect against host defenses and allow bacterial proliferation, is another inhibitory factor of wound healing. Biofilm can produce low oxygen, low pH environment for the wound. This film also can create a physical barrier that prevents cellular migration and prevents antibiotic and antibody penetration.
