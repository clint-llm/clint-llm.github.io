Back pain is one of the most common causes of healthcare visits and costs a tremendous amount each year. The etiology of back pain is far-reaching and complicated due to a long differential diagnosis. The diagnosis of osteoarthritis is difficult to correlate with the origin of a patient's back pain. Therefore, it is essential to develop an interprofessional approach that reaches many levels of healthcare to provide optimal treatment for patients suffering from this condition. Primary care providers provide education and preventative strategies for patients with back pain. As the first contact with patients, they help prevent unneeded testing and invasive procedures, ultimately improving patient quality of life. Physical therapy and home strengthening programs prolong the potential need for future surgery in patients with chronic back pain. Orthopedic and neurological surgeons, as well as pain medicine physicians, can facilitate care when the etiology of back pain is uncertain, or there is a more concerning cause for the pain, such as spinal stenosis with neurological deficits or cauda equina. Pharmacists can oversee the pharmaceutical care rendered for this type of pain, ensuring that the clinician prescribes the right agents at the correct dose and ensuring that adverse events remain in check. Less invasive procedures such as facet joint injections and epidural injections provide for symptomatic pain relief. Surgical intervention may be necessary.
