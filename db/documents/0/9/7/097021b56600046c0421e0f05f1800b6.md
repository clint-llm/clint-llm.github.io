More than 15 years since its introduction, conventional CXL has proven to be a safe and effective means of halting the progression of corneal ectasias, reducing the need for more invasive treatment options. Modified CXL techniques have had mixed results regarding efficacy when compared to conventional CXL, and long-term follow-up results are still needed. In addition to treating ectasias, CXL has increasing utilization as a treatment for microbial keratitisÂ and reduction of low myopia, and further research into these domains is still underway.

The number of CXL procedures performed in the last ten years has increased drastically. The majority of patients are seen in the first two decades of life. Hence it is highly imperative to pick up these patients early in the course of the disease, document the progression, and cross-link these eyes so that irreversible visual loss can be prevented. There are treatment options for thin corneas of less than 400 um, and vision can be safeguarded in most cases.
