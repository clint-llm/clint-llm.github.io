Historically, Roth spots were considered to be a pathognomonic finding for bacterial endocarditis secondary to septic emboli within the retina. Given recent histological data, it is now believed that Roth spots are the result of retinal capillary rupture and intraretinal hemorrhage. Roth spots occur in a multitude of disease processes in which retinal blood vessel injury and subsequent bleeding and hemorrhage occur. A common thread found in these conditions is a predisposition for endothelial dysfunction allowing for retinal capillary disruption. Histological examination reveals that the white centered lesions are composed mostly of fibrin, which represents a fibrin-platelet plug at the site of vessel rupture.
