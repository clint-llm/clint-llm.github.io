Under light microscopy, a thickened stratum corneum will be seen from samples of any skin region. The remaining layers (granular, spinous, basal), as well as the dermis, are not affected. Characteristic features of HI seen in the epithelial keratinocytes include absent lamellar granules, multivesicular bodies, and autolysosomes. Between the first cornified cell layer and the granular layer, extracellular lamellar structures are absent. Also, abnormal lipid droplets and vacuoles, which contain dense granules or laminated structures are found in immature keratinized cells.
