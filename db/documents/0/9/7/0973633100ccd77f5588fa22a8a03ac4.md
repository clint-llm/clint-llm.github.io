Once a diagnosis of M. marinum infection is made, it is important to instruct the patient on limiting their risks of exposure to the bacterium. The patients themselves are not infectious to other individuals, which is of most concern to patients and family members. Avoiding contact with aquatic environments when skin abrasions/cuts are present is ideal. When exposure is unavoidable, such as in the case of individuals who work near saltwater, they should be instructed on how to properly clean the skin after water exposure with an antibacterial preparation and to cover abrasions with waterproof bandages. Individuals who work with aquariums should wear gloves at all times.
