When in the lab, it is important to use caution during the process of sample preparation before placing the compound in the mass spectrometer for analysis. For example, using the proper measuring tools for accuracy during chromatography is essential.

Operating the mass spectrometer requires safety to be taken into consideration.Â The mass spectrometer apparatus can have high temperatures, which can result in burns. Thus, it is important not to touch any part of the apparatus while the spectral data is generated. Additionally, ionization occurs within the device, so it is essential to be cautious when running a mass spectrometer. Lastly, the samples placed in the spectrometer could be hazardous upon exposure to the skin or inhalation.
