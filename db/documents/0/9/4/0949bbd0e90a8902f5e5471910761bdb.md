The following equipment is needed:

- Bovie or bipolar cautery, harmonic scalpel, electronic tissue fusion devices, or surgical ties, according to the surgeon's preference.

- Frozen pathology analysis to confirm parathyroid tissue.

- Intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM): RLN monitoring is an attempt to reduce the risk of nerve injury during parathyroid surgery, especially in re-operative parathyroid surgery.

- In focused parathyroidectomy, ultrasound or Gamma probe can be used to localize abnormal gland intraoperatively, and intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) assay to confirm the removal of the hyperfunctioning gland should be coordinated with the pathology department if it is planned.
