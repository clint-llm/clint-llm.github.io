The majority of skin lesions first present to primary care providers, including nurse practitioners. However, the number of cutaneous lesions is vast, and the primary care provider cannot know all of them. Thus, it is important to work in collaboration with a dermatologist when faced with an unknown skin lesion. The other important fact is that clinicians should not presume that all skin lesions are benign; missing a malignancy can prove to be devastating for the patient.

Acquired digital fibrokeratoma is most commonly diagnosed based on history and physical examination. Clinicians need to be familiar with unusual manifestations and other skin conditions that may simulate ADFK. Microscopic assessment is often required to provide histological diagnosis and variants. Management of ADFK is possible with a complete surgical excision performed by a dermatologist or a plastic surgeon. The postoperative period involves nurses for incision care and pharmacists for appropriate pain management that could significantly affect the patient's quality of life. If either the pharmacist or the nurse detects any failure in treatment or follow-up, they should report this to the treating clinician. Despite acquired digital fibrokeratoma being a benign lesion, the principles of interprofessional team dynamics are important, as they will always lead to better patient outcomes.
