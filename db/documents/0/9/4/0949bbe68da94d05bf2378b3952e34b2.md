The major complications secondary to replantation of avulsed teeth include infections, tooth discolorations, fistulas, inflammatory root resorption, ankylosis of the root to the alveolus, apical periodontitis, pulp canal obliteration (PCO), and pulp necrosis (ultimately leading to tooth loss).

Resorption and ankylosis are associated more with the use of rigid splints as opposed to semi-rigid ones. Ankylosis can be especially problematic in young patients going through the facial growing phase as the surrounding structures will continue to develop, and the tooth will look submerged.

Tooth avulsion is associated with a high risk of loss of vitality, especially if the apex has completely developed. This may eventuate in pulp necrosis and inflammatory resorption of the root. If this goes unrecognized, periapical periodontitis may develop and can complicate the healing process and prognosis. Pulp canal obliteration is apparent weeks to months after replantation and is heralded by radiographic density in the pulp chamber and canal. Although it is thought to be a concomitant of healthy revascularization of the injured neurovascular bundles, approximately 15-25% of teeth with pulp canal obliteration develop pulp necrosis.
