Historically, scarlet fever was a disease with a high complication rate and even death among children. With the development of antibiotics and treatment regimens, scarlet fever is now considered a relatively mild disease. However, complications from delayed or untreated GAS are significant. The complications fall into two categories, suppurative and non-suppurative. Typically, suppurative complications result from a worsening, an extension, or a spread of the original area of infection. As an example, bacterial pharyngitis can spread to the ear, causing otitis media; the sinuses, causing sinusitis; and then to the meninges, causing bacterial meningitis. Non-suppurative complications generally are mediated through an immune response after the original infection resolves. Rheumatic fever, a disease affecting the heart valves, is a complication of GAS infection that results in long-term morbidity.

Although not directly caused by scarlet fever, below is a partial list of complications due to GAS infection.

**Suppurative**

- Peritonsillar/pharyngeal abscess

- Otitis media

- Sinusitis

- Necrotizing fasciitis

- Streptococcal bacteremia

- Meningitis or brain abscess

- Jugular vein septic thrombophlebitis

**Non-Suppurative**

- Acute rheumatic fever

- Poststreptococcal reactive arthritis

- Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome

- Acute glomerulonephritis

- Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with group A streptococci
