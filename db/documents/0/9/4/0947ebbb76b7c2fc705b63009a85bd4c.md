Amniotic band syndrome (ABS) comprises various congenital anomalies, which include disruption, deformation, and malformations of organs that were intended to develop normally. Amniotic band syndrome should be called a sequence rather than a syndrome because the pattern of anomalies in ABS are related to an insult that can result from multiple etiologies, whereas a syndrome refers to patterns of congenital anomalies that are known to result from single etiology (e.g., Turner syndrome is due to XO chromosomal anomaly). Likewise, ABS has many names amnion rupture sequence, ADAM complex (amniotic deformities/adhesions/mutilations), amniotic band disruption complex, congenital constricting bands, terminal transverse defects, and Streeter anomaly. This activity reviews amniotic band syndrome in newborns and highlights the interprofessional team's role in taking care of infants with amniotic band syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of amniotic band syndrome.
- Describe the evaluation of amniotic band syndrome.
- Outline the treatment options available for amniotic band syndrome.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of infants with amniotic band syndrome and improve outcomes.
