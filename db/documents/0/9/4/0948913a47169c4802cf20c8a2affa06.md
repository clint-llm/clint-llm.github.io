Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), historically referred to as idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis, is a relatively common disorder. HOCM is a significant cause of sudden cardiac death in young people, including well-trained athletes, and affects men and women equally across all races. In most patients, it results from asymmetric septal hypertrophy causing outflow obstruction of the left ventricle. It is difficult to diagnose and presents a challenge to medical health professionals in evaluating at-risk athletes. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Discuss the recommended management of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. 
- Outline the typical presentation for a patient with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
- Review the pathophysiology of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. 
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
