The investigations for angle-closure glaucoma are as under:

**Gonioscopy:**Indentation gonioscopy is the standard technique used to visualize the angle dynamically to determine the extent of angle-closure due to peripheral anterior synechiae.

**Tonometry:**Measurement of intraocular pressure. The gold standard is Goldmann applanation.

**Pachymetry:**Central corneal thickness to adjust intraocular pressure according to corneal thickness.

**Slit-lamp examination:**Anterior segment examination.

**Indirect ophthalmoscopy:**Optic nerve head clinical examination.

**Perimetry:**Visual field analysis.

**Optical Coherence Tomography**

- Optic nerve head evaluation: Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and the structure of the optic nerve head.

- Macula evaluation: Macular structural parameters such as macular retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer with inner plexiform layer, and ganglion cell complex.

- Anterior segment: Examine the extent of peripheral anterior synechiae and iridocorneal angle.

**Ultrasound biomicroscopy:**This can assist in evaluating the position of the ciliary body, lens position, and presence of an iridociliary cyst or mass.

A darkroom-prone provocation test has been described but is not useful in discriminating primary angle-closure suspects from those with open angles.
