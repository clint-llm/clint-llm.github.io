With the potentially vague presentation of necrotizing enterocolitis, the differential diagnosis is broad. The symptoms of necrotizing enterocolitis in this population, including nausea and vomiting, may be the result of congenital abnormalities, such as pyloric stenosis, duodenal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula, gastroschisis, or malrotation with or without midgut volvulus. Infectious causes include gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, sepsis, meningitis, and pneumonia. Other possibilities include intussusception or testicular torsion. Clinicians also must always consider child abuse, including intracranial injury.
