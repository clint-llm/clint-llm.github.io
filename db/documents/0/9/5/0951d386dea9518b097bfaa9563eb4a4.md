The importance of medication compliance, laboratory tests, and imaging workup, regular follow-up at the appointments, especially primary care provider, cardiothoracic surgery, andÂ cardiology follow-up, should be stressed. Time should be taken to clearly explain to the patient the risk versus benefits of the treatment. The patient should honestly be told the current evidence regarding the benefits of this treatment and why this treatment is considered an option for him or her. The patient should be given an idea about the prognosis, and discussion about the code status and advance directives should occur.
