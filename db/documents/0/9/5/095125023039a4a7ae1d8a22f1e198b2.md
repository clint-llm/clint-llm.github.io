Approximately every 5 in 100 patients with TED progress to sight-threatening optic neuropathy.****Younger patients are less likely to develop DON as compared to older age groups. It is found that for every 10-year increment in the onset of ophthalmopathy, the risk of developing optic neuropathy increases by approximately 60%.****

Although the White-race population demonstrates female preponderance in TED, DON is more common in males. Hence, an old male is far more likely to develop DON than a young female.
