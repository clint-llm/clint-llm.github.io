There is limited clinical experience with drugs acting on CGRP or its receptor. However, treatment should include general supportive measures, including monitoring of the vital signs and observation of the general clinical status. There is no specific antidote for the toxicity of erenumab, eptinezumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab, rimegepant or, ubrogepant.

For rimegepant, dialysis is unlikely to remove rimegepant significantly due to its high serum protein binding.

Since the half-life of ubrogepantÂ elimination is about 5 to 7 hours, patient monitoring after ubrogepant overdose should continue while symptoms or signs persist, or for a minimum of 24 hours.
