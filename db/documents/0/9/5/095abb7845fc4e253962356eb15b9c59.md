Hoarseness is a frequent complaint following long surgeries or prolonged admissions to the ICU. Often, the patientâ€™s hoarseness is related to trauma caused by the intubation. Risk factors for intubation-related laryngeal injury are prolonged intubation (greater than 36 hours), intubation without myorelaxant drugs, large endotracheal tubes, aspiration, and coexisting presence of a nasogastric tube.

Because of its long course through the neck and mediastinum, the recurrent laryngeal nerve is subject to injury in cervical surgery (thyroid surgery, neck dissections, anterior cervical approach to the spine, etc.) and thoracic surgery (lung biopsy, aortic aneurysm repair, etc.). Surgical injury is the leading cause of unilateral vocal cord paralysis, followed by idiopathic and malignant causes.
