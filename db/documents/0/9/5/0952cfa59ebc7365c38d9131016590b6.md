**Cerebral Stroke**

The primary purpose of mechanical thrombectomy in ischemic cerebral stroke is rescuing the ischemic penumbra. The indications for mechanical thrombectomy have recently significantly increased, with recent literature proving its efficacy and superiority over intravenous (IV) thrombolytics. Some noteworthy trials are the DAWN, DEFUSE-3, CTP, and CRISP studies.

- Pre-stroke modified Rankin scale <2

- NIH stroke scale score ≥ 6; Alberta stroke program early CT score ≥ 6

- Start of the procedure within 6 hours of symptom onset

- Causative occlusion of the internal carotid artery or the proximal middle cerebral artery (M1)

- Age 18 years or older

The DAWN and DEFUSE-3 trials demonstrated that mechanical thrombectomy improved clinical outcomes versus standard care alone in select patients with large vessel ischemic stroke presenting up to 24 hours after the start of symptoms. The current indications have extended the time of thrombectomy to 24 hours after the symptom onset.

**Myocardial Infarction**

Unlike in the case of cerebral stroke, recommendations for mechanical thrombectomy, specifically aspiration thrombectomy in cases of acute MI, remain doubtful. The TAPAS study (Thrombus Aspiration During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Acute Myocardial Infarction Study) suggested that routine thrombus aspiration improves microvascular reperfusion with improved outcomes at 30 days (the one-year follow up reported improved clinical outcomes) compared to traditional percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for a wide range of patients.

The TOTAL trial compared PCI alone vs. PCI with thrombectomy in ST-elevation myocardial infarction 12 hours after MI onset and revealed an increased risk of stroke with routine thrombectomy in acute MI within 30 days of follow up.

**Pulmonary Embolism**

The use of mechanical thrombectomy in PE remains under investigation; pivotal clinical trials have provided evidence to the safety and efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy in some patients. The FLARE (FlowTriever Pulmonary Embolectomy Clinical Study) study concluded that a mechanical thrombectomy mechanism appears safe and effective in persons with acute intermediate-risk PE.
