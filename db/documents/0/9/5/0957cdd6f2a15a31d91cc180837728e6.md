Rotor syndrome is largely a diagnosis of exclusion. Serological abnormalities in Rotor syndrome only include elevated total serum bilirubin (typically elevated between 2 to 5 mg/dL but may be as high as 20 mg/dL). Most of the time, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal, but mild elevations can be seen. If any of these lab values are markedly elevated, investigation for other, more serious conditions is warranted. Imaging studies cannot diagnose Rotor syndrome but can help rule out other diseases that cause hyperbilirubinemia. For example, an ultrasound of the liver and biliary tree can help investigate the causes of extra-hepatic biliary obstruction. The gallbladder is visualized on oral cholecystography in Rotor syndrome, while it is not visualized in DJS.

- Total coproporphyrin excretion is greatly elevated in both Rotor syndrome and DJS:

- The ratio of coproporphyrin 1 to 3 in urine allows the differentiation of these two conditions.
- Around 90% is coproporphyrin 1 in Dubin-Johnson syndrome but a much lower proportion in Rotor syndrome.

- The plasma disappearance of injected bromosulfophthalein is delayed, with no secondary rise (which is seen in Dubin-Johnson syndrome).

- The hepatic biopsy will show pigment deposition in Dubin-Johnson syndrome but not Rotor syndrome.
