Stroke is the third leading cause of death and morbidity in the United States. Systemic atherosclerosis and atherosclerosis of extracranial and intracranial arteries have been identified as the major cause of ischemic stroke. Doppler imaging of the extracranial is routinely performed to assess the atherosclerotic burden of these arteries. This activity reviews the assessment, protocol, and interpretation of Doppler imaging of extracranial arteries.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the technique of Doppler US of extracranial carotid arteries.
- Summarize the interpretation of Doppler waveforms of extracranial carotid arteries.
- Summarize the protocol of Doppler US of extracranial carotid arteries.
- Summarize the clinical significance of Doppler US of extracranial carotid arteries.
