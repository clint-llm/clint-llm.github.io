According to the ROME IV criteria for rumination syndrome, a diagnosis is possible on clinical grounds without invasive testing. In contrast, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) criteria require that repeated regurgitation should not be due to a medical condition which most often requires some form of testing for exclusion. Moreover, as many patients commonly wait years to be accurately diagnosed, some patients are disappointed about a diagnosis of a functional gastrointestinal disorder, and objective tests are helpful for patients to comprehend the diagnosis of rumination syndrome better.

- Assessment of potential underlying eating disorders (bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa)

- Endoscopy and/or CT enterography to exclude mechanical obstruction

- High-resolution esophageal manometry (HRIM) with impedance testing

- This study can confirm rumination syndrome in both children and adults
- Postprandial intragastric pressure is usually above 25 to 30 mmHg in patients with rumination syndrome.

- Electromyography (EMG) of the abdominothoracic muscles

- This study will show a characteristic spiking of activity during episodes of rumination.
- Historically, this study was often employed in the diagnosis of this condition.

- Gastric emptying studies and pH studies are not necessary for diagnosis but recommended if clinical symptoms are atypical and other underlying conditions such as refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or gastroparesis have to be excluded.

**Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) Criteria for Rumination Syndrome**

- Repeated regurgitation of food for a period of at least one month is a sign. Regurgitated food may be re-chewed, re-swallowed, or spat out.

- The repeated regurgitation is not due to an underlying general medical condition (e.g., GERD, pyloric stenosis, etc.).

- The behavior does not occur exclusively in the course of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder (BED), or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.

- If occurring in the presence of another mental disorder (e.g., intellectual developmental disorder) or general medical condition (including pregnancy), it is severe enough to warrant additional clinical attention

**ROME IV Criteria for Rumination Syndrome in Adults**

Must include **all**of the following:

- Persistent or recurrent regurgitation of recently ingested food into the mouth with subsequent spitting or remastication and swallowing

- Regurgitation is not preceded by retching

Criteria fulfilled for the last three months with symptom onset at least six months before diagnosis.

Supportive aspects:

- Effortless regurgitation events are usually not preceded by nausea

- Regurgitant contains recognizable food that might have a pleasant taste

- The process tends to cease when the regurgitated material becomes acidic

**ROME IV Criteria in Pediatrics**

**Neonate/Toddler**

Must include all of the following for at least two months:

- Repetitive contractions of the abdominal muscles, diaphragm, and tongue

- Effortless regurgitation of gastric contents, which are either expelled from the mouth or re-chewed and re-swallowed

Three or more of the following:

-  Onset between 3 and 8 months

-  Does not respond to management for gastroesophageal reflux disease and regurgitation

-  Unaccompanied by signs of distress

-  It does not occur during sleep and when the infant is interacting with individuals in the environment.

**Children/Adolescent**

Must include all of the following for at least two months:

- Repeated regurgitation and re-chewing or expulsion of food that begins soon after ingestion of a meal

- It does not occur during sleep

- Not preceded by retching

After appropriate evaluation, if the symptoms cannot be fully explained by another medical condition, an eating disorder must be ruled out.

**High-resolution Impedance-pH Manometry**

The diagnosis of rumination syndrome can be confirmed using this study if there is evidence of reflux extending to the proximal esophagus that is closely associated with an intragastric pressure of greater than 30 mmHg in adults or 25 mmHg in children.
