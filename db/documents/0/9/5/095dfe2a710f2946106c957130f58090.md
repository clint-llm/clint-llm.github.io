Overdose of insulin glargine leads to hypoglycemia, which can be severe and persistent due to the long-acting nature of this insulin. In the case of mild hypoglycemia, carbohydrate intake is typically sufficient to restore euglycemia. The patient should ingest 15 grams of carbohydrates, wait 15 minutes, and recheck their blood glucose level. If it remains hypoglycemic, the procedure is repeated. In the case of severe hypoglycemia or if there is a reason that oral intake is not possible, then injectable glucagon is an option. Another option typically reserved for severe hypoglycemia in the hospital or EMS setting is intravenous dextrose. From published reports, dextrose infusion alone was sufficient to correct hypoglycemia. The long-acting nature of the insulin must also merit consideration; dextrose infusions may need to be repeatedÂ beyond the predicted 24-hour lifetime of the medication.
