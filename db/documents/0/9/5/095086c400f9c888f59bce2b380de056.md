In typical individuals, Malin (an E3 Ubiquitin ligase) binds Laforin (a dual specificity protein phosphatase) and interacts in a cellular pathway that protects against intracytoplasmic polyglucosan accumulation. Mutations in the genes (EPM2A and EPM2B [NHLRC1]) that encode those proteins could lead to Lafora disease.

Defects in the cellular clearance systems and autophagic processes are thought to lead to the accumulation of the glycogen derived particles within the cytoplasms, known as Lafora bodies (LB). This glycogen accumulation accounts for neurodegeneration in Lafora disease.
