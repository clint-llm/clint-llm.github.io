The etiology of syringomyelia includes conditions that alter the physiologicÂ CSF circulation dynamics. In most cases, it is secondary to spinal subarachnoid space obstruction. Etiology includes

**Idiopathic Syringomyelia**

Syrinx in the absence of an identifiable cause

**Secondary Syringomyelia**

**Syringomyelia with obstruction at the foramen magnum (developmental)**

- Chiari 1 Malformation (CM1): Most common association

- Basilar invagination

**Syringomyelia with other diseases of the spinal cord (acquired)**

- Post-inflammatory

- Post-infectious: Granulomatous (tuberculosis, fungal), post-operative meningitis
- Chemical/ Sterile inflammation: Post-subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), post-myelography (metrizamide)

- Post-traumatic

- Spinal Cord Tumors: Intra-medullary spinal tumors esp. Hemangioblastoma

- Secondary myelomalacia: Cord compression (herniated disc, spondylosis, tumors), infarction, hematomyelia
