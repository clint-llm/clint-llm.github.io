MGD closely mimics clinical conditions like evaporative dry eyes or anterior seborrheic blepharitis. Patients can present either with typical symptoms of dry eyes or can present for some other ophthalmic condition like decreased vision secondary to cataracts or can present to an optometrist for refractive error evaluation or contact lenses or change of glasses.

It is essential to understand the primary pathology and guide patients regarding the management of MGD based on the presentation stage. The optometrists and general ophthalmologists should manage asymptomatic cases or those presenting in the early stages. Patients with advanced stages should be referred to a cornea or ocular surface specialist for detailed evaluation and management.
