Complications of rhombic flap reconstruction should be fully explained during the consent process and may be divided into general and specific complications.

General complications include pain, bleeding, infection, wound breakdown, scarring (including abnormal).

Specific complications of partial or complete flap failure are uncommon and may be caused by surgical factors such as over thinning and undermining of the flap. These may be influenced by patient factors such as smoking.
