Periodontal disease undergoes four different stages that were first explained by Page and Schroeder in 1976

**Initial Lesion**

This stage is characterized by an acute exudative inflammatory response, a raised gingival fluid flow, and the migration of neutrophils from the blood vessel of the subgingival plexus located in the gingival connective tissue to the gingival sulcus. An alteration of the matrix of the connective tissue located next to vessels results in the accumulation of fibrin in the area. The initial lesion is seen within four days of the initiation of plaque accumulation. There is a destruction of collagen caused by collagenase and other enzymes secreted by the neutrophils. About 5% to 10% of the connective tissue is occupied by the inflammatory infiltrate in this stage

**Early Lesion**

The early lesion is consistent with delayed hypersensitivity. It usually appears after one week from the beginning of plaque deposition. In this stage, the clinical signs of gingivitis, such as redness and bleeding from the gingiva start appearing. The inflammatory cells that predominate in this lesion are lymphocytes accounting for 75% of the total, and macrophages. A small number of plasma cells are also seen. Along with the inflammatory infiltration that occupies 5% to 15% of the connective tissue of the gingival margin, there is loss of collagen in the affected area that reaches 60% to 70%. Furthermore, the local fibroblasts undergo a series of pathological changes, and the gingival fluid flow and the number of leukocytes migrating to the region continue to increase. Neutrophils and mononuclear cells are also increased in the junctional epithelium. The duration of the early lesion has not yet been determined, it can remain for more time than previously expected

**Established Lesion**

There is increased collagenolytic activity in this stage along with a rise in the number of macrophages, plasma cells, T and B lymphocytes. However, the predominant cells are plasma cells and B lymphocytes. In this stage, a small gingival pocket lined with a pocket epithelium is created. The lesion exhibits a high degree of organization. It has been suggested that the severity of gingivitis correlates with a growth in the B cells and plasma cells population, and a decrease in the number of T cells.

An established lesion may follow two paths, it can either remain stable for months or years; or progress to a more destructive lesion, which appears to be related to a change in the microbial flora or infection of the gingiva. This stage has shown to be reversible after an effective periodontal therapy that results in an increase in the number of microorganisms associated with periodontal health that directly correlates with a reduction in the plasma cells and lymphocytes

**Advanced Lesion**

This stage is a transition to periodontitis. It is characterized by attachment loss that is irreversible. The inflammatory changes and the bacterial infection starts affecting the supporting tissues of the teeth and the surrounding structures such as gingival, periodontal ligament, and alveolar bone resulting in their destruction and may eventually result in tooth loss
