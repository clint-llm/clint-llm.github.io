The pituitary gland is located in the base of the brain and is involved in hormonal regulation. Pituitary gland tumors may cause symptoms from mass effect on adjacent structures, typically the optic pathway involved in vision, or via glandular involvement with increased or decreased gland secretion. The signs/symptoms that are evaluated include vision changes if due to mass effect, hormonally may present with irregular menstrual cycles, milky discharge from breasts in females, and can cause erection problems or low sex drive in men. If there is an excess of steroid hormones, patients will typically have symptoms that will include weight gain, weak bones, and high blood pressure.

Several other related conditions or symptoms caused by different types of hormones may present with excess growth of the hands or head. Patients may additionally present with non-specific symptoms, such as headaches. Pituitary cancer comprises a very small proportion of pituitary tumors and may rarely arise as a metastatic lesion from elsewhere in the body or, more commonly, from the pituitary gland itself, referred to as pituitary carcinoma. Pituitary carcinoma may present with neck and/or back pain if there are metastatic lesions involving the spine.

There are varying modalities of diagnosis that typically involve a combination of laboratory testing and radiographic imaging. This will be determined by the physician on a case-by-case basis. Treatment typically includes surgical intervention followed by possibly adjuvant radiosurgery and/or chemotherapy/immunotherapies.
