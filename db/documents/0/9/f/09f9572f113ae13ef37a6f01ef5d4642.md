T-cell dysfunction is notable in several types of immunodeficiencies and autoimmune diseases, both acquired and genetic. Notably, T cells are the main targets of the human immunodeficiency virus and human T-lymphotropic virus. T cells are also implicated in several types of neoplasms, such as T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) and adult T-cell lymphoma (ATL). T cells are often implicated in transplant rejection, and their surface receptors are pharmacologic targets for anti-rejection drugs. Additionally, there are several different T-cell disorders, including, thymic aplasia (DiGeorge syndrome), IL-12 receptor deficiency, autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (Job syndrome), and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.
