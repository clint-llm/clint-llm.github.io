Researchers have studied abciximab in three-phase III clinical trials: EPIC, EPILOG, and CAPTURE. Abciximab is no longer manufactured.

Abciximab is currently a prescription-only medication onlyÂ indicated for intravenous (IV) use. Further studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are necessary to provide more interventions for this drug. Studies have shown abciximab to be effective in the prevention of ischemic cardiac complications in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and prevention of ischemic cardiac complications in patients with unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTMI) unresponsive to conventional therapy when scheduling PCI within 24 hours. Abciximab has only had research performed in conjunction with aspirin and heparin.

**FDA-labeled Indications**

- PCI: Adjunct, refractory unstable angina

**Non-FDA-labeled Uses**

- Acute myocardial infarction: cardiogenic shock

- Aneurysm of coronary vessels: such as with Kawasaki disease

- Acute arterial thrombosis

- Myocardial infarction
