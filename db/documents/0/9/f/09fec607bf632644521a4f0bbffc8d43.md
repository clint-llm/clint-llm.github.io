Diagnosis and treatment of urinary retention require an interprofessional team effort. Primary care physicians, emergency department physicians, and hospitalists should be able to recognize the earlyÂ signs and symptoms of urinary retention. Nurses should monitor the urine output in hospitalized patients and report to physicians if they notice a decrease or complete absence of urine output or voiding. Protocols for post-partum voiding have demonstrated usefulness in minimizing urinary complications such as acute retention but require close cooperation between OB-GYN, urology, family practice, and nursing. Urology should be involved in unusual, difficult, or refractory cases.

Nursing must monitor these patients post-procedure and report back to the surgeon or attending if there are any significant status changes. Pharmacists also have a role in recognizing the medications which can cause urinary retention and coordinating efforts with the prescribing clinician.
