The cerebellum and, by extension, theÂ dentate nucleus arises from the metencephalon, which derives from the rhombencephalon (hindbrain).

Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) is important in cerebellum development, as atopic injections of FGF8 can develop a secondary cerebellum in other brain regions. FGF8 appears to define the boundaries into which the cerebellum will develop. The subsequent removal of FGF8 establishes the onset of cerebellar development.
