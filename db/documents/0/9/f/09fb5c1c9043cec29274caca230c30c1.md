Before initiating estrogen therapy, clinicians should perform screening to assess the patient's risk of breast cancer, endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disease, including stroke, venous thrombosis, and myocardial infarction. Patients should also be screened for hypertension before starting estrogen therapy, and patients should continue to be monitored for the development of hypertension while taking estrogen. Routine women's wellness exams, including mammography and pap smear, should be continued during hormone replacement therapy with estrogen. Smoking cessation should be encouraged before the start and duration of OCPs since tobacco use increases the risk of venous thrombosis.

The Endocrine Society recommends monitoring patients' improvement of postmenopausal symptoms while taking estrogen as hormone replacement therapy at the following intervals: first 1 to 3 months of therapy, then re-evaluated at 6 to 12 months of therapy annually after the first year.
