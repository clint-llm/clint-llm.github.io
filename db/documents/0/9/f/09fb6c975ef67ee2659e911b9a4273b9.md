Braxton Hicks contractions are thought to play a role in toning the uterine muscle in preparation for the birth process. Sometimes Braxton Hicks contractions are referred to as "practice for labor." Braxton Hicks contractions do not result in dilation of the cervix but may have a role in cervicalÂ softening.

The intermittent contraction of the uterine muscle may also play a role in promoting blood flow to the placenta. Oxygen-rich blood fills the intervillous spaces of the uterus where the pressure is relatively low. The presence of Braxton Hicks contractions causes the blood to flow up to the chorionic plate on the fetal side of the placenta. From there the oxygen-rich blood enters the fetal circulation.
