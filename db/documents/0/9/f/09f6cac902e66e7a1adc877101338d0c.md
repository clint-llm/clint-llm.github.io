Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a plant indigenous to Southeast Asia, typically consumed by tea or powder, with physiologic effects similar to opioids, as well as stimulants. There is an increasing prevalence of kratom use, raising concern for possible dependence, addiction, and toxicity. Given the increasing popularity and the potential harm this substance could cause, it is essential to understand how it works, its physiologic side effects, and any possible treatment options for symptoms related to a toxic overdose. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management/prevention of kratom toxicity and also reviews the role of the interprofessional team with management.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pathophysiology/toxicokinetics of kratom toxicity.
- Outline the signs, symptoms, and examination findings for patients with kratom toxicity.
- Describe management strategies for kratom toxicity.
- Review the interprofessional team approach to identifying and improving care for managing patients suffering from kratom toxicity.
