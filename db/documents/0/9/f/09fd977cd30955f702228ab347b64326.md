Several immunohistochemical stains can be used to identify cellular features that are characteristic of parathyroid glandular tissue. Normal parathyroid glands stain positive for parathyroid hormone, neuroendocrine markers chromogranin-A and synaptophysin, and keratins 7, 8, 18, and 19. No one of these markers is entirely specific to the parathyroid gland so multiple need to be present to identify parathyroid tissue. Chromogranin-A is a specific neuroendocrine marker that typically stains chief cells more intensely than oxyphil and other cells. There have been suggestions that chief cells may stain less intensely with chromogranin-A or PTH in hyperfunctioning or adenomatous parathyroid glands.
