The superior laryngeal nerve supplies sensory fibers to theÂ mucosa of the supraglottis and the upper surface of the glottis. It also sends the motor nerve for the cricothyroid muscle, while the recurrent laryngeal nerve carries the sensory fibers from the mucosa of the subglottis and the lower surface of the vocal folds. The superior laryngeal nerve is also the motor nerve for all the intrinsic laryngeal muscles except the cricothyroid muscle.
