While surgical resection remains the standard of care, several techniques are available for treating liver metastasis in medically or surgically inoperable patients. Most of the data on outcomes in this setting is related to colorectal malignancies, but data from neuroendocrine and primary liver disease has also provided valuable insight. Less invasive techniques such as stereotactic body radiotherapy have been utilized, and embolization techniques with either chemotherapy or radioactive isotopes with reasonable outcomes and acceptable toxicity levels.
