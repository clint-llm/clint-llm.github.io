CCl4 toxicity develops not due to the CCl4 itself but for the generation of free radical CCl3 and other metabolites produced by cytochrome P450. Ultimately they lead to cellular damage by alteration of cellular structure through lipid peroxidation and in some other pathways. Severe conditions may develop through multiple organ dysfunction by these free radicles.
