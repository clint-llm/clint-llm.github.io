For many of these syndromes, the clinical symptoms will often prompt the use of additional diagnostic modalities that are instrumental in establishing a correct diagnosis (see Table 4). Such modalities include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT) scans to assess neurological involvement in theÂ cerebral or spinal nervous tissues. Additionally, laboratory testing of serum samples may be useful in ruling out some diseases while providing confirmatory data for others, as in the case of the diseases of lipoproteins (ABL and HHBL) or aceruloplasminemia. For most neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, there are either no clear diagnostic criteria (e.g., ChAc, ABL, and HHBL) or genetic testing to identify diseases that may otherwise be indistinguishable from other syndromes (e.g., HDL2).
