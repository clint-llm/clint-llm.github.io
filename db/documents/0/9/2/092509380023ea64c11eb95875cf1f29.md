Through the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, the carbon dioxide and water released as byproducts from cellular respiration are converted to carbonic acid (H2CO3). In pursuing biochemical equilibrium, carbonic acid partially and reversibly dissociates into hydrogen ions and its conjugate base, bicarbonate (HCO3). This release of hydrogen ions increases the available concentration of H+ ions within the blood, effectively decreasing the pH of the environment. Due to the reversibility of this reaction, the resulting bicarbonate conjugate base form of carbonic acid indirectly represents the majority of the blood carbon dioxide (CO2) content (70%).

This process usually takes place in peripheral tissues, as the desired effect is to unload oxygen into these tissues and load oxygen in the lungs. To limit the decrease in pH of the environment surrounding peripheral tissues, hemoglobin serves as a buffering agent by releasing its oxygen molecules in favor of binding H+ ions. Additionally, the increased bicarbonate molecules move down their concentration gradient, diffusing out of the red blood cell, exchanging chlorine ions into the red blood cell to maintain electrical neutrality. This buffering process is known as the Haldane effect. In the setting of lung alveoli, the less acidic and highly oxygenated environment favors the dissociation of the scavenged H+ protons from hemoglobin in exchange for oxygen binding. The effect of this relatively increased pH environment and its effect on hemoglobin oxygen affinity is graphically represented as a left shift in the oxy-hemoglobin dissociation curve as the P50 effectively decreases, resulting in greater attachment of oxygen to hemoglobin.
