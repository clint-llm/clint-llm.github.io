The subclavian arteries lie just below the clavicles, providing blood supply to the bilateral upper extremities with contributions to the head and neck. The right subclavian artery derives from the brachiocephalic trunk, while the left subclavian artery originates directly from the aortic arch. The subclavian arteries course laterally between the anterior and middle scalene muscles. The distal limit of the subclavian artery is the lateral border of the first rib, where it becomes the axillary artery.

Multiple aspects of the nervous system travel alongside or near the subclavian arteries. They include the sympathetic trunk, the vagus nerve, parts of the brachial plexus, the phrenic nerve and the right recurrent laryngeal nerve.

Clinically the subclavian arteries can be host to numerous congenital and idiopathic pathologies which can be managed with physical rehabilitation and/or surgical interventions. The most common congenital anomaly is an aberrant subclavian artery which is usually a benign condition but can be symptomatic in twenty percent of cases.
