FISH provides a swift means to diagnose common fetal aneuploidies; its diagnostic scope has reduced sensitivity compared with conventional cytogenetic analysis; this technique will not identify cases with cytogenetic abnormalities other than the most frequent ones (e.g., translocations, inversions, markers).de Novo mutations.

Chromosomal microarrays are considered a first-tier test for individuals with developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorders, or multiple congenital disabilities and are recommended in lieu of a karyotype.

Detection of abnormalities by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis is dependent on the probes employed, which are typically designed to identify specific small gene deletions (e.g., MEN1 partial or complete deletion).

NGS generates millions of sequences that are processed, analyzed, and interpreted to identify the variants.
