K. kingae expresses different structures for successful colonization, carriage, transmission, virulence, and pathogenesis. K. kingae is acquired via direct contact from person to person. Though the mechanism of communication is not well known, there is a high possibility of its spread via droplets. K. kingae produces type IV pili (T4P) under the regulation of rho 54, pilS, and pilR genes.K. kingae infection establishes itself via a previous virus-induced mucosal damage in addition to the RTA toxin produced by the organism. RTA toxin also has cytotoxic effects on leukocytes, macrophages, and synovial cells. The polysaccharides capsules on the outer-membrane confer protection against phagocytosis of the bacterial cells. The tendency for K. kingae to produce biofilms assist the pathogen in evading host immunity and defenses. Also, the exopolysaccharides of K. kingae has inhibitory effects on biofilm production from other microorganisms and also facilitates the periodic release of the bacteria cells from biofilms, thereby promoting easier dissemination.
