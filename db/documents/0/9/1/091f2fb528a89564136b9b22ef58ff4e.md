The 2015 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pericardial diseases divided the etiology of acute pericarditis into two main groups, infectious causes, and non-infectious causes.

Viruses are considered the most common infective agents, and include coxsackieviruses A and B, echovirus, adenoviruses, parvovirus B19, HIV, influenza as well as multiple herpes viruses such as EBV and CMV.

Non-infectious causes are numerous and include malignancy (often secondary to metastatic disease), connective tissue disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Behçet’s disease), and metabolic etiologies (such as Uremia, and myxedema).

Trauma may also cause pericarditis with early onset following injury, or as more frequently encountered in clinical practice, result in a delayed inflammatory reaction.

Multiple medications have been implicated in drug-induced pericarditis, with a long list of possible culprits, but the incidence remains rare. Certain medications, such as procainamide, hydralazine, and isoniazid were historically cited to cause medication-induced systemic lupus erythematosis, with associated serositis and pericardial involvement manifesting as pericarditis.

Miscellaneous disease processes such as amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis should also be considered, especially when pericarditis occurs in association with suggestive systemic findings.
