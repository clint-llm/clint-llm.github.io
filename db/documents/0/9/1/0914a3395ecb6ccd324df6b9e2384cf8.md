Counseling patients and families to restrict access to lethal means (locking medications, removing or locking firearms, etc.) during episodes of SI is encouraged in the literature. However, chart reviews show this is frequently not done. A training intervention for healthcare professionals in ED improved the frequency they initiated counseling against lethal means (CALM).

School-based educational programs may reduce SI, but a recent systematic review determined the quality of evidence is low.

Helping the ideator to formulate a safety plan that includes appropriate supports, resources, distractions, and safeguards to prevent assess to lethal means are best practice interventions.
