Neurologic monitoring has been used to assess for depth of anesthesia in the operating room setting. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is infrequently used during cerebrovascular surgery to monitor anesthesia and cerebral oxygenation. Most commonly used is a bispectral index (BIS) to indicate wakefulness in a patient.
