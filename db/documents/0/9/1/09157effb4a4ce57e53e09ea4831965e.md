Minimal complications are the norm from one-time mild, acute occupational, or environmental exposures. Significant acute exposures can cause respiratory and CNS depression and death. Long-term occupational exposure in workers exposed before the 1975 OSHA standard has been linked to AOL and HAS. Cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, brain cancer, and lung cancer also have correlations with VCM exposure in these workers, but causation remains controversial.
