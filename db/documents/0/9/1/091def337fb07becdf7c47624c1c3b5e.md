The classic presentation is a sudden, painless loss of vision in the range of light perception to finger counting. Visual acuity may be in the range of 20/200 but is often worse.

If a patient has no light perception, this may indicate an ophthalmic artery occlusion, and therefore, no blood is flowing to choroidal vessels.

If central visual acuity is spared and fundoscopy is consistent with central retinal artery occlusion, then the patient probably has a cilioretinal artery blood supply. The fundoscopy may show a pale yellow ischemic retina. A cherry-red spot may be present where the macula is, but this is not a consistent or reliable finding. The presence of a cherry red spot is an indicator of poor prognosis.
