Conjunctivitis is a common cause of eye redness and, subsequently, a common complaint in the emergency department, urgent care, and primary care clinics. It can affect people of any age, demographic, or socioeconomic status. More than 80% of all acute cases are generally diagnosed by non-ophthalmologists, such as internists, primary care providers, pediatricians, and nurse practitioners.

The conjunctiva is the transparent, lubricating mucous membrane covering the outer surface of the eye.

Conjunctivitis refers to the inflammation of the conjunctival tissue, engorgement of the blood vessels, pain, and ocular discharge. It can be acute or chronic and infectious or non-infectious. Acute conjunctivitis refers to symptom duration of 3 to 4 weeks from presentation (usually only lasting 1 to 2 weeks), whereas chronic is defined as lasting more than four weeks.

Apart from being caused by various infective agents, conjunctivitis may also be associated with some systemic illnesses, including immune-related disorders, such as Reiter syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, nutritional deprivation (especially vitamin A deficiency), and congenital metabolic syndromes (porphyria and Richner-Hanhart syndrome).
