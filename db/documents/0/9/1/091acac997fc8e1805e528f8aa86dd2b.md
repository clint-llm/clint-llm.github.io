A complete blood count (CBC) usually shows leukocytosis, often with a left-shift, and chemistry may reveal evidence of dehydration if the patientâ€™s fluid intake is poor due to pain. A blood culture should be obtained if the patient is septic, and cultures should be obtained of any purulent discharge in the affected region.

Plain radiography of the neck in children may suggest retropharyngeal abscess when the prevertebral soft tissue shadow is greater than 7 mm at the C2 level or greater than 14 mm at C6 level. Among adults, the soft tissue shadow is greater than 22 mm at C6 level.

Ultrasound is useful for relatively superficial infections to differentiate between phlegmon and abscesses but may not be adequate for deep infections. If the ultrasound results are questionable, a CT scan should be obtained so long as it is safe to do so.

The gold standard imaging modality to diagnose the source and extent of the deep neck infection is computed tomography (CT) with contrast, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also possible though logistically more challenging. There is little utility in obtaining a non-contrast CT scan as phlegmon versus abscess are not easily distinguishable.
