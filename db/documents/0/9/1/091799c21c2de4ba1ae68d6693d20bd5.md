The revised memorandum in 1979 correlated the brain stem death with death itself. This activity outlines current recommendations set for diagnosing brain stem death and highlights mandatory prerequisites to be rigorously adopted prior to initiating the process of evaluating brain stem integrity. This activity reviews the potential pitfalls and shortcomings during the steps in assessing brain stem reflexes, the apnea test, and the ancillary tests to avoid complications.

**Objectives:**
- Outline current recommendations and guidelines set by the American Academy of Neurology pertaining to the diagnosis of brain stem death. 
- Identify specific prerequisites that are mandatory before initiation of evaluation for brain stem death. 
- Summarize confounding factors and the pitfalls that can erroneously jeopardize the protocol in diagnosing brain stem death. 
- Explain the role of an interprofessional team in performing brain stem death evaluation.
