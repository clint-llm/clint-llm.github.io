Snapping hip is most commonly an overuse phenomenon, but may be precipitated by trauma, including intramuscular injection into the gluteus maximus and surgical procedures. For example, the smaller median femoral neck angle (i.e., coxa vera) following total hip arthroplasty specifically has been linked to the development of external snapping hip syndrome. Other anatomical variations may predispose to coxa saltans including an increased distance between the greater trochanters, prominent greater trochanters, and narrow bi-iliac width. Additionally, iliotibial band tightness, shorter muscle or tendon lengths, muscle tightness, or inadequate relaxation of the muscles may contribute to snapping hip development. Sometimes no etiology is uncovered at all, resulting in an idiopathic classification.
