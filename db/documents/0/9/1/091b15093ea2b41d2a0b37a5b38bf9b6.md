In patients who are asymptomatic or mild cases of CD, regular follow-up with the clinician is recommended for any typical ophthalmologic changes, as well as the possibility for any disease progression.

Treatment for symptomatic dystrophies can be organized by anatomic location, as symptoms tend to become similar among dystrophies of the same classification. Elaboration on management for each type of dystrophy will be discussed in other StatPearls articles.

**Epithelial dystrophies**: The most common symptoms seen are corneal erosions, especially in the morning, due to the increase of epithelial sloughing from nocturnal corneal drying.

**Stromal dystrophies**: CD involving the stroma may most likely lead to visual acuity loss.

**Endothelial Dystrophies**: With the advent of Descemet’s stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK) and Descemet’s membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK), the need for penetrating keratoplasty has diminished due to faster recovery, better post-surgical visual acuity, and decreased graft rejection, because there is no impact on the anterior face of the ocular surface with these procedures.

Other techniques that are used presently or may be implemented in the future consist of using gene or enzyme therapy, mesenchymal stem cells to replace dystrophic cells, and lipid-based therapies.
