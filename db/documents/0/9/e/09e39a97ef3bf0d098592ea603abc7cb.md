The TCP unit is a portable compact device that consists of a semiconductor solid-state diode laser system that emits laser energy at 810 nm. This device is connected to a handpiece in the shape of a curved footplate, matching the spherical curvature of the sclera and enabling laser energy delivery.

The laser energy is transmitted through a 600 um diameter quartz fiber oriented within the handpiece 1.2mm posterior to the limbus. A tip protrudes 0.7mm beyond the probe to provide indentation on the ocular surface, thereby improving laser energy effectiveness. The continuous-wave laser energy is administered with the handpiece aligned to the visual axis on the conjunctiva surface for the duration of the desired burn.

The MP-TCP is also a portable device connected to a handpiece that, on contact with the conjunctiva, similarly delivers laser energy to TCP.  Unlike the continuous-wave TCP, the MP-TCP device is set on micropulse delivery and with specific on-off times.

The ECP probe is inserted intraocularly on an 18-20G handpiece and consists of an 810 nm diode laser, 175 W xenon light source, a helium-neon laser aiming beam, and a video imaging camera. The endoscope provides a 110 to 160-degree field of view. This probe can be used in a pulsed or continuous-wave mode. ECP requires the addition of an operating microscope and intraocular instrument set up.
