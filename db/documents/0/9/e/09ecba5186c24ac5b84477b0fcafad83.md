The superior cervical ganglia are involved in the autonomic nervous system. They are involved explicitly with sympathetic efferent innervation, particularly to the face and head. The superior cervical ganglion is the most superior ganglion of the sympathetic chain, bilaterally. It is the largest of the three ganglia of the cervical sympathetic trunk, the other two being the stellate and middle cervical ganglion.
