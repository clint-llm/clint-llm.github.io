Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses many mechanisms for antibiotic resistance and a variety of virulence factors that collectively account for the broad-spectrum of infections it causes and the increasingly challenging treatment for the resulting antimicrobial resistance. Multiple mechanisms have been identified for Pseudomonas antibiotic resistance, examples are intrinsic antibiotic resistance, efflux systems, and antibiotic-inactivating enzymes.Pseudomonas bacteria to form a biofilmÂ is also an important mechanism with which it can increase antibiotic resistance and resist host defenses.
