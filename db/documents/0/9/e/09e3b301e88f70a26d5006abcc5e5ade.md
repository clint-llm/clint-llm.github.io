The molecular signals regulating lung development are complex and involve members of BMP, EGF, FGF Hedgehog, TGFB, WNT families, and retinoic acid. Nkx2.1 encodes a transcription factor essential in lung development; The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway regulates Nkx2.1 expression in ventral endoderm of the foregut. Inactivation of Wnt2a, Wnt2b, or beta-catenin causes lung aplasia.

Branching within the respiratory tree is caused by reciprocal interactions between the ventral endoderm of the foregut and the adjacent splanchnopleuric mesoderm. FGF10 is a crucial ligand in facilitating this process by inducing the formation of the trachea from the lung primordia, as well as the formation and subsequent branching of the primary bronchial buds. FGF10 signals to the FGF2b receptor in the mesenchymal cells at the tips of the bronchial buds to stimulate mitosis in the adjacent endoderm, thus stimulating its outgrowth.
