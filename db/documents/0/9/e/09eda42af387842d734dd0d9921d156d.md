The spinal trigeminal nucleus incorporates sensory information from all three branches of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). CN V1, also known as the ophthalmic nerve, relays sensory information from the face in regions located above the orbit of the eyes. CN V2, also known as the maxillary nerve, is primarily responsible for sensory information between the orbit and the mouth. The final branch is CN V3, also known as the mandibular nerve. CN V3 has both a sensory component as well as a motor component; however, only the sensory component projects to the SN.

The spinal trigeminal nucleus also consolidates sensory input from the facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves; this is a minor role of SN in comparison to its integration of sensory information from the three branches of the trigeminal nerve.
