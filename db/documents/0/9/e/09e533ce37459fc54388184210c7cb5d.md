The prognosis for cerebral edema is highly variable and depends on the amount of brain involved, the severity, and the etiology of the edema.  If the patient is comatose upon discovery, the prognosis may be poor.  If the edema is widespread and severe enough to cause significantly elevated intracranial pressure, and treatment is not initiated, the patient may die or develop persistent and irreversible brain injury.  An example is seen in prolonged cardiac arrest causing diffuse anoxic brain injury.  The basis for prognosis in milder forms is usually the diagnosis and underlying cause (i.e., tumor, stroke, traumatic brain injury, infection, etc.) and early recognition and treatment.  Cerebral edema as a consequence of reversible diagnoses, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or uncontrolled hypertension or mild head trauma can be reasonably good.
