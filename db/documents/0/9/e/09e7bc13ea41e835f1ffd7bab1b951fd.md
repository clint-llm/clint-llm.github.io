Intracellular growth of tachyzoites results in direct cytopathic effects, cellular inflammation, and necrosis. Type 1 cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is mainly required to control acute and chronic infection of T. gondii. Thus any defects in cell-mediated immunity predispose the host to develop severe manifestations of toxoplasmosis. In response to the damage caused by tachyzoite entry, the gut epithelial cells produce chemokines that act as chemical messengers resulting in the recruitment of dendritic cells (DC), macrophages, and neutrophils to the site of damage. The entry of tachyzoites into these inflammatory cells stimulates the production of interleukin-12 (IL-12). IL-12 induces interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) synthesis by natural killer (NK) cells and T lymphocytes.

Synthesis of IFN-gamma is required to control acute and chronic infection. Low CD4 counts seen in patients with AIDS result in lower IFN-gamma levels, thereby causing unopposed multiplication of tachyzoites in case of acute infection and reactivation of bradyzoites in latent infection resulting in severe disease (cerebral and extracerebral toxoplasmosis). Though CMI plays a key role in controlling the T. gondii infection, humoral immunity also contributes by synthesizing antibodies, modulating CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses, and amplifying IFN-gamma production involved in CMI.
