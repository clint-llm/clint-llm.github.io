Clinical presentation for AF can range from asymptomatic incidental findings on an electrocardiogram (ECG) to a catastrophic stroke with an undiagnosed underlying irregular rhythm. More commonly, symptoms are similar to other arrhythmias like palpitations, dyspnea at rest or exertion, angina-like symptoms, fatigue or decreased exercise tolerance, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, dizziness, and pre-sync and syncope. AF can also masquerade as symptoms of heart failure exacerbation like weight gain, pedal edema, and pulmonary congestion.

All patients presenting with the above symptoms should have a detailed history, including past medical/cardiac history. On physical examination, patients should be examined for an irregularly irregular pulse, signs of heart failure like jugular vein distension (JVD), pedal edema, and lung crackles. In valvular AF, mitral stenosis/regurgitation murmur can be heard. A history of prior investigation of underlying causes, anticoagulation choices, and previously attempted methods for rate/rhythm control is important.
