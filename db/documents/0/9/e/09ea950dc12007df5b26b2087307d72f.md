Liddle syndrome is one of the rare causes of resistant hypertension that presents in early childhood. Grant Liddle et al. first explained Liddle syndrome in 1963. It is also known as pseudo aldosteronism. It is a rare cause of secondary hypertension due to a genetic mutation, affecting the function of the collecting tubule sodium channel. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of Liddle syndrome and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the genetic etiology of Liddle syndrome.
- Describe the right workup to help establishing that a patient has Liddle syndrome, including potential differential diagnoses.
- Summarize the pharmaceutical treatment of Liddle syndrome.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by Liddle syndrome.
