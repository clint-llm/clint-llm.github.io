The diagnosis and management of uric acid nephrolithiasis require coordination among various health care professionals like nephrologists, radiologists, urologists, primary care providers, nurses, and pharmacists. In most cases, conservative treatment with uric acid dissolving medications helps to resolve the nephrolithiasis. However, in the case of urinary obstructions and accompanying renal failure or infection, urology surgical help is required for further management. The prognosis is good in most of the cases, and patient recovery is rapid.
