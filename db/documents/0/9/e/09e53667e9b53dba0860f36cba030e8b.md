Patients with yolk sac tumors have signs and symptoms depending on the location of cancer.

Testicular tumors have no specific symptoms except testicular mass.

Children with testicular yolk sac tumors are generally present with testicular masses; the mass is painless and solid. Metastasis is not common in the presentation of the disease. It occurs in less than one-tenth of cases. While in adults, testicular yolk sac tumors are mixed with other germ cell components such as embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, teratoma, and seminoma.

Most patients with ovarian yolk sac tumors have symptoms of abdominal distention and sudden onset of pain at presentation. A pelvic mass may be palpable on examination of the patient. This tumor is described by very rapid growth; the duration of the symptoms in most of the patients is seven days or less.

Other symptoms of ovarian cancer can include:

- Fatigue

- Upset stomach (dyspepsia)

- Back pain

- Pain during sex (dyspareunia)

- Constipation

- Changes in the period, such as more massive bleeding (menorrhagia) or irregular bleeding (metrorrhagia)

- Abdominal swelling with weight loss

Metastasis develops quickly in ovarian yolk sac tumors and invades the structures around the ovaries. Metastasis can also spread through the lymph nodes.
