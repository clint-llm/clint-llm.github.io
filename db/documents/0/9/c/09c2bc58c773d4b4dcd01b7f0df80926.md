The fallopian tubes are bilateral conduits between the ovaries and the uterus in the female pelvis. They function as channels for oocyte transport and fertilization. Given this role, the fallopian tubes are a common etiology of infertility as well as the target of purposeful surgical sterilization. They can also be sites of ascending infection or neoplasms.
