Most patients with endocarditis present with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, fever, or chest pain. These symptoms correspond to multiple serious conditions, and the workup must necessarily be broad. Patients with chest pain or dyspnea warrant early consideration of other potentially life-threatening cardiopulmonary processes such as acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonia. Whereas those appearing floridly septic should undergo rapid, guideline-directed evaluation following validated protocols.

For those presenting primarily with chest pain or dyspnea, initial acquisition of a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a rapid and inexpensive means to evaluate for underlying ischemia, dysrhythmias, or structural disease that may be confounding the diagnostic picture. The typical ECG in infectious endocarditis appears normal. ST-elevation can be seen in infectious endocarditis but should be considered a marker of myocardial infarction and handled consistent with ST-segment myocardial infarction even in previously diagnosed cases of infectious endocarditis.

In the acute setting, a broad laboratory workup is often indicated, given the nonspecific presenting symptomatology. A complete blood count often demonstrates a leukocytosis that points towards an underlying infectious process. Cases with more subacute-chronic presentations may have normocytic anemia consistent with anemia of chronic disease. Although nonspecific, inflammatory markers such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and c-reactive protein (CRP) are elevated in around 60% of cases.

Following exclusion of more immediately life-threatening etiologies, diagnosis of infectious endocarditis anchors on both microbiologic and echocardiograph evidence of infection. Diagnosis has long been predicated on the Modified Duke Criteria. Divided into major and minor criteria, diagnosis requires satisfaction of either two major criteria, one major and three minor criteria, or five minor criteria. The first major criterion involves confirmation of bacteremia. More specifically, the Modified Duke Criteria requires two separate blood cultures positive for typical pathogens such as viridans group strep, S. gallolyticus, HACEK organisms, S. aureus, or community-acquired enterococci in the absence of a primary focus. If other culprit pathogens are suspected, blood cultures must remain persistently positive as defined by either two positive cultures drawn more than 12 hours apart or positive results of all three or majority of 4 or more separate cultures (with first and last samples drawn one hour apart).Coxiella burnetii or an anti-phase 1 IgG antibody titer greater than or equal to 1:800.

The second major criterion involves sonographic evidence of endocardial involvement. An echocardiogram must demonstrate a vacillating intra-cardiac mass fixed to a valve, supporting structure, or implanted material. Initial evaluation with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is common; however, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends obtaining a more sensitive and specific transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) if suspicion for infectious endocarditis remains high despite a negative TTE (Class I, Level of Evidence B).

Regarding the five minor criteria, these include the following:

- Predisposing conditions such as underlying valvular abnormalities, structural heart disease, or intravenous drug use.

- Fever defined by a temperature greater than 38 degrees celsius.

- Evidence of vascular phenomena such as mycotic aneurysms, intracranial hemorrhage, Janeway lesions, major arterial emboli, or septic pulmonary infarcts.

- Evidence of immunologic phenomena such as Osler’s nodes, Roth spots, glomerulonephritis, or positive rheumatoid factor.

- Positive blood cultures that do not satisfy the aforementioned major criterion or serologic evidence of infection consistent with infectious endocarditis.
