Contraindications for placement of a radial artery catheter include

Absolute:

- Patient refusal

- Infection overlying the site

- Absent pulse/poor circulation assessed by the Allen test. Positive Allen test which assesses proper collateral perfusion from the ulnar artery. This test is performed by having the patient make a tight fist. The examiner then occludes the radial and ulnar arteries at the wrist, and the patient is asked to relax. The hand should reveal pallor at this point. The examiner then releases the ulnar artery, and the patient should have a return of blood flow through the hand as evidenced by hyperemia throughout the entire hand within 1 to 5 seconds. In a negative test, this provides the performer evidence that there is less chance of an ischemic event to the palmar arch if the radial artery were to be occluded, transected, or thrombosed due to the collateral circulation from the ulnar artery. A positive test would have the return of blood flow in more than 5 seconds and warrant choice of another site.

Relative:

- Coagulopathy

- Partial/full thickness burn

- Vascular graft in upper extremity

- Raynaud syndrome

- Thromboangitis obliterans
