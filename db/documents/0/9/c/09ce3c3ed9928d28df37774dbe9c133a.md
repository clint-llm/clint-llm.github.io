To use technetium 99m sestamibi, it must be prepared ahead of time using the water bath method. A variety of techniques have been proposed to heat sestamibi, but the main goal is to heat the compound to a boil. Following this preparation process, there is a six-hour period where the vial must be administered.

For myocardial perfusion imaging, sestamibi is introduced intravenously, using aseptic technique, in small amounts when the heart is at rest and one minute into maximal stress. Exercise is the preferred way to induce stress, but adenosine receptor agonists, namely dipyridamole, can be used in those with limited exercise capacity.

In preparation for parathyroid surgery, a dose of 740 to 925 megabecquerel of sestamibi is injected intravenously approximately 2.5 to 3 hours before the surgery to localize the adenoma to be removed. Furthermore, to ensure that the radiotracer is not taken up by thyroid parenchyma, the thyroid gland function is inhibited by administering five drops of Lugol's iodine solution every twelve hours four days before the procedure and the day of the procedure. By suppressing the thyroid function, sestamibi uptake will be isolated to the hyperfunctioning parathyroid adenoma on the day of the surgery.

The standard dosing used in molecular breast imaging is approximately 300 megabecquerel of sestamibi using dual-head cadmium zinc telluride cameras. In this setting, the imaging is gathered immediately after the injection of the radiotracer.
