When a traumatic injury occurs, bones and soft tissue absorb the imposed energy. It is when the threshold of absorption is exceeded that communication of the bone occurs causing periosteal stripping and soft tissue destruction. The comminuted bone fragments are often not attached to any anchoring structures which allow them to be displaced causing significant soft tissue and neurovascular structure damage. When the skin tears, it creates a vacuum effect which then pulls all surrounding debris into the wound.  The foreign material and dirt can often be deposited into deep intramuscular and bone cortex.
