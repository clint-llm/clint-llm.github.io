Communication is vital for optimal outcomes during spinal, intracranial, and aortic vascular surgeries that utilize motor evoked potentials. Close contact between the neurophysiologist, the offsite supervising neurologist, the surgeon, the physician assistants or residents, the anesthesia provider, the circulating nurse, and the scrub technician is required for optimal outcomes.

Motor evoked potentials are an important means of detecting early neuronal ischemia and preventing neurological injury. Implementation of time-outs, safe surgical checklists, encouraging each team member to speak up and cultivating a “no blame” culture improve surgical outcomes and staff morale.
