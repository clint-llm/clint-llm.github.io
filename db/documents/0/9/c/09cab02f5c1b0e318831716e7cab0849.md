Setmelanotide is administered subcutaneously and is available as a 1 mL multidose vial with a concentration of 10 mg/mL. The starting dose in the pediatric population between the ages of 6 and < 12 is 1 mg (0.1 mL) injected daily for two weeks. Patients must be simultaneously monitored for side effects, specifically gastrointestinal (GI) and hypersensitivity reactions.

The dose is further adjusted to 2 mg if the initial dose is tolerated. However, if side effects are noted, the dose is decreased to 0.5 mg once daily in pediatric patients. The starting dosage in patients 12 years of age and older is 2 mg (0.2 mL) injected subcutaneously once daily while also monitoring for GI side effects. The dosage is then adjusted from 1 mg (0.1 mL) to 3 mg (0.3 mL), depending on the patient's tolerance.

The weight evaluation of the patient is necessary after 12Â to 16 weeks of treatment. Recommendations include discontinuing the drug if the patient has not lost either 5% of their baseline body weight or 5% of their baseline body mass index (BMI). Continued treatment with Setmelanotide in patients who exhibit this may not cause significant weight loss.
