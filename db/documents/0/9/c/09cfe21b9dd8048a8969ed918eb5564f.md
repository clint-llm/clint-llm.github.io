Patients in the care of infertility practices are cared for by an interprofessional team of medical professionals, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), nurses, embryologists, lab technicians, and other health professionals. It is essential for all team members to be aware of the optimal time for the patient to achieve pregnancy to generate a thoughtful treatment plan with the highest likelihood of success; this requires open communication channels between team members and accurate, updated patient record keeping. This interprofessional approach will yield the best patient outcomes.
