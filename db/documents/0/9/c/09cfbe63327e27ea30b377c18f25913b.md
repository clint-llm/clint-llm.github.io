Anatomy varies a lot by the operation chosen.  Therefore, this will include the most common choices for free flap breast reconstruction, although this is not all-inclusive.  See the images below for the anatomy.

Starting with the recipient site.  Patients who are getting free flap breast reconstruction are undergoing or have had a mastectomy. Therefore the recipient's vessels need to be located near the site of reconstruction.  Historically, the thoracodorsal arteries were utilized although the internal mammary arteries are now more commonly used.  The results are comparable regardless of the site chosen. The thoracodorsal arteries are similarly sized to the internal mammary arteries at 1.0 to 2.5mm in diameter. They are already exposed in a patient who underwent an axillary dissection but is prone to injury in a patient who requires a delayed axillary dissection.  The internal mammary arteries have a higher flow than the thoracodorsal arteries.  Also, they can be utilized for anastomosis in both the anterograde and retrograde direction and can best be used at the 3 to 5 intercostal spaces.  Occasionally, perforators off of the internal mammary are large enough to be utilized.  Internal mammary arteries require less pedicle length to be reached and are advantageous for small flaps with short pedicles.

Below is the list of the common donor sites/flaps:

**Abdomen**

There are several iterations of flaps from the abdomen that can be utilized, from most invasive to least invasive, the free TRAM, ms-TRAM, DIEP, and SIEA (superficial inferior epigastric artery) flap.  These flaps are beneficial to harvest, as many patients have some extra abdominal tissue and get the added benefit of abdominal contouring from the harvesting of the transverse skin island.  The TRAM derives from the rectus muscle, which is a Mathes and Nahai type III flap, with two dominant pedicles. TRAM, ms-TRAM (ms-1 and 2), vs. DIEP (ms-3), all depend on how much muscle gets removed.  The free TRAM takes the entirety of the muscle (ms-0), ms 1 leaves either a medial or lateral component, ms 2 leaves medial and lateral components, ms 3 (DIEP) is a true perforator flap and leaves all muscle intact. The muscle is split to free the vessels.  The typical anatomy of the rectus muscle is two rows of perforators, although variants with one and three rows also exist.  The advantage of taking more muscle is improved blood supply, but it sacrifices more abdominal wall morbidity.  A large amount of tissue is harvestable, and the pedicle is about 12cm in length and 2.0mm in diameter.  The SIEA is considered ms 4 as it only takes the skin and fat off the fascia based on the superficial vessel and does not violate the muscle or fascia.  However, only a hemi-abdomen can be utilized with this flap, which often does not have a vessel sufficient in size to use.

When the abdominal tissue is not available or sufficient, secondary flap options are a possible choice.  This option varies between buttock and thigh flaps, with flaps like the SGAP (superior gluteal artery perforator), IGAP (inferior gluteal artery perforator), TUG (transverse upper gracilis), and PAP (profundal artery perforator).

**Medial Thigh**

There are two options from the medial thigh, the TUG flap, and the PAP flap.  The TUG flap produces a relatively small breast but is an easy flap to elevate.  It utilizes the area that otherwise discarded during a medial thigh lift, but keeps the gracilis, and thus the vascular pedicle (the ascending branch of the medial circumflex femoral artery) with it.  Since the TUG flap is based on the gracilis, it is a Mathes and Nahai Type II flap.  The transversely oriented skin paddle can be up to 25x10cm in size, with a small pedicle (6cm in length and 1.6mm vessels).  This flap is ideal for small-breasted women who do not have an abdominal donor site or do not want an abdominal donor site.

The profunda artery perforator flap, or PAP flap, has recently been described to improve upon the TUG flap.  It has the advantages of longer pedicle length, better donor-site scar, larger skin paddle, no muscle harvest, and decreased lymphedema risk.  However, pre-operative imaging is necessary to determine the location of the pedicle, to design the skin paddle properly.  It is more posteriorly located than the TUG donor site and can make a flap of about 6 to 7cm by 18 to 20cm.  The pedicle is about 10cm in length and usually has a diameter of 2.2mm.  These flaps can be coned to re-shape the breast and tend to look more natural than gluteal tissue.

**Gluteal Flaps**

The gluteal flaps were actually described before the thigh-based flaps, but are used less commonly as they require position changes for harvest and inset.  Gluteal tissue is firmer and more difficult to shape and inset.  They can be based on either the superior (SGAP) or inferior gluteal arteries (IGAP).  The SGAP skin island is 10 to 12 x 25 to 32 cm with a 6 to 8 cm pedicle.  The IGAP is usually about 8x18 cm, and the pedicle is about 8 to 11 cm. The inferiorly based flap avoids the divot created by the SGAP donor site but risks sciatic exposure if taking the muscle.

**Lateral Thigh Flap**

A more recently described flap is the lateral thigh or subcutaneous tensor fascia lata perforator flap, based off perforators originating from the ascending branch of the lateral circumflex artery.  The perforators are in the septum between tensor fascia lata and gluteus medius muscles.  Flap dimensions range between 6 to 9 cm x 18 to 22 cm with a 6 to 8 cm pedicle length and 2.0mm in diameter.
