Bupropion is an antidepressant medication that is now also used in smoking cessation. Bupropion has been FDA-approved since 1985. The drug is FDA-approved for adult depression, seasonal affective disorder, and smoking cessation. Off-label, non-FDA approved uses include anti-depressant-induced sexual dysfunction, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression associated with bipolar disorder, and obesity. In the pediatric population, bupropion is used off-label for ADHD. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of bupropion, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team for the treatment of patients with indications where bupropion has therapeutic value.

**Objectives:**
- Review the FDA-approved on-label indications of bupropion, as well as other off-label uses.
- Describe the mechanism of action of bupropion, including consequential interactions with other medications. 
- Summarize the contraindications and risks associated with initiating bupropion.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for the patient receiving treatment with bupropion.
