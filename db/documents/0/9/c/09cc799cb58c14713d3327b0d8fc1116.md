It is essential that clear post-operative dietary guidance is given and follow-up provided. Bariatric patients must take lifelong vitamin supplements following their procedure; however, studies suggest compliance declines at 5 months and is significantly reduced 2 to 3 years later.****Vitamin B12 and iron are the most commonly encountered deficiencies following surgery, and particular attention should be paid to the latter in menstruating women. Supplements can include Vitamins A, B12, C, D, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, iron, folic acid, zinc, copper, selenium, and thiamine.

Surgical failure can be due to surgical complications requiring revision, insufficient weight loss, or weight regain following surgery. Revision surgery carries a higher risk than the initial surgery due to irreversible anatomical changes that have already been made in the primary surgery and the development of adhesions. Weight regain following surgery requires further studies to understand the mechanisms involved. Proposed contributing factors include inadequate follow-up and the development of detrimental lifestyles and behaviors. The desired reduction in the volume of food intake and, therefore, calorie intake with restrictive bariatric surgeries can be circumnavigated with items such as ice creams and milkshakes, which are particularly high in calories. Weight regain is particularly noted following sleeve gastrectomy, and this further emphasizes the importance of continued postoperative care.

Depressive disorders, binge eating, and uncontrolled snacking have been associated with poorer weight loss outcomes. To this end, most American bariatric programs require a pre-operative psychological assessment to identify any potentially detrimental factors.
