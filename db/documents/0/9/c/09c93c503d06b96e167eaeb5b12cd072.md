The rotator cuff interval is a region located between the supraspinatus and the subscapularis tendons. The structure and function of this interval underwent a study by Jost et al. and were found to be comprised of the supraspinatus and subscapularis and the coracohumeral ligament, superior glenohumeral ligament, and the glenohumeral joint capsule.

In instances where the rotator cuff interval is contracted and limiting external rotation, the release of the lateral aspect of the interval may be an option, leaving the coracohumeral ligament intact. Lim et al. found the presence of pectoralis minor tendon inserting into the rotator cuff interval in 11 of 99 subjects studied, and the tendon tethered the retracted supraspinatus tendon in 7 of the 11 subjects, which created tension on the tendon repair and resulted in the need to resect the pectoralis minor tendon completely for optimal repair.
