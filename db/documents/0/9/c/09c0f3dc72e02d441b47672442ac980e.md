Language impairments can be frustrating for patients. When communicating with patients with language impairment in a healthcare setting, it is important to provide these individuals with ample time to express themselves and ensure that communication-related is clear and unambiguous. In a stroke, language impairments are associated with depression and poorer quality of life.

Good communication between interprofessional team members is vital to success when working in an interprofessional setting, as in rehabilitation. Agraphia and its features can be subtle, and relaying specific clinical findings directly to therapists can help guide effective speech and occupational therapy.

Rehabilitation for agraphia, as with other forms of disability, should be tailored to the patientâ€™s individual capacity and goals. The need for writing as a skill varies between patients. As communication with language is inherently a social activity, it is also valuable, whenever possible, to engage the family members of patients with agraphia to help determine therapy goals.
