Pneumocephalus (also known as pneumatocele or intracranial aerocele) is defined as the presence of air in the epidural, subdural, or subarachnoid space within the brain parenchyma or ventricular cavities.

Pneumocephalus can occur following trauma, cranial surgeries, or spontaneously. It is classified as simple or tension pneumocephalus. It can also be classified as acute (less than 72 hours) or delayed (72 hours or more).

It has to be differentiated from the following terms:

- Pneumorrhachis denotes intraspinal air.

- Pneumocele is a focal or diffuse enlargement of any paranasal sinus (usually frontal) associated with thinning of its bony walls and hyperpneumatization

- Pneumosinus dilatans is the same as pneumocele, but the sinus walls are intact and normal.

- Pneumoventricle is the presence of intraventricular air

The term tension pneumoventricle is used when there is an intraventricular accumulation of air causing an increase in the intracranial pressure and compression of vital centers.
