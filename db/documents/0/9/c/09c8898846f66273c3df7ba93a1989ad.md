Epispadias represents the mild form of the spectrum of anomalies included in BEEC. It must be differentiated from classical bladder exstrophy, in which the bladder plate is also exposed, apart from the open urethral plate, as seen in epispadias. The pubic diastasis is common among both bladder exstrophy and epispadias. Also, the most severe form of the spectrum is represented by cloacal exstrophy. It is characterized by the presence of major anomalies, including omphalocele, bladder exstrophy, imperforate anus, and spinal abnormalities. An isolated epispadias can easily be distinguished from these diseases on clinical examination.

Hypospadias is another disease, which sounds similar, but has the exact opposite clinical features. Hypospadias has a ventral meatus, ventral chordee, dorsally hooded prepuce, and lacks pubic diastasis. Common urogenital sinus is frequently misdiagnosed as female epispadias, which is a disorder of sexual differentiation. The patulous urethral opening may appear to be a single opening in the vestibule. However, upon precise examination, the anteriorly placed vaginal opening becomes visible.
