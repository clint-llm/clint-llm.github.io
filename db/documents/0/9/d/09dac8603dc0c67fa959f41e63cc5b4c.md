Like in any other blood vessel, the wall is comprised, from the inside out, of the tunica intima, media, and adventitia. The intima layer is sensitive to endothelial nitric oxide synthase, which produces potent vasodilation in response to acetylcholine, substance P, and bradykinin. The nerve fibers, the majority of which are sympathetic, are distributed in the tunica media and adventitia layers.

Chronic hypertension causes hypertrophy of the smooth muscle layer in response to the consistently higher pressures within the vessel lumen. Hypoxia to the outer smooth muscle layers leads to their degeneration and fibrinoid necrosis. Following this is sclerosis of the media layer and over time of the entire vessel wall.

A similar sequence of events occurs in cerebral amyloid angiopathy, where there is a deposit of beta-amyloid in the vessel wall that leads to hypoxia and fibrinoid necrosis.

Finally, the collagen fiber network is then replaced with hyalin. These hyalinized areas are points of low resistance and are thus susceptible to aneurysmal dilatation and rupture with sudden increases in blood pressure. The size of the hematoma correlates with the size of the ruptured aneurysm. The LSAs are especially vulnerable since the deep structures in the brain surrounding these arterioles and capillaries do not allow them to withstand high-pressure variations.
