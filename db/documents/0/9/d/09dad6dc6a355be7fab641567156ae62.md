Secondary causes of eosinophilia should be ruled out first. The evaluation for primary eosinophilia should begin with screening peripheral blood for FIP1L1- PDGFRA gene fusion. Diagnostic testing should start with peripheral smear. Cytogenetic testing and FISH analysisÂ can be performed on peripheral blood as well.

Concurrent cytophilias or cytopenias, if present, can help with diagnosis. In that case, a bone marrow biopsy, along with karyotype and genetic screen of chromosomes, may be required.

B12 level and tryptase level, along with cytogenetic/immunophenotypic testing and marrow findings, help diagnose chronic mastocytosis, acute/chronic myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and MDS/MPN overlap. When skin rashes are present, skin biopsy helps to diagnose cutaneous disorders like pemphigoid, eczema, mycosis fungoides, and Sezary syndrome. Imaging of the chest helps diagnose aspergillosis, Loeffler syndrome, and Churg Strauss syndrome. Ultrasound abdomen helps to evaluate for splenomegaly. Stool testing helps to assess for parasitic infections.
