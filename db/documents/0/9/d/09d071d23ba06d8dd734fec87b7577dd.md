Patients should be educated that they will likely not experience visual symptoms in the presence of nerve drusen. However, they are highly likely to develop some visual field defects detectable on visual field testing. Education should also be given that despite the benign nature of nerve drusen, imaging is warranted in general and especially in borderline cases to confirm no presence of disc edema.

Patients should also be educated that there are rarely associated complications possible and that treatment and prognosis of complications depend on the nature of the complication. Lastly, patients should understand that treatment options targeting nerve drusen are not widely available or well studied.
