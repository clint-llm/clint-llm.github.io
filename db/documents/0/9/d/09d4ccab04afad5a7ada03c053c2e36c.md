All antipsychotics have some degree of antagonism at D2 receptors. First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) produce antipsychotic effects at 60% to 80% D2 occupancy. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) like risperidone exhibit their therapeutic effects through some D2 blockade, but more from the blockade of serotonin receptors like 5HT2A. Second-generation antipsychotics have loose binding to D2 receptors and can quickly dissociate from the receptor, potentially accounting for the lower likelihood of causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).

Moreover,Â second-generation antipsychotics have agonism at the 5HT1A receptor. Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition are potential mechanisms by which risperidone is postulated to produce antidepressant effects. The improvement of positive symptoms is thought to be accomplished through the blockade of D2 receptors, specifically in the mesolimbic pathway. The ability of antipsychotics to block D2 receptors in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens is important in improving certain psychiatric symptoms. Of note, risperidone does not cause anticholinergic effects, which may benefit patients in certain populations, including the elderly with dementia.
