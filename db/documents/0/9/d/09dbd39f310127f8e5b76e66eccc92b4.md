Multiple options exist for breast reconstruction following oncologic resection, and the management of oncologic breast defects has changed over time. Abdominal-based flaps have become workhorse donors for reconstruction, including free transverse rectus abdominis muscle flap (TRAM), muscle-sparing TRAM flaps, and deep inferior epigastric perforator flaps. Prior abdominal surgery, prior and planned radiotherapy, and other patient factors may complicate decision-making in the preoperative period. Collaboration with breast surgeons and the other treating oncologic teams is imperative for the best outcomes.

Intraoperatively, an operating room staff familiar with microvascular tools, techniques, and required medications is important for good outcomes. Nurses with specific surgical training are an integral part of the health care interprofessional team. Coordination with the anesthesia team, including the nurse anesthetistsÂ and anesthesiologists, is necessary for appropriate anticoagulation and blood pressure management.

In the postoperative period, the receiving nurse is of critical importance, as they are the first line in diagnosing flap problems. Pharmacists are likewise important to aid with appropriate inpatient and outpatient anticoagulation. An interprofessional team familiar with the needs of microvascular patients can minimize complications and diagnose flap problems more quickly.
