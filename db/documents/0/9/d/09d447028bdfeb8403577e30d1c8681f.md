Simvastatin has been used for many years to treat dyslipidemia and high-risk patients such as people with diabetes. Common clinical pearls can help limit potential adverse effects and enhance patient outcomes.

- Due to an increased risk of myopathy, the 80-mg dose is restricted to patients who have been stable on 80 mg for at least 12 months. If additional LDL-lowering is required, switch to a high-intensity statin.

- Use a lower starting dose and monitor for patients who are of Chinese descent.

- Use further caution in patients who are chronic alcohol consumers and/or have a history of liver disease.

- Avoid the consumption of grapefruit juice, or space the consumption of grapefruit and grapefruit juice from statin dosing.

Simvastatin therapy can address dyslipidemia in those patients with such a profile. However, newer statin agents with fewer interactions and adverse effects have replaced simvastatin as the first-line agent for statin therapy. Currently, it is more common to initiate treatment on these newer agents, leaving simvastatin for those who have had successful results using the drug with no adverse events. For those patients who receive dyslipidemia therapy with simvastatin, the interprofessional healthcare team, consisting of clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPS, and PAs), specialists, nurses, and pharmacists, should work together to monitor for therapeutic results and adverse effects and the pharmacist can suggest equivalent dosing with other statins less prone to adverse events.

When the clinician prescribes simvastatin, the nursing staff should review dosing and administration with the patient and answer patient questions about their medication therapy. It is incumbent on the pharmacist to perform medication reconciliation and verify that there are no potential drug-drug interactions that need to be addressed and that the dosing of the drug is appropriate. Any concerns should be reported to the prescriber or nursing staff, so appropriate measures can be taken to alter the patient's therapy.
