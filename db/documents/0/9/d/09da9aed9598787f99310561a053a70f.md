The most common and clinically concerning the adverse effect of intravenous polymyxins is nephrotoxicity, which has the highest incidence. Polymyxins have correlations with hematuria, proteinuria, oliguria, and acute renal failure. As a result, renal function should be followed closely during administration. Colistin needs to be dose adjusted for renal impairment; however, it is not necessary for polymyxin B. Clinicians should avoid concurrent use of other nephrotoxic drugs if possible.

Neurotoxicity can also occur due to intravenous polymyxin administration with an incidence rate of 7 percent, according to initial studies. Adverse effects include dizziness, numbness, paresthesia, slurred speech, tingling, vertigo, and neuromuscular blockade, which can lead to respiratory failure. Paresthesias were the main neurotoxic adverse effect seen in patients treated with polymyxins. Neurotoxic adverse effects may be more common in cystic fibrosis individuals with the use of polymyxins, with the main effect being paresthesias and ataxia. Clinicians should avoid concurrent use of neurotoxic drugs if possible.

Other rarer adverse effects include hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, pruritus, urticaria, and fever. Aerosolization of polymyxins into the airway can cause bronchospasm; therefore, bronchodilation prior to administration may be beneficial.
