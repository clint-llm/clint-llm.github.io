Malignant hypertension is a term that has been used to describe patients with elevated blood pressure (BP) and multiple complications with poor prognoses. Today, the term hypertensive crisis is used to describe patients who present with severe BP elevations as follows: Systolic blood pressure and (SBP) greater than 180 mm Hg and Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 120 mm Hg). The diagnosis can be further classified as a hypertensive emergency when severe elevation in BP is associated with end-organ damage or hypertensive urgency when severe hypertension occurs without it. This activity reviews the cause of malignant hypertension, its pathophysiology and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the causes of malignant hypertension.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with malignant hypertension.
- Summarize the treatment of malignant hypertension.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by malignant hypertension.
