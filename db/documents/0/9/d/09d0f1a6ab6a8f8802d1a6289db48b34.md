Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim may be administered orally without regard to meals. However, it is best to take it with at least 8 ounces of water. It also has an intravenous formulation. The choice of oral or intravenously varies both on the type of infection/or type of prophylactic use. It should not be administered intramuscularly. Patients with impaired renal function must have calculated dosing regimens based on renal function, as listed below. Administration of the two drugs is in a 1 to 5 ratio (trimethoprim:sulfamethoxazole) as a tablet formulation; this is so when they enter the body, their concentration throughout the blood/tissues is 1 to 20, which is the peak synergistic desired effect ratio of the two drugs in combination.
