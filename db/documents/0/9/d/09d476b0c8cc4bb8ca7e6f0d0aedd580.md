Being a cognitive disorder, SAD has a myriad of treatments and therapies currently in use. One of the major treatments is cognitive behavior therapy, generally once a week. Antidepressants and light therapies can accompanyÂ such treatment.

The following are the main treatments used for SAD:

- Treating intrinsic medical conditions

- Light therapy

- Hormonal therapy

- Use of antidepressants

- Dietary modifications

- Increased exercises

- Meditations

- Sleep hygiene

- Dawn stimulation

- ECT therapy

- Vitamin D

With SAD as a recurring disease, the main mode of treatment involves proper planning and management. Social behavior such as drug abuse, isolation, and stress should be avoided. Activities like visiting warmer climates during winter times can aid in preventing the syndrome. Light therapy at any day or night aids in reducing depressive symptoms and advancing circadian rhythms. It can also restore sleep timing and sleep patterns. The primary form of light in light therapy is blue light, which is of a moderate frequency and normally found in the morning sunlight. It boosts vitamin D at the onset of the day. However, it should be avoided at night as it can inhibit sleeping patterns and change the physical properties of emitted light. Several devices are used to emit this type of light, although they vary greatly in the intensity and light wavelengths emitted. The efficacy of emitted light is greatly supported by research and may be useful for some patients.
