Obtaining a thorough history is paramount in the diagnosis of knee dislocations, especially in instances where the joint has spontaneously reduced before medical evaluation. The clinician should inquire about the traumatic mechanism and if the patient noted the position of the lower leg immediately after the injury. In scenarios where the patient or emergency management services report a change in the position of the tibia relative to the femur, the examiner should assume a knee dislocation occurred and then may have spontaneously reduced to a more anatomic position. Gross instability suggested by hyperextension of the knee greater than 30 degrees when lifting the heel suggests that a knee dislocation may have occurred. In other instances, the patient may present after trauma with an obvious deformity consistent with knee dislocation, making the diagnosis more straightforward. A significant joint effusion, swelling, and ecchymosis may be present around the knee as well, which can limit the examination of ligament integrity.

Distal pulses, as well as popliteal pulses, should be assessed. However, a palpable distal pulse does not suggest the absence of vascular injury. Limb-threatening vascular ischemia can result even in the presence of palpable distal foot pulses. The clinician should also assess for proper sensory and motor function though this can be somewhat limited by the pain and swelling associated with this injury.
