Pott puffy tumor (PPT) describes a forehead edema resulting from osteomyelitis of the frontal bone with associated subperiosteal abscess. First described by Sir Percival Pott in 1768, a surgeon in London.

When originally described, it was thought to be caused by a complication from direct trauma to the forehead.
