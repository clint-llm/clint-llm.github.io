Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors arising from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. The clinical features result from excessive secretion of catecholamines. These tumors can be benign or malignant and are frequently associated with familial syndromes like neurofibromatosis type 1, multiple endocrine neoplasia type II, and Von-Hippel Lindau disease. In addition, sporadic pheochromocytomas are among the most frequently overlooked causes of secondary hypertension. This article reviews the evaluation and management of pheochromocytomas and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.
