The predominant blood supply to the hand consists of two arterial arches, the superficial palmar arch (formed by the ulnar artery) and the deep palmar arch (formed by the radial artery).

When planning procedures involving either the radial or ulnar artery, Allen testing is mandatory in the pre-procedure assessment to verify adequate collateral circulation to the hand. For example, the adequacy of collateral circulation through the ulnar artery requires verification before the following procedures involving the radial artery: arterial line placement, transradial cardiac catheterization, radial artery harvest for coronary artery bypass surgery, access procedures for hemodialysis, pedicled radial forearm flaps, and radial forearm free flaps. Similarly, the collateral circulation through the radial artery needs to be assessed by Allen testing if planning procedures on the ulnar artery, such as an ulnar forearm free flap.
