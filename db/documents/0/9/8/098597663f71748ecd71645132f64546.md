Angioma serpiginosum evolves from the proliferation of endothelial cells and formation of new capillaries and not merely by dilation of pre-existing capillaries.

Electron microscopy shows the thickening of the capillary walls caused by a heavy precipitate of basement membrane-like material intermixed with thin collagen fibers and an increased number of pericytes and some authors consider angioma serpiginosum as a type 1 mosaicism.

Researchers have disproved the role of hormones in its pathogenesis by vascular endothelial proliferation because of the lack of estrogen and progesterone receptors on the associated blood vessels. Another proposed etiology is an abnormal vascular response to cold which results in the formation and collection of newly formed capillaries that leads to large ectatic vessels in the papillary dermis.
