Infective endocarditis occurs globally and is defined by the infection of the endocardial surface of the native valve, prosthetic heart valve, or an implanted cardiac device such as a permanent pacemaker or a defibrillator. This activity outlines the etiology, evaluation, and medical treatment of infective endocarditis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiologic pathogens commonly associated with infective endocarditis.
- Outline the common signs and symptoms associated with infective endocarditis.
- Summarize the management of infective endocarditis based on pathogen susceptibility.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in the diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
