Mesenteric ischemia is rare. It is thought to have a prevalence of 0.09% to 0.2% of all hospital admissions in the United States, although the exact percentage is trulyÂ unknown.

- Mesenteric arterial embolism (50%)

- Mesenteric arterial thrombosis (15% to 25%)

- Mesenteric venous thrombosis (5%)

- Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia due to intestinal hypoperfusion (20%)

Usually, mesenteric ischemia is seen in elderly patients, especially those with cardiovascular disease. In younger patients who have no known cardiovascular disease, venous thrombosis is the main cause of mesenteric ischemia.
