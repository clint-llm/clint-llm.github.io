There is a smaller number of other etiologies that may present in the RPS which are often non-surgical in treatment. These include:

- Thoracic duct cysts: these are rare entities that may cause respiratory distress in the presenting patient, which most commonly link with trauma or a neoplasm. A potential treatment option for these individuals is sclerotherapy.

- Retropharyngeal emphysema: the best definition of this condition is free air in the retropharyngeal space. The causes can include trauma, surgery, obstructive respiratory disease, substance abuse, bronchial asthma, and physical exertion, or spontaneousÂ in nature. The clinical symptoms include dysphagia, neck pain, sore throat, and odynophagia. The recommended medical management includes an extensive history and physical, laryngoscopy for examination of the airway, barium swallow for monitoring of potential esophageal perforation, and imaging studies of the neck such as CT and plain radiographs. Most patients will resolve without intensive medical therapy as the condition is typically self-limiting and treatment is supportive.

- Other lesions: foregut duplication cysts, leiomyoma, ectopic parathyroid adenoma, and disk bulge.
