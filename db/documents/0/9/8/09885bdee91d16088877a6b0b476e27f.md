Muscular hematomas are a common source of extravasated blood from within a muscle group, most commonly occurring in the abdominal waist. Muscular hematomas are typically benign, but spontaneous muscular hematomas have the potential to develop into a life-threatening condition. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of muscular hematomas and examines the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in improving the management of patients who develop muscular hematomas.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of muscular hematomas
- Review the appropriate evaluation of muscular hematomas
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for muscular hematomas
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of muscular hematomas and improve outcomes.
