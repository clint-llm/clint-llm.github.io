Limitations in work capacity are noted in patients with advanced lung disease due to impaired gas exchange and alveolar ventilation. The resulting decrease in oxygen supply to skeletal muscles can shift towards anaerobic metabolism in the skeletal muscles and build-up of lactic acid.

A program involving high-intensity exercises can bring about biochemical changes at the cellular level and structural changes in the muscle fibers leading to more aerobic metabolism and a decrease in lactic acid and carbon dioxide production. This leads to delayed onset of fatigue and enhanced exercise tolerance.
