C. botulinum is non-invasive. Its pathogenesis is due to the production of potent neurotoxin 'botulinum toxin' (BT), probably the most toxic substance known to be lethal to humankind. The botulinum neurotoxin is the most potent toxin known till now, with as little as 30-100 ng potentially fatal.

BT is a zinc-dependent protein of 150 kDa (100 kDa heavy chain and a 50 kDa light chain). Eight types of C. botulinum strains have been identified (A, B, C1, C2, D, E, F, and G ) based on the immunological differences in the toxins produced by them. All serotypes produce neurotoxin, except C2, which produces an enterotoxin.

**Therapeutic Uses**

As BT produces flaccid paralysis, it can be used therapeutically for the treatment of spasmodic conditions such as strabismus, blepharospasm, and myoclonus.C. butyricum, C. baratti, and C. argentinense.

Recovery: Blocking of acetylcholine release is permanent, but the action is short-lasting as the recovery occurs in 2Â to 4 months once the new terminal axons sprout. Spores do not produce toxins. Toxin production, therefore, requires spore germination, which occurs in an anaerobic atmosphere. Spores do not normally germinate in the adult intestine; however, they may germinate in the intestine of infants.
