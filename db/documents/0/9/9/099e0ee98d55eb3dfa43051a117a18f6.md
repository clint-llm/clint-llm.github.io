The nasopharynx is a small, tubular structure above the soft palate that connects the nose to the oropharynx. Cancers that arise from this area are usually squamous cell carcinomas that behave differently than the other head and neck cancers. Most common place of origin is the fossa of Rosenmuller, which is the pharyngeal recess. Virus-related oncogenesis is a common theme in head/neck cancers. Oropharyngeal cancers are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and nasopharyngeal cancers (NPC) are associated with Ebstein-Barr virus (EBV). The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified nasopharyngeal carcinoma into the three subtypes based on histology. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and management of patients with nasopharyngeal cancer.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of nasopharyngeal cancer.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with nasopharyngeal cancer.
- Summarize the treatment options for nasopharyngeal cancer.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance care bundle approaches in patients with nasopharyngeal cancer.
