# Continuing Education Activity

Androgen use has become a major public health concern due to the transition of use of androgens from strictly sports to a much wider spectrum of the population. Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) are steroidal androgens which include natural androgens such as male sex hormone testosterone or could be synthetic to mimic the action of the endogenous male hormone. Some people misuse anabolic steroids for various reasons. For example, athletes abuse anabolic steroids to enhance performance and prolong endurance. Non-athletic people misuse anabolic steroids to increase body weight and lean muscle mass without increasing fat mass in the body. The potential side effects of anabolic steroid abuse are significant, and health care providers should be aware of patients at risk of anabolic-androgenic steroid misuse. This activity describes the evaluation and management of anabolic steroid use disorder and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the at-risk patient populations for anabolic steroid use disorder.
- Review the legitimate medical uses for anabolic steroid therapy.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for patients exhibiting signs of anabolic steroid misuse disorder.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients presenting with anabolic steroid misuse disorder.

# Introduction

The term "anabolic" means the use of body energy to promote growth and regulate constructive metabolism. Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) are steroidal androgens, which include natural androgens such as male sex hormone testosterone or could be synthetic to mimic the action of the endogenous male hormone. Androgen use has become a major public health concern due to the transition of the use of androgens from strictly sports to a much wider spectrum of the population. The lifetime prevalence of anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) use worldwide is estimated to be 1% to 5%

Androgens stimulate and precipitate the development of male sex characteristics. Anabolic steroids and androgens are medically prescribed (orally or injectable) to treat hormonal imbalance for hypogonadism, impotence in men, delayed puberty in adolescent boys. For women, they can be used to treat breast cancer, endometriosis, osteoporosis, and muscle loss in patients with cancer or HIV. Misuse or abuse is commonly seen in athletes to enhance performance and prolong endurance. Non-athletes misuse anabolic steroids to increase their body weight and lean muscle mass without increasing the body's fat mass.

# Etiology

Approximately 3 to 4 million Americans used anabolic-androgenic steroids to increase muscle mass, whether for sports to increase their performance or cosmetic purposes, such as enhancing their appearance. People who have misused steroids may be suffering from muscle dysmorphia, which is a behavioral syndrome. AAS are frequently used by fighters, bouncers, and security personnel to enhance their appearance and job performance. The popular term used for the anabolic steroids is “steroids,” and other common names are "roids," "juice," "andro," "gear," and "stackers."

# Epidemiology

The prevalence of AAS abuse has steadily increased over the last two decades.

# Pathophysiology

Among AAS users, about 30% develop dependence, which is characterized by chronic AAS use despite negative consequences and adverse effects on physical, psychosocial, or occupational functioning.

Hypogonadism is a hallmark of AAS abuse, which may have profound effects on the reproductive system. The majority of AAS users found to have low gonadotropin and testosterone levels even after the discontinuation of AAS.

Cardiovascular risk of AAS includes myocardial dysfunction, coronary atherosclerosis****et al, there is increased aggression, violent behaviors, and a 9 fold increased risk of crime and imprisonment in people with AAS abuse.

# History and Physical

A comprehensive history and physical examination are needed to diagnose AAS abuse. The clinician may suspect AAS abuse in the following situations:

- Child or adolescent who is experiencing early development of secondary sexual characteristics, decrease in height, and premature closure of epiphyses

- Females experiencing temporal hair recession, hirsutism, acne, irregular menses, breast atrophy, deepening of the voice (irreversible), clitoromegaly, decrease in total body fat and increase in muscle mass

- Males exhibiting rapid increased in muscle mass and strength and experiencing changes such as gynecomastia, small testes, low sperm count, impotence, and acne

# Evaluation

Exogenous administration of androgens should be suspected in a patient who is in a competitive sport or activity, who demonstrates behavioral changes such as aggression, depression, or irritability, or with blood work changes such as deficient luteinizing hormone (LH) concentration, high hematocrit, and low sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).

# Treatment / Management

According to the current evidence, the most effective treatment for AAS is the discontinuation of AAS use, treatment of withdrawal symptoms, a combination of behavioral therapy, and symptomatic treatments. Treatment of AAS is based on the duration of use, the likelihood of withdrawal symptoms, treatment goals of the patient, and risk-benefit analysis of the treatments. Anawalt(2019) discusses four management strategies for AAS;1. Cessation with no medical therapy; 2. Cessation and initiation of clomiphene therapy; 3. Cessation and initiation of hCG therapy; 4. Conversion of nonprescription AASs to prescription testosterone

In AAS users with less than one year of use, testosterone levels normalize to baseline within 6 months of discontinuation

# Differential Diagnosis

Clinicians should investigate the use of anabolic-androgenic steroids in middle-aged males and young men who present with gynecomastia, hirsutism, coronary artery disease (CAD) and left ventricular dysfunction.

# Toxicity and Adverse Effect Management

The common side effects of androgens include gynecomastia, shrinking of testicles, azoospermia, and infertility in men

# Prognosis

Like with any substance with addictive potential, abrupt cessation of the AAS use leads to withdrawal symptoms including anxiety and depression.

# Complications

- Androgen use complications include cardiac hypertrophy, decreased serum HDL cholesterol, hypogonadism after discontinuing exogenous androgens, and neuropsychiatric concerns.

- In a survey of 10000 to 15000 college students, the use of androgens correlated highly with drinking and driving, cigarette smoking, illicit drug use, and alcohol misuse.

- Anabolic steroids are completely prohibited in sports, whether in- or out-of-competition. The following organizations prohibit anabolic steroids intake: National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), International Olympic Committee (IOC), U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), and World Anti-Doping Agency (WAD).

# Deterrence and Patient Education

The potential side effects of anabolic steroid misuse are significant and chronic. Health care providers should be aware of patients at risk of anabolic-androgenic steroid misuse. Ongoing patient education about the potential side effects should be provided for patients who take androgens for therapeutic use. Timely identification of the anabolic steroid abuse and appropriate referral for treatment is highly warranted.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Clinicians should target treating depression, body-image, and dysmorphia and associated detrimental behavioral patterns in groups at risk of anabolic-androgenic steroid misuse.
