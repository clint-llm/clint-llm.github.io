Oral

Methylxanthines are available as tablets, extended-release tablets, and an oral solution. When administered orally, the drug is absorbed rapidly. However, broadly fluctuating plasma drug concentrations are a well-documented disadvantage to this route of administration. Despite the development of extended-release formulations, variability in plasma drug levels has led oral administration of methylxanthines to fall out of favor clinically.

IV

Intravenous administration of methylxanthines yields a more consistent plasma drug concentration than does oral administration. IV methylxanthines are indicated for the termination of acute bronchospasm secondary to asthma or COPD exacerbation; however, inhaled beta-2-agonists (such as albuterol) are more effective treatments. The drug is administered as a loading dose followed by a constant maintenance infusion with a goal therapeutic range of 10-15mcg/ml. Dosage must be adjusted if the individual has taken a methylxanthine dose within the past 24 hours, is a smoker, or has renal or hepatic impairment.

Other

Other routes of administration include inhalation and intramuscular injection. Inhalation has poor bioavailability and is typically not well tolerated. Intramuscular injection is painful and not recommended.
