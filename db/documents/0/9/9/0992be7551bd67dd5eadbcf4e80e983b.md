According to the 2015, National Survey on Drug Use and Health conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, an estimated 20.8 million Americans age 12 and older had a substance use disorder, of which 15.7 million were alcohol use disorders.  Of those, 2.7 million had an illicit drug use disorder as well.  This number makes alcohol the leading substance abused in the United States.  Of the people with alcohol use disorder and illicit drug disorder, 623,000 were adolescents ages 12 to 17 (2.5% of all adolescents). Almost four million (3.8 million) individuals ages 18 to 25 (10.9% of young adults) and 11.3 million individuals 26 years or older (5.4%) had both an alcohol use disorder and substance use disorder. However, this number has been steadily declining since 2002. Almost half of the people with any substance abuse problem, including alcohol, also had a co-existing mental illness.

Overall, alcohol use disorder tends to be more common in individuals with less education and low income.

Globally, alcohol use disorder affects 240 million people, mostly in Europe and the Americas.
