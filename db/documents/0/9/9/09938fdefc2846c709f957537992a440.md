Ingesting diluted sodium hypochlorite generally causes only mild stomach irritation; however, swallowing larger amounts can cause more serious symptoms, including chest pain, delirium, hypotension, burns to the gastrointestinal tract, shock, bradycardia, nausea, and vomiting.

It is important never to mix ammonia with sodium hypochlorite (bleach or bleach-containing products). This mixture can produce toxic chlorine gas that can cause choking and serious breathing problems. HCl is formed when chlorine gas contacts moist tissues like the eyes or lungs. HCl is a digestive juice that damages tissue; it can damage the airways, cause asphyxiation, and result in death.

It is important to note that activated charcoal does not effectively treat (adsorb) sodium hypochlorite. Treatment will depend on the severity of the toxicity with medical management for mild-moderate cases of toxicity to surgery if there are perforations noted along the gastrointestinal tract.
