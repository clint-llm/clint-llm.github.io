The caregiver and/or parents of a child are an essential part of the management team. They are educated about the signs and symptoms of feeding difficulty, such as vomiting, gagging, regurgitation, and proper positioning techniques. The caregivers are educated on appropriate feeding skills. Additionally, signs of aspiration and sudden shortness of breath are explained, and the caregiver is advised to bring the child to the emergency department when the child experiences these symptoms. The caregiver is informed about the probable causes and the possible treatment options. They are counseled to cope with the stress they suffer during the course of treatment.
