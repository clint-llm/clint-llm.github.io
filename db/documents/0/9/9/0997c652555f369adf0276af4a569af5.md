Metronidazole comes with a black box warning that it may be carcinogenic based on some animal studies in mice and rats. However, the risks are considered low, and additional follow-up studies of patients treated do not reveal an increased cancer incidence. As with any medication choice, physicians and patients must decide whether the benefit from therapy outweighs the potential risk. The use of metronidazole should be reserved for conditions approved by the FDA; it should not be used prophylactically or unnecessarily.

Additional warnings and precautions for metronidazole exist. Prolonged drug courses can cause severe neurological disturbances due to the risk of cumulative neurotoxicity. Monitor for neurologic sequela and discontinue therapy if any abnormal neurologic symptoms occur.C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis. There are reports of CDAD even after more than two months of postantibiotic treatment. Candidiasis infection may also be more prominent during metronidazole treatment.
