Subdiaphgramatic abscessesÂ can happen as a consequence of another condition such as cholecystitis, diverticulitis, or appendicitis. Risk factors include recent surgery, diabetes, and/or inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with these risk factors should be educated to monitor for symptoms of a subphrenic abscess, including fever, pain in the abdomen, chest or shoulder pain, and anorexia. Patient outcomes depend on the cause of the infection and how quickly treatment is sought, so patients should be instructed to seek care immediately if these symptoms develop, especially after recent intraabdominal surgery.
