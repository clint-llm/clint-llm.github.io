Weight loss can be achieved through several different strategies. Most people starting a weight loss plan experience rapid weight loss initially. However, they often reach a period where they experience a plateau, and their weight loss appears stagnant. This activity describes the physiology of what happens during a weight loss plateau and strategies to overcome this phenomenon.

**Objectives:**
- Review the physiology of weight loss.
- Identify different weight loss strategies.
- Explain how and why weight loss plateaus occur.
- Describe strategies used by interprofessional to overcome weight loss plateaus.
