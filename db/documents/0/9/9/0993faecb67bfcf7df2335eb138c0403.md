Toxic shock syndrome is a life-threatening disorder which carries a very high mortality. While the mortality rates have decreased over the past 2 decades, they still vary from 1.8-12%. For those patients who are misdiagnosed or the treatment is delayed, the mortality can exceed 50%. For this reason, healthcare workers should be aware of the disorder and even if they do not manage it, should be able to make a prompt referral. The key in the management of TSS is prevention. The patient needs to be educated on the early signs and symptoms of the disorder and when to seek medical care. In some cases, chemoprophylaxis of household contacts of the patient is recommended. The moment TSS is suspected, even during triage to the emergency department, an infectious disease consultant must be called right away. Early surgical consultation in order to identify and manage source control is also critical to improving patient outcomes, as the most common source is a soft tissue infection or wound. These patients need rapid resuscitation and admission to the ICU. Only with aggressive treatment can the high mortality rates be prevented.
