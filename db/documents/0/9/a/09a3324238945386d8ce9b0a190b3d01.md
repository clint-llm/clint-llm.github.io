Methylxanthines have a narrow therapeutic range and, therefore, a high incidence of adverse effects. More mild adverse effects typically occur when serum drug concentrations are below 20 mcg/ml and may include nausea, vomiting, increased gastric acid secretion (and subsequent gastroesophageal reflux), polyuria, insomnia, palpitations, headaches, and tremors. Many of these mirror effects seen with excess caffeine. Generally, with serum concentrationsÂ that exceed 20 mcg/ml, severe effects include intractable vomiting, arrhythmias, irregular heartbeat (slow or fast), cardiac arrest, allergic skin reactions, or seizures.

It is because of this dose-related appearance of adverse effects that dosing is administered at the lowest possible rate to begin and titrated up until achieving a therapeutic effect.
