The primary therapy for symptomatic amebiasis requires hydration and the use of metronidazole and/or tinidazole. These two agents are dosed as follows:

- Metronidazole dosing for adults is 500 mg orally every 6 to 8 hours for 7 to 14 days.

- Tinidazole adult dosing is 2 g orally each day for 3 days.

Luminal agents such as paromomycin and diloxanide furoate are also used. An amoebic liver abscess can be managed by aspiration using CT guidance in combination with metronidazole. Surgery is sometimes required to treat massive gastrointestinal bleeding, toxic megacolon, perforated colon, or liver abscesses not amenable to percutaneous drainage.
