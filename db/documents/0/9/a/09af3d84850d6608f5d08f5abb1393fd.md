Asymptomatic individuals without hemolysis do not require treatment and follow up. It is of utmost importance that the patient is educated about the nature of the disease, and documentation of the disease in the patient's record has been done to prevent unnecessary testing.

Individuals with intermittent hemolysis or anemia may require blood transfusions when the patient is either symptomatic, or the hemoglobin level drops below the threshold required for their age.

Splenectomy is reserved for the patient with severe anemia that is life-threatening or severe anemia that requires regular blood transfusions. Since splenectomy is associated with increased risk of infection with encapsulated organisms, vaccination against pneumococcus, meningococcus, and Haemophilus influenza is required prior to the surgery.
