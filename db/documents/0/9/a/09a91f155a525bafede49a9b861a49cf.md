Monitoring the flap for signs of failure is critical in the first two weeks of healing, but even more so during the first 72 hours, during which the anastomosed vessels are re-epithelializing. Signs of flap failure include a dusky or pale color, a cool temperature (unless the flap is intraoral), the rigidity of the soft tissue due to edema, either very rapid or absent capillary refill of the skin paddle, either very rapid return of dark blood or no return of blood at all when pricked with a lancet, and absent Doppler signals. Often, loss of the Doppler signal is the last sign of a flap failure, because venous congestion accounts for 80% to 90% of flap failures, and the arterial signal may not disappear until very late in the process. In the case of vascular failure, rapid return to the operating room for revision of the anastomoses is critical.
