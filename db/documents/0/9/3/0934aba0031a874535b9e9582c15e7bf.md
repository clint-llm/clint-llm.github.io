Patients with aniridic fibrosis syndrome will likely have decreased baseline best-corrected visual acuity. However, the presenting complaint has been recorded as an additional decrease in their visual ability. On ocular examination, a fibrous membrane may be observed to grow from the remnants of the patientâ€™s iris. As patients are accustomed to poor visual acuity, they may delay making an appointment with their physician. With time, the membrane may grow to affect the IOL, ciliary body, and retina; and may become more evident on examination. In addition, patients with aniridic fibrosis syndrome may present with endothelial decompensation.
