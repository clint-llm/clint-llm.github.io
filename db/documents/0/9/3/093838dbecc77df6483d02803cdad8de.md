Xerostomia is a clinical diagnosis primarily based on history and physical examination. It is estimated that salivary secretion needs to be decreased by half before xerostomia is evident.

If needed, there are numerous techniques employed to evaluate hyposalivation, such as:

- **Sialometry:**The normal stimulated salivary flow rate is between 1.5 to 2.0 mL/min, while the unstimulated flow rate ranges from 0.3 to 0.4 mL/min.

- **Sialography:**An imaging technique that can be used to identify salivary stones or masses.

- **Biopsy:**If a systemic cause such as sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, or a salivary mass is suspected, a biopsy of a salivary gland may be necessary. Further management then depends on biopsy results.

In secondary Sjögren syndrome, patients exhibit further signs and symptoms of an autoimmune or connective tissue disease such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus.
