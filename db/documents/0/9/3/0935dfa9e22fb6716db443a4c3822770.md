Arginase, commonly found in the liver, erythrocytes, and salivary glands, catalyzes the fifth and last reaction of the urea cycle, hydrolyzing L-arginine into ornithine and urea.

Its deficiency or absence causes accumulation of arginine, reversibly translating into ammonia overproduction at different levels and expressions after 1 to 3 years of life, although a few cases have been reported in early infancy.

Orotic acid accumulation can be found, given that reduction of ornithine impairs ornithine transcarbamylase activity, creating a backup or overflow of carbamyl phosphate, which is subsequently shunted to the pyrimidine synthetic path.
