Patients with DISH can be asymptomatic, so the disease is discovered incidentally. Neuropathy or bony overgrowth causing physical impingement can cause pain.

The traditional diagnostic criteria for DISH had previously included three major elements

- Presence vertebral flowing ossifications present at a minimum of four contiguous vertebrae

- Preservation of disc height and lack of significant degenerative changes at the involved vertebral segments

- Differentiates DISH from degenerative spondylosis

- The absence of ankylosis at the facet-joint interface and absence of sacroiliac joint erosion, sclerosis, or fusion

- Differentiates DISH from ankylosing spondylitis (AS)

The current widespread definition of DISH by Resnick and Niwayama has recently been challenged as these inclusion criteria may be best applied to the more advanced stages of the condition.  Moreover, even dating back to 1985, Utsinger had challenged the contemporary definition and advocated to lower the threshold for spinal involvement to two contiguous while incorporating the presence of peripheral enthesopathies.

There have been recent challenges to the validity and consensus agreement regarding the current and evolving level of support behind these specific criteria.  A 2013 Delphi exercise found that consensus agreement and definitive literature support may only be available for the following elements:

- Presence of exuberant new bone formation (in the locations as mentioned above)

- Enlarged bony bridges present in either the C-spine, T-spine, or L-spine

**Differentiating DISH from AS**

Healthcare providers often are inevitably confused regarding the clinical differentiation in discerning a diagnosis of DISH as opposed to AS.  In short, the main distinguishing features of DISH compared with AS can be summarized into the following elements

- Higher age of presentation favoring DISH over AS

- The absence of sacroiliac (SI) joint erosions favoring DISH over AS

- Important to recognize the clinical overlap for milder conditions of SI joint pathology.  For example, there are reports of SI osteophytes in patients with DISH

- The absence of apophyseal joint obliteration favoring DISH over AS

- Frequent ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL)

- Absent enthesopathies with erosions favoring DISH over AS

- No association with HLA-B27 favoring DISH over AS

- DISH, compared to AS, tends to be a relatively mild or even painless disease

- The clinical symptoms are mild in comparison to the extensive radiographic or advanced imaging modalities
- DISH is often discovered incidentally in asymptomatic patients

Aside from the current controversial and debated diagnostic criteria, the classic clinical presentation remains that of an older patient with increasing back pain and stiffness. Soft tissue involvement secondary to osteophytes at the cervical segments may result in dysphagia, hoarseness, sleep apnea, and difficult intubation.

Peripheral joint involvement in DISH has some distinctive features

- involvement of joints usually unaffected by primary osteoarthritis (OA - e.g., hip and knee)

- Foot and ankle involvement has been reported in up to 70% of patients

- Clinical and radiographic findings are often consistent with heel spurs, Achilles tendinitis, and plantar fasciitis

- Increased hypertrophic changes compared with primary OA

- Prominent enthesopathies adjacent to peripheral joints

- Calcification and ossification of entheses in sites other than the joints

Peripheral findings often include hyperostosis and tendonitis.
