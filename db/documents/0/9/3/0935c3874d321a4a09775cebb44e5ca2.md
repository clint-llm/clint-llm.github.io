Approximately 20% of all labors involve protraction and/or arrest disorders.  Disorders of labor are the most common reason for primary intrapartum cesarean sections.

Abnormal labor involving true labor dystocia can result in fetal and/or maternal injury and even death. The trend toward more cesarean sections in developed countries has drawn attention to initiatives to minimize primary cesarean sections. In this regard, guidelines have been developed to implement more conservative management of the first and second stages of labor abnormalities (Obstetric care consensus: safe prevention of the primary cesarean delivery-ACOG and SMFM, March 2014).

After the delivery of the baby, the third stage of labor involves the delivery of the placenta. This opens the risk for postpartum hemorrhage leading to blood transfusions and resulting in maternal morbidity and mortality. Postpartum hemorrhage affects approximately 5% of all deliveries. The mean duration of the third stage of labor is 5-6 minutes when utilizing active management of the third stage of labor. Ninety percent of labor's third stages take less than 10 minutes. Postpartum hemorrhage is more likely when the third stage lasts more than 18 minutes and significantly more likely when the third stage lasts over thirty minutes.
