RVF formation results as a complication of an underlying disease, injury, or surgical event.

Obstetric-related injury: This is the most common etiology of traumatic RVF, and probably for all RVFs.

Surgical procedure: Surgical interventions that cause unrecognized vaginal or rectal injury, insufficient tissue thickness between the two organs, or ischemia of the tissue may result in perforation and fistula formation through the damaged tissue.

Diverticular disease: Complex diverticular disease is a common cause of fistula connecting to an intra-abdominal organ like the bladder and vagina.

Crohn's disease: Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, especially Crohn's disease, is a well-known cause of intestinal fistulization.

Malignancy: Cancer of the intestine or adjacent organs is a known cause of bowel perforation and fistulization. RVF can result from vaginal, cervical, or, more commonly, rectal cancer that involves the entire wall thickness and extends to the adjacent vagina. These fistulae are also called malignant fistulae.

Radiation

Non-surgical injuries and foreign bodies: Injuries in trauma or a foreign body can result in a non-healing abnormal connection with the vagina.

There are several causes that are abbreviated in the mnemonic "FRIEND" (Foreign body, Radiation, Inflammation, Epithelization, Neoplasm, Distal obstruction). These are known causes of non-healing in fistulous diseases. They should not be mixed with the primary or underlying causes of fistula formation.
