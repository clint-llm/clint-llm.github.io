Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a primary brain malignancy with a poor prognosis. No specific risk factors are identified. Diagnosis is by imaging like CT/MRI. The standard of treatment is maximal surgical resection followed by chemoradiotherapy. A high index of suspicion can lead to early diagnosis. Clarification of patients' goals of care is important as soon as the diagnosis is made given poor prognosis even with complete treatment. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and treatment of glioblastoma multiforme.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of glioblastoma multiforme.
- Summarize the evaluation of glioblastoma multiforme.

- Outline the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme.
