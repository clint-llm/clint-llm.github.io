The degree of hand stiffness is proportional to the severity of the initial injury.

Early and appropriate management of hand trauma can reduce the extent of resultant stiffness. Non-operative outcomes depend on patient adherence to splinting and physiotherapy. It has been reported that 87% of stiff hand joints respond successfully to exercise and dynamic splinting, avoiding the need for surgical intervention.
