Although classically described as a self-limiting condition lasting about 7 to 14 days, recent studies have shown an association with carotid artery thrombosis and neurological events.

If the diagnosis is confused with giant cell temporarily arteritis, patients might be subjected to a temporal artery biopsy, and experience possible biopsy related complications. Patients might also report anxiety at prolonged, expensive testing and lack of a definitive diagnosis. It is therefore recommended to accept carotidynia as a clinical entity so that patients can avoid the hazards of unnecessary testing.
