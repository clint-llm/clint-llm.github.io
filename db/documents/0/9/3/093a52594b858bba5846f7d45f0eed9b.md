Acute scrotum pain is an umbrella term that includes a wide variety of unique disease processes. Patients may describe the rapid onset of symptoms within minutes or may describe the development of symptoms over one or two days, depending on the etiology. Rapid evaluation and treatment are necessary due to the time dependency of certain morbid but reversible conditions, such as acute testicular torsion. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of acute scrotum pain and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients affected by it.
