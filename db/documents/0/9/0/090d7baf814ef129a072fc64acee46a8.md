Indications for testing include evaluating symptoms clinically suggestive of asthma and response to therapy. It is important to note that although the test is highly sensitive, the positive predictive value has limitations due to the high incidence of false positives results seen in several other conditions, including allergic rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and cystic fibrosis. This situation renders the test more useful in terms of exclusion due to high negative predictive value when presenting with clinical symptoms suggestive of asthma, such as in patients with vocal cord dysfunction, central airway obstruction due to tumors or polyps, and certain cases of occupational exposure.
