A greenstick fracture is a partial thickness fracture where only the cortex and periosteum are interrupted on one side of the bone while they remain uninterrupted on the other side. Greenstick fractures occur most commonly after a fall on an outstretched arm (FOOSH); however, they can also occur due to other types of trauma, including motor vehicle collisions, sports injuries, or non-accidental trauma where the child is hit with an object. Malnutrition, specifically vitamin-D deficiency, increases the risk of greenstick fractures of the long bones after a trauma. This activity reviews the evaluation, management, and pathophysiology of greenstick fractures and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of greenstick fractures.
- Review the X-ray features of a greenstick fracture.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for greenstick fracture.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and care delivery to advance the management of greenstick fractures and improve patient outcomes.
