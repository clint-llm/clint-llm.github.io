Healthcare is a high-stakes industry that is prone to crises; this is especially true for acute care specialties such as anesthesiology and emergency medicine, in which healthcare practitioners must treat critically ill patients while facing diagnostic ambiguity, resource limitations, and numerous disruptions in chaotic work environments. To deliver safe and effective patient care, medical professionals must execute highly coordinated team-based strategies. Crisis resource management (CRM) refers to a set of principles dealing with cognitive and interpersonal behaviors that contribute to optimal team performance.

Crisis resource management has its origins in the aviation industry. In the 1970s, the National Transportation Safety Board found that human error contributed to over 70% of aviation accidents.

In healthcare, anesthesiology was the first specialty to incorporate CRM principles into the training of its clinicians. In the late 1980s, David Gaba and his colleagues recognized that, like aviation, traditional training in anesthesiology focused on the technical aspects of patient management and not on the behavioral aspects of team performance.

Following their success in aviation and anesthesiology, simulation-based CRM training programs were soon developed in other high-risk, high-acuity medical specialties, including emergency medicine,
