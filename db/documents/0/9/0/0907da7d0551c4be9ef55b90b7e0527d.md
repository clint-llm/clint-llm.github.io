- Eosinophilic granuloma (EG) is a benign disorder of the bone.

- An asymptomatic solitary lesion may resolve spontaneously and require no treatment, however, there is a risk of developing additional bone lesions within 6 months to 2 years. Thus, regular follow up with a complete skeletal survey is required.

- Children with multiple bone lesions should be evaluated for systemic involvement.

- There is an increased incidence of thyroid disease in the family members of a patient with EG.
