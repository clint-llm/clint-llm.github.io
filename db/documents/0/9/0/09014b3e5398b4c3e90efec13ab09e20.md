Most complications are rare. Patients typically improve rapidly with treatment and do not require any follow-up. Most can be discharged home. Those with severe bronchospasm, evidence of shock, or arrhythmias may warrant observation for up to 24 hours. Most patients, even with severe symptoms, improve rapidly with the administration of antihistamines within hours of treatment and can be discharged home.
