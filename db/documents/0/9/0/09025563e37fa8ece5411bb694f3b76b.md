Ohm law is used in every electrical device to apply the correct amount of charge given the resistance. While clinicians will not need to readily calculate voltage, current, and resistance for these devices, understanding the relationship can provide intuition into how electrical devices work. Ohm law is also present within the human body and has multiple applications. For example, nerves within the nervous system use electrical properties to relay messages to one another. These electrical signals can be mapped with sensors and be better understood by clinicians. Gao et al. and Su et al. have studied the electrical properties of bones and have progressed the treatment of bone ailments. The human body contains many electrical pathways and processes. By understanding the fundamental governing equation, clinicians can work to resolve issues in new ways.
