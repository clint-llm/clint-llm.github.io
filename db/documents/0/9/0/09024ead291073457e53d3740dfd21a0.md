The initial treatment primarily is to maintain a patent airway and maintain adequate ventilation through assisted or controlled ventilation.

Naloxone is a competitive antagonist of the mu, kappa, and sigma receptor that tramadol and other opioids bind to, with the highest affinity for the mu receptor. It is available in oral or IV formulations. The oral form has low bioavailability compared to the other formulations. The half-life of naloxone is shorter than tramadol, so repeat doses may be necessary. Although this drug may be used toÂ decrease respiratory and central nervous system depression, it may increase the risk for seizures.
