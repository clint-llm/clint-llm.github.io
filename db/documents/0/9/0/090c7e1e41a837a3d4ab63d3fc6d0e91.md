The etiology of early-onset neonatal sepsis is predominantly caused by Group Beta Streptococcal (GBS) infection followed by Escherichia coli.  Risk factors are maternal Group B streptococcal colonization, chorioamnionitis, premature or prolonged (greater than 18 hours) rupture of membranes, and preterm birth (less than 37 weeks).

The etiology of late-onset neonatal sepsis includes pathogens such as Group B strep, E. coli, Coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterococci (more common in preterm infants), Pseudomonas, and Candida albicans. Risk factors for late-onset neonatal sepsis are prematurity, low birth weight, prolonged indwelling catheter use, invasive procedures, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and prolonged antibiotic usage.
