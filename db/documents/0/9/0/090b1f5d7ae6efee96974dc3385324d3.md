Many perioperative complications may arise during ophthalmic surgeries. The retrobulbar block has the highest incidence of adverse events associated with damage to anatomical structures compared to peribulbar and sub-Tenon blocks.

Complications for peribulbar blocks are less severe and are less common. This is the main reason that peribulbar blocks are becoming exceptionally popular. The main complication from a peribulbar block is temporary swelling of the conjunctiva, which is attributed to the accumulation of local anesthetics since larger volumes are used for anesthesia within the confined space of the orbit. Similarly, a sub-Tenon block has lower rates of complications because anesthesia can be achieved without using a sharp needle. This block would be a reasonable approach in patients who are on anticoagulation therapy or have a greater axial length of the eye, as using a sharper needle may cause complications. It is important to note that inadvertent intravascular injection can occur in all of these nerve blocks and can result in systemic toxicity due to local anesthetic.

Another feared complication that may result in hemodynamic compromise is a result of the oculocardiac reflex. The afferent for this reflex is the trigeminal nerve, and the efferent is the vagus nerve. The risk factors for this reflex include traction on ocular muscles (especially the medial rectus), pressure on the globe, ocular pain, and manipulation of the eye.
