The treatment goals for alcohol withdrawal are to control agitation, decrease the risk of seizures, and decrease morbidity and mortality. The most common and validated treatment for alcohol withdrawal is benzodiazepine. There are several benzodiazepines which can be used, ranging from lorazepam (Ativan), diazepam (Valium), to chlordiazepoxide (Librium), preferably administered via an intravenous route. This can be administered either based on a symptom-triggered regimen or fixed schedule. In a symptom-triggered regimen, medications are usually given when symptoms are present, at times using CIWA score greater than 8. In a fixed schedule regimen, the benzodiazepine is administered at fixed intervals, and additional doses are given based on the withdrawal symptoms.

Based on numerous trials, symptom triggered regimens have been shown to require less medication with a smaller duration of treatment. There is no clear consensus on the dosages of benzodiazepine, and this may variably change drastically from one patient to another. Those with substantial dosing requirements warrant intensive care unit monitoring, especially if there are associated comorbid conditions. In those patients, severe DT unresponsive to benzodiazepine, barbiturates such as phenobarbital in conjunction with benzodiazepine can be effective. Another alternative is the use of propofol in conjunction with benzodiazepine; this would, however, require mechanical ventilation.

Although there are studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of central-acting, alpha-2 agonists such as clonidine and dexmedetomidine, these agents should not be used alone and as the primary treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Dexmedetomidine has been shown to work in conjunction benzodiazepine with doses up to 0.7 micrograms per kilogram per hour without requiring mechanical ventilation. It is also recommended to avoid using alcohol, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, and baclofen for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal as there are not enough studies to support the safety of these medications.
