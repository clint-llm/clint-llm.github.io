The value of monitoring lamotrigine concentrations remains unestablished to date. Due to the pharmacokinetics between lamotrigine and other drugs and their effect on lamotrigine concentration, clinical judgment must be exercised during concomitant use if there are concerns regarding lamotrigine levels. Dofetilide can have a severe interaction with lamotrigine, and the combination is strongly discouraged. Other drugs with potential serious interactions include valproic acid, rifampin, estrogen-containing contraceptives, and estrogen replacement therapy medications, as well as certain barbiturates.

Labs should include pertinent serum levels of concurrent anticonvulsants, liver function testing, and renal function assessments. Clinical team staff should spend ample time educating patients on monitoring themselves for hypersensitivity, particularly rashes or other skin changes occurring near or on the mucosa. Patient education should also include discussing how to monitor for changes in seizures and their frequency and duration. Patients should also monitor for changes in suicidality, including suicidal thoughts and increased desire to commit suicide. Finally, patients shouldÂ receive counsel on how to watch for signs/symptoms of aseptic meningitis.
