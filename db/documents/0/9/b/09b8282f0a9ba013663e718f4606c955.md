IEA usually starts with an exogenous port of entry, either the paranasal sinuses or ears. Streptococci (usually anaerobe forms like Peptostreptococcus) and other anaerobes such as Cutibacterium (formerly Propionibacterium, part of the skin flora) are usual organisms. Gram-negative bacilli or fungi can also be a cause. They usually originate in the sinuses.

IEA can be a complication of neurosurgery, with the most likely organisms being staphylococci, especially Staphylococcus aureus, and gram-negative bacteria. Infection can also spread inward from osteomyelitis of the skull or fetal monitoring probes applied to the skull during birth.

Bacterial SEA make-up the major cause of this entity. Tuberculous, fungal, and parasitic abscesses of the spinal epidural space typically evolve more insidiously than pyogenic bacterial ones. Other than candida infections, these etiologies are more frequently encountered in tropical and subtropical resource-constrained regions of the world.
