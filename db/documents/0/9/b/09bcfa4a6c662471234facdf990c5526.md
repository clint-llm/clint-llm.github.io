The most common cardiac complication of PVE is heart failure. This can result from prosthetic valve dehiscence, which leads to valvular insufficiency, or myocardial infarction from emboli.

Non-cardiac complications are usually a result of an embolic event, metastatic abscess formation, or a mycotic aneurysm.

Neurologic complications are stroke (due to an embolus), seizure (abscess or emboli), brain abscess formation, aseptic meningitis, acute encephalopathy, cerebral hemorrhage due to ruptured mycotic aneurysm, or meningoencephalitis.

Renal complications are renal infarction due to emboli, renal abscess, glomerulonephritis (as a result of immunoglobulins and complement deposition in the glomerular membrane), and acute interstitial nephritis. All these complications may present as acute renal failure.

Pulmonary complications occur due to right heart PVE; vegetations of the tricuspid or pulmonary valve can lead to embolization, which results in lung abscess, pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.

Other complications are osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, persistent bacteremia, or candidemia in fungal PVE.

Mortality remains a serious concern after PVE, despite appropriate treatment and surgical interventions.
