The etiology and pathogenesis of granuloma annulare are largely unknown. However, the disease has been associated with diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, mild trauma, hyperlipidemia, infections (Ebstein-Barr Virus, human immunodeficiency virus, varicella-zoster virus, tuberculosis), vaccines, malignancy, and certain drugs (TNF-alpha inhibitors). Despite the classic association with diabetes, the evidence is lacking to support a true association with diabetes. Experts believe that a clinician should screen for malignancy in a patient with granuloma annulare under the following circumstances: older age, atypical or widespread presentation, and recalcitrant disease. However, more evidence is needed to establish a true correlation between granuloma annulare and malignancy. StudiesÂ suggest that HIV patients are more likely to have generalized granuloma annulare. There are also reports of highly atypical presentations of granuloma annulare in patients with HIV. Antiretroviral drugs have been found to both improve and exacerbate HIV. Patients with new-onset granuloma annulare who have risk factors for HIV should be screened for HIV. Also, patients with the generalized type or perforating type of granuloma annulare should be screened for HIV.
