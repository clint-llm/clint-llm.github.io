Early exposure to ALS patients during EMS training has been identified as a strategy utilized among highly effective EMS training programs, however, a barrier to training then, is the infrequency of exposure to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or other events such as mass-casualty incidents even among working medics.

Recent events have also demonstrated simulation as an effective means to coordinate the responses of various agencies during a mass casualty incident (MCI). This specialized kind of simulation training was touted as one of the reasons for an integrated local response to the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando in 2016, and it is likely to be used more heavily in future EMS training programs.

A survey of 389 paramedic programs found all programs have access to some kind of simulation tool (and very often to a wide variety of such tools), meaning simulation is universally available in EMS education. Unfortunately, despite this availability, several barriers prevent the appropriate use of the resources at hand. In approximately one-third of surveyed EMS programs, some portion of available simulation tools were found to sit idly without regular use, most commonly because of a lack of educator familiarity and training in the use of these tools. In programs using advanced mannequins, 19% of teaching faculty had no formal training with the equipment. Addressing this neglect may lead to improved efficacy of simulation training down the road.
