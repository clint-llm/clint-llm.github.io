Coronoid fractures are almost always traumatic; therefore, those participating in sporting events, high-velocity activity, and other riskier behaviors are at risk to sustain this injury.Â  Motor vehicle accidents are the most common cause of proximal ulna fractures.

Coronoid fractures account for approximately 10 to 15% of fractures about the elbow.
