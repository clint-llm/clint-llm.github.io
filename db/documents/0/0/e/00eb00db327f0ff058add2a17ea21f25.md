Progestins, or progestogens, are a class of synthetic hormone drugs that mimic progesterone's endogenous hormone. These drugs each act on the progesterone receptor, and however, they have their own specific effects and are grouped based on generational class or their structural derivation. Progestins are used as medications in managing a variety of conditions, including contraception and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT), among others. This article reviews the mechanism of action, indications, contraindications, adverse events, and other key elements of progestin therapy in the clinical setting to benefit the healthcare team members managing the care of patients for which progestin may be of benefit.
