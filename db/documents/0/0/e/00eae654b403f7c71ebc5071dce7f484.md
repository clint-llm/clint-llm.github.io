Upon identifying the cause of myofascial pain, it is necessary to explain to the patient the relevant pathophysiology and the ways of improving the quality of life. For example, if the patient is anxious at work or during daily activities, they require strategies to relax, perhaps with deep breathing or the learning of other relaxation techniques with the help of a psychologist. If the pain is from a poor diet, it is necessary to teach the patient to consume a more balanced diet. If repetitive movements cause pain, encourage the patient to perform physical activity, including stretching. Sleep disorders may lead to increased muscle tension, resulting in the formation of TPs. In this case, it is necessary to adopt strategies to improve the quality of sleep.
