Care of a patient with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis requires supportive care

- Cessation of the suspected causative drug(s)

- Hospital admission: preferably to an intensive care and/or burn unit

- Fluid replacement (crystalloid)

- Nutritional assessment: may require nasogastric tube feeding

- Temperature control: warm environment, emergency blanket

- Pain relief

- Supplemental oxygen and, in some cases, intubation with mechanical ventilation

- Sterile/aseptic handling

Skincare requires daily examination of skin and mucosal surfaces for infection, non-adherent dressings, and avoidance of trauma to the skin. Mucosal surfaces require careful cleansing and topical anesthetics.

- Gentle removal of necrotic skin/mucosal tissue

- Culture of skin lesions, axillae, and groins every two days

Antibiotics may be required for secondary infection but are best avoided prophylactically.

It is unknown whether systemic corticosteroids are beneficial, but they are often prescribed in high doses for the first three to five days of admission. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) may be of benefit in patients with severe neutropenia.

Other drugs reported effective include systemic corticosteroids, ciclosporin, TNF-alpha inhibitors
