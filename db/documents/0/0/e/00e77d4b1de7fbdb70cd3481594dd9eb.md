The differential diagnosis of a distal femur fracture is rarely a problem. The identification of an acute deformity on a plain radiograph in the setting of trauma is rarely a challenge.Â  In the context of chronic knee pain in a young athlete, a patient with limited verbal communication, or the setting of severe trauma, the timing of diagnosis may be the challenge. Similarly, the clinician should systematically approach repeated surveys of trauma patients after the stabilization of life-challenging issues.
