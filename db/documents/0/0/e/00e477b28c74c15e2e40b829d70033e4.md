The precise cause of varicoceles is not known, but it is thought to develop from a backup of venous blood flow in the internal spermatic vein that causes venous engorgement which is clinically detectable on scrotal examination.

Varicoceles are far more common (80% to 90%) in the left testicle. If a left varicocele is identified, there is a 30% to 40% probability it is a bilateral condition.

There are three theories as to the anatomical cause:

- The "Nutcracker" effect occurs when the left internal spermatic vein gets caught between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta. This entrapment causes venous compression and spermatic vein obstruction.

- Failure of the anti-reflux valve where the internal spermatic vein joins the left renal vein. This failure causes reflux and retrograde flow in the testicular vein.

- Angulation at the juncture of the left internal spermatic vein and the left renal vein.

Rare causes of varicoceles include deep vein thrombosis, renal arteriovenous malformations, and thrombosis of the pampiniform plexus.

Tobacco smoking and mutations in the gene expressing glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 increase the risk of male infertility. These factors may also increase the risk for a varicocele.

When a varicocele contributes to an abnormal semen analysis, it typically causes a "stress pattern" on microscopic semen examination. This pattern consists of a low sperm count, poor motility, and an increase in the percentage of abnormal sperm.
