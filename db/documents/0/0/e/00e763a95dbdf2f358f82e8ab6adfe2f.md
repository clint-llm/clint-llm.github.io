Given the high prevalence of refractive errors worldwide, the task of prescribing corrective lenses to those in need can only be accomplished by teams. Eye care personnel typically perform measurements of visual acuity before patients undergo an examination of their eyes. This must be done carefully for the best results from prescription lenses. Patients should be asked to blink often while measuring visual acuity so that the tear film is uninterrupted and the best possible refraction occurs.

Refractive errors, while prevalent, are not the only cause of blurry vision. Therefore, upon initial evaluation of refractive errors, a comprehensive eye examination should be performed by qualified providers to rule out other potential ocular pathology and potential causes of blurry vision. The examination should be thorough and include evaluation of the lids, lacrimal glands, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, posterior chamber, lens, vitreous chamber, and dilated fundus exam. The USPSTF recommends at least one comprehensive eye examination be performed on all children aged 3 to 5 years.

The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that adults under the age of 40 years undergo a comprehensive eye examination at least every 5 to 10 years and more often after that with advancing age.
