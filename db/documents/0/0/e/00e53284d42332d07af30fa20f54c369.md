Due to toxicity, several subjects treated with lenvatinib may have their dosage reduced or the drug discontinued. At baseline, creatinine, a pregnancy test for female patients, oral exam, blood pressure, and urine protein tests are recommended. Routine monitoring of renal function and liver function is advised. If nephrotic syndrome occurs, treatment should be terminated immediately.

Clinical trials of lenvatinib commonly revealed elevations in serum aminotransferase levels, occurring in 52% of patients. However, values exceeding five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) only appeared in 3% to 5% of subjects. Similarly, elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase were also common, occurring in 28% of patients, but were above three times ULN in only 2%.
