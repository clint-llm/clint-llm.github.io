Myelophthisic anemia results from fibrosis and crowding out of the normal bone marrow owing to infiltration by non-hematopoietic or abnormal cells such as metastatic cancers or hematologic malignancy, granulomatous lesions, lipid storage diseases, and primary myelofibrosis.  Several cases of breast, prostate, and hematological cancers have been reported to cause bone marrow infiltration.  Khan et al. reported a similar case of lobulated breast cancer infiltrating the bone marrow.
