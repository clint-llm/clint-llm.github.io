- The two main sites of SSN compression are the suprascapular notch and the spinoglenoid notch.

- The compression of the SSN at the spinoglenoid notch likely will result in isolated infraspinatus atrophy and is painless.

- Diagnosis of suprascapular neuropathy may be delayed due to co-morbid but asymptomatic findings of the rotator cuff and labral pathology on examination and/or imaging.

- The authors recommend electrodiagnostic testing to confirm suprascapular neuropathy and avoid the pitfall of misdiagnosis of Parsonage-Turner Syndrome or cervical radiculopathy.

- In patients in which symptoms are only present during overhead sport or occupational specific activities, the authors recommend an ultrasound-guided nerve block with a trial of light sport or occupational specific activities in a controlled practice environment while in the therapeutic window of the local anesthetic used.

- Prompt diagnosis and treatment are keys to symptom improvement and the potential return to a prior level of function because once significant atrophy has occurred, it is less likely for the patient to return to pre-morbid muscle bulk and strength in the affected muscles.
