Hyaluronidase is the antidote for paclitaxel and is commonly used for the treatment of extravasation. If the needle/cannula is still in place, administer 1 to 6 mL into the existing IV line. If the needle/cannula is no longer inserted, the hyaluronidase may be injected subcutaneously clockwise around the area of extravasation. This procedure may be repeated several times over the next 3 to 4 hours.
