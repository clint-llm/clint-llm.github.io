SinceÂ transmyocardial laser extravascular angiogenesis (TMLR) is only performed in patients with refractory angina, usually other conditions that can mimic angina should be ruled out. It is essential to ensure that a patient's angina is not any other condition that mimics angina symptoms. Differential diagnosis of angina is broad. However, for conditions that can mimic refractory angina, only differential diagnoses that are also chronic and recurrent should be considered. For instance, gastrointestinal causes like gastroesophageal reflux disease, hiatal hernia, musculoskeletal conditions like muscle spasm, costochondritis, or psychological disorders like anxiety or panic-induced chest pain are all conditions that can be recurrent and not responsive to standard anti-anginal medical therapy.
