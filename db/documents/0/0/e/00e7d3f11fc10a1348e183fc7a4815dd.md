Bortezomib is available in intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SQ) forms. There is no difference in the response rates between the available forms; however, the SQ form correlates with a decreased occurrence of grade 3 or higher adverse effects. IV form administration is as a rapid push (3 to 5 seconds). The dosing regimens below will reference IV administration.

For previously untreated multiple myeloma, bortezomib dosing is 1.3 mg/m^2 X 1 IV on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, and 32 of a 42-day cycle for the first 4 cycles; doses must be at least 72 hours apart. Subsequent dosing is 1.3 mg/m^2 X 1 IV on days 1, 8, 22, and 29 of a 42-day cycle. Bortezomib is given as part of a multi-drug regimen.

For previously relapsing multiple myeloma, bortezomib dosing is 1.3 mg/m^2 X 1 IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle. If the patient has previously received bortezomib therapy, give up to 8 cycles, then starting with cycle 9, dosing can be 1.3 mg/m^2 X 1 IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 35-day cycle; doses must be at least 72 hours apart. In this regimen, bortezomib can be given with dexamethasone or as monotherapy.

For mantle cell lymphoma, bortezomib is dosed at 1.3 mg/m^2 x 1 IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle, with a minimum of 72 hours between doses. Avoid injecting at the same site within a single cycle.

The drug is metabolized by the CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 enzymes in the liver. The metabolites are inactive and are excreted by the kidney.
