Each antiseptic possesses a specific mechanism of action, the spectrum of microbes targeted, and a side-effect profile that the surgeon should carefully weigh before selecting the agent for the procedure. Other factors to consider when selecting an optimal surgical scrub include the patient's underlying health status, the expected extent of surgery, the anatomic location of the tumor, and the planned reconstruction. Particularly related to the skin, the most common pathogens implicated in SSIs are Staphylococcus aureus, followed by other gram-positive bacteria, including coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, and group A Streptococci. Other implicated bacteria are gram-negative rods, particularly Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas. Broad-spectrum antiseptics generally cover more pathogens and subsequently are some of the most popular in dermatologic surgery.

**Chlorhexidine**

Chlorhexidine is a positively charged biguanide at physiologic pH that binds to bacteria's negatively charged cell walls, disrupting microbial cell membranes and precipitation of cell contents. At low concentrations, it is bacteriostatic, but at higher concentrations, it is bactericidal. Chlorhexidine displays a wide range of coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, enveloped viruses, and Mycobacterial tuberculosis. Advantages include its broad-spectrum, fast onset of action, and excellent sustained/residual activity after being wiped from the field via binding to the stratum corneum. It is an extensively used antiseptic in dentistry but at a much lower concentration (concentrations of 0.12% to 0.2% are recommended).

**Povidone-Iodine**

Povidone-iodine is a complex of povidone, hydrogen iodide, and elemental iodine. It is thought to act via iodination (a form of halogenation) to oxidize lipids of the cell membrane and form salts with microbial proteins. Povidone-iodine is a broad-coverage antiseptic with microbicidal activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (including spores and M. tuberculosis), fungi, viruses, and protozoa. Additionally, this antimicrobial acts rapidly after application to the skin but has minimal residual activity, unlike chlorhexidine. In one study, as a facial antiseptic, it was considered a safer alternative to chlorhexidine.

**Chloroxylenol**

Chloroxylenol is a halophenol that is thought to act by microbial cell wall disruption and inactivation of cellular enzymes. It is likely bactericidal with broad coverage of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria but less activity against M. tuberculosis, fungi, and viruses. Chloroxylenol is fairly slow-acting and has a minimal residual effect; despite this, it has shown a similar incidence of SSIs as chlorhexidine in a recent study.

**Isopropyl Alcohol**

Isopropyl alcohol is hydrophilic alcohol that likely causes membrane damage and denatures proteins needed for microbial metabolism and growth. Isopropyl alcohol is typically mixed with water because the microbial activity is greatest in a 60% to 90% solution rather than in the pure form or lower concentrations. Generally, alcohol solutions are thought to have most of their activity against gram-positive bacteria (bactericidal) but may have minor activity against some viruses and fungi. While one of the weaker cleansing agents with minimal residual activity, it has the fastest onset of action of antiseptics.

**Hexachlorophene**

Hexachlorophene is a bisphenol compound that primarily acts by inhibiting the membrane-bound portion of the electron transport chain and disrupting microbial cell membranes. At concentrations used in skin-cleansing agents, it is bacteriostatic and is primarily only active against gram-positive cocci, with little activity against gram-negative organisms and no fungal coverage. Hexachlorophene has the advantage of having a residual activity for several hours after use and gradually reduces bacterial counts after multiple uses (cumulative effect). Newer agents with broader antimicrobial coverage and fewer side effects have largely replaced hexachlorophene as a surgical scrub.

**Benzalkonium Chloride**

Benzalkonium chloride is a quaternary ammonium detergent (also called a cationic surfactant) that acts by irreversibly binding to phospholipids and proteins of the membrane, disrupting the cell membrane. It acts as a bactericide against many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria but has inconsistent coverage against fungi, viruses, and mycobacteria. The advantages of benzalkonium are its stability and ability to be applied with a low incidence of irritant contact dermatitis. Like hexachlorophene, benzalkonium has been replaced by antiseptics with better antimicrobial coverage.

**Hydrogen Peroxide**

Hydrogen peroxide is the simplest peroxide that forms highly reactive free radicals (hydroxyl radicals) that attack and oxidize essential cell components, including lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Although generally better against gram-positive bacteria, hydrogen peroxide also has a microbicidal effect on gram-negative bacteria, bacterial spores, fungi, and viruses with higher concentrations and longer contact times. In addition to its being a broad-spectrum agent, it has a rapid onset of action and low cost, which made it an attractive option in the past. While a common at-home remedy, the evidence argues against routine use as a surgical scrub or cleansing agent due to known cytotoxicity to keratinocytes.
