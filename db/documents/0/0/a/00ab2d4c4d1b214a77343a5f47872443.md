- The basis of a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome (MFS) is upon the presence of characteristic manifestations, particularly aortic root dilatation/dissection and ectopia lentis, skeletal findings, mitral valve prolapse, dural ectasia, pneumothorax, and skin striae.

- Over 90% of patients with MFS have had FBN1 mutations identified.

- Application of diagnostic criteria to individuals younger than 20 years old can be challenging because not all clinical features may exhibit themselves.

- The aortic root Z-score is used to identify aortic dilatation in association with body size.

- First-degree relatives of patients with a gene mutation associated with aortic aneurysms and/or dissection (e.g., FBN1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, COL3A1, ACTA2, MYH11) should undergo counseling, genetic testing, and potentially aortic imaging.
