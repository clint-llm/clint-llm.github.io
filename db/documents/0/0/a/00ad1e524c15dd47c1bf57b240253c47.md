The disaster cycle involves four phases: preparation, response, recovery, and mitigation.

To meaningfully discuss disaster response, it is essential also to discuss disaster and disaster management. Though there exists no consensus definition of disaster, the various definitions published by organizations and agencies at the forefront of disaster management have overlapping concepts.

A disaster is a state in which the usual, normal day-to-day human activities within a determined geographic area cease indefinitely. It is defined by a severe disruption in the basic structure and function of a society. This abnormal state is triggered by some extraordinary circumstance, either occurring naturally or as the result of human activity.

A disaster is the consequence of a sudden event or series of events of grand magnitude, which results in injury, disease, illness, loss of life, destruction of property, and/or damage to critical infrastructure and essential services.

Due to its scale and dimension, a disaster exceeds the emergency management capacity of local organizations and agencies, thus necessitating external assistance. That assistance may come from the state, national, and/or international levels. The rapid, immediate, and short-term actions circumjacent to a disaster are known as disaster response.

Disaster response is one of the core activities of disaster management. It involves the execution of a disaster plan in the event of a disaster.
