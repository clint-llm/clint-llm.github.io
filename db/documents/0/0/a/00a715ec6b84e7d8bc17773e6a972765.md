All pregnant patients should have a comprehensive history and physical exam at the initial prenatal visit as well as on admission to labor and delivery. History should include a detailed obstetric history consisting of the year of any prior pregnancies, and pregnancy outcome (abortion, ectopic, or delivery). Weight and gestational age of the infant at delivery should be recorded. If patients have had complications with prior pregnancies, this should be noted and pertinent details described. In some cases, it will be beneficial to obtain records from prior prenatal care providers or from the hospital at which the patient delivered her other babies.

Concerning mode of delivery, it is important to note if prior babies were delivered vaginally or by cesarean section. For patients experiencing prior operative delivery (either operative vaginal delivery or cesarean section) details about the indications for operative delivery should be noted. Ideally, the operative notes of any prior delivery should be obtained and a copy available in the patient's chart.

General physical exam in a patient with a prior cesarean section is performed. The pelvic exam may include an assessment of clinical pelvimetry which is a series of assessments designed to predict the likelihood of vaginal delivery. While clinical pelvimetry is frequently performed, this assessment has not been found to be highly predicted of successful VBAC or vaginal delivery and should not be used as a sole predictor to determine if a patient can undergo a trial of labor.

For patients planning a trial of labor after cesarean section, a pelvic exam close to term may provide additional guidance regarding delivery planning. Ripening of the cervix (softening and effacement) and low station of the fetal head provide some encouragement that patient may be more likely to enter labor spontaneously. A near-term attempt should be made to estimate the fetal weight either by physical exam or using ultrasonographic assessment. This information should be considered but should not be used singularly to determine if a trial of labor should be attempted, as no methods for determination of fetal birth weight are highly accurate.
