The side-viewing duodenoscope is considered the standard for ERCP procedure as it allows a better view of the major duodenal papilla, rendering cannulation easier. In patients with reconstructed gastrointestinal anatomy, as in patients with Billroth II gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y operation, the afferent loop entrance is hidden, and at a sharp angle, the afferent loop is elongated, and the papillary position is reversed. In these situations, the traditional side-viewing endoscope provides a limited visual field and makes afferent loop intubation challenging, thus increasing the risk for intestinal injuries. A forward-viewing endoscope may be a reasonable alternative in these circumstances, where afferent loop intubation would be easier, but papillary cannulation would be more challenging. The reversed papillary position makes it difficult for both side-viewing and forward-viewing endoscopes. The double-balloon enteroscopy technique uses two balloons to advance the forward-viewing endoscope through the intestine by alternating inflating and deflating balloons.

The dual lumen forward-viewing endoscope would allow the use of other surgical tools as an Allis forceps to hold the papilla, and using a stiffer endoscope with manual compression or instruments like polypectomy snare may be considered to make cannulation easier.
