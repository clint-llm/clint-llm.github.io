It is important that the patient understands the purpose of screening tests and the difference between screening and diagnostic tests. A positive screen needs to be followed by a diagnostic test before any irreversible decisions are made. Likewise, patients need to understand that a negative screening test is not a guarantee. To achieve this end, patients should be counseled on test sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values.

Patients with concerns over the implications of genetic testing and privacy of their results should be given information on the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008.
