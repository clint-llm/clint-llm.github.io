Phosgene's lone carbonyl group makes it a highly reactive molecule.

The degradation of surfactant components leads to impaired respiratory mechanics and loss of the air-blood barrier, causing widespread atelectasis.

As phosgene's toxicity ensues, its degradation into HCl is also thought to worsen tissue insult. The combination of surfactant loss and a compromised air-blood barrier leads to pathognomonic noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, which impairs gas exchange by increasing the diffusion distance for oxygen. As the blood-air barrier receives further insult, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage may occur. In severe cases, the fulminant interstitial edema may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
