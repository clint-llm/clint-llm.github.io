Before dismissing a patient from practice, the clinician should evaluate whether all efforts have been made to ameliorate the relationship. For instance, when a patient is noncompliant with treatment and scheduled follow-up appointments, the physician can consider having a conversation about the patient's needs and expectations. The physician and patient together may attempt to establish reasonable goals. If the patient has unrealistic expectations, the physician can attempt communication to reconcile differences. All efforts made should be documented by the physician.

According to American Medical Association (AMA) guidelines, a doctor may lawfully dismiss a patient for various reasons: Patient's repeated noncompliance with treatment and follow up appointments that were previously agreed upon, disruptive or threatening behavior, unreasonable failure to pay for services, and a physician's closure of his/her practice or retirement. Other acceptable reasons or situations to dismiss a patient from a medical practice include when patients are misleading about their past medical history, chronic drug-seeking behaviors, displaying threatening or seductive behavior toward staff members or physician, and a sentinel event such as violence, blatant sexual advances, theft, verbal threats or any criminal behaviors at the office. Such a sentinel event may require immediate intervention by security and/or law enforcement.
