Microscopically, pterygium is considered to be composed of elastotic fibro-vascular tissue. Leaving the top, mostly, the pterygium is covered by conjunctival epithelium. Extensions of fibrous tissue are seen on the top of pterygium, and as the head encroaches on to the cornea, the Bowmanâ€™s layer gets involved and is fragmented. The fibrous connective tissue fills these cavities. Histopathological hallmarks of chronic inflammation can also be seen. There is the presence of lymphocytic infiltration consisting of plasma cells, mastocytes, and T-lymphocytes.
