The Austin Flint murmur is a rumbling diastolic murmur best heard at the apex of the heart that is associated with severe aortic regurgitation and is usually heard best in the fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Younger patients are more likely to have a history of a bicuspid aortic valve or rheumatic heart disease, while older patients are more likely to suffer from calcific valvular disease. A blood pressure reading on the patient will show an increased pulse pressure due to the backflow of blood through the aortic valve during diastole. An astute clinician may be able to palpate a "water hammer" pulse, which is also known as "Corrigan's pulse." This finding demonstrates arterial swelling followed by a brisk diastolic fall. Patients may endorse a history of syncope or lightheadedness associated with an inability to maintain forward flow through the aortic valve and the significant difference between systolic and diastolic pressure. Decreasing exercise tolerance and the inability to perform activities of daily living should prompt screening for this condition.
