The insular cortex (i.e., insula, Latin for "island") is a still poorly understood and hidden structure located deep in the human brain. This telencephalic lobe makes up only about 2% of the complete cortical surface area but is part of complex neural circuitry involving the higher cortex, limbic structures, basal ganglia, and autonomic system. Further, the insula is located adjacent to several critical structures, and pathology originating from this area may risk significant neurological morbidity and even mortality. Care should include a coordinated effort between primary and specialty care alongside strong rehabilitation and social support. These factors make the insula an area of continued basic and clinical neuroscientific research.
