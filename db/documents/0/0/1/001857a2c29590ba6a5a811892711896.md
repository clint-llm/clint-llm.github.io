Exact incidence and prevalence statistics for adenoiditis alone are challenging to elucidate, as adenoiditis is usually addressed in the context ofÂ a regional disease process such as rhinosinusitis and adenotonsillar disease. Since adenoid tissue atrophies during puberty, adenoiditis is typically a disease in children. Current literature does not suggest a predilection for gender, race, region, or socioeconomic class in this disease, though parental smoking has been positively correlated.

Adenoiditis can be challenging to differentiate from bacterial sinusitis in children. Therefore, statistics on sinusitis in children may give us some idea of the frequency of adenoiditis. Estimates are that children have six to eight viral URIs per year. Five to thirteen percent of these viral URIs result in bacterial superinfection, leading to sinusitis with adenoiditis as a potential component of the illness.
