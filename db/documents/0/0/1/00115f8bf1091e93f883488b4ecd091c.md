Complications of Hypercalcemia can be related to the disease process itself or due to the side effects of therapies. Severely elevated hypercalcemia is an endocrine emergency and requires prompt management to avoid serious complications, which include severe volume contraction and cardiac and neurological consequences.

Chronically high serum calcium can precipitate to form crystals and eventually form calcium stones in the kidneys. Hypercalcemia inhibits renal autoregulation, induces diabetes insipidus, and causes increased serum osmolality and other metabolic disturbances leading to prerenal kidney injury with decreased glomerular filtration and renal excretion capacity. Osteoporosis occurs as a result of hypercalcemia bone resorption. In the case of persistent osteoclastic activity, bone thinning develops, with complicationsÂ of fractures and loss of height. Severe hypercalcemia can result in delirium, confusion, dementia, and coma, which is often fatal.
