Patients with Wernicke's aphasia are often difficult to diagnose. Often they generate many words in grammatically correct sentences with a normal rate, but what they say does not make sense. They use way too many irrelevant words and fail to realize that they have a speech problem. These patients may first come to attention during admission for another problem and it is important for healthcare workers to be aware of this speech problem. While there is no specific therapy, recent studies suggest that a focus on communication and functional therapy may help some people. The prognosis is strongly dependent on the primary condition causing Wernicke's aphasia. In addition, the patient's age, level of education, motivation, and gender also play a role in recovery. The length of therapy can be for months or years but not everyone has a positive outcome.
