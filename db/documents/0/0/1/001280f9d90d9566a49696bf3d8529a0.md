Menisci are two crescent-shaped structures in the knee that act as shock absorbers between the femur and tibia, dissipating stress and dispersing compressive loads

A discoid meniscus is an anatomical variant from the normal crescent-shaped meniscus. It is often thicker and is disc or saucer-shaped.
