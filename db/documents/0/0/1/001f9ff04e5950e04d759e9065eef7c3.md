A wide variety of airway procedures and adjuncts are in use, each requiring varying degrees of skill and posing benefits and risks in different clinical contexts. They include:

- Manual airway management maneuvers, using the head-tilt-chin-lift method or the jaw-thrust method

- Oxygen devices, including high-flow nasal oxygen

- Insertion of oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airways

- Bag-valve-mask device

- Supraglottic airways

- Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices and non-invasive ventilation

- Direct laryngoscopy with endotracheal intubation

- Nasal intubation

- Rapid sequence intubation (RSI), with sedatives and paralytics

- Drug-assisted or facilitated intubation without paralytics

- Airway intubation adjuncts, such as bougies, styles, or video laryngoscopes

- Front of neck access, such as needle cricothyrotomy or surgical cricothyrotomy
