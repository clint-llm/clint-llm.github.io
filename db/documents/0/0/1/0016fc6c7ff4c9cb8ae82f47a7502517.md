Osteoporotic fractures are associated with high morbidity, increased mortality risk, and significant economic impact. Multiple fractures can severely impair the quality of life in females and can be a severe complication of osteoporosis. Fractures of the hip and spine can limit and disable the patients. Some might have to undergo surgical interventions, including neurosurgical, if fractures cause any spinal canal stenosis or cord compression. Patients with hip fractures have an increased risk of mortality in first-year post fractures.
