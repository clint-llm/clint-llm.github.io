The acetylation and methylation processes are carried out by specific proteins which exist in all of our cells. Histone acetyltransferases (HAT) transfer acetyl groups from acetyl coenzyme A to the lysine molecules. This transfer eliminates the natural positive charge of the histone proteins and therefore reduces its interaction with the negatively charged DNA phosphates, ultimately leading to a euchromatin state and turning on gene expression. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) function to remove acetyl groups from the lysine, leading to a heterochromatin state and turning off gene expression.

Histone methylation is not as straightforward as acetylation. The effect of histone methylation depends on the location of the modified position, and the number of methyl groups added.
