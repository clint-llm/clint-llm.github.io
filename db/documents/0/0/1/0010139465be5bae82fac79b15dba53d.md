This activity reviews the evaluation and management of atraumatic spinal cord compression. It highlights the roles of the emergency physician, neurosurgeon, and inpatient care team in treating patients with this condition.

Atraumatic spinal cord compression occurs as a result of numerous possible etiologies and is notoriously difficult to identify in the early stages. Delayed diagnosis can result in permanent neurological disability or death. Practitioners should recognize that further evaluation is warranted when early symptoms, such as back pain, motor weakness, sensory deficits, or gait difficulty, are present, especially in the context of known risk factors. This will lead to improved recognition of potential abnormalities, which, in turn, will dictate treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes.
