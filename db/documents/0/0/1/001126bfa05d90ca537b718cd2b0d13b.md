The X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome is characterized by an inappropriate immune response to EBV and leads to death from infectious mononucleosis, a dysgammaglobulinemia, or a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. However, the link between X-linked lymphoproliferative disorder and EBV is unknown.

ALPS presents with an increased size of lymphoid organs including lymph nodes and spleen in up to 90% of patients. The liver may be enlarged in up to 40% of patients. Autoimmune cytopenia is common including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Symptoms that resemble systemic lupus erythematosus may be present. ALPS is associated with other autoimmune disorders like autoimmune cerebellar ataxia, transverse myelitis, Guillain–Barre syndrome, and autoimmune glomerulonephritis.

Clinical features of chronic hematological malignancies (chronic leukemias and lymphomas) include:

- Males are more affected than women

- Asthenia

- Anemia

- Thrombocytopenia

- Granulocytopenia

- Loss of weight

- Lymphadenopathy (for example, peripheral, mesenteric, and retroperitoneal).

- Splenomegaly

- Hepatomegaly

- Metastatic disease affecting several organs including jaw, liver, ovaries, central nervous system (CNS), and gastrointestinal (GI) tract

- Recurrent infections

- Skin rash
