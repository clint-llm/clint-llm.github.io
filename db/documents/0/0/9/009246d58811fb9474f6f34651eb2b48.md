Genetically encoded molecules, known as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules or human leukocyte antigens (HLA), determine an individualâ€™s ability to produce an immune response to different antigens. These MHC molecules are responsible for determining if a molecule is histocompatible with the individual and for initiating an immune response if it is deemed foreign.
