Preparation for an exam in pediatric nuclear medicine involves several aspects:

- As a rule, proper hydration is essential to optimize the study itself and decrease radiation exposure since hydration enhances rapid clearance of the radiopharmaceutical.

- Specific preparation will depend on the study performed and the radiopharmaceutical administered. For example, fasting for 4 to 6 hours is required for certain studies such as FDG PET (positron emission tomography) scans. However, this fast may be shortened to 2 or 3 hours in babies and for HIDA scans and gastric emptying studies.

- Special attention should be made to withhold any interfering medications.

- Child life involvement is frequently needed before the test to alleviate the child and family's anxiety and assist with the exam.

- A visit to nuclear medicine before the scan day and a tour of the scan room by the child may help prepare the child for the test.

- Making sure toys, snacks, ambiance, mood, relaxing music, and atmosphere are available is essential.

- Distraction devices are helpful in babies and younger children.

- Making sure that safe immobilization devices are available. This includes head holders or straps fitted to the patient's size; otherwise, they will not be effective.

- Informing the anesthesia team and other team members of the specific requirements of the nuclear medicine test allows for a smooth and safe workflow on the day of the test.
