Postpartum psychosis has been underdiagnosed and underreported because there are no standard screening procedures in place during the prenatal and postnatal periods.

- A complete blood count (CBC)

- Electrolytes

- Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)

- Blood glucose

- Creatinine

- Vitamin B12

- Folate

- Thiamine

- Calcium

- Thyroid function tests

- Liver function tests or LFTs

- Urinalysis

- Urine drug screen

- Urine/blood cultures for patients with fever

- CT/ MRI brain

The above lab tests help to rule out medical conditions and organic causes that may present as psychosis. Examples include hypo and hypernatremia, hypo and hyperglycemia (insulin shock and diabetic ketoacidosis), abnormal liver function tests (hepatic encephalopathy), and hypo and hyperthyroidism (thyroid storm in Graves disease). Other examples are uremia, substance abuse, hypercalcemia (in hyperparathyroidism), urine and blood cultures to rule out infection and CT, and MRI to see for a possibility of a stroke, especially in women with a history of pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia.
