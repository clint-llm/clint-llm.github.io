It is important to recall that when examining a patient with ocular trauma, finding one site of traumatic injury does not rule out additional corneal foreign bodies elsewhere.

Always complete your examination in a standard, routine, thorough, and meticulous manner.

Always remember to flip the upper eyelid and remove contact lenses before the examination.
