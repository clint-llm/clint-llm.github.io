The repeated interruption in breathing imposes an autonomic, chemical, mechanical, and inflammatory burden on the heart and circulation. The hypoxia during the apnea or hypopnea phase will increase sympathetic activity and myocardial damage. Hypoxia is also known to precipitate rupture of plaques, vasoconstriction of vessels, and promote dementia. Hypercapnia can cause arrhythmia and contribute to lethargy and feeling of fragmented sleep.  The presence of Cheyne-Stokes respiration in a patient with heart failure is a strong independent predictor of cardiac death and hospital readmission. In clinical studies, the presence of Cheyne-Stokes respiration in patients with heart failure is linked to arrhythmia and arrhythmia-related death. Patients with heart failure with Cheyne-Stokes respiration are more likely to have lower ejection fraction, higher brain natriuretic peptide, and increased plasma catecholamines compared to patients without Cheyne-Stokes respiration.

Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a complex breathing disorder seen in patients with heart failure. The presence of Cheyne-Stokes respiration affects the overall prognosis of patients with heart failure.  Although the exact pathophysiology of Cheyne-Stokes respiration is still not clear, the latest development in noninvasive therapy offers hope for a potential cure. Further research is needed to understand and treat this disorder precisely.
