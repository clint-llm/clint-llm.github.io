Basal cell carcinoma occurs most commonly on sun-damaged skin of the head, neck, and trunk. Basal cell carcinoma develops at sites of prior ultraviolet light exposure; the latency period extends from 10 to 40 years, and no known precursor lesion exists. Individuals with light skin and lighter-colored eyes are at the greatest risk of developing these tumors. Longer life spans and an increase in the use of immunosuppressant medications has further added to the incidence of patients with basal cell carcinoma.
