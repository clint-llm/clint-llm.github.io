Lupus pernio is a rare form of cutaneous sarcoidosis which often requires the expertise of multiple providers including a dermatologist and a pathologist in establishing the diagnosis. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease with potentially life-threatening complications that warrants the importance of coordinated care provided by an interprofessional team. Patients would benefit from pharmacy education regarding potential medication side effects and possible drug interactions. The choice of therapy is often decided by the interprofessional team after assessing the severity and the extent of sarcoidosis. Patients with cosmetic disfigurement should be referred to plastic surgeons for reconstructive surgery.
