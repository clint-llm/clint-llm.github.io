**Classification of Non-infectious Complications of Blood Transfusion**

These are broadly classified as acute and delayed reactions based on time of occurrence. These categories are further subclassified based on the etiology, whether it is immune or non-immune related.

**Acute Reaction (<24 hours)**

-  Immune-mediated reactions include

- Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction(AHTR) 
- Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR)
- Allergic reactions 
- Anaphylactic reactions 
- Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)

- Non-immune mediated reactions include

- Air embolism
- Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) 
- Non-immune hemolysis

**Delayed Reaction (>24 hours)**

- Immune-mediated reactions include

- Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction(DHTR) 
- Alloimmunization

- To HLA antigens
- To platelet antigens 
- To red cell antigens


- Transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM)
- Transfusion-associated graft versus host disease (TA-GVHD)
- Post-transfusion purpura (PTP)

- Non-immune reaction includes

- Iron overload
