Pharmacological cardioversion is usually performed by the cardiologist but dedicated nursing staff are required to monitor the patient and assist in the procedure. Prior to pharmacological conversion, an echo is highly recommended. Pharmacological cardioversion is ideal for hemodynamically stable patients. The pharmacist must emphasize the importance of medication compliance because untreated atrial arrhythmias can predispose people to a stroke. Prior to cardioversion, the pharmacist should evaluate for potential drug-drug interactions that may diminish the chances of success. The patient has to be placed on an oral anticoagulant after the procedure and should be followed up the primary care provider to ensure that the INR is therapeutic. The pharmacist, nurse practitioner and the primary care provider should never alter the dose of the antiarrhythmic agent without first consulting with the patient's cardiologist Patient education is key, and the nurse should assist in making sure the family and patient understand the procedure then assist with education in regards to changes in behavior that will improve long-term outcomes. An interprofessional team approach will provide the best care for these patients.
