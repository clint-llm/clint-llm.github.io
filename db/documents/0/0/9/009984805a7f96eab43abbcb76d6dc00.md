Ventilator-associated pneumonia is typically bacterial and from a single organism. However polymicrobial infections are increasing. In a large retrospective review done in the ICU settings of three hospitals, the microbiology was the same across adult and pediatric hospitals. The most common organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (28.4 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25.2 %), and other gram negatives (26.6%).

Artificial airways become colonized with pathogenic bacteria soon after intubation or tracheostomy, and the major pathogens include both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: S. aureus (including MRSA), P. aeruginosa, and Klebsiella and Enterobacter species. Patients in a NICU have a risk of Enterococcus species and group B Streptococcus as well. Other pathogens include the Streptococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, and Acinetobacter species. Anaerobic bacteria are an uncommon cause of Ventilator-associated pneumonia but can play a role in polymicrobial infections, particularly when pneumonia is due to aspiration.  Nosocomial viruses and fungi are rare causes of pneumonia in immunocompetent hosts.

In addition, early pneumonia (less than 4 days after admission to the hospital) is most likely from antibiotic-sensitive community-acquired organisms, and late pneumonia (more than 4 days) is more likely due to antibiotic-resistant organisms. However, this distinction is not helpful in children who are frequently admitted to the hospital.
