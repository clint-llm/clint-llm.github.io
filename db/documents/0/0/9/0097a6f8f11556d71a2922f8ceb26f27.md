Patients with alopecia often initially present to a primary care clinician. A referral may be warranted depending on the type, severity, and patient impact. For example, if scarring alopecia is suspected, a referral to a dermatologist for a biopsy is necessary. A multidisciplinary and interprofessional team of providers will include any of the following: primary care providers (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), dermatologists, dermatopathologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, pharmacists, and nurses.

An accurate diagnosis can optimize clinical management for patients and help reduce the psychosocial burden. Specialty nurses can help educate patients about expected outcomes and encourage treatment compliance. The clinical pharmacist can help streamline medications to prevent interactions and adverse effects and offer patients medication counseling. Nurses often help coordinate activities and interventions among various clinicians and can provide counsel to patients. A collaborative interprofessional team of clinicians, psychotherapists, nurses, and pharmacists can best treat patients with alopecia, optimizing clinical outcomes while minimizing adverse events.

Ideally, the interprofessional team will work to build long-term relationships with the patient and their family to consistently provide pharmacological and adjunct therapy, patient education, psychological and emotional support, ongoing monitoring, and social support.
