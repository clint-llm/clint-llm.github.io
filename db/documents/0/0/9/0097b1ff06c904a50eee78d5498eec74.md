**Limitations**

- The keratometer measurements are based on the false belief that the cornea is a sphere or has a spherocylindrical configuration, where the two principal meridians are at 90 degrees to each other. In reality, the cornea is aspheric in configuration.

- The peripheral corneal surface is not considered while having refractive measurements. The keratometers take into account only the central curvature of 3Â to 4 mm, which is a smaller portion and is a potential limitation.

- The keratometer has limited accuracy and loses accuracy in the very flat or steep cornea.

- Corneal irregularities like abrasion, erosions, epithelial defects, etc., will preclude the perfect keratometry reading due to irregular astigmatism.

- Keratometers have assumed the index of refraction in radius to diopter conversion

- It employs para axial optics to measure the corneal surface power.

- It approximates the distance from the focal point to the distance to the image.

- Regular astigmatism due to one position astigmatism is also a limitation.

**Factors Leading to Errors in Keratometry**

- Faulty or improper calibration

- Excessive lacrimation

- Faulty lid position

- The patient has not fixed the instrument

- Abnormal patient position

- Accommodation error

- Corneal folds or distortion

- The abnormal focus of the corneal image
