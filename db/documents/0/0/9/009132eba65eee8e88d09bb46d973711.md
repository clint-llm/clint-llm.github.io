The arytenoid cartilages are paired pyramid-shaped structures of cartilage found in the larynx, which are essential to the production of vocal sound. They are located on the lateral part of the superior border of the lamina of the cricoid cartilage and help form the cricoarytenoid joints. The arytenoid has the apex directed cranially where the corniculate cartilage is sitting. The apex gives attachment to the aryepiglottic fold, while the base articulates with the cricoid cartilage lamina by the cricoarytenoid synovial. Each arytenoid has three surfaces (medial, posterior, and anterolateral) and two processes originating from the base. The thin anterior process (vocal process) gives attachment to the vocal ligament, which in turn,Â supports the medial edge of the vocal fold. The thick lateral process (muscular process) is the point of attachment of the thyroarytenoid and cricoarytenoid (lateral and posterior) muscles. The posterior curved surface receives the fibers of the interarytenoid muscles (transverse and oblique), while the medial surface is flat, smooth and covered by the mucosa that constitutes the lateral border of the posterior (intercartilaginous) part of the glottis. The anterolateral surface gives strong attachments to the thyroarytenoid muscle near the base and is attached to the vestibular ligament near its apex.
