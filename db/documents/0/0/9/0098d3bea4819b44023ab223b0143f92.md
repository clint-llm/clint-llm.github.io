Morphologically, PCFCL demonstrates perivascular and periadnexal to diffuse infiltration of monoclonal B-cells, which typically spares the epidermis (grenz zone). Growth patterns can be follicular, follicular and diffuse, or diffuse. The growth pattern has not been found to be of clinical significance. The follicles in a follicular pattern PCFCL are commonly poorly defined, have an attenuated mantle zone, typically lack tingible body macrophages, and demonstrate a low rate of proliferation. The diffuse-type growth pattern frequently shows a sheet-like proliferation of monotonous centrocytes, which may have cleaved/multi-lobated/irregular nuclei. The proliferation rate of the diffuse growth pattern is generally high.
