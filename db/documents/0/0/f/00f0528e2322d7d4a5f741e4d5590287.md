Branchial cleft cysts are the most frequent cause of congenital neck masses, comprising approximately one-third of allÂ congenital neck masses. They are the most common lateral neck mass, with 2% to 3% occurring bilaterally. While they occur more frequently in patients with a family history, there is no reported predilection for gender or race. They are more commonly found during childhood but can be seen in adults.
