Appropriate consultation between primary care physicians (PCP) and hematologists is paramount. While some causes of lymphocytosis will resolve with observation or supportive management alone, others may need more prompt evaluation. The presence of highly elevated counts (ALC greater than 30000 cells/microL) or rapidly increasing ones should alert PCP to consult hematology specialists. Likewise, hematology consultants should direct management in cases needing intervention and provide guidance when clinical monitoring is appropriate.
