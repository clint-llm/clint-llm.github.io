Simple elbow dislocations, while less common, can occur without any associated fractures.

Terrible triad injuries of the elbow are notorious for recurrent instability and significant post-traumatic arthritis. The triad consists of a coronoid fracture, a radial head fracture, and an elbow dislocation (usually with lateral collateral ligament injury resulting in posterolateral rotatory instability). These injuries most often require surgical stabilization of the fractures as well as ligamentous repair. Non-operative treatment is an option if the elbow is stable after a concentric reduction, and both the coronoid and radial head fractures are independently amenable to non-operative treatment.
