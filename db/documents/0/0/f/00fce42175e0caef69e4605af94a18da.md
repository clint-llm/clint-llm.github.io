Osteofibrous dysplasia is a type of benign bone tumor that is usually located in the tibial bone. It presents with painless swelling in the leg in children and is diagnosed by radiograph. Parents should be educated that it may cause a pathological fracture or bony deformity. Parents should also be counseled that a large biopsy should be obtained to differentiate between OFD and adamantinoma.
