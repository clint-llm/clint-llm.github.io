Prevention of GBS disease in pregnant women and infants requires an interprofessional healthcare team effort. All healthcare workers caring for pregnant women and newborn infants, including obstetricians, neonatologists, pediatricians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, midwives, and specialty trained nurses, play an important role in screening high-risk patients and treating those with signs or symptoms of GBS-related infection. Furthermore, researchers also play an essential role in investigating the use of vaccines to prevent GBS disease in pregnant women. Pharmacists review antibiotics used for prophylaxis and treatment for doses and interactions. Nurses monitor patients, provide education, and report issues to the team; this includes neonatal specialty nurses for the newborn.

Since the initiation of universal screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, the incidence of early-onset GBS disease has decreased tremendously by approximately 80%. However, the incidence of late-onset GBS disease remains the same. Thus, further collaboration between all healthcare workers and researchers is essential in understanding the pathophysiology of late-onset GBS disease, the potential use for immunoprophylaxis, and further promoting awareness and education to women regarding GBS disease. These interprofessional team strategies will lead to better outcomes for both mother and child. [Level 5]
