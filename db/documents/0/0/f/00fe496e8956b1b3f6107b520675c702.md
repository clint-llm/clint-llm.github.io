Diphenhydramine can also have negative cardiovascular consequences in the setting of toxicity. ECG changes can be observed, which include the widening of the QRS-complex and tachycardia, possibly caused by the anticholinergic effects of diphenhydramine. More specifically, diphenhydramine can affect the delayed rectifier potassium ion channels of the heart as it can act as a blocker of potassium channels. These channels are responsible for the rapid component of the cardiac repolarizing current. This leads to the prolongation of the QT interval and a flattening of the T-wave.

Diphenhydramine pharmacokinetics do not appear to change in the event of intoxication/overdose.

Vd can also vary between age groups. For pediatric patients, the Vd is approximately 22 L/kg (range: 15 to 28 L/kg). For adult patients, the Vd is approximately 17 L/kg (range: 13 to 20 L/kg) and approximately 14 L/kg (range: 7 to 20 L/kg) for elderly patients.
