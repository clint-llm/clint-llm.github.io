A comprehensive, full-body evaluation should be performed in patients suspected of having ankylosing spondylitis (AS) due to the pervasive nature of the disease and susceptibility to multi-organ system involvement. Almost all patients will complain of back pain to some degree. The characteristic type of back pain in AS is "inflammatory" in nature. Inflammatory back pain typically exhibits at least four of the five following characteristics: age of onset less than 40 years, insidious onset, improvement with exercise, no improvement with rest, and pain at night with an improvement upon arising. Spinal stiffness, immobility, and postural changes, especially hyperkyphosis, are also commonly seen. History and physical exam should address all systems, as AS can have several axial and peripheral musculoskeletal manifestations, as well as extra-articular features. A detailed medical history should be obtained to rule in/out any correlated conditions (e.g., psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, uveitis, among others).
