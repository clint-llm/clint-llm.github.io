Treatment for HIV-associated lipodystrophy depends on the phenotypic profile of the patient.

**Treatment of HIV-associated Lipoatrophy**

The most important treatment strategy in patients with this disease is to switch the antiretroviral therapy combination to exclude the use of stavudine and zidovudine. Alternate NRTIs that may be used include tenofovir or abacavir. Multiple clinical trials have shown improvement in lipoatrophy with this treatment strategy.

Regimen changes that have not shown any clinical benefit in the treatment of lipoatrophy include switching from a protease inhibitor to an NNRTI or switching from an older-generation protease inhibitor to a newer agent in the same class.

Thiazolidinediones are another possible treatment that can be considered for patients with lipoatrophy. Their use, however, is not proven to be beneficial and remains investigational. In patients who do not improve with ART regimen alterations and need treatment for lipoatrophy, a trial of pioglitazone can be considered if they have evidence of insulin resistance.

It is important to note that regimen changes may favorably affect limb lipoatrophy but have minimal effect on facial lipoatrophy. Plastic surgery is the mainstay of therapy for patients affected with facial lipoatrophy, which may require injectable gel fillers or autologous fat transplantation.

Although uridine supplementation can theoretically protect patients from lipoatrophy while on thymidine analogs, a multicenter clinical trial found uridine supplementation to be ineffective after 48 weeks of treatment when compared to a placebo.

**Treatment of HIV-associated Lipohypertrophy**

The mainstay of therapy for patients with this syndrome is lifestyle modifications with diet and exercise.

In severe cases, who do not respond to conservative treatment, tesamorelin can be considered. This is a growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) analog that can be used to treat excess abdominal fat. Although the efficacy of this therapy in reducing abdominal fat deposition is established, long-term safety data is still lacking; therefore, prolonged treatment should be pursued with extreme caution.

Surgical management of lipohypertrophy includes liposuction and lipectomy. However, the duration of the effect is variable, and recurrence is common, which renders these options less favorable.

**Medical Treatment of Dyslipidemia**

Lipid-decreasing therapy can be considered with low-density lipoprotein levels are high. In such cases, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) would be preferred; however, caution is advised given the risk of side effects with concomitant ART therapy. Pravastatin, low-dose atorvastatin or fluvastatin are recommended as first-line agents in patients receiving protease inhibitors, and dose adjustments may be needed to avoid the risk of statin toxicity.
