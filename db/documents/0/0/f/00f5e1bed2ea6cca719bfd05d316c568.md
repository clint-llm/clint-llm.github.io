Two scoring systems are used for predicting outcomes and stratifying patients with PCNSL.

- International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG) score

- Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic score

The IELSG score includes the use of 5 parameters to determine prognosis

- Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score

- Age

- CSF protein concentration

- Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) serum level

- Deep brain involvement

The two-year survival rates depending on the presence of the above risk factors are:

- 0 to 1 adverse factor – 80% survival rate

- 2 to 3 adverse factors - 48% survival rate

- 4 to 5 adverse factors - 15% survival rate

Three prognostic groups are defined by the MSKCC score using Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and age

- Age ≤50 – median overall survival 8.5 years

- Age >50 and KPS ≥70 – median overall survival 3.2 years

- Age >50 and KPS <70 – median overall survival 1.1 years

The median overall survival has increased in patients with PCNSL in the United States from 12 months in the 1960s to 26 months in the 2010s.
