As with its structure and function, the embryology of the anal canal differs superior and inferior to the pectinate line. Above the pectinate line, the anal canal is the terminal portion of the hindgut and is endodermally derived. As with the rest of the hindgut, the superior anal canal is lined by columnar epithelium. Below the pectinate line, the anal canal is ectodermally derived and is lined with stratified squamous epithelium.

At birth, the external anal sphincter is not yet fully developed or under complete voluntary control. An individual usually achieves voluntary control of the external anal sphincter near the ages of 18 to 24 months.
