Adrenal metastases are the most common malignant lesions involving the adrenal gland and the second most common tumor of the adrenal gland after benign adenomas. These metastases were primarily found on autopsy. However, with the increasing role of CT, MRI, and PET in diagnosing, staging, and follow-up of malignancies, adrenal metastases are increasingly found incidentally. The management of adrenal metastatic lesions is best done with an interprofessional team that includes an oncologist, a surgeon, radiologist, primary care provider, internist, and a pathologist. The key is to find out the primary. In most cases the biggest difficulty is determining if the adrenal lesion is benign or a metastatic lesion. Sometimes a biopsy or laparoscopy may be required. If the lesion is metastatic the prognosis for most patients is poor.
