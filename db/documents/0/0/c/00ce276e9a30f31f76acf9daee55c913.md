All equipment, including an infection control bundle, must be assembled at the bedside before initiating arterial catheterization. These commercially-available bundled kits minimize procedure time and facilitate adherence to evidence-based best practices that minimize insertional catheter-related infections. While the content of kits varies by manufacturer, all include the appropriate-sized catheter and corresponding search needle, lidocaine, gauze, chlorhexidine solution, and sterile gowns, masks, and gloves.

The transducer, connecting tubing, and monitor cable system must be available before catheter insertion. The waveform obtained after connecting the arterial catheter to the monitor confirms successful placement in the lumen of the artery.
