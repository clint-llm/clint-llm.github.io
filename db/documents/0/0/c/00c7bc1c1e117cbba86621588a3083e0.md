**Rehabilitation**is fundamental in determining patients' outcomes following PCL injuries and reconstruction

- Progressive weight-bearing and range of motion exercises.

- Avoidance of posterior tibial subluxation early in rehabilitation by avoiding resisted hamstring strengthening exercises.

- Early focused quadriceps strengthening.

**Pierce**proposed a 5-phase post-operative programme

**Phase I (0- 6 weeks):**

- (0-2 weeks):passive prone ROM (0 to 90 degrees.

- (3-6 weeks) advance to full passive prone ROM as tolerated.

**Phase II (7-12 weeks):**

- Progressive crutch weaning and weight-bearing as tolerated,

- Restrict knee flexion to less than 70º  during weight-bearing exercises.

**Phase III (13 to 18 weeks):**

- Progression of ROM weight-bearing exercise past 70º of knee flexion after 16 weeks.

- Continuation of brace usage.

**Phase IV (19-24 weeks):**

- A gradual introduction of sport-specific drills.

**Phase V (25-36 weeks):**

- Brace weaning if there is sufficient healing of the graft as guided by the 6 months postoperative PCL stress radiographs.

- Start a straight-line jogging progression.

- The final goal of multiplanar agility exercises and return to preoperative activities.
