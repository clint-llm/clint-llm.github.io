**Association with****Cardiovascular Disease**

There has been a direct relationship between dietary fat intake and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Recent studies have reported that in men, the reduction of total fat and saturated fatty acids from 36% and 12% of energy to 27% and 8% of energy, respectively, resulted in a substantial decline in the total and LDL cholesterol levels.

**AssociationÂ with Cancer**

The association between dietary fat and the risk of cancer development has had consistent support through multiple studies. There is epidemiologic evidence demonstrating associations between dietary fat intake and breast, prostate, colon, and even lung cancers in humans.

Of those cancers, dietary fat intake has been the most extensively linked with breast cancer.

One potential mechanism for the relationship between fat intake and prostate cancer include altered levels of sex hormones.

**Association with Obesity**

Obesity is a chronic disease associated with a plethora of comorbidities like diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, fatty liver, and obstructive sleep apnea, to name a few.
