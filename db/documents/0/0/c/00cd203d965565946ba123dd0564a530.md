**Cortex**

The adrenal cortex takes part in steroidogenesis, producing glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and androgen precursors. It has 3 distinct functional and histological zones: the zona glomerulosa (outermost layer), the zona fasciculata (middle layer), and the zona reticularis (innermost layer).

Once cholesterol enters the cell, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) regulates cholesterol transport from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner mitochondrial membrane.

Since the glomerulosa does not have 17 alpha-hydroxylase, pregnenolone can only be converted into progesterone via 3-beta-dehydrogenase; 21-hydroxylase catalyzes conversion to 11-deoxycorticosterone; 11-beta-hydroxylase catalyzes conversion to corticosterone. Finally, aldosterone synthase, which is present only in the glomerulosa and is regulated by angiotensin II, converts corticosterone into aldosterone. Aldosterone, corticosterone, and deoxycorticosterone all have mineralocorticoid activity with aldosterone being the predominant mineralocorticoid in man.

In the fasciculata, 17-alpha-hydroxylase converts pregnenolone and progesterone, which were synthesized in the glomerulosa, into 17-hydroxypregnenolone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, respectively; 3-beta-dehydrogenase converts 17-hydroxypregnenolone into 17-hydroxyprogesterone; 21-hydroxylase converts 17-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol; and 11-beta-hydroxylase converts 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, the predominant glucocorticoid.

In the reticularis, 17-hydroxypregnenolone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone can be converted into DHEA and androstenedione by 17,20 lyase (17 alpha-hydroxylase). Although DHEA is predominantly made, some of it can be converted into androstenedione by 3ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the reticularis.
