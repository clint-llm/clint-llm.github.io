The most notable physiological variant of the sacrum is represented by its sexual dimorphism. In females, the sacrum tends to be shorter and broader than in their male counterparts. Females also have a less prominent sacral promontory, which allows for easier passage of offspring during childbirth.

Another common variant is the presence of lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV). An LSTV may arise when either the L5 vertebrae undergoes sacralization and fuses to the sacrum (resulting in 6 sacral vertebrae) or when the S1 vertebrae undergo lumbarization to become a 6th lumbar vertebrae (resulting in 4 sacral vertebrae). A meta-analysis from 1986 to 2007 revealed the prevalence of LSTV might be as high as 12.3%.

There are many more anatomical differences, such as a variation in the number of sacral foramina, as well as morphological defects such as sacral agenesis, sacral spina bifida, and the presence of a sacral rib.
