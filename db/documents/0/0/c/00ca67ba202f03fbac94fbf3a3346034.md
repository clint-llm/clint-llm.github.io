Currently, the highest recommended dose of escitalopram is 20 mg PO daily. Management for out-of-hospital isolated SSRI overdose in patients who are experiencing minor symptoms (regularly less than five times their treatment dosage) is recommended at-home observation and in close conjunction with a local poison control center.

In an overdose of escitalopram, the most concerning clinical aspect is QT prolongation and a subsequent torsade de pointes arrhythmia, which could be fatal. In reported ingestions of 300 mg or more of escitalopram, single-dose activated charcoal demonstrably decreased the fraction of absorption by 31% and decreased the risk of abnormal QT interval by 35%. Therefore, the recommendation is to administer a single dose of activated charcoal to patients who have ingested at least 300 mg of escitalopram in an attempted overdose. Cardiac monitoring of patients who receive activated charcoal (overdose of 300 mg or greater) is recommended for 12 hours.

In patients with more severe hyperexcitability symptoms, supportive treatment is the mainstay. Besides discontinuing all serotonergic drugs, measures for adequate temperature and blood pressure control should be initiated; agitation control can be achieved with benzodiazepines. In severe cases of serotonin toxicity, patients may require endotracheal intubation and ventilatory support.****Hemodialysis is likely ineffective due to the large volume of distribution of escitalopram.
