Potential complications include pain, infection, bleeding, damage to nearby structures, allergic reaction, and non-therapeutic results. Complications specific to steroid use include septic arthritis, post-injection flare, local tissue atrophy, skin discoloration, tendon rupture, cartilage damage, avascular necrosis, flushing, and increased blood glucose level. If inadvertently injected intravascularly, there can be severe CNS and cardiac effects, particularly with insoluble, particulate formulations such as triamcinolone, which can embolize and lead to stroke.
