Universal contraindications for the use of IUD:

- Pregnancy or suspected pregnancy

- Sexually transmitted infection at the time of insertion, including cervicitis, vaginitis, or any other lower genital tract infection

- A congenital uterine abnormality that distorts the shape of the uterine cavity making insertion difficult

- Acute pelvic inflammatory disease

- History of pelvic inflammatory disease, unless a subsequent successful intrauterine pregnancy has occurred

- History of septic abortion or history of postpartum endometritis within the last 3 months

- Confirmed or suspicion of uterine or cervical malignancy/neoplasia

- Abnormal uterine bleeding of unknown origin

- Any condition that increases the risk of pelvic infection

- History of previously inserted IUD that has not been removed

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the device
