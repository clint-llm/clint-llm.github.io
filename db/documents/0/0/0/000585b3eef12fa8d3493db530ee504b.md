Parents should be made aware of the prognosis, advantages, and complications of the management of strabismus and its impact on the social, physical, and psychological growth of the child. A treatment plan based on the discussion with the parents should be charted out. In acute onset strabismus, patients and their care providers should be informed about a possible systemic or neurological cause and a possible referral to an appropriate specialist if needed. The parents need to know the risks of developing amblyopia and impaired stereopsis if adherence to treatment is not maintained.
