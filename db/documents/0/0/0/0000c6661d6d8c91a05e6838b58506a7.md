The exact etiology of congenital vertical talus is still debatable.

Commonly associated conditions include Marfan syndrome, De Barsy Syndrome, chromosomal abnormalities of 13,15,18,30,31, Multiple pterygium syndrome, Cri du chat syndrome, and muscle abnormalities like ischiocalcaneal band, spinal abnormalities, migration anomalies, and fetal brain abnormalities.

Other possible etiologies are increased intrauterine pressure, muscle imbalance, intrauterine growth retardation, and arrest in fetal development or the rotational development of the foot.
