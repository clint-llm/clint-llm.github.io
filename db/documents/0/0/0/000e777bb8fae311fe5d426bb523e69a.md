Denosumab is a total human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that binds to receptor activator of NF kappa B ligand (RANKL) and competitively inhibits its binding to receptor activator of NF kappa B (RANK). Soluble RANKL is a trimer and a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of ligands. Each RANKL trimer can bind and oligomerize up to three receptors. When bound to RANK, RANKL potentiates osteoclast differentiation from hematopoietic stem cells and activates and prolongs the survival of mature osteoclasts. Osteoclasts' primary function then is toÂ promote bone resorption. Denosumab binds to RANKL with high affinity and blocks it from binding to and oligomerizing its receptor RANK, thus inhibiting osteoclast maturation and bone resorption.
