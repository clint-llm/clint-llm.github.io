Treatment for complete patellar tendon ruptures involves surgical repair, as disability from a deficient knee extensor mechanism is high. Although not considered to be a surgical emergency, prompt surgical management of acute patella tendon ruptures is recommended to prevent the need for reconstruction. Nonsurgical treatment for patellar tendon ruptures is only indicated in those instances where the tendon tear is partial, and there is an intact knee extensor mechanism. The other instance in which nonsurgical management should be considered would be for patients who are not surgical candidates due to medical comorbidities. Non-surgical treatment involves immobilization with the knee in full extension with a progressive weight-bearing exercise program.

Surgical treatment includes primary tendon repair or tendon reconstruction.
