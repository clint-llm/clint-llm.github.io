The duration of diabetes, the presence of ESR and CRP, and imaging studies results have all affected the prognosis of MOE.

The poorer prognosis was seen in patients who experienced any of the following:

- Facial nerve involvement

- Additional cranial nerve involvement

- Non-cranial nerve neurological involvement

- Extensive granulations (or edema) in the external auditory canal

- Bilateral symptoms

- Aspergillus species as the causative organism

Elderly patients had a higher chance ofÂ developing complications and had a higher mortality rate compared to patients from younger age groups.

**Recurrence**

The recurrence rate of MOE is high, reaching 15% to 20% when ESR starts to rise again.

MOE can recur up to one year after treatment; therefore, the patient should be followed up regularly for one year before being considered cured.

**Mortality**

With the advanced treatment modalities, the mortality rate dropped from a high of 50% in the past to 10% to 20%.
