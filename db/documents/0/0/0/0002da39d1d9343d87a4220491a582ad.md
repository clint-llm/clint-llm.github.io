The approach recommended by several well-known guidelines is based on four considerations that aim to guide the physician in elective surgery cases.

**Determine the Thromboembolic Risk of the Patient**

The three major conditions related to a higher risk of thromboembolic events are atrial fibrillation, prosthetic heart valves, and recent thromboembolism (venous or arterial). The thromboembolic risk will be estimated through clinical variables in the case of atrial fibrillation with the CHA2DS2VASc score.

**Determine the Procedural Bleeding Risk**

When evaluating bleeding risk, it is imperative to consider the type of surgery and clinical characteristics of the patient. These characteristics are assessed with the HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal liver or kidney function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile International Normalized Ratio [INR], elderly, drugs, alcohol) score. Each positive item earns 1 point, and a HAS-BLED score > 3 indicates a high bleeding risk. The BNK Online Bridging Registry (BORDER) study assessed the possible predictors of perioperative bleeding in patients undergoing invasive cardiac procedures. They found that the HAS-BLED score is a reliable predictor of perioperative bleeding (HR 11.8, 95% CI 5.6-24.9).

**Determine Whether or Not Interrupt Anticoagulation or Antithrombotic Therapy**The balance between risks and benefits of anticoagulation interruption is the right approach to this decision. Clinical judgment is imperative, as there is no score or calculator to determine the classification of the patient straightforwardly.

As a generalized consideration, patients with a high risk of bleeding will benefit from anticoagulation interruption.

In patients with a recent episode of VTE (less than 1 month ago), the risk of recurrence in the subsequent month can be as high as 40%. An elective surgical procedure should be deferred up to 3 months after an episode of VTE, if possible. For patients with a recent acute ischemic stroke undergoing non-cardiac elective surgical procedures, the risk of having a major cardiovascular event after surgery is high, especially within the first 3 months. The American College of Surgeons recommends deferring the surgery up to 9 months in this scenario when the risk of cardiac events has plateaued after a stroke.

Another common scenario is the patient with coronary stents, most of which are on dual anti-aggregation. Approximately 5% of these patients will require surgery during the next year after coronary stent implantation. If aspirin and thienopyridine need to be suspended during the perioperative period, the elective surgical procedure should be delayed 6 weeks for patients with bare-metal stents and 6 months for drug-eluting stents.

Despite limited evidence, there are scenarios where anticoagulation therapy continuation is preferable in patients with low bleeding risk. Dental procedures are considered low bleeding risk procedures. The majority of evidence comes from patients receiving warfarin with a therapeutic INR range. The studies conclude that continuing anticoagulation therapy is safe, not only in dental extraction but in other types of dental procedures and that bridging therapy could be related to even more bleeding associated with these procedures.

Endovascular procedures (venous and arterial angioplasty, angiography, catheter ablation for AF, and atherectomy) studies were analyzed in a meta-analysis of 20,000 patients on warfarin anticoagulation.

Implantation of prosthetic cardiac devices is also considered low bleeding risk procedures. Two studies, the BRUISE CONTROL 1 and 2, have addressed this scenario. The first study examined uninterrupted anticoagulation vs. warfarin interruption and a low therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (1 mg per kg/twice daily of enoxaparin) in patients undergoing pacemaker implantation. The patients with uninterrupted warfarin had a lower incidence of pocket hematoma complications compared with the group that received bridging therapy with LMWH (3.5% vs. 16%, P <0.01).

**Determine Whether or Not Bridging Anticoagulation**

Bridging anticoagulation consists of the substitution of a long-acting anticoagulant (usually with warfarin) for a shorter-acting anticoagulant (usually LMWH) to limit the time of subtherapeutic anticoagulation levels and minimize thromboembolic risk

- The patient with a mechanical heart valve: Mitral valve replacement, aortic valve replacement with additional risk factors (stroke, TIA, cardioembolic event, or intracardiac thrombus), more than 2 mechanical valves.

- Patients with stroke, episode of systemic emboli, or VTE during the last 3 months. Patients presenting with a thromboembolic event after interruption of chronic anticoagulation therapy or those presenting with VTE while on therapeutic anticoagulation.

- Patients with atrial fibrillation and CHA2DS2VASc score > 5 plus additional cardiovascular risk factors (rheumatic valve disease, stroke, or systemic embolism within the last 12 weeks). A CHA2DS2VASc score > 6 with or without additional risk factors.

- Patients with recent coronary stenting (within the previous 12 weeks)

Evidence on bridging therapy follows a trend against its use. Sigeal et al. (2012) performed a meta-analysis of 34 studies, most of them were observational. Despite the criticism of this meta-analysis for its heterogeneity of studies, interesting conclusions were drawn. Regarding the risk of thromboembolism, there was no statistically significant difference between patients that received bridging therapy and those who did not receive bridging therapy(OR:0.80; 95% CI 0.42-1.54). However, the risk of major bleeding had a threefold increase in patients that received bridging therapy compared with patients who did not (OR: 3.60; 95% CI 1.52-8.50).

Large studies of anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation, such as the RE-LY study (warfarin vs. dabigatran), showed that patients on warfarin who received bridging therapy had more thromboembolic events compared with those that did not receive bridging therapy (1.8 vs. 0.3%). Patients that received warfarin plus bridging therapy had a higher risk of major bleeding (warfarin plus bridging therapy 6.8%; warfarin without bridging 1.6%), compared with patients that received dabigatran plus bridging therapy (dabigatran plus bridging therapy 6.5%; dabigatran without bridging therapy 1.8%).

In the BRIDGE (Bridging anticoagulation in patients who require temporary interruption of warfarin therapy for elective surgery) study, 1,884 patients with AF requiring interruption of warfarin anticoagulation therapy were allocated to either a dalteparin or placebo group. There was no difference between groups in arterial thromboembolic events at 30 days after surgery (0.3 vs. 0.4). However, the incidence of major bleeding was higher in the dalteparin bridging group (3.2% vs. 1.3%, P <0.01), as was minor bleeding (20.9% vs. 12.0%, P <0.01). This study was criticized for the exclusion of high thromboembolic risk patients.

The PERIOP-2 study examined whether there is any benefit of bridging therapy after surgery. This study was a randomized clinical trial of 1,471 enrolled patients, 304 of which had a mechanical valve (99 of these had AF at the same time). There were no significant differences for major thromboembolic episodes between dalteparin and placebo (0.71% vs. 1.11%, respectively). For episodes of major bleeding, this study showed no benefit of using dalteparin vs. placebo during the postoperative period (1.46% vs. 2.46%, respectively).
