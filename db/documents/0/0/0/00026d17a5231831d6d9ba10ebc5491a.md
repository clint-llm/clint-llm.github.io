Although the exact in vivo mechanism of toxicity remains unestablished, PTX is known to have vasoconstrictive, neurotoxic, and metabolic effects through dysregulation of ion pumps (e.g., the sodium-potassium ATPase, sodium-calcium exchangers, and sodium-hydrogen exchangers) which can lead to cell death.

These molecular interactions likely cause corneal epithelial death upon exposure. Disruption of the corneal epithelium can lead to marginal ulcers and large ring-shaped inflammatory response and swelling of the stromal layer and associated keratitis. Additionally, during the wound healing process, corneal myofibroblasts express high levels of alpha-actin, which may be disrupted by PTX, slowing the bodyâ€™s therapeutic process.
