Pregnant women with polyhydramnios should be informed that the condition is defined as an abnormal increase in the amniotic fluid in pregnancy. They should be well informed on the maternal and fetal morbidities associated with this condition. Patient information leaflets should be given to pregnant women with polyhydramnios. They should be informed that if the amniotic fluid volume is above the normal range for gestational age, further assessment of the baby's stomach, kidneys, and bladder is needed to exclude any significant problems. Women should be counseled about the need to exclude GDM via requesting laboratory tests, as it is one of the identified underlying causes of polyhydramnios. The involvement of pregnant women and their families in making informed decisions about their care is an integral part of managing polyhydramnios during pregnancy.
