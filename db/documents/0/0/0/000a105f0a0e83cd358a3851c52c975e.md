The undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) —formerly known as malignant fibrous histiocytoma, is a high-grade aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma (STS). Mesenchymal stem cells are the most likely origin of the tumor, instead of histiocytes as previously thought.

Prior subclassifications of MFH into storiform, pleomorphic, myxoid, giant cell, and angiomatoid variants are now rarely utilized. The definition of this tumor has been a matter of debate for more than five decades. Hence, a significant limitation of the historical literature is that only the most recent studies can confidently characterize this entity. At present, UPS is diagnosed by excluding other well-classified STSs.
