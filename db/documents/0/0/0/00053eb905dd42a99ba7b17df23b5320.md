Some entities can be mistaken for an odontoid fracture. It is important to recognize these to avoid unnecessary interventions.

**Os Odontoideum**

Os odontoideum is aÂ recognized anatomical variant of the normal C2 odontoid process. During the development, there are multiple ossification centers in the spine, with one being in the odontoid process, one in the odontoid tip, and one in the vertebral body. If the ossification centers in the odontoid process and the vertebral body fail to fuse, then the odontoid process (dens) can appear to be detached from the vertebral body and mimic a type II odontoid fracture. In younger children, complete ossification of the spine has not yet occurred, and the normal growth pattern and ossification can also mimic a type II odontoid fracture.

**Persistent Ossiculum Terminale**

The rostral tip of the odontoid process has a separate ossification center during development from the remaining odontoid process. When the two ossification centers fail to fuse, there can be a persistent gap between the odontoid process and the tip of the odontoid process, which can mimic a type I odontoid fracture.
