**Genetic testing:**

Molecular genetic testing is the confirmatory test and should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

**Temporal Bone Findings:**

Affected individuals have temporal bone abnormalities, which can be identified by thin-cut CT with detailed cochlear anatomy.

The enlarged vestibular aqueduct is measurable by high-resolution CT of the temporal bone with coronal and axial sections. COnfirmation of vestibular aqueduct enlargement is if the width of the middle portion of the descending limb of the vestibular aqueduct over 1.5 mm.

**Thyroid Findings:**Euthyroid goiter is the typical thyroid abnormality in Pendred syndrome, and it is detected by volumetric studies to assess the size of the gland, thyroid ultrasound helps to evaluate the volume of the thyroid gland and characterize the size and structure of the nodules.

Perchlorate test is a screening test for iodide organification defects done by administering radioactive iodine and measuring the intrathyroidal radioactive iodine content. If it is less than 10%, it suggests an organification defect. However, a negative test does not rule out the diagnosis of Pendred syndrome because multiple factors can affect the results. One of the factors is the previous use of high-dose iodine intake, which can interfere with the testing.
