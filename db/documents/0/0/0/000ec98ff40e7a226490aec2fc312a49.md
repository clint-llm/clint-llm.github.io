Streptococcal meningitis is a severe, life-threatening infection. It may pose a diagnostic challenge, especially in infants, because these patients may exhibit non-specific signs. The most vital for a patient outcome is fast diagnosis and treatment. Doctors who work in primary care facilities should educate their patients about alarming symptoms of meningitis. While the pediatrician or internist is almost always involved in the care of patients with streptococcal meningitis, it is essential to cooperate with other specialists that include infectious disease experts or anesthesiologists if needed. The nurses are also vital members of the interprofessional group, as they will monitor the patient's vital signs. Laboratory professionals play an essential role in establishing the diagnosis of causative agents. A physiotherapist is also needed to reduce the neurological burden of streptococcal meningitis. A board-certified infectious disease pharmacist can review antibiotic choices with the clinician, using the latest antibiogram data. They can also check for interactions, verify dosing and duration, and communicate with the rest of the team regarding potential adverse events. Interprofessional team efforts are necessary to improve outcomes for patients. [Level 5]
