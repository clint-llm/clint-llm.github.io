Treatment of cervical radiculopathy should be approached in a stepwise fashion. Also, while surgery can provide significant relief, there is little evidence that surgery provides a clear advantage over non-surgical treatment in an acute setting. Over 85% of acute cervical radiculopathy resolves without any specific treatments within 8-12 weeks.

Over 85% of acute cervical radiculopathy resolves without any specific treatments within 8-12 weeks.  However, in order to facilitate reduced inflammation of the nerve root(s) and improve radiculopathy, it is important to implement non-surgical treatments including oral anti-inflammatory drugs,  physical therapy, and translaminar epidural steroid injections.

An aggressive, well-designed physical therapy program can provide significant relief. In the setting of surgical intervention physical therapy can speed recovery.

Medical durable goods and appliances can provide significant symptom relief. Nighttime use of a cervical pillow can provide symptom relief and make sleeping easier during recovery. Short term use of a soft cervical collar can provide some support and relief.

Since the main cause of pain in cervical radiculopathy is inflammation use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for 1 to 2 weeks can provide not only symptom relief but also treat the proximate cause. The use of oral steroids is controversial, and dosing should be short term if at all. Tricyclic antidepressants and drugs such as gabapentin can be useful adjuncts in the treatment of cervical radiculopathy. Opioid pain medications are not recommended but can have utility in the management of radicular pain. It should be noted that the use of opioid medications is a risk factor for the slow recovery and delayed return to work for patients where surgical intervention becomes clinically necessary.

Studies have shown that epidural steroids can provide significant relief and speed return to normal functioning for many patients. Relief from a single treatment can be significant and long-lasting. Half of the patients treated have reported relief of at least 50% for weeks following injection.

Using acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy also has shown to provide significant relief of symptoms. A direct physical manipulative technique such as chiropractic or direct osteopathic manipulation can worsen radicular symptoms. Indirect osteopathic techniques conversely can facilitate relief of symptoms.

Surgical management of radicular pain can provide relief in patients that are failed non-surgical treatments. Surgical techniques can be done utilizing anterior or posterior approaches.  Usually, the anterior approach requires complete discectomies filled by fusion or disc replacements.  The posterior approach involves laminectomy, partial discectomy, and foraminotomy with or without fusion. Both approaches are found to be effective.  As always, surgical treatments are reserved for failed non-surgical treatments and patients have acute deterioration of their neurological function.   No matter the approach, surgery-related complications can occur including complications caused by anesthesia or complications from the procedure itself including nerve palsies, vascular impairment, and laryngeal nerve damage.
