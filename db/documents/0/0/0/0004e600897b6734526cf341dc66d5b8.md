Attention should be paid to vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation) after administering a test dose to ensure that the local anesthetic is not intravascular. Cardiovascular and respiratory vital signs should be monitored after each local anesthetic injection. Restlessness, anxiety, perioral paresthesias, metallic taste, tinnitus, tremors, and blurred vision are a few of the early signs of central nervous system toxicity.
