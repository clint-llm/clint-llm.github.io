Tracheal resection is performed when tracheal stenosis is unresponsive to conservative management, such as balloon dilation and scar excision. Tracheal resection and cricotracheal resection are two surgical approaches, depending on the location of the stenosis. Repair indications include stenosis secondary to prolonged intubation, tracheostomy, tracheal tumors, airway trauma, tracheoesophageal fistula, tracheoinnominate fistulas, and idiopathic laryngotracheal stenosis (ILTS). This activity reviews the evaluation and management of tracheal stenosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures involved in tracheal resection.
- Outline the technique in regards to tracheal resection.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications with tracheal resection.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance tracheal resection and improve outcomes.
