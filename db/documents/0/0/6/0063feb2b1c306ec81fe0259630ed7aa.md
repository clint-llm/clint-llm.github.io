Lab tests needed before starting androgen replacement include Hemoglobin (Hgb), Hematocrit (Hct), Liver Functional Tests (LFTs), lipid panels, DRE, PSA level, two-morning testosterone levels, and consider a DEXA scan. Monitoring should be done as follows

- One month after treatment: morning testosterone level

- Three to six months after treatment during one year: morning testosterone level, LFTs, lipid profile, PSA, DRE, estradiol, Hgb, and Hct, blood pressure

- Annually after one year: morning testosterone level, LFTs, lipid profile, DRE, PSA, estradiol, Hgb, and Hct, blood pressure

Referral to urology is recommended if there is an increase in PSA level greater than 1.4 ng/mL within any 12 months. If hematocrit rises above 54%, stop therapy as soon as possible.
