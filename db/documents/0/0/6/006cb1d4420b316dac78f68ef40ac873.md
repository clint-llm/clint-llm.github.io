Cryptorchidism is an important disorder to recognize early in life not only to preserve sterility but also to reduce the risk of testicular cancer. Unless the surgeon can surgically bring the testes back into the scrotum where it can be under surveillance, the undescended testes should be removed. It is also important to know that there is an increased risk of cancer in the contralateral testes and hence regular self-examinations are highly recommended.

Sometimes serous fluid can accumulate in between the layers of the tunica vaginalis leading to a hydrocele. This could be triggered by inflammation, trauma or a congenital cause due to persistent communication with the abdominal cavity.

In young men, testicular torsion is a surgical emergency. The blood supply must be restored within 6 hours of the start of symptoms; the testes need to be fixed in the scrotum to prevent recurrence. Most urologists will also fix the contralateral testes at the same time.

The descent of the testes may be delayed or arrested along the course in the inguinal canal and may be complicated by an inguinal hernia.  All true undescended testes will have associated inguinal hernias.  This is not true for retractile testicles.
