**Liver Transplantation and Consultation to Hepatologist**

Safe pregnancy has been reported in women post-liver transplantation; however, it is advisable to wait for at least a year before attempting pregnancy. This is to provide enough time post-liver transplant for immunosuppressive agents to reach safer profiles. Patients with renal dysfunction in the setting of a liver transplant are associated with poor maternal-fetus outcomes. Increased surveillance for general and opportunistic infection should be done in this population during pregnancy. Breastfeeding should be avoided while taking immunosuppressive medications. Although liver transplant during pregnancy (in a condition such as HELLP or AFLP) has been reported, it is a veryÂ high-risk procedure that is usually managed with pregnancy termination as maternal survival and support are the priority.

Early consultation and involvement of a hepatologist are recommended to manage the liver disease during pregnancy. Pregnant women with liver disease should be educated on the potential risk and complications that may happen during pregnancy. Detailed counseling about the mode of delivery and future pregnancy risk should also be discussed with the patient.
