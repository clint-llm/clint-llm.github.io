Biotin deficiency management essentially means treating the cause. Lifelong treatment with biotin supplements is required in patients with genetic disorders disrupting biotin metabolism, such as holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency and biotinidase deficiency. If the deficiency is related to excess consumption of raw eggs, it should be stopped, and biotin replacement should ensue. Change anticonvulsants if the deficiency is because of the use of a particular anticonvulsant. Similarly, those on prolonged oral antibiotic therapy may benefit from biotin supplementation.

Oral biotin supplements have high bioavailability. Usually, a dose of 5 mg/day is given regardless of the etiology of biotin deficiency.

Practitioners should be aware that biotin requirements may increase during anticonvulsant therapy.

In the cases of holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency detected antenatally, antenatal biotin treatment has been found to be very useful.
