AF is associated with a high risk of thromboembolism and death. Evidence shows that rhythm control does not offer a survival advantage over rate control. Patients with AF have multiple admissions and anticoagulation-related complications over their lifetime. The risk of stroke is ever-present, and the overall quality of life of patients is poor.Â  Finally, the management of atrial fibrillation is prohibitively expensive, with most of the financial burden borne by the patient.
