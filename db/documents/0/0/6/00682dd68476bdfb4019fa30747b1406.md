**Indication**

Hearing aids can be used to treat the majority of hearing impairments. The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK state that hearing aids should be offered to adults whose hearing loss affects their ability to communicate and hear, including awareness of warning sounds, their environment, and listening to music. Therefore, hearing aids may be indicated in various pathologies that cause sensorineural hearing loss, conductive hearing loss, or single-sided hearing loss.

**Selection**

There are various hearing aids, and their selection is not a ‘one-size fits all’ approach. Selection is influenced by factors that include audiometric deficit (laterality, frequency, and degree of loss), cosmesis, and the patient’s needs, lifestyle, and priorities.

**Behind the ear (BTE)**hearing aids sit behind the pinna. A plastic tube connects the hearing aid to an earmold or ‘open’ silicone ear tip according to the patient's needs. They are commonly used because they are capable of various levels of amplification, and their power and performance can be modified relatively easily.

The **receiver in the canal****(RIC)**hearing aids are similar to the BTE, except the receiver is located at an ‘open’ silicone earpiece that sits in the canal, rather than inside the hearing aid casing near the microphone and amplifier. This set up allows higher amplification levels without the risk of acoustic feedback (sound escaping the canal and circling back through the hearing aid again), thus more suited to patients with high frequency ‘ski-slope’ hearing losses and those who prioritize cosmetics of the device. They also provide a clearer and more natural sound, amplifying higher frequencies better, with less occlusion of low frequencies (as the ear canal is kept ‘open’).

**In the ear (ITE),****in the canal (ITC),**and**completely in the canal (CIC),**hearing aids are broadly grouped as custom-shape hearing aids. These are the most discrete hearing aids and, therefore, advantageous in a patient population that prefers an improved aesthetic. They can be used in a range of hearing losses, and because the receiver is closer to the eardrum, there is better amplification of high frequencies, important for speech discrimination.

Finally, **contralateral routing of signals (CROS)**and**bilateral contralateral routing of signals (BiCROS)**are used for unilateral hearing loss and asymmetrical hearing loss, respectively, in cases where a conventional hearing aid provides little benefit. Here, a microphone is placed on the side of worse hearing, and the signal is transmitted to the better hearing ear, where this signal is amplified. For BiCROS, used in asymmetrical hearing loss (e.g.mild-moderate on one side and severe-profound on the other), there are two microphones, one on each ear, with sound from both microphones amplified into the better hearing ear.
