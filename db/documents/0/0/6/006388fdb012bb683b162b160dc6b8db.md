The inferior and superior parathyroid glands originate from the third and fourth branchial or pharyngeal pouches, respectively. The 4 glands, weighing approximately 20 to 40 g each, are located posterior to the thyroid. The superior glands are typically found mid-thyroid and approximately 1 cm above the intersection of the inferior thyroid artery and recurrent laryngeal nerve. The inferior glands can be more variable in location, as they develop with the thymus and can be found at any point along the path of its descent. However, theyÂ are most commonly found in the inferior third of the thyroid. Both the superior and inferior glands are supplied by the inferior thyroid artery, which originates laterally from the thyrocervical trunk. In 20 to 45% of cases, the superior glands may also receive blood supply from the superior thyroid artery directly or through an anastomotic connection to the inferior thyroid artery.
