The many functions of ghrelin have stimulated interest in several potential clinical applications including obesity, anorexia, COPD, cancer cachexia, gastroparesis, growth hormone deficiency, alcohol addiction, and many others.

Given its functions in appetite regulation, the role of ghrelin in obesity is of great interest. Multiple studies have demonstrated that, in obese individuals, there is inadequate postprandial suppression of ghrelin, leading to a continued sense of hunger and difficulty losing weight.

Ghrelin has therapeutic potential for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Emphysema, a subtype of  COPD, involves lung damage and dilation as well as extrapulmonary effects including cor pulmonale. Given ghrelin’s anti-inflammatory effects, stimulation of muscle anabolism, vasodilatory effects, and cardio-protective functions, it is being considered as a way to reduce lung inflammation and improve cardiac function in patients with emphysema.

Ghrelin has also gained interest as both a diagnostic measure and treatment in cancer. Studies have found that nearly all gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors stain for ghrelin, which has led to an interest in ghrelin as a marker for therapeutic response.

Another potential clinical application of ghrelin is in the treatment of gastroparesis, a disease characterized by delayed gastric emptying causing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, pain, early satiety, and bloating. Ghrelin receptor agonists have been a topic of research as a treatment for gastroparesis due to ghrelin’s prokinetic effects on gastrointestinal motility.

Due to ghrelin's growth hormone-stimulating effects, oral ghrelin mimetics have already received approval for diagnostic use in adult growth hormone deficiency. Clinical studies using this method have proven reliable, safe, and simple; this provides a useful alternative to the insulin tolerance test (the historical gold standard for adult growth hormone deficiency), which can be inconvenient and has contraindications in some patients such as those with conditions such as coronary heart disease or seizure disorder.

Because ghrelin is involved in reward-processing, the ghrelin system is also being studied as a target in the context of alcohol misuse disorder. Rodent studies have found that administration of ghrelin increased alcohol intake, while ghrelin receptor blockade had the opposite effect. Preliminary studies involving heavy users of alcohol have found that ghrelin administration increases alcohol cravings, while PF-5190457, a GHS-R1-alpha-blocker, appeared to reduce cravings.
