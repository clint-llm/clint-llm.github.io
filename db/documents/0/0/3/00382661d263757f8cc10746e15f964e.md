The lumbrical muscles of the hand are a group of four intrinsic hand muscles. Due to their cylindrical, “worm-like” appearance, the lumbricals are named after the earthworm genus Lumbricus. All four lumbricals flex their respective metacarpophalangeal joint and extend the proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints. The lumbricals are unique in that both their origins and insertions are tendons (Figure 1). Another peculiarity is that fact that the lumbricals arise from their partial antagonist, the flexor digitorum profundus.
