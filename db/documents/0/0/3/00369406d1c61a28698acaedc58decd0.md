The diagnosis of essential tremor is based upon clinical features and exclusion of alternative diagnosis. The core criteria require either a bilateral action tremor of the hands and forearms and the absence of other neurologic signs. Other information strongly suggestive of essential tremor includes long duration (more than 3 years) of the tremor, a positive family history of essential tremor, and beneficial response to alcohol.

The evaluation relies on a detailed neurologic examination to identify specific features of the tremor, including its frequency, amplitude, pattern, and distribution, and to identify other neurologic findings if present. Precipitating, aggravating, or relieving factors such as caffeine, alcohol, medications, exercise, fatigue, or stress should be elicited; a complete list of all medications should be reviewed to exclude the possibility of enhanced physiologic tremor.

There are no specific biomarkers or findings from neuroimaging or other ancillary investigations for confirming the diagnosis of essential tremor, but testing may be appropriate to exclude other causes of tremor. Laboratory evaluation may include tests of thyroid function, urinary copper, and ceruloplasmin to exclude Wilson disease, screening for heavy metal poisoning such as lead if any of these causes are suspected.

Brain imaging can be useful in patients suspected clinically of having a structural cause for tremors, such as Wilson disease, brain trauma, stroke, or mass lesion, but otherwise is not indicated. Striatal dopamine transporter imaging using ioflupane I123 injection single-photon emission tomography can reliably distinguish patients with Parkinson disease and other parkinsonian syndromes associated with nigrostriatal degeneration, for example, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration from patients with essential tremor.
