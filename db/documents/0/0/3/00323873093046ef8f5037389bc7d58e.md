The digastrics serve as a significant surgical landmark in neck dissections; the posterior belly is used to help identify the course of the spinal accessory nerve, internal jugular vein, carotid arteries, and hypoglossal nerve. It can also help identify ansa cervicalis in reconstruction cases. The anterior belly of the digastric is often included in submental flaps during facial reconstruction, as the submental vessels frequently course deep to the muscle. The intermediate tendon of the digastric can be attached to the tongue to help avoid stridor and subsequent need for tracheostomy in patients who undergo resection of the anterior mandibular arch. The digastrics may be used as a flap to restore a symmetrical smile to those with injury to the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve.
