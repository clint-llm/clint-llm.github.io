**Non-Operative Management**

Non-operative management for blunt hepatic injury is the treatment of choice in hemodynamically stable patients as specified by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma Practice Management Guidelines. Non-operative therapy is appropriate only at a facility capable of hemodynamic monitoring, serial abdominal examinations, and an operating room that is immediately available for emergency laparotomy. Patients with blunt hepatic injury undergoing non-operative therapy must be monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) for a period with serial hematocrits, abdominal exams, nil per os, and bed rest. How frequently and for how long this should be carried out has not been established and varies by institution. In addition, several other unanswered questions in the non-operative management of blunt hepatic trauma exist. This includes when to resume a diet, how long to wait before starting chemical deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, and when the patient can resume full activities.

Patients with higher injury grades are more likely to fail non-operative management, with hemodynamic instability being the leading cause of failure in 75% of patients. However, failure of non-operative therapy does not necessarily mean the patient should undergo surgery as angiographic therapy can be effective.

Non-operative therapy may play a role in very select patients with penetrating injury who are hemodynamically stable. For penetrating trauma localized to the right upper quadrant, often the result stab wounds or low-velocity gunshot wounds, with low-grade injuries may be managed non-operatively. Other abdominal injuries must be excluded in these patients. Similar to blunt hepatic injured patients, they should undergo admission to an ICU with hemodynamic monitoring, serial laboratory evaluations, and abdominal exams.

**Angiographic Embolization**

Angiography with selective embolization is an effective treatment for patients undergoing non-operative therapy of bleeding liver injuries, especially those with blunt hepatic injuries. Success rates for angiography and embolization are as high as 83%. No clear consensus guidelines exist as to when and in which patients to perform angiography with embolization. Some trauma surgeons prefer to do angiography and embolization in any blunt hepatic injury higher than grade III. In contrast, others will only do so if there is contrast extravasation on a CT scan.

**Operative Management**

Hemodynamically unstable patients, not responsive to resuscitation, should go directly from the trauma bay to the operating room for laparotomy. In addition, patients with peritoneal signs should go to the operating room. Patients that fail non-operative therapy must undergo laparotomy. Damage control laparotomy principles should be followed in the unstable patient undergoing laparotomy. This includes first controlling hemorrhage, then controlling gastrointestinal (GI) contamination. The abdomen should be packed in all 4 quadrants, allowing for injuries to be localized and the anesthesia team to resuscitate the patient. The “lethal triad” of coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia should trigger a damage control approach.

Some temporizing measures can be taken to minimize blood loss from hepatic injuries. The liver can be manually compressed together with the surgeon’s hands on each side of the fracture, allowing for the raw edges to be pushed together. Peri-hepatic packing can also be carried out by placing laparotomy pads in the space between the liver and diaphragm and around the anterior and lateral sides of the liver to reapproximate raw edges of injured parenchyma. Patients that require peri-hepatic packing have a high rate of mortality. For severe bleeding that cannot be controlled, a Pringle maneuver may be helpful. This involves placing a non-crushing vascular clamp on the porta hepatis to occlude the hepatic artery and portal vein. If this results in decreased hemorrhage, then bleeding is likely related to the hepatic inflow vessels. However, if bleeding continues despite the Pringle maneuver, then bleeding is from injury to the hepatic vein or retrohepatic inferior vena cava (IVC). The Pringle maneuver should be released every 20 to 30 minutes to allow intermittent perfusion of the hepatic maneuver. The Pringle maneuver can be combined with the finger fracture technique to control bleeding from liver lacerations.

With more destructive injuries, ligation of the feeding hepatic artery or an anatomic hepatic lobectomy may be necessary. Selective ligation of the right or left hepatic artery just beyond the bifurcation of the proper hepatic artery can be used to manage bleeding that has been localized to one of the hepatic lobes. In desperate circumstances, non-selective ligation of the common hepatic artery can be indicated. It is important to make sure that flow through the portal vein is intact prior to carrying out non-selective ligation. Given the liver’s dual blood supply, hepatic ischemia is not likely after common hepatic artery ligation. In a damage control situation, the above temporizing maneuvers may allow for rapid, temporary abdominal closure and transfer of the patient to the ICU for continued resuscitation and reversal of the “lethal trial.” Angiography with embolization can also be used as an adjunct treatment with damage control laparotomy.

In patients not undergoing damage control laparotomy, other hemostatic techniques can be used. Fractured parenchyma can be reapproximated with suture hepatorrhaphy. The hepatic wound should be explored, and any injured bile duct radicals should be identified and ligated with suture or clips. Similarly, damaged blood vessels can be identified and ligated or clipped. For grade II or III injuries, a chromic suture on a 1-0 or 2-0 blunt needle can be used to approximate the laceration. Gleeson’s capsule provides the tensile strength for the suture. For deeper lacerations, omentum can be packed into the injured parenchyma and sutured into place with simple sutures. Commercial hemostatic agents can also be placed on injured parenchyma to help maintain hemostasis. Closed suction drains can be left into place at the discretion of the surgeon to control potential bile leaks or hepatic necrosis.

**Adjunct Treatments**

Other therapies can be used to treat patients with traumatic liver injuries. For example, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can be used to identify and treat bile duct injuries, whether done pre- or post-operatively. Stents can be placed at the time of ERCP to help treat bile duct lacerations. In addition, bile duct stents can be placed to decrease hepatic parenchymal bile leak and facilitate healing of injured bile ducts.

Interventional radiology (IR) can also be used as an adjunct for hepatic trauma. Bilomas or hepatic abscesses can develop as a result of traumatic injury or as a complication of angioembolization and hepatic necrosis. Closed suction drains can be placed by IR to drain infections or bilious fluid collections.
