When ingested orally, strychnine is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract. It has transient detectable levels in the blood but rapidly distributes to the tissues. It is metabolized predominantly in the liver and partially excreted by the kidneys. Strychnine follows first-order kinetics with a half-life of 10 to 16 hours and volume of distribution of 13 L/kg. The median lethal dose is 1.5 mg/kg. Post-mortem assays find highest concentrations in the hepatobiliary system. Urine and gastric measurements are most useful to test for exposure, and blood assays are unreliable.
