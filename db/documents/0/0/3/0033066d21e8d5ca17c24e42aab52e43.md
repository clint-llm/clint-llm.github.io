History is essential in differentiating the pathology of peroneal tendons. It is necessary to identify the timing, aggravating position or activity, any traumatic events if there is associated swelling, as well as a description of the pain. A common pertinent history finding is a description of snapping or popping at the lateral malleolus. Patients must undergo screening for prior steroid injections and history of recent antibiotic use; Fluoroquinolones and steroids have associations with tendon disease.

Physical exam should begin with an inspection of the ankle and foot for erythema or swelling, muscle strength testing of eversion and plantar flexion. The examiner can isolate the peroneus longus tendon by resisting active eversion through applying pressure to the medial first metatarsal head. Palpation of the tendons during ROM of the ankle. Evaluation of hindfoot biomechanics such as varus and valgus alignment should take place with the patient standing.

Peroneal tendonitis presents with gradual onset of pain and swelling. There may be palpable fluid present in the tendon sheath with crepitation. The primary location of tenderness is along the peroneal tendons as they pass posterior and inferior to the fibular head. Tendon tears often have constant swelling, pain, or patient feeling of ankle instability or weakness. Tendon subluxation patients will have painful clicking and popping at the lateral malleolus. Subluxation may be apparent with voluntary eversion.
