The diagnosis and management of strychnine poisoning is best done with an interprofessional team that includes poison control, neurologist, an emergency department physician, ICU nurses, an internist, and a toxicologist. The treatment should follow the ATLS guidelines.Â  In ingestions that present acutely within the first few hours, activated charcoal or gastric lavage can be considered. Caution should be used when performing gastrointestinal decontamination as manipulation may provoke seizures.

Barbiturates and benzodiazepines can be used to control muscle contractions in cases of mild to moderate toxicity. Patients should be intubated and paralyzed with nondepolarizing paralytic agents if convulsions are uncontrollable and causing hyperthermia or acidemia. Generous intravenous fluid hydration should be administered for the treatment rhabdomyolysis. If intubation is required for airway protection, succinylcholine should be avoided given the potential for hyperkalemia.

Outcomes

In the case of minor to moderate exposures, recovery is usually complete with no neurologic or musculoskeletal sequela. For those who sustain severe neurological or musculoskeletal deficits, the recovery can be prolonged and associated with permanent disability.
