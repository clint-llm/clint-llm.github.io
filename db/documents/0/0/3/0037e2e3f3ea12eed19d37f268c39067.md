Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) are a spectrum of diseases that range from self-limiting, localized conditions to aggressive lymphomas. Epstein-Barr virus is a ubiquitous organism, achieving asymptomatic lifelong carrier status in a large proportion of the world's population. The pathophysiology of this latent infection is due to the interaction of EBV with the memory B cells of a healthy, immunocompetent individual. Disruptions in the balance of this interaction are believed to result in the lymphoproliferation of various cell derivatives. EBV positive mucocutaneous ulcer (EBVMCU) is an indolent condition on this spectrum of LPDs, which localizes to the skin and mucosal surfaces. It is a rare lymphoproliferation that gained recognition as a new entity in the 2016 revisions to the World Health Organization classifications.
