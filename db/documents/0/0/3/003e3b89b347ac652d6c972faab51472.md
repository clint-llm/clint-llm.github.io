Researchers believe that the collection of findings that constitute the diagnosis of Heyde syndrome is the direct result of increased circulatory shear forces and its effect on the physiologic confirmation and subsequent cleavage of large von Willebrand (VWF) multimers. In Heyde syndrome, increased shear forces are caused by stenosis at the aortic valve, although reports exist of similar pathophysiologic changes from other cardiac etiologies that result in increased circulatory turbulence, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, complications of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement, and severe mitral regurgitation.
