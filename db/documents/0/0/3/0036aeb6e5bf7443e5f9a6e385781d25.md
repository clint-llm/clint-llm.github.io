**External ear:**

The pinna and external auditory canal are the main structures of the external ear. The pinna derives from the ectoderm, specifically from branchial arches 1 and 2. The external auditory canal forms from the 1st branchial groove.

**Middle ear:**

The tympanic cavity and ossicles make up the middle ear. The tympanic cavity derives from the endoderm of the 1st pharyngeal pouch. The ossicles consist of three structures: the malleus, incus, and stapes. The malleus and incus come from the mesenchyme of the 1st branchial arch whereas stapes from the second branchial arch.

**Inner ear:**

The inner ear develops from a thickened portion of the ectoderm close to the hindbrain.
