Tricuspid stenosis (TS) is a very rare valvular abnormality occurring due to the narrowing of the tricuspid valve. It results in an elevated gradient between the right atrium and right ventricle, systemic congestion, and failure to augment right ventricle output. The isolated occurrence is rare, and tricuspid stenosis usually accompanies other valvular abnormalities.Â It most often co-exists with mitral valve pathology, especially in patients with rheumatic heart disease.
