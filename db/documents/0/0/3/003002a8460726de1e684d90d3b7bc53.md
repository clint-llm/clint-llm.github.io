Miliaria, also known as eccrine miliaria, heat rash, prickly heat, or sweat rash, is a frequently seen skin condition triggered by blocked eccrine sweat glands and ducts. The blockage leads to backflow of eccrine sweat into the dermis or epidermis, resulting in a rash comprised of sweat-filled vesicles under the skin. This activity reviews when this diagnosis should be considered, how to manage it, and the role of the interprofessional care team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of miliaria.
- Describe the signs and symptoms of miliaria.
- Explain how to distinguish miliaria from conditions that are more clinically concerning and require treatment.
- Summarize the importance of optimizing coordination amongst the interprofessional team to ensure appropriate evaluation and management of miliaria.
