CT (computed tomogram):

Even though CT can help us in visualizing some anatomical changes in the brain, it is not possible to diagnose normal pressure hydrocephalus with this imaging modality alone.

MRI (magnetic resonance imaging):

MRI is the investigational imaging of choice for normal pressure hydrocephalus to image the structural changes. CSF flow studies and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can support the diagnosis of iNPH.

The following findings in MRI brain may be suggestive of NPH:

Evans index: It is a frontal horn ratio defined as the maximal frontal horn ventricular width divided by the transverse inner diameter of the skull; it signifies ventricular enlargement if it is greater than or equal to 0.3.

Callosal angle: This angle should be between 40 to 90 degrees in patients with iNPH.

Size of temporal horns: Disproportionate widening of the ventricles in comparison to the cerebral sulci may be present. Normal fourth ventricle size in the presence of lateral and third ventricle enlargement need not be indicative of aqueductal stenosis and is a finding consistent with NPH. Dilatation of temporal horns not entirely attributable to hippocampus atrophy.

Narrow high-convexity sulci: A coronal section at the level of the posterior commissure shows a narrowed subarachnoid space surrounding the outer brain surface (a “tight convexity”) and narrow medial cisterns.

Dilated Sylvian fissures

Focally dilated sulci (disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus - DESH)

Peri-ventricular hypodensities in CT or T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities in MRI: Represents transependymal edema due to elevated CSF pressure, but may also be seen in small vessel ischemic disease.

There is bulging of the lateral ventricular roof (upward bowing and stretching of the corpus callosum).

CSF flow study: the flow rate of greater than 24.5 mL/min is 95% specific for NPH. Aqueductal flow void seen in T2 weighted images due to increased CSF flow velocity is not a useful sign.

Factors suggesting favorable outcome following shunt surgery:

- Aqueductal stroke volume greater than 42 microliters

- Lack of white matter lesions on MRI

- B-waves longer than 50% of intracranial pressure monitoring time

- Resistance to CSF outflow over 18 mmHg

Factors suggesting unfavorable outcome following shunt surgery:

- Severe dementia

- Dementia as a presenting symptom

- MRI abnormalities, cerebral atrophy, and multiple white matter lesions

- Misdiagnosis and delayed recognition

Nuclear medicine studies:

Some of the non-specific signs seen in iNPH are:

- The heart-shaped appearance of lateral ventricles (normally shaped like a trident)

- persistence of tracer more than 24 to 48 hours in the ventricular system due to impaired absorption

- An absence of an extension of tracer onto the superior aspect of lateral ventricles

- Backflow of CSF into lateral ventricles

Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a promising imaging modality for diagnosing NPH and detecting concomitant degenerative disease.

Invasive diagnostic tests:

Tests of CSF drainage increase the diagnosis and the prognostic accuracy above 80%:

- Spinal tap test: Lumbar puncture removing of 30 to 70 mL of CSF, which is repeatable on two or three consecutive days.

- There is continuous subarachnoid drainage from the lumbar spine of 150 to 200 mL of CSF daily for 2 to 7 days. It has high sensitivity (50 to 100%) and high positive predictive value (80 to 100%).

These tests are considered to be positive if the number of steps the patient takes in a 10-meter gait test, and the time needed to walk 10 meters, are reduced by not less than 20%, and/or psychometric testing shows an improvement of at least 10%. Competent and experienced health professionals should do the CSF pre- and post-drainage evaluations.
