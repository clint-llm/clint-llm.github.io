Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are typically benign tumors that most commonly occur in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. While only comprising 0.1% to 3% of all GI malignancies, these tumors are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the GI tract. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of GISTs and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
-  Describe the etiology of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
- Review the imaging findings associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
- Explain the treatment considerations for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance understanding of gastrointestinal stromal tumors and improve outcomes.
