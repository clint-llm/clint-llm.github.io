The acute treatment of lacunar infarctions is like that of acute ischemic strokes. Within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, patients should receive intravenous (IV) alteplase therapy. The contraindications to IV thrombolysis are the same as those for other types of acute ischemic strokes, some of which include ischemic stroke/head trauma in the past 3 months, previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal (GI) malignancy or hemorrhage in the past 21 days, intracranial/spinal surgery in the past 3 months, and intra-axial intracranial neoplasm. For those patients not eligible for IV alteplase therapy, aspirin therapy is recommended. Otherwise, the acute treatment involves stabilization and early involvement of rehabilitation with speech and physical therapy.

The most important aspect of treatment for these patients is prevention. Aggressive blood pressure control, early high-dose statin therapy, and antiplatelet therapy are crucial. Anti-platelet therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, and fixed-dose aspirin with dipyramidalÂ are all acceptable medications. With the results of the CHANCE trial and the POINT trial, dual antiplatelet therapy for 3 weeks followed by single antiplatelet will provide the best scheme of therapy. More prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel + aspirin) has not been shown to decrease the risk of recurrent strokes and resulted in a significantly increased risk of bleeding and death.
