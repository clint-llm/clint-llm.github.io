111-Indium white blood cell scan may be utilized to detect and localize the site of infection and to correlate clinically with the patient presentation of various pathologic processes, including

- Prosthetic joint infection

- Vascular grafts

- Intra-abdominal infections

- Abscesses

- Endocarditis
