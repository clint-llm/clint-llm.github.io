After an acute traumatic injury to a limb, injury to blood vessels will lead to bleeding into tissues with subsequent coagulation and stasis in the vessels, which leads to hypoxia in the cells and the inability to maintain the metabolic demand important to maintain adequate intra-cellular water. The resulting edema causes increased pressure, causing more ischemia and hypoxia, leading to more cell death and extra-vascular water. Once blood flow is restored, subsequent ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs. The endothelial layer of the vessels becomes injured and fluid extravasates causing edema besides progressive obstruction of blood flow caused by neutrophils that adhere to the injured vessel wall.

Hyperbaric oxygen works in multiple ways to help with those acute changes at the cellular level. First, it produces vasoconstriction by about 20%, which means less inflow of fluid (blood and plasma)Â into the injured area, but since the dissolved oxygen in plasma is at least doubled (from that of breathing 100% oxygen by facemask), there is a net increase in oxygen delivery. This vasoconstriction results in less edema and increased oxygen diffusion distance. Hyperbaric oxygen, also, reduces the adhesion of neutrophils to the injured endothelium which blunts the ischemia-reperfusion injury.
