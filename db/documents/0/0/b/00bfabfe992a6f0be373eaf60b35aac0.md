Milrinone is primarily for use in the ICU and perioperative setting. Before initiating this medication, a right heart catheterization may be considered for obtaining hemodynamic measurements to establish the patient's baseline parameters and gauge the patient's response to continuous infusion. Repeat or dosing monitoring is not routine due to the risks associated with repeat vascular access or continuous indwelling catheters. Pulmonary artery catheterization for monitoring pulmonary pressures should be done with discretion and only after considering a case-by-case risk-benefit analysis.

Potassium loss due to rapid diuresis may predispose patients receiving digitalis therapy to arrhythmias. Therefore, potassium levels should be monitored and corrected by potassium supplementation in advance of or during the use of milrinone. In addition, clinicians should closely monitor fluid, electrolytes, and renal function during therapy with milrinone. Improvement in cardiac output resulting in diuresis may require a dose reduction of diuretics. Serum milrinone levels are not routinely necessary as the arrhythmogenic toxic effects have not shown a dose-dependent linear relationship. Outpatient use of milrinone is routinely not recommended due to increased patient mortality secondary to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death.
