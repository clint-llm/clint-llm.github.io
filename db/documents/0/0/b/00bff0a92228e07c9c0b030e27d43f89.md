Conservative management is often effective in treating CFL injuries. The progression of healing following initial injury has three distinct phases: inflammatory (1 to 10 days), proliferative (4 to 8 weeks), and remodeling phase (up to one year).

During the initial inflammatory response, RICE (rest, ice, compression, and elevation) is implemented in the first 4 to 5 days. Immobilization with cast or boots can be applied in the first week to reduce swelling and pain, after which, brace or taping can be provided for a return to activity.

Most lateral ankle injuries are managed non-operatively, while surgical interventions are allocated to patients with chronic instability.
