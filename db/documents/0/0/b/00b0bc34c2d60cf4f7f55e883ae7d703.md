Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder with no cure. Despite optimal therapy, most patients have a poor quality of life. The life expectancy is slightly reduced to the development of malignancies, genitourinary disease, liver, and biliary tract complications. The majority of Crohn patients who develop complications need surgery and as the disease progresses, some need multiple procedures. Overall, patients with the proximal disease have higher mortality than those with the distal disease.

Once a patient has had surgery, surveillance endoscopy is recommended in six to 12 months.Â If there is no endoscopic recurrence, ileocolonoscopy should be repeated in 1 to 3 years.
