Neisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative bacterium that inhabits the mucosal surface of the nasopharynx in approximately 10% of healthy persons. The invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is a severe form of Neisseria meningitidis infection, most commonly manifested as meningitis or septicemia. Initially, non-specific symptoms of infection with fever often lead to a rapid deterioration of the patient's condition and death within 12 to 24 hours of the onset of the disease. The infection may occur in the form of sporadic, epidemic, or pandemic disease. The incidence of IMD is estimated at 0.3 to 3/100,000 residents in developed countries,

The diversity of capsular antigens on the surface of the bacteria allowed the distinction of 12 serotypes of N. meningitidis. Types A, B, C, Y, W are responsible for more than 90% of IMD cases globally. Serogroup B leads to approximately 60% of disease among children aged younger than 5 years, while serogroups C, Y, or W cause 73% of IMD cases in a group of persons aged equal to 11 years.N. meningitidis is spread through droplets from the upper respiratory tract of colonized individuals (saliva and other respiratory secretions during coughing, sneezing, kissing, and chewing on toys), both by patients affected by the disease and also the asymptomatic carriers of bacteria.

The great burden of the disease has led to the implementation of various strategies to prevent IMD.
