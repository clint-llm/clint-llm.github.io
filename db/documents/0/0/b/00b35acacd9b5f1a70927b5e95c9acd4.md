The three main known genetic mutations in familial hypercholesterolemia are classified as defects in the LDL receptor (most common), apolipoprotein B Â (ApoB), or proprotein convertase subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Each of these three mutations leads to impairment of LDL receptors and a reduction in uptake of LDL cholesterol and subsequently causes high LDL cholesterol concentration.STAP1) was also reported to cause familial hypercholesterolemia.
