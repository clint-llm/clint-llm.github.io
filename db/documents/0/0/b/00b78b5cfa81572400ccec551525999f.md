The irrigation system delivers 250 mL of the warm water solution to the suspected affected ear over 25 to 30 seconds. Allow an open system in which the delivered water can freely dribble out of the external auditory canal and be collected in the basin. The nystagmus beats will begin approximately 30 seconds after the onset of the water delivery and will build in intensity over the ensuing 30 to 45 seconds. The alerting exercise performed by the patient will prevent any suppression of nystagmus. Wait five minutes and repeat the process on the other ear. Repeat the process using cool water if indicated.

If there is no response to either warm or cool irrigation, or if the bithermic irrigation system is unavailable, ice water irrigation can be considered. Instruct the patient to lie in a semirecumbent position with the suspected affected ear turned up. Inject approximately 2 mL of ice water into the external auditory canal using a syringe. The patient should hold their position for 30 seconds and then turn their head to the midline. Observe for nystagmus while the patient performs alerting tasks. This testing method has higher sensitivity and specificity than warm air or water, though it may not be as well tolerated.

The acronym WARMCOLD can help healthcare providers remember the correct order of steps during caloric testing, ensuring accurate testing and results that can help diagnose vestibular disorders.

The steps of caloric testing are as follows:

W - Warm: The introduction of warm air or water into the external auditory canal causes the endolymph in the semilunar canals to move, stimulating the hair cells and causing a reflexive eye movement called nystagmus.

A - Alternate: Alternating the stimulus to cold air or water in the external auditory canal causes the endolymph in the semilunar canals to move in the opposite direction, stimulating the hair cells and causing a reflexive eye movement called nystagmus.

R - Return: Returning to a warm stimulus, either air or water, after the cold stimulus causes the endolymph in the semilunar canals to move in the same direction as the first warm stimulus, stimulating the hair cells and causing a reflexive eye movement called nystagmus.

M - Measure: Measure the patient's eye movements and compare their results to typical values to evaluate the function of the inner ear and the vestibular system.

C - Compare: Compare the eye movement of both ears to check for an asymmetrical response.

O - Observe: Observe any spontaneous or positional nystagmus that can indicate a central lesion.

L - Look: Look for any other symptoms, such as vertigo, dizziness, nausea, or tinnitus, that the patient might be experiencing.

D - Document: Document all the observations and measurements made during the test, and compare them with typical values to evaluate the function of the inner ear and the vestibular system.

The mnemonic COWS (cold, opposite, warm, same) makes remembering the fast nystagmus component easy.
