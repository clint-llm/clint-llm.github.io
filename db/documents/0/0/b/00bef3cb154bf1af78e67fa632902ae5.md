The etiology of aneurysmal bone cysts is currently unknown, although they appear to be due to vascular malformations in the bone.

There are three main theories for their etiology:

- Aneurysmal bone cysts occur as a result of a separate primary bone tumor; this may be due to the relatively high rate (1 in 3) of an accompanying bone lesion. These lesions are frequently chondromyxoid, fibromas, chondrosarcomas, fibrous dysplasia, giant cell tumors of the bone, osteoblastomas, osteosarcomas, among others.

- They form as the primary tumor.

- They form at a site of previous trauma.

A portion ofÂ aneurysmal bone cysts now appears to be neoplastic. Genetic studies of the tumor have revealed that up to 69% of primary aneurysmal bone cysts contain a clonal t(16,17) translocation. The t(16,17) fusion causes an upregulation of the TRE17/USP6 oncogene, which activates NF-kB and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The MMPs break down the extracellular matrix, allowing for the swift growth of the lesions.
