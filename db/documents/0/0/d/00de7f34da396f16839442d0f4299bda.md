An interprofessional team approach is crucial to the success of dialysis fistula in ESRD patients and should involve collaboration between primary care physicians, nephrologists, vascular access surgeons, interventionalists, dialysis nurses, and vascular access coordinators.

The primary care physician must actively screen patients for chronic kidney disease and intervene with timely referral to a nephrologist for evaluation and treatment. The nephrologist oversees the care of the patient to ensure appropriate dialysis care. Vascular surgeons must decide the placement and type of vascular access that will yield the greatest success rate. Given the high rate of vascular access dysfunction, interventionalists can play a critical role in the maintenance and restoration of dialysis access using endovascular techniques. The dialysis nurse plays a critical role in patient care as they can examine and monitor access three times per week during dialysis. Lastly, the vascular access coordinator is essential for organizing patient hemodialysis care.
