# Definition/Introduction

The Rigler sign, or double-wall sign, is an indication of free air enclosed within the peritoneal cavity (pneumoperitoneum), imprinting a visible pattern on a plain radiographic image of the abdomen, in supine technique. This sign presents because of the separation between free air and intraluminal by the intestinal wall, marking the air radiolucency and radiopacity of the wall. Both serosal and luminal surfaces of the bowel are visible.

American radiologist Leo G. Rigler (1896-1979) in 1942 described this sign of pneumoperitoneum. He described the pattern in four cases report in 1941. He observed this sign was present when large quantities of free air are in the peritoneal cavity.

# Issues of Concern

In upright chest radiography or abdominal radiography, pneumoperitoneum is detectable under special conditions in small quantities as little as 1mL.

# Clinical Significance

Rigler sign is the second most common sign of pneumoperitoneum, the first being the right upper quadrant subdiaphragmatic free air. Study cases report the incidence of Rigler sign with a lower prevalence then right upper quadrant subdiaphragmatic free air (46% vs. 32%).
