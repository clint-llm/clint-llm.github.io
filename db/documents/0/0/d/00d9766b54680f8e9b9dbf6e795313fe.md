Temporal bone fractures have been reported across all age groups; however, 70% occur within the second through fourth decades of life with a 3 to 1 male to female predominance.

Bilateral fractures occur in roughly 17% of patients, and the distribution between left and right sides in cases of unilateral fracture is approximately equal.
