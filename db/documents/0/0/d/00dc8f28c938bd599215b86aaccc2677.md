**Major Determinants of a Satisfactory Outcome After Portoenterostomy**

**Age at Initial Operation**

Liver fibrosis is a time-dependent factor. However, the age at porto-enterostomy and surgical outcomes do not have a linear relationship. This was demonstrated in an age cohort analysis which showed that up to about 90 days of age the outcome of porto-enterostomy could not be ascertained by age alone for the cases of an isolated variety of biliary atresia.

**Syndromic Variety of Biliary Atresia**

Infants with syndromic BASM respond less well to Kasai surgery and have a poorer overall outcome with a higher risk of death.

**CMV IgM Positive Associated Biliary Atresia**

Those with the poorest outcome and highest risk of death are infants with CMV IgM positive associated biliary atresia.

**Successful Achievement of Postoperative Bile Flow**

patients with satisfactory bile flow with good bile clearance after porto-enterostomy (PE) have a better survival outcome with the native liver. Nio et al. reported that most patients who had survived more than 20 years post-PE had normal to moderately elevated liver function test results post-PE.

**Size of Microscopic Ductal Structures at the Hilum**

The size of the microscopic bile ducts in the transected bile duct remnant has been shown to have prognostic significance in some studies.
