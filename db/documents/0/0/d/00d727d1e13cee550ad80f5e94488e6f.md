The incidence of Bertolotti syndrome is reportedly between 4 to 8% within the general population.

Due to this discrepancy, many specialists believe Bertolotti syndrome has been vastly underdiagnosed. Despite this variability, the prevalence of an LSTV associated with pain is more than twice as common in males than females.

Additionally, sacralization of L5 has been shown to be more common in males, while lumbarization of the sacrum and the presence of an accessory articulation between L5 and S1 is more common in females.
