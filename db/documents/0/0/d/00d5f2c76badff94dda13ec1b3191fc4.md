Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a gynecological condition in which the pelvic organs herniate into the vagina due to ligament or muscular weakness. POP is subcategorized according to the compartment of descent. Cystocele characterizes anterior wall herniation, rectocele refers to the posterior vaginal wall descent, and vaginal vault prolapse characterizes descent of the uterus, cervix, or apex of the vagina. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of pelvic organ prolapse and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pelvic organ prolapse.
- Review the evaluation of pelvic organ prolapse.
- Outline the management options available for pelvic organ prolapse.
