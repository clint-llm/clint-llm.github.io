The Fontan procedure provides a palliative treatment option for children that are diagnosed with functionally univentricular congenital heart disease. A Fontan procedure includes various techniques and ultimately results in a surgical atriopulmonary connection or total cavopulmonary connection so that systemic venous blood bypasses the heart and goes directly to the lungs. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, relevant anatomy, and techniques involved in performing the Fontan procedure and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing perioperative care of patients to improve outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for a Fontan procedure.
- Outline the surgical techniques involved in performing the Fontan procedure.
- Identify the potential complications of the Fontan procedure and preventive measures that can be taken to prevent their occurrence.
- Explain how careful planning and collaboration among interprofessional team members involved in the management of patients undergoing the Fontan procedure will improve outcomes.
