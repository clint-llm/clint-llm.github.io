The Dix-Hallpike maneuver is the gold standard for diagnosis of benign positional paroxysmal vertigo, so it is difficult to assess its sensitivity and specificity acutely. The exclusion of dangerous etiologies of vertigo should be the clinician's primary concern, requiring excellent history and physical examination skills. Once these etiologies have been ruled out, if benign positional paroxysmal vertigo is on the differential, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver can diagnose the problem. This can be readily transitioned into the Epley maneuver, in which the position of the otolith continues to be manipulated until it is out of the posterior canal, ending the sensation of vertigo with positional changes and curing the disease process. While there is a high rate of recurrence and this is not always effective, relieving the symptoms of our patients in this way is highly desirable, and patients can be given instructions on how to do this at home for recurrences.
