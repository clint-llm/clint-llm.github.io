American Indians (AI) and Alaska Natives (AN), descendants of the indigenous people, are a diverse population group growing in number every year. Studies have shown that American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) have a decreased life expectancy, higher mortality rate, and lower quality of life than the general US population.

In addition to having higher rates of general medical conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure, there is a high prevalence of mental health problems and psychiatric comorbidity amongst American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs).

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), violence, suicide, and substance use have been identified as some of the more prevalent mental health issues among AI/ANs when compared with the general population in the United States.

There should be an increased effort to improve AI/AN mental health care disparities through culturally competent clinical interventions. In working towards this goal, it is important to identify the existing disparities in mental health care delivery and outcomes among AI/ANs. This will then help guide the steps that are necessary for improved outcomes and reduction in health disparities.
