One of the most common complications of lactational mastitis is early termination of breastfeeding. The disease of the breast and associated pain are some of the most commonly cited reasons for early cessation of breastfeeding.

Periductal mastitis and IGM can both be complicated by abscess or fistula formation. Both forms of non-lactational mastitis are associated with recurrence and can lead to scarring and deformity of the breast tissue.
