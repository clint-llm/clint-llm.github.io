Exudative retinal detachment is multifactorial in origin and can develop in patients of all age groups when there is defective clearance of subretinal fluid or when there is excessive exudation in the subretinal space. Most of the cases may be successfully managed medically. If diagnosed on time and necessary medical and surgical interventions are initiated, reasonably good visual recovery could be achieved. Prompt diagnosis and identification of the cause of exudative retinal detachment can help to avoid high ocular morbidity associated with this condition. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of exudative retinal detachment and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of exudative retinal detachment.
- Review the pathophysiology, histopathology, and clinical features of exudative retinal detachment.
- Describe the evaluation, management, and differential diagnoses of exudative retinal detachment.
- Summarize the prognosis, complications, and role of interprofessional collaboration in managing patients with exudative retinal detachment.
