To ensure the delivery of the greatest possible patient care, an interprofessional team approach should be followed.

In the pre-transplant phase, evaluation by a hepatologist, a transplant surgeon, and a transplant nurse coordinator is crucial to assess the patient, discuss all required vaccinations, medications, lifestyle changes, types of surgeries, and have a detailed discussion about the post-transplant phase, including immunosuppression and possible complications and outcomes.

Psychiatric evaluation by a specialized transplant psychiatrist is needed to address any alcohol or drug abuse issues and ensure the patient has insight regarding the surgery and the possible outcomes.

Social workers also have a role in ensuring the social support system to the patient, especially in the post-liver transplant phase and home care and adjustments. A specialized team assesses for insurance coverage of the liver transplantation surgery and immunosuppressive drugs.

Nutritionists play a role in both the pre and post-transplant phases to ensure an adequate nutritional status and address dietary changes related to chronic diseases like diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia.
