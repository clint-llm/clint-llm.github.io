Tarsal tunnel syndrome results from the compression of the posterior tibial nerve or one of its two branches, the lateral or medial plantar nerve, within the tarsal tunnel. Up to 43% of patients have a history of trauma including events such as ankle sprains. Abnormal biomechanics can contribute to disease progression. Risk factors include systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, gout, mucopolysaccharidosis, and hyperlipidemia.
