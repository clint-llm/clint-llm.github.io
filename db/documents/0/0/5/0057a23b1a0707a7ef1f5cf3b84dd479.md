Hamstring muscles comprise the three major muscles of the posterior aspect of the thigh. These include the semimembranous as the medial most, long and short heads of the biceps femoris as the lateral most, and semitendinosus in between. These groups of muscles are clinically significant as they are highly susceptible to injury, especially in the athletes. This activity illustrates the significance of hamstring muscles and the burden of its injury in sports medicine. It also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in diagnosing the injury to the muscle, management, and appropriate rehabilitation for a smooth return to play and prevent reinjury.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of a hamstring injury.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of hamstring injury.
- Review the management options including the rehabilitation and return to sports criteria available for a hamstring injury.
- Describe the importance of interprofessional communication and coordination in the management of patients with a hamstring injury.
