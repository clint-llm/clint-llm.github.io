Preoperative visual acuity should be noted in both the affected and unaffected eye as a baseline. Any acute change in visual acuity preoperatively should prompt further evaluation, as this would not be expected from simple lid malposition, and may reflect corneal or other ocular pathology. Formal optometric examination may also be of benefit, particularly if the patient has known additional ocular pathology, such as glaucoma.
