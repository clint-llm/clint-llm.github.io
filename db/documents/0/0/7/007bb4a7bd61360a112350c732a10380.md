Sever disease, or calcaneal apophysitis, is a common cause of heel pain in the skeletally immature athlete. It is considered to be the result of an overuse injury to the secondary ossification center by a traction apohysitis at the Achilles tendon insertion site on the calcaneus.

The patient will often endorse resolution of pain during periods of rest or inactivity. Clinical exam is notable for tenderness over calcaneal insertion of Achilles tendon and a positive squeeze test. Diagnosis of Sever disease is clinical and does not require imaging studies.
