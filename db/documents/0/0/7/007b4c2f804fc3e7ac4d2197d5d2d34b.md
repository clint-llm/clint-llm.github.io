The prognosis of patients that suffer from lower genitourinary trauma varies greatly depending on the injury, as well as based on their other associated injuries. Patients that experience lower GU injuries are typically polytrauma patients. Injuries to the GU tract are seldom life-limiting but more frequently are associated with significant morbidity. Ultimately, the prognosis is dependent on injuries sustained in combination with the patientâ€™s comorbidities.
