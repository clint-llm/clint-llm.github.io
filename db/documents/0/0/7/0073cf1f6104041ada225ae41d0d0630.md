Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is often an incidental diagnosis in an asymptomatic patient found to have peripheral blood lymphocytosis on complete blood picture evaluation. However, approximately 5 to 10% of patients present with one or more “B” symptoms, including Fevers of >100.5 F (38 C) for two or more weeks without evidence of infection, night sweats without evidence of injections, extreme fatigue, or unintentional weight loss of ≥10 percent of body weight in the last six months.

The physical examination can reveal lymphadenopathy in 50 to 90% of patients.

Cutaneous involvement, which is the most common extra lymphoid presentation of the disease manifesting as presenting as papules, blisters, ulcers, macules, and nodules, is rare, occurring in only 5% of the cases.
