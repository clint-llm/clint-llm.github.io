MTB is first introduced into the host by droplet inhalation infecting the alveolar macrophage. The primary infection localizes in the lung with dissemination to the lymph nodes. At this point in the infectious process, a high degree of bacteremia can seed the entire body. In tuberculous meningitis, the meninges are seeded by MTB and form sub-ependymal collections called Rich foci. These foci can rupture into the subarachnoid space and cause an intense inflammatory response that causes meningitis symptoms. The exudates caused by this response can encase cranial nerves and cause nerve palsies. They can entrap blood vessels causing vasculitis, and block cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) flow leading to hydrocephalus, which may be communicating or non-communicating. These immune responses can lead to complications associated with tuberculous meningitis and chronic sequela in patients who recover from TBM.

Tuberculous vasculitis leads to constriction, spasm, thrombosis, and occlusion of intracerebral vessels. This ultimately causes multiple, small, bilateral infarcts, frequently located in the periventricular regions. The basal ganglia, thalamus, and internal capsule are most frequently involved. These infarcts can cause stroke syndromes of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, pons, and/or cerebellum.
