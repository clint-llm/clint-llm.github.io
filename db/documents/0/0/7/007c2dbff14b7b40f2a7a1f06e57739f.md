Infants usually present within a few days after birth. Prenatal history should be obtained at the time of NICU admission and should include maternal medical conditions as well as drug exposure. Providers should obtain prenatal and perinatal factors such as chorioamnionitis, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and perinatal asphyxia, as these contribute to persistent pulmonary hypertension.

Newborn assessment usually occurs simultaneously with resuscitation in conditions such as meconium aspiration. On exam, an infant with persistent fetal circulation appears cyanotic. Respiratory distress can manifest as labored breathing with subcostal, suprasternal and intercostal retractions due to lung parenchymal disease. Infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have a scaphoid abdomen on the exam. Septic infants can present with refractory hypotension, multiorgan failure, and easy bleeding due to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC).
