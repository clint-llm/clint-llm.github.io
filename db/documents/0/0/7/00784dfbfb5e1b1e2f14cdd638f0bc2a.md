The instruments reviewed are fundamental to many oral surgical procedures. As such, it is necessary to be aware of their existence, appreciate the clinical situations they are used in and understand how they can be applied. This knowledge will facilitate their safe use, as improper instrumentation in combination with uncontrolled excessive force can have detrimental effects such as iatrogenic fracture of the mandible.

This reading should be supplemented with practical experience as one method for a particular procedure does not always work in another clinician's hands. Often, several different instruments can be used in the same clinical scenario, and clinicians develop a preference.
