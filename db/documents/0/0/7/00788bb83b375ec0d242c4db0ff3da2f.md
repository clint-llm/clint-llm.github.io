Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are two conditions commonly referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). They are immunologically mediated inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. In Crohn disease, the inflammation extends through the entire thickness of the bowel wall from the mucosa to the serosa. The disease runs a relapsing and remitting course. With multiple relapses, Crohn disease can progress from initially mild to moderate inflammatory conditions to severe penetrating (fistulization) or stricturing disease. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of Crohn disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of Crohn disease.
- Describe the extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn disease.
- Summarize the management of Crohn disease.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in prompt diagnosis of Crohn disease and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
