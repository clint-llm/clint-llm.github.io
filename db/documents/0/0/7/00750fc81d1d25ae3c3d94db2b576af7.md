Opsonization is an immune process which uses opsonins to tag foreign pathogens for elimination by phagocytes. Without an opsonin, such as an antibody, the negatively-charged cell walls of the pathogen and phagocyte repel each other. The pathogen can then avoid destruction and continue to replicate inside the human body.

Opsonins are used to overcome the repellent force between the negative cell walls and promote uptake of the pathogen by the macrophage. Opsonization is an antimicrobial technique to kill and stop the spread of disease.
