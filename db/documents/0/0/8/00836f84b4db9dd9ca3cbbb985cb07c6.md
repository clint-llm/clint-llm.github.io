**Drug Interactions or Dosing Modifications**

- Avoid: Avoid taking lemborexant with strong (itraconazole and clarithromycin) or moderate (fluconazole and verapamil) CYP3A inhibitors, which may increase the adverse effects of lemborexant.

- Avoid: Avoid taking lemborexant with strong (rifampin, carbamazepine, and St. John’s wort) or moderate (bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, and modafinil) CYP3A inducers, which may reduce the effectiveness of lemborexant.

- Use with caution: Do not use a dose of greater than 5 mg when co-administering with weak CYP3A inhibitors to avoid adverse effects.

- Use with caution: at doses greater than 5mg in patients over the age of 65.

- Mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A): May experience increased somnolence, but there is no recommended dose adjustment.

- Moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B): A nightly dose greater than 5 mg is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.

- Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C): Researchers have not studied lemborexant in severe hepatic impairment, and therefore the current recommendation for such patients is to avoid using the drug.
