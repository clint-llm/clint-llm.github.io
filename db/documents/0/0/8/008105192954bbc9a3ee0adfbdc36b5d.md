Manganese (Mn) toxicity is a well-established result of repeated occupational and nutritional exposures. Though this syndrome is relatively uncommon, its neurotoxicity renders it a feared poison encountered in toxicology. Familiarity with this uncommon toxidrome and its distinct etiologies will ensure prompt recognition and appropriate management early on in its manifestation. This activity describes the evaluation, management, and treatment of manganese toxicity (also known as Manganism), and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, treating, managing, and improving care for patients with this toxicity.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of manganese toxicity.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of patients suffering from suspected manganese toxicity.
- Review the management options available for manganese toxicity.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to understand and improve outcomes regarding manganese toxicity.
