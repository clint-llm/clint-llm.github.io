Recommended daily allowance of niacin is as follows:[5]

- Infants: 5 to 6 mg

- Children: 9 to 13 mg

- Adults: 13 to 20 mg

- Pregnant and lactating mothers: 17 mg and 20 mg, respectively

**Dosing**

**Pellagra**

The adult dose is nicotinamide 100 mg orally, every 6 hours for several days until relief of acute symptoms, followed by 50 mg every 8 to 12 hours until all skin lesions heal. In severe cases (marked neurological or gastrointestinal tract symptoms), 1 g three to four times a day can be given, initially by the parenteral route. For children, one can use 10 to 50 mg orally every 6 hours until symptoms of pellagra resolve. For mild endemic pellagra, smaller doses such as 10 mg per day are acceptable. Therapy should include other B vitamins, magnesium, and zinc, as well as a calorie-rich diet. Topical emollients may reduce discomfort due to skin lesions.

**Dyslipidemia**

The recommended dose for hyperlipidemia is 1 to 6 g daily, initially low doses (100 mg three times per day), increasing at weekly intervals depending upon clinical efficacy and tolerance. Extended-release (ER) niacin in concentrations from 125 to 1000 mg is approved for use in hyperlipidemia and does not have hepatotoxicity compared to regular niacin.
