Biological warfare agents include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and biological toxins. Some agents are frequently lethal, while others are intended to cause illness or incapacitation. Biological warfare can be directed not only at the human population but also at crops and livestock. More than 180 pathogens have been researched or employed as biological weapons, including anthrax, tularemia, brucellosis, plague, Legionnaireâ€™s disease, Q fever, glanders, melioidosis, smallpox, viral hemorrhagic fevers, influenza, ricin, botulinum toxin, staphylococcal enterotoxin B, coccidiosis, rice blast, and wheat rust. Biological warfare agents are most likely to be dispersed as aerosols to be more easily spread amongst large populations. However, certain agents can be spread from person to person or by vectors, ingestion, direct contact, or other methods.
