Compartment syndrome occurs when the tissue pressure within a given compartment exceeds the perfusion pressure of the arterial supply, resulting in ischemia of the muscles and nerves of the compartment. The etiology is varied; however, most commonly it is related to acute trauma or overuse syndrome. In the leg, this can occur in any of the four compartments: anterior, lateral, superficial posterior, or deep posterior. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of anterior tibial compartment syndrome and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk factors for anterior tibial compartment syndrome.
- Review the signs and symptoms of anterior tibial compartment syndrome.
- Explain how to manage anterior tibial compartment syndrome.
- Describe how enhanced coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid recognition of anterior tibial compartment syndrome and improve outcomes.
