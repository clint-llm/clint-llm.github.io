An interprofessional team of ophthalmic surgeons, nurses, optometrists, and technicians may be involved in the preoperative evaluation, surgery, and postoperative management of patients who undergo SMILE. Ensuring appropriate patient selection per established guidelines and maintaining adequate follow-up are essential for maximizing long-term visual outcomes and patient satisfaction. Nursing should assist during the surgery, and provide post-operative care following. They can also ensure patient compliance and be available for questions in the time after the procedure. All interprofessional healthcare team members should be aware of clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of major postoperative complications, and prompt referral to a cornea specialist is warranted should any of these complications arise.
