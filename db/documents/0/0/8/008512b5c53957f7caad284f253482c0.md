Trichinosis or trichinellosis is a helminth infection primarily transmitted via the ingestion of improperly prepared food. Pork and its byproducts are the primary sources of infection. Trichinosis has the potential to be fatal but is more commonly a self-limiting disease. It is a persistent public health issue in countries where there is high consumption of pork. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of trichinosis and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.
