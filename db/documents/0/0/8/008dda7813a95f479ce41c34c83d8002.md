**RADIANCE (A Randomized Controlled Study of Ranibizumab in Patients with Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) Secondary to Pathologic Myopia) (n=277)**

A multi-center, randomized controlled trial compared intravitreal Ranibizumab 0.5mg to Verteporfin photodynamic therapy to treat myopic CNV. The ranibizumab treatment group experienced a superior visual gain (14 letters vs. 9 letters) at 12 months. Patients received a median of 2 treatments during the 12 month study period as guided by disease activity.

**MYRROR study (Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection in Patients with Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization) (n=122)**

A multi-center, randomized control trial compared intravitreal Aflibercept 0.5mg versus sham injection to treat myopic CNV. Additional injections were administered if there were signs of CNV activity during monthly visits. At week 24, the treatment group experienced superior visual gains (+12 letters vs. -2 letters). Patients in the treatment group received a median of 2 injections in weeks 0–8 and 0 injections in weeks 8 to 32.

Both trials demonstrated that anti-VEGF therapy was effective for the treatment of myopic CNV, with good visual and anatomic benefits achieved with a limited number of injections.
