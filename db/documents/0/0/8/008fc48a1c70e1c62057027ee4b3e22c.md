The PA catheter or Swan-Ganz catheter is usually between 60 to 110 cm in length and around 4 to 8Fr in caliber. It was named after its inventors, Jeremy Swan and William Ganz.

Most PA catheters have 4 separate lumens, each of which serves individualized functions.

- The proximal lumen or blue port is located in the right atrium and measures the right atrial pressure. It can also be used to administer medications. Some PA catheters might have a separate lumen designated for infusing drugs.

- The distal lumen or yellow port is located at the distal end of the catheter and resides in the pulmonary artery. It is used to monitor PA pressures and to obtain a mixed venous sample. Medications and infusions should not be inserted through this port.

- The red port is for balloon inflation and deflation. The balloon sits approximately 2 cm from the distal end of the catheter. Each PA catheter is accompanied by a 1.5 ml syringe used to inflate or deflate the balloon. The inflated balloon helps to guide the catheter from the right atrium into the PA by following intracardiac blood flow. The inflated balloon also helps to measure the PCWP.

- Temperature or thermistor is used to measure core temperature in the pulmonary artery. This helps to measure the cardiac output via the thermodilution method.
