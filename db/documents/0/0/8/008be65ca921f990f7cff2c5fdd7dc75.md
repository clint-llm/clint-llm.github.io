As the usage of PPIs continues to rise, it becomes extremely important to understand the extent of their adverse effects. As the use of these medications is common, potential adverse effects have received significant media attention; however, it is essential to note that most of these associations have as their basis on low-grade evidence and observational associations rather than clear causation. The following is a description of the variety of adverse effects described in the literature.

**Hypomagnesemia**

Albeit a rare side-effect, PPIs may lower magnesium to a level not easily replenished by supplementation and only corrected with removal of PPI. Hypomagnesemia is a serious complication that predisposes the patient to tetany, seizure, muscle weakness, delirium, and cardiac arrhythmias. It is not yet entirely clear what causes this adverse effect, but one hypothesis suggests that it may be due to decreased active intestinal absorption of magnesium by the transient receptor protein channels (TRPM 6/7) that are stimulated by extracellular protons.

**Infection**

While the acidic environment of the stomach serves as an environment in which proteins become activated to perform certain functions, so too does it serve as a chemical barrier against bacterial infection. PPIs have correlations with an increased amount of Clostridium difficile infections, other enteric foodborne infections, and potentially increased risk of community-acquired pneumonia. While it is still unclear as to the exact mechanism for this increased infection risk, one hypothesis proposed that the decreased acidic environment of the stomach leads to bacterial overgrowth and increased risk of bacterial aspiration.

**Rebound Acid Secretion**

PPIs can increase the levels of gastrin, which in turn leads to increased proliferation of ECL cells. ECL cells produce histamine, which under normal circumstances, stimulates parietal cells to activate their H+/K+ ATPase and produce acid into the stomach. Because PPIs act a step further than histamine, this side-effect does not negate the effect of PPIs. However, the problem lies in the discontinuation of PPIs after prolonged use, which has been shown in some cases to result in acid levels higher than before the initiation of PPIs. This effect has been referred to as rebound acid secretion.

**Vitamin Deficiency**

When vitamin B12 enters the stomach, it is bound to a protein molecule, R-factor. For vitamin B12 to release from R-factor, proteases need to be activated by an acidic environment. Once activated, the peptidases release R-factor from vitamin B12 so that it may bind another molecule, intrinsic factor, for absorption at the level of the terminal ileum. Disruption of the stomach's acidic environment by PPIs may lead to a vitamin B12 deficiency, although this appears to be clinically rare. Additionally, iron deficiency has also been reported with prolonged PPI use, although the exact mechanism remains elusive. There is also slight malabsorption of insoluble calcium separate from food, which many believe to be subclinical in most cases.

**Other Potential Associations**

Due to the frequency of PPI administration, numerous other potential associations have been reported and have received significant attention. Conflicting data have linked PPI use with osteoporosis and bone fracture; proposed mechanisms include calcium malabsorption, increased gastrin, decreased vitamin B12, and potential proton pumps in the bone. However, the data are not consistent, and while there may be an association, there is not a clearly established etiology at present. Likewise, isolated retrospective analyses have suggested a potential link between PPI use and dementia, kidney disease, and heart disease. However, these associations have not occurred to date in prospective studies, and there have been significant concerns raised with the retrospective analyses given potential confounding. Moreover, for dementia and heart disease, in particular, the findings, even in retrospective analyses, have been inconsistent. Following the initial development of PPIs, there was a concern for potential malignancy given prolonged gastrin elevation; however, while this was present in animal models, it has not been demonstrated in human patients. Evidence shows that fundic gland polyps increase with prolonged PPI use; however, these do not appear to have a link with malignancy.
