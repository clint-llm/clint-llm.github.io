Prevention of medial epicondyle apophysitis (MEA) requires intentional adherence to pitching guidelines by athletes, parents, and coaches and placing the athleteâ€™s health above performance in any particular game or showcase. Athletes are often initially evaluated by their primary care physician, athletic trainer, or coach.

The evaluation and treatment of medial epicondyle apophysitis require an interprofessional healthcare team of healthcare professionals. A primary care physician should see any athlete with persistent medial elbow pain for radiographical imaging. The radiologist's role is vital for accurate interpretation of the imaging, determination of the degree of epicondylar separation, and determination of the need for referral to orthopedic surgery for operative management. Physical therapists play an important role in non-operative management and safe return to exercise. A sports injury's psychological toll can be significant since many high-level athletes place their identity in their sport and their performance. A sports psychologist can help counseling athletes through the uncertainties and pain of having a sports injury.
