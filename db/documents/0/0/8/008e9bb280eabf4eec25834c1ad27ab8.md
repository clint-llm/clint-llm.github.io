Interpretations of the results

- The average length of the kidney ranges from 9 to 13 cms.

- The average renal parenchymal thickness in the polar regions is 3 to 3.5 cms, and in the interpolar regions is 2 to 2.5 cms.

- The upper pole of the right kidney is usually at the level of the 12th rib, and the left kidney is slightly higher than the right one.

- The vertical axis of the kidney is parallel to the ipsilateral upper third of the psoas major.

- Parenchymal breaking and double contour may be visible in the case of a growing neoplasm.

- Abnormal calyceal configuration can show in post-inflammatory and stone related scarring.

- Rounding of forniceal margins can result from early and mild obstruction of the urinary tract.

- Extensive collections of contrast material in the parenchyma can be a sign of inflammatory response.

- Loss of papillary impression and clubbing of calyces seen in chronic obstruction.

- Outpouchings of contrast material are evidence of the presence of diverticula.

- Aberrant papillae may be due to renal cell carcinoma.

- The formation of phantom calyx due to a filling defect can appear in benign and malignant neoplasms.

- Static columns of contrast on several images are suggestive of obstruction or ureteral ileus.

- Separation of less than 5 cm between the ureters is considered a medial deviation. If the ureter is present more than 1cm beyond the tip of the transverse process of the vertebrae, then it is regarded as the lateral deviation of the ureter.

- Narrowing of the ureteral lumen may be due to causes internal or external to the ureter.

- Tuberculosis of the urinary system produces remarkable signs that are visible on pyelogram, namely: moth-eaten calyces, sawtooth ureter, pipe stem ureter, and thimble bladder. The bladder appears small and contracted due to extensive mural fibrosis.

- Cobra head sign on an intravenous pyelogram is visible in ureterocele.
