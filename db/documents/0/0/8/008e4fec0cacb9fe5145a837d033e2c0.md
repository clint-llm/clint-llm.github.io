Cilia exist on epithelial cells lining the nasopharynx, lower respiratory tract, paranasal sinuses, middle ear, and reproductive tract.

Given the wide range of possible mutations, there is significant variation in clinical presentations.

The sperm tail and fimbriae of fallopian tubes also have motile cilia. Therefore, male and female infertility often occurs. Situs abnormalities occur in about 50% of cases of PCD. Normal ciliary movement is needed for visceral rotation. In the absence of normal ciliary function during embryogenesis, abnormal orientation can result. Kartagener syndrome is a triad of chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and situs inversus resulting from ciliary dysfunction.
