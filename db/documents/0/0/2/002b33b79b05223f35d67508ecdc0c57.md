The diving medicine specialist should be the coordinating provider and lead the discussions on the individual risk as well as the risk for the organization of returning to dive after a diving-related injury. However, he/she often needs input from various other specialties such as cardiologists, neurologists, radiologists, and otolaryngologists. In addition, on an organizational level, input from the dive supervisor on what will be expected on working dives will be helpful in determining the future of an occupational diver. Unfortunately, for the dive masters and dive instructors in the recreational dive industry, there is no dive supervisor who can predict the dive conditions, dive location, and workload, which will make recommendations to the divers who want to return to diving after an incident more conservative.
