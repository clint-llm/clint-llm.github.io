A positive Schirmer test alone does not definitively diagnose keratoconjunctivitis sicca or dry eye; rather, the diagnosis is made by a combination of subjective history and objective physical findings. There are several different underlying mechanisms that manifest in symptoms of dry eye—likewise, certain tests are better than others at elucidating the cause. Treatment should be tailored to the specific mechanism underlying the patient’s dry eye. All healthcare team members involved in the care of the patient undergoing the STT should share relevant information with each other and especially with the attending physician to ensure a disorder is correctly identified when present. Similarly, the healthcare team should continue to follow up with the patient to evaluate response to therapy, adjusting treatment when appropriate to improve patient outcomes.
