Testicular neoplasm is one of the most common causes of testicular mass. It occurs in approximately 5 per 100,000 men, mainly in the age group of 15-34 years. Seminoma is a malignant germ cell tumor that involves most commonly the testicle or less frequently the mediastinum, the retroperitoneum, or otherÂ extra-gonadal sites. It is one of the treatable and curable cancers, with a survival rate of over 95% if discovered in early stages.

Testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs) have different pathological subtypes, including seminoma, teratoma, choriocarcinoma, embryonal, and yolk sac carcinoma. The most significant clinical distinction is between seminoma and nonseminoma, two broad categories with different treatment algorithms. Seminoma based on classification is pure seminoma upon histopathological review. The presence of any nonseminatous elements (even if seminoma is prevalent) changes the classification to nonseminoma.
