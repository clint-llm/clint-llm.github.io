Epidemiological data on autoimmune hepatitis is scarce and very likely unreported and underrecognized. Of the two types of autoimmune hepatitis, 80% of cases are diagnosed as type 1. Seventy-five percent of type 1 autoimmune hepatitis is known to manifest in young or middle-aged females. Autoimmune hepatitis is more common in females than males with a ratio of 3.6:1.
