**Bloods**

- Routine labs as a baseline

- Rheumatoid factor and or other connective tissue markers

- CRP and WC to look for features of chronic inflammation or infection

**Imaging**

- The following radiograph views are recommended

- Anterior-posterior (AP)
- Lateral
- Clenched fist
- Scaphoid
- Radial and Ulnar deviation
- Flexion and Extension

- **Specific findings in radiographs that correspond to a specific type of instability**
- **Dorsal intercalated segment instability (DISI)**
- Terry Thomas Sign: Increased distance between the scaphoid and lunate, usually >3mm
- Cortical Ring Sign: Scaphoid rotation/mal-alignment
- Scaphoid fracture-dislocation
- Scaphoid shortening
- Scaphoid humpback deformity
- Scapholunate angle >70 degrees
- Capito-lunate angle >20 degrees


- **Volar intercalated segment instability (VISI)**
- Scapholunate angle  < 30 degrees
- Capito-lunate angle > 15 degrees
- Break-in Gilula's arc
- Lunotriquetral overlap


- **Peri-Lunate Dislocation**
- Break-in Gilula's arc
- The triangular appearance of lunate
- Slipped Tea Cup sign


- **Distal radio-ulnar joint Instability**
- Widening of the DRUJ
- Dorsal displacement of ulna


- **Adaptive instability**
- Old fracture malunion of distal radius
- Dorsal angulation > 30 degrees

In addition to radiographs, we can also perform computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. These are helpful in particular instances and are divided below,****

**CT**

- Chronic DRUJ

- Fracture dislocation

- Complex fractures

- Misalignments

- Carpal non-unions

**MRI**

- Undiagnosed ligamentous injury

- TFCC injuries

- Suspected fracture-dislocation

Besides imaging, arthroscopy is the last investigation available for wrist instability. It is the most invasive of investigations listed, but it is considered to be the gold standard for diagnosing ligamentous injuries.
