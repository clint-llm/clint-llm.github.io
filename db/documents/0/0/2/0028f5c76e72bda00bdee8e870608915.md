Women who carry BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are at high risk for several types of cancers including breast, ovary, colon, stomach, pancreas, and gallbladder. Because technological advances have made identification of these gene mutations cost-effective, the goal is to identify women at risk. To prevent malignancies by BRCA mutations requires an interprofessional team dedicated to oncology.

The United States Preventive Service Task Force recommends that primary care physicians and nurse practitioners evaluate women who are candidates for hereditary cancer genetic testing by inquiring about family history of breast, ovarian, tubal or other cancers during annual examinations. If questioning reveals increased risk, referral to a certified genetic counselor (CGC) for possible testing is indicated (Grade B recommendations). Certified nursing and clinician genetic counselors and breast surgeons may also aid in the decision regarding tests for BRCA alone, or for different genetic mutations related to other hereditary cancers

Other clinicians who see female patients should always ask about the family history of cancer and determine if studies are needed to evaluate for the presence of BRCA mutations.

A positive BRCA mutation indicates a higher likelihood of developing cancer but does not make or confirm the diagnosis of cancer. Subsequently, a negative BRCA test does not eliminate the risk of developing breast cancer from sporadic or other genetic causes.

Finally, when a patient is identified with BRCA mutations, the team should hold a conference with the patient. The patient should be provided with all the latest information and choices of treatment. The patient's decision should be voluntary and without any due pressure from the clinicians to produce the best outcomes. [Level 5]
