Allergic reaction: patients presenting as an allergic reaction to fish with no history of fish allergy. The diagnosis of scombroid is especially suspicious with multiple people who ate the same fish presenting with allergic reaction symptoms.

Myocardial ischemia: Sweating, nausea, chest tightness, difficulty breathing can simulate the clinical presentation of acute MI in adults.

Staphylococcal enterotoxin-induced food poisoning:
Staphylococcus aureus causes very similar symptoms with sudden onset nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain within 2 hours after eating contaminated food. These patients, however, may develop fever, while scombroid patients do not. Also, patients with scombroid typically have flushing or rash, while Staphylococcus food poisoning does not.

Other marine foodborne poisoningÂ culprits include ciguatera, shellfish, pufferfish, but all have a long latent period before the onset of symptoms and do not present with histamine reactions, specifically flushing and an urticarial rash.
