The complications of percutaneous plating include increased rates of nonunion and delayed union, wound dehiscence and long plates may irritate the superficial peroneal nerve proximally or distally. Malunion in valgus and procurvatum is seen most commonly in proximal-third fractures. Nonunion is an uncommon complication with intramedullary nail fixation but is treated by dynamization of the nail. Malrotation is most commonly seen in proximal and distal-third fractures. Knee pain is the most common complication after intramedullary nailing which occurs during the patellar tendon splitting and paratenon approach. Compartment syndrome is another complication which can be seen in both open and closed fractures.
