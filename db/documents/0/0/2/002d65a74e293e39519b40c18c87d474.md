Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by one of several enzyme deficiencies. In particular, the 17-hydroxylase deficiency is a rare cause of CAH due to loss of function mutations in the CYP17A1 gene located on chromosome 10q24-q25.

Over 100 mutations in the CYP17A1 gene are known, with most resulting in complete loss of both enzymatic activities.CYP17 gene is available for the detection of known mutations.
