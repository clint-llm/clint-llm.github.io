The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that all women aged 65 have routine screening for osteoporosis. The task force made no formal recommendations for men. They were also unable to recommend supplementation with either vitamin D or calcium daily, stating insufficient evidence in the primary prevention of fractures.

Screening includes but is not limited to: bone mineral density testing, height measurements, vertebral imaging, and checking biochemical markers.

Patients with osteoporosis can receive treatment with current FDA-approved medications that include bisphosphonates, estrogen agonist/antagonist, calcitonin, hormone therapy, tissue-selective estrogen complex, parathyroid hormone, and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitor.

Primary care clinicians, including nurses, should emphasize the prevention of osteoporosis by making lifestyle changes. Patients should be told to stop smoking, limit alcohol intake, become physically active, eat a healthy diet, and maintain a healthy weight. Open communication between the team can help improve outcomes in patients with vertebral fractures.

Providers who take X-rays of the spine need to be familiar with the radiographic signs of vertebral column fractures; these include family practitioners and even chiropractors, who should refer appropriately when they encounter such conditions.

Should the patient require surgical intervention for vertebral fracture, an orthopedist or neurosurgeon should take the case, depending on the specific issues and the structures involved. Surgical and orthopedic specialty trained nurses can be significant assets, preparing the patient for the procedure, assisting during the procedure, monitoring the patient post-operatively, administering medication, and consulting with the pharmacy if necessary.

Vertebral column fractures and their underlying conditions require the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team working collaboratively to ensure the best possible patient outcomes. [Level 5]
