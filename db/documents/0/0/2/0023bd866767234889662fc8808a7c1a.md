AIN and CIN are rare conditions with disease spectrum extending from minor infections to severe life-threatening infections leading to death. Thus interprofessional teams, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, can manage these conditions with the best approach. A specialists team, including immunologists, geneticists, infectious disease specialists, and pediatricians, can manage these conditions with either prophylactic antimicrobial agents or G-CSF. These patients should be monitored closely with the complete blood cell count, blood chemistry, inflammatory markers, and immunoglobulins.

The health care providers should advise these patients regarding warning signs and symptoms for infections, as well as appropriate precautions. Patients undergoing chemotherapy should watch for signs of infections and, if possible, wear masks in public and follow handwashing measures. Pharmacists should advise of possible side effects of medications prescribed for these patients by providers.

Hence a team effort is essentially required for the well being of these patients and their quality of life.
