About 25% of fetuses will be in breech presentation at 28 weeks, and this decreases to about 3% to 4% of term pregnancies. Most of these patients will be delivered by cesarean delivery. It is held that the overall cesarean delivery rate is higher than it should be, and efforts to prevent the first cesarean section often present obstetricians with the task of decreasing the number of cesarean deliveries they perform. One alternative to cesarean delivery is an external cephalic version (ECV). Simply, it is a procedure to change the presentation of the fetus from breech, tranverse, or oblique to vertex by applying pressure externally to the fetus through the gravid abdomen.
