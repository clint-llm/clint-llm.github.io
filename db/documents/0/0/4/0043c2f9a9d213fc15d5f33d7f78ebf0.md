After confirming the diagnosis of lymphoma by tissue biopsy, further evaluation involves the determination of tissue where disease activity is the greatest. PET/CT scans by measuring uptake of radiolabeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) are used to measure the biological activity of lymphoma.

The clinical staging of both HL and NHL is derived from the Ann Arbor staging system. The presence or absence of B symptoms (persistent fever, weight loss in excess of 10% of body weight over six months, or night sweats) is included in the staging for lymphoma. Blood work includes lactate dehydrogenase along with complete blood counts with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, and uric acid.

Whole-body PET/CT imaging is preferred over CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Bone marrow biopsy is often performed for staging but may be omitted for stage III DLBCL and HL because detection of stage IV disease over stage III does not change the treatment.

Antigen-specificity for B and T-cells is defined by the cell-surface receptor, B-cell receptor, or T-cell receptor, respectively. T-cells are programmed for antigen recognition in the thymus. B-cells mature in the marrow and encounter foreign antigen for the first time within the lymph node germinal center (GC). As such, B-cells may be divided into GC or post-GC. Post-GC, some B-cells develop eventually into plasma cells, which secrete the soluble form of B-cell receptor, that is, immunoglobulin (Ig) or antibody. The method used for determining malignancy or clonality in B-cell lymphomas is by immunohistochemical staining for light chains to show that the sample has lymphocytes expressing all kappa or lambda light chains. It is called light chain restriction and shows the presence of lymphocytic clone.
