Newborn screening is the recommendation since many studies suggest that "almost all individuals with ectopic thyroid are hypothyroid." Thus a biochemical thyroid profile may be necessary at birth. Many centers are now routinely obtaining a thyroid profile in all newborns

- Serial thyroid function tests (TSH, T3, total T4, free T4, and thyroglobulin are mandatory in the screening and diagnosing of the ectopic thyroid - the majority of the cases will provide evidence of hypothyroidism, while some patients may be euthyroid

- The etiological diagnosis is established by thyroid scintigraphy

- MRI and CT scan also can be used as modalities to determine the exact location of ectopic thyroid

- High-resolution ultrasound scanning could help as an initial assessment, especially in patients presenting with neck masses

- If the case is highly suspicious for malignancy, then tissue biopsy for histology or fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) should be performed
