Evaluation of a patient for participation in sporting activities has a traditional role in ensuring their health is optimized before enduring the effects and stresses of that particular sport. This form of patient evaluation has been used by both professional as well as amateur athletes, hence having a variable level of comprehensiveness. Many sports associations and leagues require a documented physical exam from a physician to certify that the athlete is in good health. Patients will undergo an assessment that includes personal medical history, family medical history, medication use, a physical examination, and potential diagnostic tests.

The medical history evaluates potential existing medical illnesses, which include cardiac illness, musculoskeletal disease, history of neurological illness, respiratory disease, bleeding disorders, and psychiatric illness. Similarly, the family history is evaluated for any conditions that might have been inherited but are asymptomatic or not yet recognized. The physical examination assesses for optimal neurological and musculoskeletal health as well as evaluation of cardiovascular function.
