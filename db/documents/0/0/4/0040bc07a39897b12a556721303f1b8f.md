Disc edema is often identified in the clinic setting and can variably be a sign of life-threatening or vision-threatening conditions.  The practitioner should not hesitate to expedite a patient's workup by admission to the hospital and aggressive treatment if the patient presents with poor central visual acuity, high-grade disc edema, and a greater frequency of transient visual obscurations.  Additionally, patients with history concerning for underlying cancer or systemic symptoms should be admitted hospitalized for further workup.

As mentioned before, elevated ICP can also occur in the absence of disc edema. The only way to accurately gauge ICP is by direct measurement.  Also, an optic nerve that has undergone atrophy and loss of axons will be less susceptible to becoming edematous with repeated bouts of ICP elevation.
