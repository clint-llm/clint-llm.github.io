Esthesioneuroblastoma, or olfactory neuroblastoma, is a rare malignant neoplasm of the sinonasal tract originating from the olfactory neuroepithelium with neuroblastic differentiation. It most often presents in the superior nasal cavity. Since its initial description in 1924 by Berger and Luc, there have been reports of more than 1000 cases of esthesioneuroblastoma worldwide.
