Longitudinal growth of the phalanges is driven from epiphyseal growth from the proximal portion of the phalanx. Abnormal configuration of the epiphyseal plate results in the curvature seen in clinodactyly. In clinodactyly, a C-shaped physis is often present and results in incomplete or restricted longitudinal growth on one side of the phalanx. In cases of early complete physeal plate ossification, no longitudinal growth will be possible, and a classic delta phalanx will be produced. The severity of the deformity can vary, and a classification system has been described.
