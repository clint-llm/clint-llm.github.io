A highly sensitive and less specific definition of systemic inflammatory response syndrome is inaccurate capture of the true incidence. Not all patients with SIRS get to a healthcare facility or get hospitalized. Clinicians often manage acute viral syndromes in peak season in urgent care and emergency room setting with self-containment afterward. Only those who progress beyond in the continuum of severity are truly captured in the patient census. That also reflects a bias on the severity and all-cause mortality, as well as related outcome measures.

Churpeck et al., in their large-scale study involving 269951 hospitalized patients, found that 15% of patients met at least two diagnostic criteria for SIRS during admission. In contrast, an overwhelming 47% met them at least once during the hospital stay. The mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with SIRS (4.3%) than in those without SIRS (1.2%).

Comstetdt et al. demonstrated that 62% of patients who presented to the emergency department with SIRS had a confirmed infection. In contrast, within the same cohort of patients, 38% of infected patients did not present with SIRS.

In their prospective study of admissions in a tertiary care center, showed that 68% of hospital admissions in their surveyed units met SIRS criteria. 26% developed sepsis, 18% developed severe sepsis, and 4% developed septic shock within 28 days of admission.

As far as variation across sex and race is concerned, Choudhry et al. had observed a protective effect of estrogen in animal models with trauma, hemorrhage, and sepsis. Similarly, NeSmith et al. reported a lower incidence of SIRS in women and African Americans.

For understandable reasons, extremes of age and concomitant medical comorbidities negatively impact the outcome of SIRS.
