**Patho-anatomy and Biomechanics**

The forearm unit consists of radius, ulna, proximal and distal radioulnar joints, and secondary soft tissue stabilizers, including a triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) and the interosseous membrane (IOM). Proximally, the elbow joint capsule and annular ligament stabilize the proximal ulna and radial head. Distally, the ulna articulates with the sigmoid notch of the radius and is stabilized by a triangular fibrocartilage complex and the wrist joint capsule.

Interosseous membrane is located between the radius and ulna. It has five components: 1) the central band, 2) the distal oblique bundle, 3) an accessory band, 4) a proximal oblique cord, and 5) a dorsal oblique accessory cord. It provides stability to the distal radioulnar joint, longitudinal stability to the forearm, and also provides an attachment to the forearm muscles.

The radius and ulna and the secondary soft tissue stabilizers act as a joint that helps in the pronation and supination movements. The key muscles which help in the supination are the biceps brachii and supinator, whereas pronator teres and pronator quadratus help in pronation; these muscles are the primary deforming forces in the forearm fractures. The various movements that occur at the distal end of the forearm include wrist flexion, wrist extension, ulnar and radial deviation. Similarly, elbow flexion and extension occur at the ulnohumeral joint.
