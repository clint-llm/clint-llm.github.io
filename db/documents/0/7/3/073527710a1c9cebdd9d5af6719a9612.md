History and physical examination will dictate whether laboratory studies, imaging, or both are indicated. Most children do not warrant testing. The presence of fever, prolonged symptoms, toxic appearance, or concerning symptoms such as weight loss, easy bruising, joint pain are reasons to initiate a workup.

**Laboratory Studies**

When an infectious or oncologic source is suspected, there are basic hematologic tests that can be useful. Complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) tests are recommended if an infectious etiology is suspected; a blood culture should also be obtained.

**Imaging**

Exposure to ionizing radiation is always a concern in the pediatric population. There are numerous guidelines and expert consensus resources that have endorsed the “as low as reasonably achievable” concept. There are several common imaging modalities can that be employed.

Plain Radiography: Easily available and with low ionizing radiation exposure, this is the first-line imaging modality in children with an antalgic gait. Selected imaging of the involved extremity is recommended. The tibia is cited as the bone that is most likely to have pathology on plain imaging.****Plain radiography is useful in detecting trauma, SCFE, and LCP disease, and it is employed as a first-line imaging modality in suspected cases of osteomyelitis or joint infection, primarily to exclude other pathology. A proper imaging technique is essential to maximize the effectiveness of the modality as pediatric fractures can be subtle. This includes at least 2 views of an involved extremity or a full pelvis view in evaluating hip pain, not a hemipelvis view.****It is also helpful to provide as many relevant historical and physical examination findings as possible to the interpreting radiologist. Ewing sarcoma has a classic “onion skinning” pattern and osteosarcoma a “sunburst” pattern on plain radiography. Both lesions may show poorly defined margins.

Computed Tomography (CT): This modality can be useful in detecting subtle fractures when plain radiography is indeterminate, making it useful in the setting of trauma.****CT is not useful for the evaluation of infectious processes. While widely available in most clinical settings, CT scanning does employ ionizing radiation. Contrast is not employed in trauma settings.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): The advantage of MRI is the lack of ionizing radiation and superb image resolution. This modality is excellent for the evaluation of infectious or oncologic processes. Images are usually obtained with and without contrast. There are several disadvantages of MRI, including lack of availability, cost, and the time required to obtain a study, which often requires sedation in younger children.

Ultrasound (US): This modality is useful for the detection of fractures
