Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting, human insulin analog that works parenterally to lower blood glucose by regulating the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. It works by binding to a glycoprotein receptor specific to insulin on the surface of target cells. These receptors are found on a variety of target tissues, including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the liver.

- In adipose tissue, insulin produces free fatty acids by supporting the processing of circulating lipoproteins. This also helps with the synthesis of triglycerides, as well as adipocyte storage. Insulin also directly inhibits the hydrolysis of triglycerides.

- In the liver, insulin stimulates the synthesis of hepatic glycogen and promotes the synthesis of fatty acids.

- In skeletal muscle, insulin works to increase the synthesis of protein and glycogen.

Insulin prompts the cellular uptake of amino acids and increases cellular permeability to a variety of ions. Lastly, insulin can movie potassium intracellularly by activating sodium-potassium ATPase.

The drug itself is synthesized by using a special non-pathogenic laboratory strain of the bacteria Escherichia coli which has been genetically altered by adding the gene for insulin lispro. Human insulin, normally secreted by the pancreas, has the amino acids lysine and proline at positions B28 and B29. Insulin lispro has these amino acids in the reverse positions, with proline at position B28 and lysine at position B29.
