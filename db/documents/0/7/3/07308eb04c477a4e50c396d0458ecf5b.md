The pathophysiology of venous thrombosis has been famously described by Rudolf Virchow, known as Virchow's triad, which includes stasis, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulability.

Several risk factors, both inherited and acquired, have been specifically studied and associated with venous thrombotic events, and identification of such risk factors can improve diagnostic approaches and, more importantly, the prevention of thrombotic events. Preventive strategies such as using pneumatic devices and prophylactic anticoagulation are a standard of care in hospital medicine, and such strategies are based on identifying the underlying risk factors in an individual patient.
