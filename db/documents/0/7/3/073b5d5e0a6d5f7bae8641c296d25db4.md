Conjunctivitis is the most prevalent etiology of eye redness and discharge. The etiology of conjunctivitis could be infectious or non-infectious. The commonest cause of conjunctivitis is viral conjunctivitis, followed by bacterial conjunctivitis, and among non-infectious etiologies, the most common etiologies are allergic and toxin-induced conjunctivitis.

Infectious conjunctivitis can result from bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. However, 80% of acute cases of conjunctivitis are viral, the most common pathogen being adenovirus. Adenoviruses are responsible for 65 to 90% of cases of viral conjunctivitis.

Bacterial conjunctivitis is far more common in children than adults, and the pathogens responsible for bacterial conjunctivitis vary depending on the age group. Staphylococcal species, specifically staphylococcal aureus, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza, are the most common causes in adults.

Allergens, toxins, and local irritants are responsible for non-infectious conjunctivitis.
