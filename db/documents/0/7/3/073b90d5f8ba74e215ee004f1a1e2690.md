Preparation of the patient includes the following:

- Proper patient positioning- Vaginal hysterectomy is typically performed with the patient positioned in dorsal lithotomy with the help of either candy cane or boot-type stirrups.

- Application of sequential compression devices or administration of anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis

- Antibiotic prophylaxis- We typically use cefazolin 1Â to 2 gm IV, administered within 60 min of the incision.

- Time out (pre-procedure verification checklist) is always performed before the commencement of surgery to confirm the correct patient, type of the operation, equipment used, and the surgeon performing the procedure, as per the standard hospital protocol.

- The patient is examined under anesthesia for the evaluation of size, shape, mobility of the uterus, assessment of the adnexa, and other pelvic structures. The degree of descent of the uterus, vaginal wall caliber, and pelvic organ prolapse, cystocele, and rectocele are assessed.

- Betadine scrub is used for vaginal preparation before the procedure.

- A sterile surgical drape is used to cover the patient to ensure the aseptic environment of the entire procedure.
