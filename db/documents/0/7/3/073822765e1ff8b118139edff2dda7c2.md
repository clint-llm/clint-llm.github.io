Obtain informed consent from the patient including risks, benefits, and alternative therapies to the procedure. Conduct a pre-procedure "time out" to verify patient identity with name, date, and MRN, confirm allergies, and confirm the site at which you will be administering the nerve block. Position the patient so that the dorsal surface of their foot and anterior leg is easily accessible. This is best achieved by having the patient lay down in bed with their knees bent and the plantar surfaces of their feet firmly against the bed. Prior to initiating the block, perform a detailed neurovascular exam of the extremity to be blocked and document any preexisting abnormalities. Aseptic technique is used with the application of chlorhexidine gluconate 2% or povidone-iodine solution to the skin of the injection site. Apply a sterile ultrasound probe cover and sterile gel to the high-frequency linear probe. Draw up the anesthetic solution in a sterile syringe and have appropriate monitors attached to the patient (e.g. pulse oximeter, blood pressure cuff, and ECG leads).
