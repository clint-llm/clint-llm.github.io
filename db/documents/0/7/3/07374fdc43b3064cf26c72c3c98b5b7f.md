**Morphology**

Granular cell tumors are characterized by infiltrative, non-encapsulated nests, cords, or sheets of polygonal and occasionally spindled cells with abundant eosinophilic, finely granular cytoplasm. Many of the tumors have Pustulo-ovoid bodies of Milian, which are large granules with clear halos.

**Malignant Features**

These lesions can be sub-classified into benign, atypical, and malignant categories based on histologic features. The first system was developed in 1998 by Fanburg-Smith et al.Â using these six features: necrosis, increased mitotic count (greater than 2 per 10 high power fields), spindled tumor cells, nuclear pleomorphism, prominent nucleoli, and vesicular nuclei, and high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio.

**Immunohistochemistry**

Both benign and malignant tumor cells typically stain positively for S-100, CD68, neuron-specific enolase, CD57, inhibin, calretinin, TFE3, SOX10, CD56, PGP9.5, and vimentin.

**Additional Features**

Although benign granular cell tumors are readily identified morphologically, there are some features that can be mistaken for malignancy. Benign lesions located deep to the skin or deep to a mucosal surface can induce reactive pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, which closely mimics squamous cell carcinoma in superficial biopsies and is found in over half of cases.
