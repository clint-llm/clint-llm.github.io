- Consider anaerobic infection if the site of suspected infection is adjacent to a normal indigenous anaerobic flora, such as the mouth, bowel, or female genital tract.

- Identifying a predisposition such as obstruction, perforation, injury, the inability of the host to clear secretions, decreased blood flow to the tissue, such as tissue necrosis.

- Clues to an anaerobic infection include foul-smelling discharge, and infection is not responding to antibiotics without any anaerobic activity.

- An attempt should be made to send anaerobic cultures, which involves the proper collection, expeditious transport, and proper culture methods. Tissue or purulent material is preferred over sending swabs.

- Metronidazole has broad-spectrum anaerobic activity with the least resistance. Other anaerobic antibiotics include clindamycin, penicillin beta-lactamase inhibitor combination, second-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, and quinolones.
