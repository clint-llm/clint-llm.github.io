Initial medical treatment focuses on fluid resuscitation and correcting electrolyte imbalances. Avoid vasopressors and alpha-adrenergic agents, which may cause vasospasm. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be givenÂ before surgery to avoid abdominal sepsis if the necrotic bowel is resected.

Early surgical exploration is required to assess the level of ischemia and spread of necrosis. Revascularization of the bowel is the primary goal of surgery and excision of necrotic bowel is necessary. After revascularization, the bowel should be assessed for viability, which includes checking for pulses with a continuous wave Doppler, peristalsis, and normal color. Depending on the vessel occlusion type and location, open or endovascular surgical interventions are indicated in treating occlusive mesenteric arterial ischemia. Bowel resection occurs in 53% of second-look surgeries and 31% during exploratory surgery at the first attempt to revascularization. The difficulty of assessing the extent of necrosis of the bowel warrants a second-look surgery 12 to 48 hours after revascularization.

As NOMI is secondary to vasospasm rather than occlusion, treatment is medically focused and relies upon reversing the underlying cause of the low-flow state. Catheter-directed papaverine (phosphodiesterase inhibitor) delivered by a side-hole catheter or thrombolysis catheter is an interventional option.
