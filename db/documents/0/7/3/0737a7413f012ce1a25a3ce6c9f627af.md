This includes both physical and psychological elements of preparation; the stoma nurses are again invaluable here to help support the patient through this process. Physical preparation varies somewhat on the nature of the operation involved and whether it is an emergency procedure or a planned elective operation.

Points to consider include:

- Shaving of hair on the abdominal wall

- Body mass index (BMI) of patients having a planned ileostomy in an elective setting: They may be asked to lose weight prior to the operation to not only improve their anesthetic suitability but also reduce the distance the small bowel mesentery has to traverse to be bought to the skin without being under tension.

- Previous operative scars/deformities of the abdominal wall. A previous operation increases the extent of adhesions

- The presence of herniae

- Also in a planned setting, one would consider the effect of smoking and diabetic control on wound healing

- Most importantly would be the positioning of the stoma site, which is usually on the right side of the abdomen at the lateral edge of the rectus muscle, at a level where the patient can see it, access it easily and not have it interfering with belts or skin folds. It should also ideally avoid the costal margin and umbilicus.

- A nasogastric tube in cases of obstruction/perforation or if anticipating a post-operative ileus

- Adequate fluid and electrolyte resuscitation
