The uterus is a female reproductive organ that can be visualized by transabdominal or transvaginal ultrasound posterior to the bladder and anterior to the colon. Ovaries are paired reproductive organs and can be found lateral to the uterus in the pelvic cavity. The uterus has three parts: the cervix, the body, and the fundus.  In non-pregnant females, the uterine cavity collapses. In early pregnancy, by 4.5 to 5 weeks gestation, the gestational sac appears in the central portion of the uterine body, initially measuring 2 to 3 mm in diameter.
