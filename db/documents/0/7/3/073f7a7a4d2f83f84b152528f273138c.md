Carpal tunnel syndrome is the commonest and most well-studied nerve compression syndrome of the hand. In the United States, it has an annual incidence of 1 to 3 persons per 1000 and a prevalence of 50 people per 1000. The incidence increases with age, affecting women more commonly than men with a ratio of 10 to 1. Activities and occupations that require a high degree of a repetitive activity involving the hand or upper extremity are more commonly associated with nerve compression syndromes. Additionally, conditions that trigger a chronic inflammatory state, such as diabetes or hypothyroidism, are also frequently implicated in the development of nerve compression.
