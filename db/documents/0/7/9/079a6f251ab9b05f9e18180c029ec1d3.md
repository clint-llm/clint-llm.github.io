The bites of mosquitoes may be a minor problem or may lead to serious medical conditions including mosquito-borne illnesses and severe allergic reactions. In recent years Dengue, West Nile Virus, Chikungunya, and Zika virus have had increasing incidence in the United States. It is imperative for healthcare professionals to be up to date on not only how to treat local reactions, but how to prevent bites and diminish the impact of the next big epidemic. The interprofessional team should work together in diagnosing and treating the patient, as well as in providing patient education.

Identifying and treating mosquito bites and their sequelae is best addressed as part of an interprofessional team approach including primary care physicians, infective disease specialists, mid-level practitioners, and nursing staff (including nurses with specialty training in infectious disease control) to provide optimal patient care.
