**Imaging**

In the context of undescended testis,Â imaging methods can serve to determine the anatomical location of undescended testes; this allows for better pre-surgical planning and reduces the extent of exploration and anesthesia time.

**Karyotyping**

Chromosomal changes are detectable through the use of a technique known as karyotyping, which allows the identification of the chromosomes so that in situations where there may be an extra or missing chromosome, it is detectable through karyotyping.
