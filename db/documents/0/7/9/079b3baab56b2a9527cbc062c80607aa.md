Between 1975 and 2002, global elimination programs were focused on vector control, and this has largely been very successful in West Africa where it started. Following this in 1995, the focus was shifted to the use of ivermectin as the standard of care. A key drawback, however, is that ivermectin has only a temporary effect on the adult worms. Microfilariae repopulation occurs in a few months with microfilaridermia preceding the ocular presentation of microfilariae. This underscores the need for repeated treatments for at least 10 to 15 years, the life span of the adult worm. To overcome these, better treatments that have direct effects on the adult worm would need to be developed, and several such studies are already underway. One such study is looking into a combination of benzimidazole and benzoxaborole.

Promising microfilaricidal drugs like moxidectin, when approved, would likely reduce the current number of times and length of treatment for onchocerciasis**.**

It is needed to deepen the understanding of ocular pathomechanisms in onchocerciasis. In the past, these have been difficult as the only ways to do these were the use of fundus fluorescein angiography, which is invasive with considerable side effects in some patients. With the advent of high definition optical coherence tomography and other retinal imaging technologies, there are safer ways of probing the posterior segment involvement in onchocerciasis.
