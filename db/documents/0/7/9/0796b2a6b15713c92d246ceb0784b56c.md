Three phases of memory include (1)Â registration, (2) storage, and (3) retrieval of information. The hippocampus, parahippocampal region of the medial temporal lobe, and the neocortical association have been shown through the autopsy and imaging studies to be essential for memory processing. Impairment of short-term memory leading up to an inability to form new memories occurs when there is bilateral damage to the above mention regions

In lower animals, the hippocampus helps them determine if they will eat certain foods, based on olfactory discernment, avoid danger; respond to sexual invites through pheromones, or react to life and death decisions. The hippocampus is a site for decision-making and committing information to memory for future safety uses. Thus it has a mechanism to convert short-term memory into long-term memory, consolidating the verbal and symbolic thinking into information that can be accessed when needed for decision making.
