Most patients with hereditary spherocytosis have a positive family history.

The classic triad of jaundice, anemia, and splenomegaly is rare in neonates. The most common finding in this population is jaundice. Thus hereditary spherocytosis should be considered in neonates with hyperbilirubinemia of unknown cause. Additionally, spherocytes are seen less often in newborns along with several markers of the hemolysis that are typically present in older infants or adults.

Most neonates with hereditary spherocytosis have a positive family history; this should increase suspicion and aid in the diagnostic workup of patients with an unknown cause of jaundice.
