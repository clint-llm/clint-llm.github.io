From 2009 through 2012, the prevalence of pre-diabetes in the United States was 37% in adults older than 20 years and 51% in those older than 65 years. According to ADA, in 2015, 84.1 million Americans age 18 and older had prediabetes. People with IGT are generally asymptomatic and have only increased glucose level; therefore, a large proportion of these patients remains undiagnosed.

In 2010, the worldwide prevalence of glucose intolerance was about 8%

Zhang et al. did a systematic review on the A1C level and future risk of diabetes and found that as A1C increased from 6.0% to 6.5%, 5-year incidence of diabetes showed an increase of 25% to 50%. Conversion from GI to diabetes varies with population characteristics and criteria used for diagnosis.
