Diagnosis is based on the combined clinical picture and serologic testing. The latter requires the presence of antibodies with one being a non-treponemal antigen and the other a treponemal antigen. The non-treponemal antibodies are the same as used in syphilitic disease: the venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR). These have a chance of false-positive results but good sensitivity and are useful as markers to confirm cure with falling titers following treatment. The treponema-specific antibodies includeÂ Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) and haemagglutination (TPHA) assays. Once positive, these latter 2 tests are positive for life.

Additionally, as the treponemes are indistinguishable serologically and early clinical features may overlap accurate diagnosis may be difficult. A combination of epidemiology, clinical signs and symptoms, direct visualization, and serologic data are required to establish the diagnosis.
