Successful removal of an ear foreign body requires a cooperative patient and may require the assistance of family members as well as other medical team members. Patient positioning and a well-thought-out plan are keys to the success of the procedure. Explaining to patients and families what will happen and securing their cooperation is important. Involving family members and/or staff members for positioning can be very helpful as well. Another consideration is the use of medications for anxiolysis or procedural sedation to facilitate patient cooperation. This requires appropriate ancillary staff, such as nursing for intravenous line placement and medication administration, and potentially anesthesia or respiratory therapy to assist in airway monitoring. With appropriate team coordination, EAC foreign body removal can be performed safely and rapidly with a low risk for complications and minimal stress for the patient. All members of the interprofessional team, most notably clinicians (including physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and nurses, should be able to identify the problem, assist experienced hands in foreign body removal, and know when to refer the patient in more complicated cases; this will result in better patient outcomes.
