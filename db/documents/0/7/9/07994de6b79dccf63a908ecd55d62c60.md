Hypertensive heart disease is a chronic progressive disease that carries a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular death. Hypertension is one of the predominant risk factors for the development of several cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, aortic aneurysm, and chronic kidney disease. The overall prognosis of hypertensive heart disease is variable but depends on a variety of factors such as the specific manifestations of the disease, the presence of concomitant cardiovascular disease or risk factors, and other comorbid conditions. Cardiovascular risk calculators are available, and patients should be stratified into either high or low risk for cardiovascular events. Specific manifestations of HHD such as heart failure or atrial fibrillation carry a substantially increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Patients with diastolic heart failure confer a similar risk and morbidity to patients with low ejection heart failure with 6-month mortality observed as high as 16%.
