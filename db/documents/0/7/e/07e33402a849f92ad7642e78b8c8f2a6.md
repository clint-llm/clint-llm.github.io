Patients will present with gluteal pain and/or upper posterior thigh pain following prolonged sitting or exercise. The patient will most commonly complain of a low grade, pinpoint, and aching pain worsened by sitting down or stretching the gluteus maximus muscle. Patients may complain of problems sleeping because of the pain. Patients also may have reduced mobility and swelling associated with this condition. On physical exam, the examiner may note tenderness over the buttock. Patients may have pain with passive flexion at the hip joint. The patient also may have an inability to extend the hip. The patient may feel pain with stretching. There may be overlying erythema, although less this is commonly associated with ischial bursitis. If erythema is a major part of the presentation, this may point to other etiologies such as cellulitis or septic joint.
