The diagnosis of uncomplicated intercostal neuralgia is based solely on history and physical exam. A diagnostic intercostal nerve block can aid in diagnosis. Although physical examination and history may be sufficient to elicit the diagnosis of intercostal neuralgia, in some cases, imaging may be indicated. In the event of trauma, roentgenography (X-ray) or computerized tomography (CT)  may be useful in demonstrating compression or transection from a broken rib or foreign body. If a patient has had a thoracotomy for removal of cancer, thoracic pain may be a result of PTPS, but it may also be a sign of cancer recurrence and metastasis to the chest wall, and so CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be indicated.

In some cases, electromyography may be useful for evaluating the function of the intercostal nerves.
