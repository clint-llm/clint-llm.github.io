The treatment of patients with synovial sarcoma is based on the stage of presentation. A patient with SS can either present with localized or metastatic disease. Generally, a localized disease is approached to achieve a microscopic negative margin (R0 resection) surgically. Where neoadjuvant chemotherapy is widely used in the pediatric population, the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is controversial in adults.

Treating patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic synovial sarcoma aims at palliation and prolonging life. The therapy involves using cytotoxic chemotherapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or enrolling the patient in a clinical trial.Â We will discuss various modalities in the relevant sections.
