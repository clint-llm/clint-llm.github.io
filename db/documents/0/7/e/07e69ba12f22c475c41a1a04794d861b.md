Disruption of myelin sheath integrity leads to disruptions in nerve conduction and, if severe enough, complete conduction block. Minor acute damage to peripheral nerves will often resolve unaided.Â  Conduction velocity may still be slower after recovery because Schwann cell-mediated remyelination occurs with thinner myelin and with nodes more closely spaced along the axon.
