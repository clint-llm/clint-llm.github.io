Hypercortisolism is a clinical syndrome that afflicts virtually every organ system either directly or indirectly.

- Decreased bone mass, osteopenia, osteoporosis, or osteonecrosis are particularly associated with exogenous rather than endogenous HCM, with the hips being the most commonly afflicted bones.

- Cardiovascular disease, includingÂ hypertension, accelerated atherosclerotic vascular disease (including coronary artery disease and various acute coronary artery syndromes, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease), dilated cardiomyopathy.

- Dyslipidemia including hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia

- Development of the dysmetabolic syndrome

- Impaired glucose tolerance or frank diabetes mellitus with all the attendant complications and comorbidities that can accompany that.

- Obesity which is classically described as truncal dominant with relative extremity atrophy (so-called "apple on sticks" phenotype) but can be associated with generalized adiposity

- Linear growth impairment in children

- Proximal myopathy

- Hypogonadism and subfertility or infertility

- Increased predisposition to cutaneous and systemic infections, usually bacterial and fungal.

- Dyspepsia and gastro-esophageal reflux disease

- Nephrolithiasis

- Myriad cutaneous manifestations including cutaneous atrophy, ecchymoses, striae, recurrent cutaneous infections, hyperpigmentation in patients with pituitary CS, EcCS, and ectopic CRH syndrome states, alopecia, hirsutism, hypertrichosis, poor wound healing, acanthosis nigricans, excessive acne, etc.

- Ophthalmic complications of which cataracts and open-angle glaucoma are the most prevalent. Exophthalmos has also been described, especially with exogenous glucocorticoid exposure.

- Myriad neuropsychiatric syndromes including but not restricted to so-called "steroid psychosis," depression, bipolar state, dysthymia, chronic anxiety, etc.

- Cognitive decline, including progressive memory loss and a dementia-like illness in the most severe cases with associated brain cortical atrophy

- A decline in overall quality of life

- Increased coagulopathic risk, including increased risk for deep venous thrombosis and embolism

- Increased risk for secondary or primary adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome following the successful treatment of HCM

- Increased risk for development of Nelson syndrome post bilateral adrenalectomy

- Sleep derangements, including sleep deprivation, chronic insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome.

Economic toll: In this age of increasing attention and concern regarding the cost-effectiveness of medical care, this is not a minor issue with some estimates suggesting that HCM is associated with at least a 4x greater total health management costs than age and gender-matched controls. Other more recent estimates suggest that the total cost of care for Cushing disease in the United States amounts to approximately $35000/year just on its own.

In the unique and uncommon scenario of HCM in pregnancy, impaired glucose tolerance or gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preeclampsia, heart failure, psychiatric disorders, and increased fetal loss are the most common consequent complications. While the fetus in such pregnancies tend to be somewhat protected from the maternal HCM because of the effects of placental 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase which converts approximately 85% of the maternal cortisol reaching the placenta to relatively inert cortisone this protective system can be overwhelmed with increased fetal loss, intrauterine growth retardation, premature delivery, and neonatal adrenal insufficiency described.
