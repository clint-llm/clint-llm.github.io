Postoperative care for open-reduction internal fixation with volar plating includes immediate volar splinting following surgery. The patient is instructed to perform active range of motion exercises for the digits andÂ elevate their wrist above heart level to prevent stiffness and aid in edema control. The splint is removed 1 to 2 weeks after surgery for a wound check. A removable splint should be fabricated by a hand therapist to help with edema and worn at all times to protect fracture fixation. The patient should remain non-weight bearing of the upper extremity but may begin active range of motion exercises of the wrist after the first post-operative visit. At 4 to 6 weeks putty and grip exercises may be added. At 6 to 8 weeks, the splint is discontinued, and progressive strengthening exercises are advanced. The patient will typically be discharged to activities as tolerated at the 10 to 12-week mark.
