Motor output of the eyeball is by cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. These supply the extraocular muscles and initiate the movement of the eye.

Afferent fibers to the cornea are by the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve and initiate the corneal reflex. Efferent fibers are by the zygomatic branch of the facial nerve that helps in the motor output of the reflex.
