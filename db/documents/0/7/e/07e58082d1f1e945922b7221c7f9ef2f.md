The (limbus) fossa ovalis represents the most direct anatomical landmark for atrial septal puncture for various procedures and may be located using the His bundle electrogram locating method.

- Patent foramen ovale and atrial septal defect repair

- Right heart catheterization

- Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty

- Radiofrequency catheter ablation

- Pulmonary vein isolation

- Left atrial appendage closure

- Catheter-based mitral valve repair

- Hemodynamic assessment of the mitral valve

- Paravalvular leak closure

- Alternative access to the left ventricle in the presence of a prosthetic aortic valve

Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) and fluoroscopy are useful for identifying the fossa ovalis, a critical landmark for electrophysiological procedures.
