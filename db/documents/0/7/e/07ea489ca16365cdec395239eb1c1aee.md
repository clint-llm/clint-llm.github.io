Crush injuries of the extremities are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a surgeon, HBO specialist, wound specialist, ICU nurses, radiologist, orthopedic surgeon, vascular surgeon, and an internist. The key is to resuscitate the patient and salvage viable tissue. Once debridement and fasciotomy have been performed, HBO therapy may help improve the salvage rate of viable tissue.

The outcomes of patients with crush injuries are guarded as many individuals also have other associated injuries.
