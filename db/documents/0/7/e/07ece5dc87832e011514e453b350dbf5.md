Most commonly, patients experiencing basilar artery occlusion exhibit acute neurologic signs including motor deficits, hemiparesis or quadriparesis, and facial palsies, dizziness, headache, and speech abnormalities–especially dysarthria and difficulty articulating words. Patients may also complain of nausea, vomiting, and changes in vision. An altered level of consciousness is commonly present.

Basilar artery thrombosis may present in three general constellations:

- Rapid onset of advanced motor and bulbar symptoms with a decreased level of consciousness.

- Insidious or stuttering symptoms over a few days as a combination of the above that end with disabling motor and bulbar symptoms, a decreased level of consciousness, or both.

- Prodromal symptoms may include headache, neck pain, loss of vision, binocular diplopia, dysarthria, dizziness, hemiparesis, paresthesias, ataxia, and tonic-clonic type movements. “Herald hemiparesis” is the phrase to describe the momentary, unilateral weakness that may precede later permanent symptoms.

An abnormal level of consciousness and focal motor weakness are the hallmark symptoms manifested in the majority of patients. Pupillary abnormalities, oculomotor signs, and pseudobulbar manifestations (facial palsy, dysphonia, dysarthria, dysphagia) are seen in more than 40% of patients.
