Luspatercept is an FDA-approved drug indicated to be used to treat anemia in patients who need regular red blood cell transfusions in beta-thalassemia.

The ringed sideroblastic phenotype subgroup of patients has higher response rates.

The recommendation for luspatercept administration is 1mg/kg subcutaneously once every three weeks for patients with beta-thalassemia.

Luspatercept is not meant for use as a substitute for red blood cell transfusions in patients who need rapid correction of anemia.
