Patients must not use methylphenidate if they are currently on monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). There should be a minimum of at least 14 days after discontinuation of MAOIs before methylphenidate can be considered a safe treatment option to begin due to the risk of hypertensive crisis.

Medical conditions that are not compatible with methylphenidate include glaucoma, severe hypertension, motor tics, Tourette syndrome, or a family history of Tourette syndrome.

If a patient is noticeably anxious, tense, or agitated, then seek alternative treatment options. However, it can be given cautiously in patients with a history of bipolar disorder or psychosis as long as clinicians are wary of mania or psychotic episodes induced by the medication.

Any patient who develops a hypersensitive reaction to methylphenidate or an individual component of a formulation should have the medication immediately discontinued and switch to another pharmacologic agent.

Children under the age of six should not be prescribed this medication as there are limited studies to prove its safety or benefit, and it could cause learning impairments.
