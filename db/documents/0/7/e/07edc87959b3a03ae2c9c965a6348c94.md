The pathophysiology of NODAT is almost as same as type 2 DM: increase in insulin resistance and decrease in insulin secretion. In NODAT, insulin hyposecretion seems to have a more important role in glucose intolerance. NODAT more likely occurs in patients who have other risk factors in developing DM type 2. Immunosuppression regimen is one of the leading causes of NODAT; this acts by affecting insulin secretion and action.
