Although the MAUDE database contains valuable information pertaining to the safety of medical devices, there are some general limitations that the researcher must be aware of when analyzing the data; these include the following:

- Adverse events may be recorded both by the operators and the manufacturers, resulting in duplicate reports and difficulty in distinguishing,

- Because the reporting is not universally mandated, there may be underreporting, and as such unknown number of complications or device malfunctions may go untallied,

- Adverse events caused many operator errors may be underreported,

- The database may contain incomplete, biased, and imprecise reports that may not be objectively and independently verified or adjudicated,

- Because of the lack of information regarding the total devices used in the study timeframe, it is not possible to determine the true incidence and prevalence rates of the adverse events,

- Only a minority of the devices are actually returned to the manufacturer; therefore, the input by the device manufacturer is lacking in many reports,

- Because of the lack of detailed analysis, a cause and effect relationship between the device and the adverse event cannot be ascertained in many reports,

- Results are limited to reports submitted within the last 10 years, i) results are restricted to 500 records per entry.
