The development of the umbilical cord begins in the third week of embryologic formation. The developing embryo consists of a trilaminar disc attached to the decidua basalis by the connecting stalk, the primitive umbilical cord.

Starting in week three, endothelial precursor cells in the mesoderm surrounding the allantois coalesce to form small capillaries. Vasculogenesis continues, and by the end of the third week, the capillaries have grown to establish a functional vascular network within the connecting stalk. During the same period, the arterial and venous systems within the embryo are developing. The arterial system is initially established as the paired dorsal aortae from which the aortic arches originate. The primitive venous system is initially made up of the umbilical, vitelline, and cardinal systems. Early in the fourth week, two umbilical arteries branch from the paired dorsal aortae to become connected to the vascular network of the umbilical cord.

By week seven, the intestines begin to herniate out of the embryo through the umbilical ring and into the umbilical cord.
