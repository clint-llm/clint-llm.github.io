As discussed in previous sections, the vast majority of individuals with elevated blood lead concentrations will have no clinical manifestations of plumbism. Those with mild symptoms often get misdiagnosed because their symptoms are so nonspecific. As such, lead toxicity should merit consideration in the differential of children presenting with behavioral problems (the so-called “difficult child”) as well as those presenting with nonspecific GI complaints such as constipation, abdominal pain, or picky eating. Realistically, these types of complaints are so common in toddlerhood that relatively few are likely secondary to lead, but blood testing for lead is so simple that it should not be overlooked, particularly because these symptoms can be the harbinger of much more severe toxicity if the child continues to be exposed to lead. Similarly, many children with anemia secondary to lead toxicity are also at risk for iron deficiency anemia, and lead’s role in precipitating anemia may easily be overlooked. Adults with peripheral neuropathy may present with symptoms mimicking carpal tunnel syndrome, and the underlying etiology in those with saturnine gout may not be appreciated, especially if the patient is an older male with a high purine diet (the prototypical patient who develops gout unrelated to lead toxicity). Patients with severe plumbism and especially those with lead encephalopathy may clinically look like patients with infectious or autoimmune encephalitis; again, though these cases are rare, blood lead testing is so ubiquitously available that it should not be overlooked.
