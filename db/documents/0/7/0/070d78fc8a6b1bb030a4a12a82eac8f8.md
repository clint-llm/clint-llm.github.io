In many cases, PRP is self-limited and asymptomatic therefore does not necessarily require treatment.

The treatment of PRP can be challenging, and no universal approach exists. There are no treatments approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Most practitioners recommend combination therapy with topical for symptomatic management and systemic therapy aimed at reducing inflammation. Topical agents which have shown promise especially in mild disease include emollients, keratolytic agents, such as urea, salicylic acid, or alpha-hydroxy acid containing preparations, topical corticosteroids, tazarotene, and topical calcineurin inhibitors. Generally accepted first-line systemic agent for both adults and children is oral retinoids. Oral isotretinoin, 1 to 1.5 mg/kg per day, has been shown to induce clearance in as little as 3 to 6 months. Methotrexate alone or in combination with oral retinoids has also been used frequently. However, combination therapy increased the risk for systemic toxicity. Recently, some case reports and small case series have shown a possible role for biologic immunosuppressive agents typically used in the treatment of psoriases such as TNF-alpha inhibitors and secukinumab and ustekinumab. Although the risk of photo-triggered and/or photoactivated disease UV-light therapy has been implemented in certain cases, including narrowband UVB, UVA1, or PUVA in combination with an oral retinoid with some success.
