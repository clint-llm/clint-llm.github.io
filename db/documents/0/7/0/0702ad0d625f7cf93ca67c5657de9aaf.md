Parasympathomimetics are a class of pharmacological agents that activate the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. These drugs work by mimicking or modifying the effects of acetylcholine (ACh), the primary neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system. Parasympathomimetic medications are classified into two main categories based on whether they are direct agonists or indirect agonists of ACh. Direct agonists directly bind and activate muscarinic ACh receptors, while indirect agonists increase synaptic levels of ACh by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Listed below are the major indications for various parasympathomimetic drugs:

**Direct-Acting Parasympathomimetics**

- Bethanechol: Urinary retention, postoperative and neurogenic ileus

- Carbachol: Induction of miosis, open-angle glaucoma

- Cevimeline: Xerostomia (especially in Sjögren syndrome)

- Methacholine: Challenge test to assess airway hyperresponsiveness in the clinical diagnosis of asthma

- Pilocarpine: Induction of sweating, lacrimation, and salivation, open-angle, and closed-angle glaucoma

**Indirect-Acting Parasympathomimetics**

- Donepezil, Rivastigmine, and Galantamine: Alzheimer disease

- Edrophonium: Historically used in the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis

- Neostigmine: Postoperative and neurogenic ileus and urinary retention, myasthenia gravis, postoperative reversal of neuromuscular blockade

- Physostigmine: Antidote for anticholinergic toxicity

- Pyridostigmine: Myasthenia gravis
