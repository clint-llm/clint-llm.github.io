**PTSD**

The differential diagnosis of PTSD is extensive and is complicated by high rates of psychiatric comorbidities, some of which are addressed under “Complications.” Below is a limited list focusing on adults:

- Acute stress disorder: Individuals presenting with at least nine of fourteen symptoms in the five categories (intrusion, negative mood, dissociation, avoidance, and arousal), lasting between three days to a month after a trauma, and suffering functional impairment, qualify for this diagnosis. The majority of patients recover within this period. Those who remain symptomatic after thirty days are reclassified as having PTSD.

- Adjustment disorders

- Depressive disorders

- Anxiety disorders: includes specific phobias, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), panic disorder, agoraphobia, and generalized anxiety disorder.

- Substance use

- Obsessive-compulsive disorder

- Bereavement

- Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders

- Personality disorders, especially borderline personality disorder

- Dissociative disorders

- Conversion disorder

- TBI

**Depression**

While the entire differential diagnosis for MDD is expansive and beyond the scope of this article, three other conditions must be considered before establishing this diagnosis: grief, adjustment disorder, and persistent depressive disorder (PDD). Grief usually occurs with the loss of a loved one. Patients experiencing grief often have symptoms that overlap with depression, such as decreased interest in activities, depressed mood, and thoughts about the deceased individual.

**Substance Use Disorders**

Differential diagnoses depend on the substance in use and are numerous. In addition, most other DSM-5 diagnoses require ruling out substance-induced variants, which can manifest in similar ways or trigger the onset of such disorders. Categories of diagnoses associated with substances include psychotic, bipolar, depressive, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive and related sleep disorders, sexual dysfunction, delirium, and neurocognitive disorders.
