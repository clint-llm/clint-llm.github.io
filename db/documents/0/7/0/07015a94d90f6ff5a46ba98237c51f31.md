It might be quite difficult for clinicians to diagnose DSD since the disease presentation mimics a myriad of other conditions. A high index of clinical suspicion with the relevant investigation is the key to diagnosis. Involving nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, and patients themselves is crucial for a holistic management approach. When possible, patients should be encouraged to perform clean intermittent self-catheterization, which requires them to have sufficient motivation and dedication as well as adequate manual dexterity, cognitive function, compatible body size and shape, and a psychological acceptation of the technique. If the patient is treated at home, community nurses and social workers should be involved to monitor patients and make referrals when needed.
