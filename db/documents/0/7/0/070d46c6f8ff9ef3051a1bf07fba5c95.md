Idiopathic thrombophlebitis migrans occurs between the ages of 25 and 50 years; the average age is about 40. Men are affected three times more than that of women and occur in otherwise healthy adults.

Virtually all cancers have correlations with migratory thrombophlebitis. Different series have reported different frequencies of cancer types associated with migratory thrombophlebitis. Some reported a high incidence in the pancreatic body and tail carcinomas, and few others reported higher incidence in lung adenocarcinomas in males and malignancy of reproductive tract in females.
