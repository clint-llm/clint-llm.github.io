At present, it is unclear whether specific management distinct from that of IPF or CT-ILD is needed. Facts regarding idiopathic interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) treatment are merely limited to case series, and further research is necessary to determine the optimal treatment approach in the IPAF population. As previously acknowledged with other ILDs, pulmonary rehabilitation, long-term oxygen supplementation therapy if applicable, and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux if existing is recommended.

Another large retrospective study of 125 patients with CTD-ILD encompassed nineteen patients with IPAF. In that study, mycophenolate (MMF) was related to an improved FVC in all tested patients.

The INBUILD trial suggests that nintedanib decreases the rate of ILD progression, as measured by forced vital capacity (FVC) decline in patients who have a chronic fibrosing ILD and progressive phenotype, irrespective of the underlying ILD diagnosis (including IPAF).
