Renal leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a rare, but aggressive malignancy that carries an overall poor prognosis. There are no established risk factors, so prevention is not an option. Many studiesÂ suggest patients succumb to the disease, this observation was common in the patients with intermediate to high-grade tumors. Patient education is important as the rate of local recurrence of this tumor in the first two years is high, good compliance with regular follow-up can help to identify the recurrence at an early stage and improve the outcome.
