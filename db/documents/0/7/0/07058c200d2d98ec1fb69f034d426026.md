The majority of post-intubation laryngeal edema is asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic after extubation & does not require any intervention. Post-extubation stridor represents the symptomatic form of severe laryngeal edema in nearly two-thirds of such patients. Almost 50% of patients with post-extubation stridor will require reintubation. it should also be noted that different patients will have varying laryngeal injuries of different grades in isolation or in combination which determines the clinical manifestation.

About 10.5% of the patients with laryngeal edema will progress to worsening respiratory failure and need reintubation despite all medical measures. Again, another small percentage will need tracheostomy after a reassessment with medical management after 24 to 48 hours. Since reintubation events are known to increase the risk of morbidity and mortality significantly, prompt recognition of high-risk patients for post-intubation stridor/laryngeal edema by performing a bedside CLT in the high-risk patients will help to identify and chalk out a preventive measure by administering IV steroids.
