Treatment of chromium deficiency is primarily supplementation. According to the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, the Dietary Reference Intake of chromium is 20 to 35 mcg/day. While there is no distinct guideline on the treatment and management of chromium deficiency, it has been recognized that pharmacologic amounts of chromium may relieve patients of their symptoms. The doses have averaged around 200 mcg/day and are generally in the hundreds of mcg of chromium added to the total parenteral nutrition solution for approximately two weeks.

Healthy individuals absorb approximately 0.15 mcg/day of chromium from a well-balanced diet. The current standard chromium supplementation added to total parenteral nutrition for individuals not being treated for chromium deficiency is about 10 to 15 mcg of chromium per day. This is much higher than the amount of chromium that is naturally absorbed.
