Macrolides are a class of drugs used to manage and treat various bacterial infections. Azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin are commonly used to treat infections like pneumonia, sinusitis, pharyngitis, and tonsillitis. They are also used in uncomplicated skin infections and otitis media in pediatric patients. Clarithromycin is used to treat Helicobacter pylori infections in standard triple therapy protocol regardless of clarithromycin resistance status. Macrolides are also commonly used to treat sexually transmitted infections such as gonococcal and chlamydial infections. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, indications, contraindications, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) related to macrolides.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of the macrolide class of antibiotics.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of the macrolide class of antibiotics.
- Review the appropriate monitoring necessary for patients on agents in the macrolide class of antibiotics.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving the proper administration and management of macrolide antibiotics.
