Pre-operative and post-operative shunt surgery outcomes are measurable with the following validated scales: the NPH Japanese Scale (NPH Scale), the Berg Balance Scale, the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), and the Timed Up and Go (TUG).

Cytokines like CSF IL-10 and IL-33 could be useful in the diagnosis as well as follow-up of patients with NPH.
