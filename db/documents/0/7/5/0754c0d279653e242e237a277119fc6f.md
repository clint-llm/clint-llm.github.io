After performing careful testing of extraocular motility in each eye separately followed by ocular alignment testing (which should be performed by doing alternate cover testing and abnormalities recorded in each cardinal position of gaze utilizing measurements in prism diopters), an examiner has to combine all findings to figure out whether they can be due to an isolated palsy of the 3rd, 4th or 6th cranial nerves. The management of each one of these entities is different and is discussed below. Identifying complete third nerve palsy and sixth nerve palsy is relatively straightforward, but diagnosing partial third nerve paresis can be tricky. The examiner has to be very familiar with the 3-step text described above in order to diagnose 4th nerve palsy.

If there is more than one cranial nerve palsy, urgent neuroimaging (MRI of the brain and orbits with contrast enhancement) is mandatory, looking for the lesions in the area of the cavernous sinuses, superior orbital fissure, and extraocular muscles. If fatiguability, variability, decreased orbicularis strength or any other symptoms of ocular or generalized myasthenia gravis are present, acetylcholine receptor antibody testing should be performed, although its sensitivity is only about 50 to 70%

All patients with the third nerve palsy (regardless of whether it is complete or partial, pupillary sparing or pupillary involving) should undergo an emergency CT angiography of the brain in order to rule out an aneurysmal compressive lesion of the third cranial nerve in its subarachnoid compartment

For patients with the 4th nerve palsy, if the hyper deviation in the affected eye is greater in upgaze than in downgaze, it can be safely assumed that it is likely either decompensated congenital, post-traumatic, or microischemic in nature and should either be palliated with the prisms in the spectacles or observed for spontaneous improvement

Patients with acute onset of 6th nerve palsy who have vascular risk factors who are older than 50 years of age should be observed if it can be assured that cranial nerve palsy is isolated and imaged only if their motility deficit does not improve after 2-3 months. Patients without microvascular risk factors and all patients under 50 years of age with the 6th nerve palsy should have an MRI with contrast and steady-state imaging acquisition performed in order to rule out demyelinating or compressive etiology anywhere along the course of the nerve.
