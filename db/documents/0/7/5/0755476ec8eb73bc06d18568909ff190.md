**Macroscopic Findings**

Grossly, Warthin tumor is a well-circumscribed spherical to oval mass. On cut section, there are solid areas and multiple cysts with papillary projections. The cystic spaces often contain mucoid creamy brown or white fluid.

**Cytology**

Smears characteristically show oncocytic epithelial cells without atypia admixed with polymorphous lymphocytes and cellular debris. Mucinous differentiation and squamous cells with mixed inflammation and cytological are rarely encountered.

**Microscopic Findings**

Warthin tumors are composed of varying proportions of papillary- cystic structures lined by oncocytic epithelial cells and a lymphoid stroma with germinal centers. The epithelial component is formed of inner columnar and outer cuboidal cells. Some foci of mucous, ciliated, sebaceous, and squamous cells can be present in Warthin tumors. A granulomatous reaction can be seen in some cases.

The diagnosis of malignant transformation of Warthin tumor to carcinoma relies on :

- The presence of a Warthin tumor;

- The presence of transitional zones from a benign oncocytic to a malignant epithelium;

- The presence of an infiltrating growth in the surrounding lymphoid tissue;

- and the exclusion of metastasis to lymphoid stroma from another primary carcinoma.

**Immunohistochemical study**

- The epithelial component is immunoreactive for cytokeratin cocktail.

- The lymphoid portion shows kappa and lambda light-chain polyclonality
