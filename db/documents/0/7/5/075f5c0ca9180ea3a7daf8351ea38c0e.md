**Common History and Physical Findings**

- **Pain**is the most common presenting symptom secondary to mechanical insufficiency resulting from bone destruction.

- **Swelling and deformity**are associated with more extensive lesions.

- **A soft tissue mass or bump**can occasionally be seen and results from cortical destruction and tumor progression outside the bone. It is often found close to the joint. Thus, a limited range of motion at the joint area is common.

- **Joint effusion and synovitis**are also possible. At the time of diagnosis, approximately 12% of patients present with pathological fractures.

- **The typical epiphyseal location**is found in 90% of the tumors. The tumor often extends to the articular subchondral bone or even abuts the cartilage. It rarely invades the joint and or its capsule. In those rare instances in which GCT occurs in a skeletally immature patient, the lesion is likely to be found in the metaphysis.

- **The most common locations**for the tumor in descending order are the distal femur, the proximal tibia, the distal radius, and the sacrum.

- **Multicentricity**or the simultaneous occurrence of GCT in different sites occurs but is exceedingly rare.
