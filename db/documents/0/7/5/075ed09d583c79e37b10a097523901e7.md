Anal cancer is a rare tumor comprising only 2.5% of all digestive system malignancies in the United States. Per data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER), the incidence of new cases in the United States was 8200, with 1100 estimated deaths in 2017. The five-year overall survival between 2007 and 2013 was 66.9%. Also, approximately 0.2% of men and women will be diagnosed with anal cancer at some pointÂ during their lifetime based on acquired data from 2012 through 2014. The men-to-woman ratio is approximately 2 to 3.5. Anal cancer is more prevalent in patients with viral genital infections such as HPV and HIV. Also, there is an increased incidence in individuals with multiple sexual partners, those who practice anal-receptive intercourse, have condyloma infections, or have AIDS.
