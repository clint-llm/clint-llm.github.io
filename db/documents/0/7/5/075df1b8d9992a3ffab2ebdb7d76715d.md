Intracardiac shunts are abnormal pathways for blood flow in the heart that form either in addition to or in place of normal pathways for blood flow. They are congenital heart defects resulting from abnormal embryologic development. The resultant blood flow is pathological and often causes significant changes in normal physiology. Intracardiac shunts are a spectrum of disorders that could range in presentation from being asymptomatic to fatal. The two big categories of intracardiac shunts are cyanotic and acyanotic. Cyanotic shunts impair oxygenation of blood by the pulmonary system and result in cyanosis. Acyanotic shunts do not impair blood flow to the lungs, and the process of oxygenation is intact. Following are different types of acyanotic and cyanotic shunts.

- **Acynotic shunts:**Atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductal arteriosus

- **Cyanotic shunts:**Tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus, total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR), pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect, tricuspid atresia, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, transposition of great arteries, double-outlet right ventricle

The prevalence of different types of these shunts is shown in the pie chart.
