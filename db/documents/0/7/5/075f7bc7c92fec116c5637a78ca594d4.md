A thorough wound assessment must be carried out before applyingÂ negative pressure wound therapy to ensure no harm to the patient is incurred. For instance, any exposed vasculature or organ surfaces should immediately preclude the use of NPWT due to the serious risk of exsanguination secondary to erosive forces. Non-enteric and unexplored fistulae are also contraindicated due to a similar mechanism of excessive fluid extraction which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

Any necrotic tissue or eschar present in the wound bed, such as in full-thickness burns, can exacerbate non-healing and risk the further spread of necrosis. If either of these issues is identified, the wound requires further intervention or an alternative dressing should be considered.

The presence of underlying malignancy also contraindicates the use of NPWT due to the hypothetical possibility of tumor propagation and metastasis.
