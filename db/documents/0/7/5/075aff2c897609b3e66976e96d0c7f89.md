Children achieve stable fusion with halo immobilization. However, patients over 50 years of age have 21 times high risk of nonunion with halo immobilization.

The fusion rate is 88% when the surgery is performed within six months of allowing a fusion rate of 88%, but it drops to 25% when surgery is performed more than 18 months after injury.

Displaced distal fracture segment or facetal malalignment causing cervicomedullary compression and irreducible despite traction previously required transoral resection preceding posterior fusion. Anterior extrapharyangeal open reduction and internal fixation have now been introduced to manage the same.
