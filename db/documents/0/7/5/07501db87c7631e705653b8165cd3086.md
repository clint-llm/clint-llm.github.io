Autoimmune retinopathy accounted for less than 1% of all the cases seen at a tertiary eye center.

CAR is more common in females as compared to males. Misiuk-Hojlo et al. noted that sera of 6 patients of the 295 breast cancer patients had immunoreactivity to retinal antigens though only 2 cases showed ocular features of CAR. The mean age of onset of CAR ranges from 55 to 65 years.

In a case series of 209 patients, Adamus showed that the mean age of CAR was between 40- 85 years. Adamus also reported that CAR was mainly associated with malignancy of the breast (31%), followed by lung (16%) and hematological malignancies (15%). Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 29,000 diagnosed cases in the United States annually.

The time interval between the onset of retinopathy and the cancer diagnosis can vary from weeks to months (lymphoma and lung cancer) to even years (breast and prostate cancer).
