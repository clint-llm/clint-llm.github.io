For mild hypercalcemia, the only intervention needed is to withdraw the offending agent, which in most situations is calcium carbonate. As the source is removed, hypercalcemia and alkalosis are rapidly corrected in milk-alkali syndrome. Severe hypercalcemia is managed in the hospital setting. Patients are admitted, and the calcium supplement is discontinued. Intravenous fluids such as normal saline are started to correct hypovolemia.

Loop diuretics, like furosemide, can increase urinary calcium excretion. In severe cases of hypercalcemia, they can be started after the intravenous saline infusion is begun and should be continued with caution, as hypovolemia can worsen the hypercalcemia. Some patients develop mild hypocalcemia with a rebound rise in parathyroid hormone levels with loop diuretic treatment.
