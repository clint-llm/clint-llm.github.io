As Mavacamten is metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzymes, the concomitant use of moderate-to-strong CYP2C19/CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., verapamil and ketoconazole), or moderate-to-strong CYP2C19/CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin), is associated with higher risk for systolic dysfunction, heart failure exacerbation or loss of medication effectiveness.

Initiation of mavacamten is not recommended in patients with LVEF less than 55 %, given the risk of worsening systolic function. Mavacamten use is not recommended for patients taking disopyramide, ranolazine, and concomitant use of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker with a beta-blocker, as interactions with these medications, have not been studied, and the potential of additive negative inotropic effect.

The use of mavacamten in pregnant patients is not recommended as animal studies have shown fetal toxicity. Therefore, effective contraception prior to treatment initiation is necessary. Mavacamten might reduce the effectiveness of combined hormonal contraceptives. Utilization of contraception methods not affected by enzymes part of the CYP450 family is recommended. Contraception should continue for at least four months following discontinuation of mavacamten.
