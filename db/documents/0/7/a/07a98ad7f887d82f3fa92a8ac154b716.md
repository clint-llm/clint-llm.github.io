Complications that can occur after ptosis repair can subdivide into:

- Early complications: Postoperative asymmetry in eyelid height and shape is the most common complication.

- Late complications: Persistent lagophthalmos, exposure keratopathy, and recurrent ptosis are chronic complications of ptosis repair surgery. Persistent under correction or overcorrection require revision surgery.
