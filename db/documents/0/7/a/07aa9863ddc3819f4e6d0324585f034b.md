Disorders of calcium metabolism are frequently encountered. Though hypocalcemia is not encountered as frequently as hypercalcemia, it can be life-threatening if not appropriately recognized and promptly treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hypocalcemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in educating patients with this condition about follow-up care.

**Objectives:**
- Examine the differential diagnosis of hypocalcemia.
- Analyze the risk factors of developing hypocalcemia.
- Review the pathophysiology of hypocalcemia.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with hypocalcemia.
