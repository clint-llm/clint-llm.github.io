Some toxic multinodular goiters do not need treatment if they are not causing any symptoms or if the degree of hyperthyroidism is at the subclinical level (normal T4, T3, and low TSH). Symptomatic multinodular goiters need surgical resection or radioactive ablation. Disease recurrence is very low after surgery. Overall, Plummer disease has a good prognosis.
