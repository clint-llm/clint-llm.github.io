Oncologic considerations such as stage and BRCA mutation status play a key role in breast reconstruction. Patients requiring adjuvant radiation are often best served with autologous tissue reconstruction.  The lower abdomen skin and fat was discovered to be an ideal material for breast reconstruction. The DIEP  flap has also been used with excellent results for esthetic autogenous breast augmentation. In many clinical institutions, DIEP and SIEA (superficial inferior epigastric artery perforator) flaps have completely replaced the use of the free TRAM (transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous) flap and constitute the first choice for autologous breast reconstruction. DIEP flap reconstruction may also be used for women with congenital or lumpectomy breast defects.

The DIEP flap can be useful in the reconstruction of the head and neck, in particular in resections leaving a large defect such as in total glossectomy.

Other indications of the flap have been described for facial dysmorphisms such as Romberg's disease. Finally, by dissecting the deep inferior epigastric vessels to their origin, a pedicled DIEP flap will easily cover the perineum, the greater trochanter, the sacrum, and even the middle third of the thigh.

IGAP and SGAP flaps are used when abdominal tissue is unavailable.

The Profunda artery perforator flap is ideal****for patients with a small to medium breast size and excess tissue in the posterior thigh.
