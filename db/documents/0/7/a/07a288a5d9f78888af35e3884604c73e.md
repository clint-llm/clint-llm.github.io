Patients with a myocardial infarction are ideally managed by an interprofessional team that includes cardiology nurses. When papillary muscle rupture is diagnosed, the patient must be prepared for immediate surgery. The only difficulty is the decision to perform a cardiac catheterization in an unstable patient. Some surgeons take the patient to the operating room without a cardiac catheterization assuming that the RCA/PDA is already involved. Because of the extremely high mortality following papillary muscle rupture, the focus today is on the prevention of coronary artery disease. The cardiology nurse, pharmacist, and primary clinicians should educate the patients on the following:

- Participate in regular exercise

- Eat a healthy diet

- Remain in compliance with medications

- Abstain from alcohol

- Discontinue smoking

- Take statins as prescribed

- Maintain a healthy body weight

- Monitor and maintain normal blood pressure and blood glucose

Patients with risks for coronary artery disease must be closely followed and referred to a cardiologist for definitive care. Close communication between the team members is vital if one wants to improve outcomes. The outcomes for these patients are guarded. Without surgery, the disorder is fatal; even with surgery, recovery is slow.
