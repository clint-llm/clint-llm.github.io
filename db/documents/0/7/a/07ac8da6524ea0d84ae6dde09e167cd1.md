Pregnancy is a physiological state where uterine smooth muscles and blood vessel proliferate continuously. In pregnancy, there is a considerable decrease in uterine vascular and muscular tone and a rise in uterine blood flow. The increased amount of steroid hormones during pregnancy, such as estrogen, progesterone, and cortisol, all affect uterine vasculature and musculature. Estrogen is a major factor in the increased size of the uterus and thickening of the uterine wall.

The myometrium, the middle layer of the uterine wall, mainly consists of smooth muscle cells. The myometrium greatly enlarges during pregnancy. There is a lack of uterine contractions during the normal gestational period. The prevention of contraction is done through progesterone inhibition of myocytes. During pregnancy, the myocytes go under continuous stretching, hypertrophy, and remodeling. These physiological changes are necessary for a successful pregnancy. During early pregnancy, extravillous cytotrophoblasts invade the decidualized endometrium and myometrium. The spiral arteries transform into large vessels of low resistance that occur with a gradual loss of the normal musculo-elastic structure of the arterial wall. In preeclampsia or fetal growth retardation, the trophoblastic invasion and spiral artery dysfunction deters normal physiological changes.

During pregnancy, a uterine artery Doppler study may be used to scan uterine artery flow. This study shows the amount of uterine artery obstruction. In the cases of fetal growth retardation, diabetes, hypertensive disorders and preeclampsia, there is dysfunction of blood flow to the placenta and fetus. Uterine artery color imaging and pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound studies may be helpful to evaluate the uterine artery flow, mean arterial pressure, and uterine artery resistance index. Pregnant patients who have increased mean arterial pressure but a normal uterine artery resistance index may expect a favorable pregnancy outcome. Those with increased mean arterial pressure with an abnormal uterine artery resistance index may have an unfavorable outcome.

Increased uteroplacental blood flow is necessary for a normal outcome of pregnancy. This is accomplished through systematic growth and remodeling of the uterine circulation and formation of the placenta. During pregnancy, the diameter of the main uterine artery approximately doubles in size. There is no thickening of arterial wall during the enlargement of arterial diameter.

In postmenopausal women, calcifications may be found in the wall of arcuate arteries. These calcified patches are echogenic and appear as linear echoes with shadowing. This is a normal aging process which may be increased in diabetic patients. These calcified lesions are distinctive from calcified fibroids.
