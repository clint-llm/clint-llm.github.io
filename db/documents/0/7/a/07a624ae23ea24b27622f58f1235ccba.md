Hypothermia is defined as an involuntary drop in body temperature below 35C.  Symptoms will vary based on the severity of hypothermia.  Hypothermia can be further defined based on core temperature as mild (32-35C), moderate (28-32C), severe (<28C), with some experts also categorizing certain individuals with profound (<24C) hypothermia.  More severe symptoms and morbidity/mortality are associated with worsening degrees of hypothermia.  Primary hypothermia occurs when a person is unable to maintain adequate heat production due to overwhelimg cold stress.  Death from exposure and accidental hypothermia is not limited to regions/times of severe cold and can occur in milder climates/temperatures even occurring during summer months.
