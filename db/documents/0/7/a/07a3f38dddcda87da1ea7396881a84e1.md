Cutaneous LP often clears spontaneously within 1 to 2 years, but residual hyperpigmentation is very common. Oral LP may clear spontaneously within 5 years, but typically it is a chronic disease with a remitting and relapsing course. Hair loss from LPP is permanent. Drug-induced LP lesions clear slowly after the causative medication is withdrawn.
