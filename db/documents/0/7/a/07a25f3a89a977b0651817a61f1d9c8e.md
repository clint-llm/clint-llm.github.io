Blood pressure, uric acid, jugular venous pressure, blood glucose, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen/serum creatinine, and urine output must be monitored in patients taking bumetanide. Bumetanide is a potent diuretic; it can precipitate electrolyte and acid-base imbalances such as hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, metabolic alkalosis. It is essential to monitor urine output and serum electrolyte levels frequently. Dosage adjustments may be necessary, especially in patients treated for prolonged periods or with high doses; it is crucial that patients are monitored for hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and volume depletion resulting from excessive diuresis. Caution is also necessary for geriatric patients who have greater sensitivity to the hypotensive and diuretic effects of bumetanide.

The development of oliguria during therapy for patients with progressive renal disease is a sign to discontinue treatment with bumetanide. Blood and/or urine glucose levels should be monitored closely in diabetes mellitus patients taking bumetanide because loop diuretics can impair glucose tolerance leading to hyperglycemia. Signs and symptoms of hearing impairment and tinnitus require attention from the clinician as bumetanide may cause ototoxicity, with the dose adjusted accordingly. The cardiac function also requires monitoring as it may worsen heart failure and ventricular arrhythmias in patients with preexisting conditions.
