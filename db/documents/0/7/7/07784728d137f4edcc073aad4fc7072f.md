In general, flap surgery requires an operative team comfortable with microsurgical skills, especially when planning free muscle or myocutaneous flaps. High-volume flap centers with experienced operating room personnel may minimize issues in the perioperative period. Also, anesthesia providers should be comfortable with several facets of flap surgery, including the need for prolonged paralysis, heparin infusions, and maintaining normotension without vasopressors. In the perioperative period, nurses and support staff are essential to perform frequent flap checks and monitor for vital sign abnormalities.
