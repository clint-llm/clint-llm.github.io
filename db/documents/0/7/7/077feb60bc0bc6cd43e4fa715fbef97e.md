Vaso-occlusive crisis presents with severe pain with a relative paucity of objective clinical signs. Differential diagnosis should include conditions specific to the site of the pain and not be blindly attributed to sickle cell disease. As an example, patients presenting with an abdominal painful crisis can mimic acute abdomen and the differential should include conditions that give acute abdominal pain such as, Acute Appendicitis, acute Pancreatitis, acute pyelonephritis, Pelvic inflammatory disease, and hepatobiliary disease. Avascular necrosis and acute osteomyelitis are a consideration when there is persistent local bone pain.
