Like other qualitative olfactory disorders, phantosmia is associated with a deterioration of olfactory impairment over time.

Although many treatments for phantosmia have been proposed, most treatments have variable effectiveness, with limited evidence of improved outcomes. Traditionally the etiology of phantosmia was thought to be the main determinant of prognosis, where certain etiologies (e.g., traumatic injury) were associated with a worse prognosis than others (e.g., upper respiratory infection). This association, however, is becoming less clear.

Improved prognosis is increasingly believed to be associated with sex, smoking status, and disease severity - with young, non-smoking individuals with severe disease carrying improved prognosis.

As described previously, theÂ sine qua non of phantosmia management addresses the underlying cause, after which resolution of olfactory impairments is often achieved.
