- Known hypersensitivity to zolmitriptan (increased risk of angioedema and anaphylaxis)

- Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease patients because 5-HT 1B receptors are present in coronary arteries. Such conditions include myocardial infarction, prinzmetal angina, stroke, TIA(transient ischemic attack), and peripheral vascular disease.

- Coronary artery disease (history of myocardial infarction, Prinzmetal angina, angina pectoris)

- Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW) or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders

- Ischemic bowel disease

- Uncontrolled hypertension

- Hemiplegic or basilar migraine since these patients are at a higher risk of stroke.
