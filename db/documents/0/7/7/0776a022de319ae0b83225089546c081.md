There is someÂ potential for drug-induced injury to the body that requires monitoring when administering abacavir to patients with HIV. Patients should receive screening for HLA-B*57101 genotype status before starting therapy and before continuing treatment in patients with unknown HLA-B*57101 status. Patients should have CBC with differential, serum creatinine kinase, CD4 count, HIV RNA plasma concentrations, triglycerides, and serum amylases monitored periodically.
