**Laboratory Examination**

The following are the diabetic markers crucial for all the patients getting screened for diabetic retinopathy:

- Fasting blood Glucose- The fasting blood glucose level of less than 110 mg/dl is normal. A fasting blood sugar (FBS) level of 110 to 125 mg/dl is prediabetes. In at least two samples, FBS of more than 126 mg/dl denotes diabetes.

- HbA1C (glycosylated hemoglobin)- The normal range of HbA1c is between 4% to 5.6%. HbA1c level should be kept below 7%.

Diabetes affects almost all the major organs of the body. Hence a thorough systemic examination should be done to rule out diabetic complications. Especially kidney function test, cardiac function test, liver function test, thyroid markers, blood pressure, and a neurological examination should be carried out. For this, interprofessional collaboration is required.

**Ocular Examination**

On presentation, the patient should be thoroughly tested for:

- Visual acuity,

- IOP (intraocular pressure) measurement,

- Gonioscopy (for neovascularization of iris/angles),

- Slit-lamp examination (to rule out other ocular manifestations of diabetes mellitus), and

- Dilated fundus examination with +78 or +90 D lens on slit lamp and with +20 or +28 D lens with an indirect ophthalmoscope - the grading of diabetic retinopathy should be done

Additional posterior segment investigations for the evaluation of diabetic retinopathy include:

**Fundus Photography**

Color fundus photographs are taken in the instances listed below.

- Documentation and record purposes

- Patient education with counseling

The standard seven fields of modified Airlie House classification should be taken (Figure).

**Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA)**

FFA is indicated in the following situations.

- For the diagnosis of ischemic maculopathy

- To locate capillary dropout areas

- To differentiate IRMA from neovascularization

- To differentiate disc collaterals from disc neovascularization

- To reveal occult new vessels that could not be detected on clinical examination

- To find out the cause of unexplained visual loss

- To differentiate pseudophakic cystoid macular edema and diabetic macular edema

**Ultrawide Field Fundus Imaging (UWFI) and Fundus Fluorescein Angiogram (UWFA)**

UWFI and UWFA document the changes in the posterior segment in a single frame. Commercially available UWFI (at least a 100-degree field of view) includes Optos/California, Mirante, Clarus, Retcam, and Spectralis. UWFI using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope and ellipsoid mirror, captures images in small pupils and hazy media.

**Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)**

OCT of the macula helps

- To evaluate retinal thickening

- For the assessment and monitoring of edema after initiation of treatment, especially to plan for the next sitting of intravitreal injections

- To diagnose vitreomacular traction (VMT) and the epiretinal membrane (ERM), which might require surgery (pars plans vitrectomy)

**Ultrasonography (B Scan)**

It is a very useful tool in hazy media to evaluate

- Vitreous hemorrhage

- Tractional retinal detachment

- Subhyaloid hemorrhage

- Posterior vitreous detachment

**Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA)**

OCTA employs motion contrast imaging to retinal blood flow, generating images similar to fluorescein angiography without the need to inject the dye invasively.

- It provides detailed information on the retinal vasculature

- It is helpful for the demarcation of the foveal avascular zone, helping to find out foveal ischemia

- It enables accurate detection of even mild IRMA

- It helps to delineate capillary dropout areas

Vascular signs like looping, beading, and dilatation can very well be appreciated on OCTA. OCTA may help the earliest detection of microvascular changes (before the visibility of microaneurysm).

**Artificial Intelligence-based Devices**

FDA has approved a software program IDx-DR for the detection of 'more than mild diabetic retinopathy' or its absence in 2018. In 2020, EyeArt (Eyenuk) received FDA clearance for the autonomous detection of 'more than mild diabetic retinopathy and vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy.'
