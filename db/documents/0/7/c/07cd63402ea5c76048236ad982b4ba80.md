While tarantulas are native to many areas of the world, their popularity as a pet leads to the majority of human exposures. Due to the conspicuous nature of the organism, patients will often report a history of known tarantula exposure, either by bite or exposure to the hairs.Â In the case of bite envenomation, patients will often complain of local symptoms, including pruritus, swelling, and mild to severe pain, lasting for several hours. Sometimes bites can be painless, and sometimes symptoms can be delayed over hours to days. Local tissue reaction may be seen, and depending on the species, local tissue necrosis may develop over hours to days.

In the case of exposure to urticating hairs, the patient will often experience moderate-severe pain, pruritus, and erythema, which can last weeks. However, specific symptoms will depend on the site of exposure. Local symptoms previously mentioned are often associated with cutaneous involvement. If inhaled, rhinitis, cough, dyspnea, and wheezing can occur. Lastly, if there is ocular involvement, patients will often present with a painful, red, conjunctival injection due to corneal or scleral irritation, a reaction termed as ophthalmia nodosa. Later in the disease course, a granulomatous ocular disease may result.

Although rare, patients may present with anaphylaxis to either the bite or hair exposure.
