The prevalence of congenital heart disease and ASDs has increased over the past 50 years.  In the 1930s congenital heart disease was diagnosed in less than 1 per 1000 live births.  In recent years, congenital heart disease is diagnosed in 9 per 1000 live births. Atrial septal defects were identified between 1945 and 1949 in less than 0.5 live births per 1000.  More recent epidemiologic data suggest that ASDs occur in 1.6 per 1000 live births.
