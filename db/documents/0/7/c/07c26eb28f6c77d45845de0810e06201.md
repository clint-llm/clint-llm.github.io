Performance of the saphenous nerve block requires interprofessional collaboration between the proceduralist, nursing staff, and clinical pharmacist. The patient should be on continuous hemodynamic monitoring and emergency airway equipment, supplemental oxygen, and resuscitation drugs (including lipid emulsion) kept immediately available. All team members should know the early symptoms of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (i.e., tinnitus, circumoral numbness, and metallic taste) and awake patients advised to report them. Early recognition and treatment are vital to avoid more severe complications including seizures and cardiovascular collapse. Providers should calculate the maximum weight-based dose of local before the start of the procedure and should use the lowest effective dosing to minimize the risk of systemic toxicity; this should include the clinician pharmacist in a collaborative effort. Nursing will assist in the procedure and provide patient monitoring, informing the clinician of any concerns that may arise. With an interprofessional approach to a saphenous nerve block, outcomes will be optimized.
