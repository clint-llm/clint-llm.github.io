Malocclusion can be diagnosed through a visual examination and a radiographic examination of the teeth and face. If a malocclusion occurs, the patient is often referred to an orthodontist. Routine dental appointments can allow for an early diagnosis of malocclusion, which will allow for early treatment. Malocclusion is often hereditary, so it is hard to prevent it. However, parents can prevent environmental factors that can cause malocclusion early on. Such include limiting thumb sucking and stopping bottle and pacifier usage early on.
