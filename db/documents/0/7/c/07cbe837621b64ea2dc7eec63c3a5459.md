As mentioned before, Tolosa Hunt syndrome is caused by non-specific inflammation of unknown etiology. In his initial report, Dr. Eduardo Tolosa described the pathophysiology as "non-specific, chronic inflammation of the septa and wall of the cavernous sinus with the proliferation of fibroblasts an infiltration with lymphocytes and plasma cells."

The inflammation in the cavernous sinus region has seen a rare association with intracranial inflammation, but systemic inflammation is not yet reported.
