The diagnosis and management of cyanotic heart disease is with an interprofessional team consisting of a neonatologist, pediatrician, cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, intensivist and NICU nurses. The treatment depends on the type of heart defect. While some infants may have an isolated heart defect, others may have many other systemic anomalies that also need assessment. Thus, it is important to have the pediatrician and a geneticist involved in the care of these infants.
