The prevalence of oppositional defiant disorderÂ varies greatly, with an estimated range of 2% to 11%.

ODD is more common in preadolescent males than in females (1.4:1); however, this male predominance is not found in adolescents or adults. Symptoms remain relatively stable between the ages of five and ten and are thought to decline afterward. The prevalence declines with increasing age.
