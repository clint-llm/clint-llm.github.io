Chen et al. reported gradual symptomatic improvement of COVID-19 conjunctivitis in one patient with administration of ribavirin eye drops.

As with other viral infections, COVID-19 conjunctivitis is presumed to be self-limited and can be managed with symptomatic care. In the absence of significant eye pain, decreased vision, or light sensitivity, many patients can be managed remotely with a trial of frequent preservative-free artificial tears, cold compresses, and lubricating ophthalmic ointment. A short course of topical antibiotics can prevent or treat bacterial superinfection based on the patient's symptoms and risk factors (e.g. contact lens wear).

On March 18, 2020, the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) urged all ophthalmologists to provide only urgent or emergent care to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and to conserve disposable medical supplies. Specific criteria are presented below. In the summer of 2020, many centers had begun to resume elective surgeries and consider expanding care on a case-by-case basis based on reopening guidelines from the federal government.

Although preliminary studies suggest that the risk of viral transmission through ocular secretions is low, large-scale research has not yet been done, and new data is emerging daily. Therefore, healthcare providers are still urged to wear proper protection of the eyes, nose, and mouth when examining patients (see below). Eye care providers and technicians may be more susceptible to infection due to the nature and proximity of the ophthalmic examination.

**Stratification of Ophthalmic Patients for Clinic Visits from early 2020 to December 2020**

In the presence of life-threatening infections such as this, ophthalmologists have to achieve a balance between providing ophthalmic care and infection control. Most ophthalmic conditions are not life-threatening. Furthermore, many can be managed with some delay in treatment as they progress relatively slowly (cataracts, glaucoma, ptosis, etc.). However, some conditions like retinal detachments, acute infections (cellulitis, orbital cellulitis), severe inflammation (uveitis), and trauma require more urgent attention. To that end, the following is suggested for the management of ophthalmic patients:

1. All routine ophthalmic patients are delayed until the severity of disease spread reduces as determined by the WHO and the local Chief Medical Officer. These include chronic conditions and routine clinic annual and other follow-ups as well as new patients with chronic conditions like cataracts, ptosis, etc.

2. New patient referrals are reviewed by the consultant surgeon to determine urgency. If necessary, telephone interviews with the referring doctor and/or the patient are held.

3. All patients considered for a clinic visit are reviewed for three things:

- Presence of fever, cough, or shortness of breath

- Any foreign travel or travel to an area with a high infection rate within the prior 14 days

- Any contact with patients who have been diagnosed as having COVID-19

The presence of any of these would be a reason to consider the necessity of seeing and examining the patient more closely. If a patient has two of the three are referred for medical assessment. If a patient with COVID-19 or one with a fever, cough, or shortness of breath needs to be examined, the patient is seen in a separate isolation room. Ideally, only one person (physician, technician, etc.) should be present in the room (as ophthalmic rooms tend to be small) and should wear the full personal protective equipment (PPE): gown, N95 mask, face shield, and gloves. Hands are washed before and after examination for a minimum of 20 seconds with soap and water. Once the ophthalmic examination is completed, the patient is referred for further assessment by the medical team.

**Protection of Medical Workers**

Although the 2003 SARS-CoV crisis did not create quite so severe a spread of infection in the United States, it was noted that health care workers (HCW) accounted for about 20% of all patients with infections.

It is, therefore, vital that front-line medical workers wear proper protection. Secondly, it is important to monitor these health care workers for disease and implement appropriate containment measures.

A significant number of deaths in the United States were associated with an initial severe shortage of appropriate personal protective equipment for healthcare providers. Even with the availability of appropriate protective equipment, it behooves us to choose the level of protective gear based upon the risk of infection. The following is suggested:

- Keep the waiting room as empty as possible with available seating spaced at least 6 feet apart.

- For all patients who have none of the three criteria mentioned above, the medical workers will wear a surgical mask, a face shield, and gloves. Hands are washed before and after every encounter.

- If a patient is positive for any of the three criteria, the full PPE of gown, face shield, gloves, and the N95 mask are worn.

- It has been noted that droplets from sneezes can travel up to 6 meters.

- Conversations are kept to a minimum during the consultation. Ophthalmologists are, by nature, a gregarious lot. Such temptations are to be resisted.

- As a shortage of surgical masks has become a reality, some institutions are storing used masks at the end of each day in a container with a view to re-sterilization if necessary.

- As many as a quarter of patients being injected under sedation may develop a severe involuntary sneeze.

**Surveillance of Medical Workers**

- In Singapore, health workers reported their temperatures twice a day via an online system: this was eminently sensible as the "walk-by" temperature-testing that was practiced may not be as accurate or complete with staff arriving early, leaving late, etc.

- All travel outside the state or country should be declared to the medical administration for review. This should still apply in April 2021 as there are recurring hot spots of infection in different states and countries.

- All health workers should self-report any symptoms, so appropriate testing may be performed: isolation and contact-tracing would then be undertaken as deemed necessary.

**Sterilization of Equipment**

- The slit-lamp shields are disinfected with 70% ethyl alcohol after each patient; 70% ethyl alcohol has been shown to reduce coronavirus infectivity.

- Slitlamps, B-scan probes, and any other tools are similarly cleaned with 70% ethyl alcohol.

- Goldman tonometers are sterilized with a 10% diluted sodium hypochlorite solution, which inactivates coronaviruses.
