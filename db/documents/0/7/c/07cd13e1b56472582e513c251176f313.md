If left untreated, microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) can result in permanent damage to the organs. Kidney failure is the most common complication. MPA complications will depend on the particular organ system involved. Research has shown that older age, diastolic hypertension, and positive PR3-ANCA status correlate with cardiovascular events.

The medications that treat MPA can also carry adverse complications. For example, cyclophosphamide has a relatively strong correlation with bladder cancer in those treated with the drug. In addition, steroids are known to cause bone loss, hyperglycemia, muscle weakness, and skin problems.
