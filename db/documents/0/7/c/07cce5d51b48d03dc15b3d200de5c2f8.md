Corneal opacities are one of the leading causes of worldwide blindness along with cataracts, glaucoma, and macular degeneration. Access to corneal transplantation is variable around the world and is limited by a lack of infrastructure as well as donor tissue supply.

The increasing number of newer artificial corneal keratoprostheses require adequate study and evaluation. Recent guidelines on consensus with reporting standards amongst all the groups researching artificial cornea devices have been created and will result in better data collection and comparative analysis.
