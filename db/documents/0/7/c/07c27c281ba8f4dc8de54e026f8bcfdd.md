The practical application of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate is most efficient with an interprofessional approach among the healthcare team, especially in pediatrics. Assistance in irrigating, applying, and securing the patient, if needed, is best shared among nursing, physicians, and patient care technicians. This wound care process is where specialized wound-care nurses can play a significant role in ensuring proper care of the wound, as well as training other ancillary personnel and providing patient education on follow-up wound care.  They are also in a position to recognize any issues or concerns that may arise and report these promptly to the physician managing the case. This type of interprofessional coordination between clinicians (MDs, DOs, PAs, NPs), nurses, and other ancillary staff on the healthcare team is essential when using 2-octyl cyanoacrylate successfully, leading to improved patient care and outcomes.
