The annual incidence of early inflammatory arthritis ranges from 115 to 271 per 100,000 adults, and the incidence of undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis (UA) ranges from 41 to 149 per 100,000 adults. Out of which, 13% to 54% of patients with undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis will develop rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and in 21% to 87%, undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis will persistÂ as such. A specific diagnosis can be made at the presentation in about 70% of such patients, the most common being rheumatoid arthritis.
