Near the end of the eight weeks in utero, the palate begins its development. Each maxillary process generates a lateral palatine process within the mouth. These processes are horizontal and shelf-like, growing from the lateral aspect of the mouth toward the midline and downward. Between the tenth and the eleventh week in utero, the lateral palatine processes meet and fuse with each side and the much smaller premaxillary process and the nasal septum. Palatal fusions are normally completed by the end of the fourth month of gestation. In this stage, there is a theory that states that epithelium entrapped between the palatal shelves and the nasal process formed cysts called Epstein pearls.

Another theory expressed that these cysts may come from epithelial remnants that have arisen from the formation of the minor salivary glands of the palate.

Remnants of the dental lamina are believed to remain within the mucosa of the alveolar ridge after tooth development; then they proliferate to form keratinized cysts.
