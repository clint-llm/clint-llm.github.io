Most patients with adrenal metastases are asymptomatic. Patients may have localized symptoms like back or abdominal pain due to tumor mass effect if the tumor is large or rapidly growing. This could indicate local invasion or retroperitoneal hemorrhage.

Adrenal metastases do not usually result in adrenal insufficiency unless a significant portion of the bilateral adrenals ( more than 90%) are affected. These patients can present with anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, fatigue, lethargy, fever, confusion, electrolyte imbalances secondary to adrenal insufficiency, and can be easily confused with the manifestations of the neoplastic disease. Adrenal crisis due to episodes of symptomatic hemorrhage into adrenal glands which were infiltrated by a metastatic tumor has rarely been noted.
