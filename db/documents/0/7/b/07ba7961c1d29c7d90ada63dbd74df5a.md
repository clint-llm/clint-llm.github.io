Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is an exaggerated defense response of the body to a noxious stressor (infection, trauma, surgery, acute inflammation, ischemia or reperfusion, or malignancy, to name a few) to localize and then eliminate the endogenous or exogenous source of the insult. Dysregulation of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory pathway homeostasis lies at the heart of the clinical scenario with the dysregulated release of acute and chronic phase reactants. This activity reviews the evolution of the definition and the clinical relevance of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. It outlines appropriate evaluation and management strategies for the syndrome and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care and clinical outcomes for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
- Review the significance of current and emerging biomarkers in the diagnosis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
- Summarize the clinical prognosis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure appropriate adherence to treatment guidelines and to enhance the clinical outcome of systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
