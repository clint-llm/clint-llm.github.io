According to the Nation Institute of Health, the prognosis of patients presenting with neurosyphilis is mostly dependent on the type of neurosyphilis and early detection of the disease. Patients who present with asymptomatic or meningeal neurosyphilis generally return to normal health if treated adequately. Patients with meningovascular disease, general paresis, or tabes dorsalis may improve but usually do not return to their health or functional baseline. Furthermore, patients who are treated years after initial infection tend to have more poor prognoses.
