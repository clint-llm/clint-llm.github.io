Transcatheter intervention for right ventricular outflow tract obstruction with balloon angioplasty and stent implantation was a remarkable advancement but still resulted in significant pulmonary regurgitation. Transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation, which is a common intervention in adult patients with congenital heart disease today, provides a much less invasive approach, thus allowing earlier restoration of pulmonary valve function before the onset of irreversible remodeling and dysfunction and potentially fewer lifetime surgical interventions. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of pulmonary regurgitation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for percutaneous transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement.
- Describe the technique of transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement.
- Outline appropriate evaluation of the potential complications of transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance and improve outcomes of transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement.
