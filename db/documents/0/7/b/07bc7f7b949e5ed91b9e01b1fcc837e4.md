Currently, segmental sublobar resection is not considered an adequate resection in patients that can tolerate lobectomy. It has also not been studied in patients with small-cell lung cancer. Other relative contraindications are severe emphysema, interstitial pneumonia, and extensive adhesive burden due to previous surgeries, as these may make the operation technically unfeasible.
