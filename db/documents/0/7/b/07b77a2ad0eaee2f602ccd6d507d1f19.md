**Corneal Abrasions**

The majority of corneal abrasions heal spontaneously, so treatment consists primarily of pain control and preventing infection. For abrasions greater than 2 mm, or for those that are very painful, a cycloplegic agent such as cyclopentolate 1% or homatropine 5% can help control discomfort by relaxing the ciliary body and relieving pain from spasm. The cycloplegia of both these agents lasts approximately 24 hours,Â so a single administration at the time of care should be adequate given the rapidity of corneal healing. Topical anesthetics should never be prescribed for home use as they can inhibit corneal healing, impair the protective blinking reflex, and prolong identification of the progression of the ocular pathology or development of complications.

In cases not related to contact lens wear, erythromycin ophthalmic ointment is a suitable antibiotic, but for contact lens wearers antipseudomonal coverage is needed. A fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin will provide adequate antibiotic prophylaxis. Tetanus prophylaxis should be administered if necessary. Patients should be counseled to not wear contacts until the abrasion has healed completely. Patients with corneal abrasions should be reevaluated within 24 to 48 hours to assure complete resolution of the injury.

**Corneal Foreign Bodies**

Corneal foreign bodies should be removed at the time of diagnosis, preferably under slit lamp magnification, after anesthesia has been achieved with a topical agent such as proparacaine 0.5%. A cotton applicator may occasionally be effective in removing a foreign body but a sterile needle or eye spud may be necessary.

**Corneal Laceration/Perforation**

Unrecognized corneal perforations can quickly result in endophthalmitis or traumatic cataract. These should be treated similarly to scleral (globe) rupture with the placement of a protective eye shield to prevent accidental pressure on the globe and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics to cover common organisms that cause post-traumatic endophthalmitis. A third-generation cephalosporin, gentamycin, and vancomycin would be appropriate.

**Ocular Burns**

Treatment of radiation burns (ultraviolet keratitis) is supportive of pain control and topical antibiotics, although there is minimal evidence for the latter. Oral opioids are typically needed. Generally a self-limiting condition, ophthalmology follow up in 24 hours is needed if symptoms have not resolved. Patients should be counseled on the adverse effects of ultraviolet radiation including cataract formation, pterygium, and skin cancer.

Treatment of ocular chemical burns should begin at the scene of the injury with copious irrigation with water for at least thirty minutes and continue upon arrival to the hospital. The use of irrigation devices, such as a Morgan Lens, is helpful in delivering continuous irrigation to the affected eye. The conjunctival fornices should be checked for any particulate matter, and irrigation should continue until the pH of the conjunctivae is 7 in both eyes. If available, buffered eyewash solutions may be better for the irrigation of caustic exposures than standard normal saline. After irrigation of one to two liters, the pH should be tested with fresh litmus paper. Irrigation should be continued until the pH remains neutral for at least 30 minutes after the last irrigation. Ophthalmology consultation should be obtained for all but minor burns. Any patient with corneal clouding or an epithelial defect should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist. The principles of acute management include removal of inciting chemical agents, promotion of ocular surface epithelial healing (ascorbate, citrate), inflammation control (topical steroids, citrate, and acetylcysteine), and infection prevention (topical antibiotics), pain control (cycloplegia, systemic oral analgesia). A prompt and frequent review is necessary to assess clinical progress and detect complications e.g. raised intraocular pressure.
