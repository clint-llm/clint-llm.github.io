The differential diagnoses of a tumor located in the proximity of tendons and aponeurosis should include paraganglioma-like dermal melanocytic tumor, MM, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, synovial sarcoma, and clear cell myomelanocytic tumor.

Compared to MM, CCSST usually occurs in the younger patient population, is located in deeper tissues, is associated with aponeuroses or tendons, and commonly lacks epidermal involvement.

Synovial sarcoma commonly shows a t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) translocation producing SYT/SSX1 or SYT/sSSX2 gene fusions, not seen in CCSST.

Paraganglioma-like dermal melanocytic tumor primarily presents in the extremities of female patients as a dermal nodule. On microscopy, it shows oval-cells arranged in packet-like groups.

Clear cell myomelanocytic tumor belongs to a family of tumors known as perivascular epithelioid cell family of tumors, which present commonly in the abdomen, usually in the ligamentum teres of the liver of young patients. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor usually arises within large peripheral nerves and is negative for HMB-45.
