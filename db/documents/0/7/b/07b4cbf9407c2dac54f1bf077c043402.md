Atrial tachycardia can manifest itself in patients with both anatomically normal and anatomically abnormal hearts. The structure of the patientâ€™s heart can be responsible for specific variants. In hearts, reentrant variations, typically present in hearts that accommodate the reentrant conduction, such as in the orifices of the vena cava, coronary sinus, and pulmonary veins.

Atrial tachycardia can present secondary to a triggering event or conditions. Hypoxia, catecholamine release, alcohol, drug use, and even exercise can trigger atrial tachycardia. Iatrogenic versions are seen following ablation procedures; most commonly originating from gaps in the ablation lines.
