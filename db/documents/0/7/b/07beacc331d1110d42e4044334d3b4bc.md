Atrial tachycardia is a form of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) usually seen in patients with structural heart abnormalities but also seen in patients with structurally normal hearts. Unlike other SVTs, atrial tachycardia does not depend upon the atrioventricular junction or accessory pathways for its initiation or maintenance. As is typical for most SVTs, atrial tachycardia exhibits a narrow QRS complex. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of atrial tachycardia and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of atrial tachycardia.
- Describe the evaluation of atrial tachycardia.
- Explain how atrial tachycardia is managed.
- Optimize interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by atrial tachycardia.
