CSH is a cause of syncope in the elderly. Physicians must approach syncope wisely. Ruling out life-threatening conditions first is a priority, after that, a monitored carotid massage is allowed (if not contraindicated), management of CSH is directed toward education about the condition and its consequences in the first place not ignoring the patients' activities requiring a full consciousness, treating the symptomatic patient helps continue daily life activities i.e., driving (after a symptom-free period post-management concerning each state's law and the case conditions). The interdisciplinary collaboration between the healthcare team to approach patients presenting with syncope and the highly skilled hands are needed at healthcare facilities to give suitable care because determining the etiology behind syncope helps in decreasing morbidity and mortality rates.
