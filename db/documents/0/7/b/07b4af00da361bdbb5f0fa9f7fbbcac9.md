Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease is a rare cause of group 1 pulmonary hypertension. It is characterized by having significant venous and capillary involvement, as opposed to other causes of group 1 pulmonary hypertension, in which the arteries are primarily involved. This disease has significant mortality, and early recognition remains paramount in its management. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of pulmonary veno occlusive disease (PVOD).
- Discuss the risk factors associated with pulmonary veno occlusive disease.
- Outline the typical imaging findings associated with pulmonary veno occlusive disease.
- Summarize the management of pulmonary veno occlusive disease.
