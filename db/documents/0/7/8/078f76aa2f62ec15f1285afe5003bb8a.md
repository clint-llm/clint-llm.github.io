The stellate ganglion forms as a result of the fusion of the inferior cervical and first thoracic sympathetic ganglions. It is present in up to 80% of the population. The stellate ganglion is an oval-shaped structure located anterior to the neck of the first rib. A thorough review of its relevant neuroanatomy is necessary for the successful and safe performance of a stellate ganglion blockade, which is useful in various clinical scenarios.
