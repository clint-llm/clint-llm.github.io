Because of the complex nature of infantile spasms and the need for prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment, strict interprofessional communication must occur. Care coordination includes coordination between general pediatricians, pediatric neurologists, nurses, pharmacists, and therapists. Emergency medical physicians may also be part of care coordination as they will likely evaluate the patient initially when the parents note spasms. Once the emergency department physician has suspicion for IS, a pediatric neurologist and the patient's general pediatrician should be contacted to evaluate the patient and begin diagnostic measures. They should involve nursing in parent education and coordination of appointments and diagnostic imaging. Once a diagnosis is made, a pharmacist can assist in medicine distribution and dosing, as well as parent education, on medication side effects. The patients should also start the occupational, speech, and physical therapy due to the likelihood of developmental delays and regression. Caring for patients with infantile spasms is complex and requires extensive interprofessional communication to improve patient outcomes.
