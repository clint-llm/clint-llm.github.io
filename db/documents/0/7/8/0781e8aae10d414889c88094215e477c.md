Testicular neoplasms constitute the most common solid organ malignancy in males between the ages of 15 and 35. They represent only 0.5% to 1% of all solid male cancers (or about 10,000 cancer cases yearly) in the US and have an excellent five-year survival rate.

There are three main types of primary testicular neoplasm: germ cell tumors, sex cord-stroma tumors, and extragonadal tumors. The germ cell tumors are classified histologically into two broad classes: seminomas and non-seminomas. Seminomas are the most common of these germ cell tumors. Still, the non-seminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) is found almost as frequently. It is the most likely testicular cancer to cause metastases which typically affect the lungs, liver, central nervous system, and bone in order of frequency.

Roughly one-third of patients with NSGCT will have disseminated or metastatic disease at the time of initial presentation and diagnosis. Non-seminomatous germ cell tumors are further classified into yolk sac tumors, embryonal cell carcinomas, choriocarcinomas, and teratomas. Seminomatous tumors which have syncytiotrophoblast components are also treated as non-seminomatous tumors.

Historically, testicular cancers were responsible for 11% of all deaths from malignancy in men between 25 and 34, with an overall 5-year survival rate of only 64%.
