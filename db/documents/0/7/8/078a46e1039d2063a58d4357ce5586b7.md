Decorticate and decerebrate posturing are abnormal posturing responses typically to noxious stimuli. They involve stereotypical movements of the trunk and extremities. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with these conditions, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the assessment and management of decorticate and decerebrate posturing and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the physical exam findings associated with decorticate and decerebrate posturing.
- Describe the pathophysiology of decorticate and decerebrate posturing.
- Outline the prognosis of patients with decorticate and decerebrate posturing.
- Review the etiology of decorticate and decerebrate posturing.
