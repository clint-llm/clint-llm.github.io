The diagnosis and management of dermatitis artefacta is complex and best done with an interprofessional team that includes the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, psychiatrist and dermatologist. While the skin lesions may need treatment, theÂ underlying mental health disorder must be addressed and treated. The usual drugs include antipsychotics, antidepressants, and sedatives. NSAIDs may be prescribed, but opiate and other prescription analgesics should be avoided for fear of inducing addiction and physical dependence.

The patient's denial of psychological distress and negative feelings aroused in healthcare personnel make management difficult. The doctor should create an accepting, empathic, and non-judgemental attitude and avoid confrontation. Close supervision and good symptomatic care of skin lesions permit the development of a therapeutic relationship in which psychological issues may gradually be introduced, which may occasionally permit a psychiatric referral.

Dermatitis artefacta is a long-term disorder, and patients need regular follow up with a dermatologist and a psychiatrist because relapses are common. Many patients are noncompliant with treatment and often fail to follow up. The prognosis for most patients is poor- leading to self injury, scarring and poor cosmesis.
