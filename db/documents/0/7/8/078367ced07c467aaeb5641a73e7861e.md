The Jodhpur technique not only bridges the tissue and cellular grafting approaches, its overall efficacy outcome in vitiligo [Figure 4], and CNHU's are very encouraging.

The advantages of this approach include:

1) Need for minimum infrastructural and monetary support in terms of laboratory, specialized equipment, special media, etc.

2) A broad spectrum of donor sites that may be available in this technique, compared to the relatively limited options in other skin grafting techniques.

3) A relatively high coverage ratio:****In cases of vitiligo, the Jodhpur technique allows coverage of a recipient area with the harvesting of as low as 20 to 30% of that area from the donor site.

4) An easy learning curve for the dermatologist or dermatology surgeon, and need for minimal personnel for conducting the procedure.

5) High efficacy and minimal complications (such as textural abnormalities, uneven pigment matching, etc., usually encountered with STSG and MPG).
