Cervicitis is primarily a sexually transmitted infection. Therefore, its control requires an interprofessional approach that encompasses preventive medicine at the level of primary care clinicians, as well as effective management of the patients at secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities. TheÂ interprofessional team involves clinicians who diagnose and initiate treatment, nurses who monitor the condition of the patient, and pharmacists who tailor the drugs according to each patient.

In complicated cases (e.g., cervicitis complicated by PID), a gynecologic or surgical consultation may be necessary. Sexually transmitted infection clinics also play a vital role in the identification and management of cervicitis. For improved outcomes and better patient care, effective communication between the members of the team as well as with the outpatient and STI clinics is essential. This would provide the clinicians with an in-depth history of the case and enable them to have a patient-centered approach. [Level 1 and 2]
