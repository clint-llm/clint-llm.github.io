Unfortunately, the histological reports of confirmed pernio are few and far between, making consistent histologic diagnosis challenging and largely nonspecific. However, the most commonly reported findings in pernio include dermal infiltrate with associated edema. Additionally, other findings include spongiosis, deep peri-eccrine inflammation, basal layer vacuolation, and necrotic keratinocytes within the epidermis.
