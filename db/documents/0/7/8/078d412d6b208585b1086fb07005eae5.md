The most critical step for any fine-needle aspiration is the decision of whether or not it will actually change the management of the patient for whom it is being planned. Everyone on the entire interprofessional healthcare team (clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses) should be in agreement that a cytology sample is necessary to determine the appropriate treatment for the patient and that fine-needle aspiration will be sufficient to attain this rather than a more invasive method such as core-needle biopsy or excisional biopsy. When the procedure is being performed, the entire healthcare time should take every precaution necessary to ensure that sterile technique is maintained to minimize the risk of spreading infection.
