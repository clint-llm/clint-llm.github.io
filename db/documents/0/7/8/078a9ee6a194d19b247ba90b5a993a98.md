The primary treatment modalities available for nephrolithiasis are extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL), ureteroscopy (URS), and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). ESWL is the only method that is truly non-invasive and can achieve the stone-free-rates that approach 75%. ESWL is considered as first-line treatment for smaller stones (less than 2 cm size).

For stones that are larger than 2 cm, a more invasive approach (such as PCNL) is better suited. However, more patients are willing to accept multiple treatments with ESWL instead of an invasive procedure. While the single-treatment success rates of ESWL are not equal to those of URS or PCNL, success rates can be maximized with the use of adjunctive treatment before or after ESWL, proper patient selection, and optimization of ESWL technique.
