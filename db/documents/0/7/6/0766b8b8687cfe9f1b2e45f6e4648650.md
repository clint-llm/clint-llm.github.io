Transanal microsurgery is often limited by technical factors, including the location and size of the tumor. Lesions low down in the rectum (<5 cm from the anal verge) may not be easily excised due to being obscured by the transanal port. Tumors occupying >30% of the luminal circumference or >3 cm in size may also be considered contraindications, although this depends on surgeon experience. Nonetheless, if the lesion possesses one of these attributes, excision will be difficult and lead to worse oncological outcomes.
