Opisthotonus is relatively rare. It is a sign that may be present inÂ a wide variety of disorders. It can affect infants (e.g.neonatal tetanus), children, or adults. There is no gender predilection. It is indeed difficult to diagnose in the younger age group. As opisthotonus is not a disorder nor a disease, the incidence and prevalence are not reported.
