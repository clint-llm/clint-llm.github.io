Iodine toxicity most commonly results from over-consumption of dietary supplements. Generally, many grams of iodine must be ingested to cause toxicity. Foods containing iodine include iodized salt ( one gram contains about 77ug of iodine), drinking water, milk, certain seafood, and seaweeds. Some oral medications may also contain iodine, such as amiodarone and potassium supplements. Tincture of iodine and betadine are topical medications used as antiseptics and can cause a rash or blistering when applied topically and will lead to more severe toxicity if accidentally ingested.
