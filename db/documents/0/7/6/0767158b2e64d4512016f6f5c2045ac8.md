Non-diabetic hypoglycemia is relatively uncommon as compared to hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes. A large retrospective review of 38,898 patients admitted to hospitals with non-critical illness showed the estimated frequency of 36 per 10000 admissions.

The incidence of Insulinoma is estimated to be 0.4 per 100,000 person-years with 59% female preponderance and age of 47 years at the surgery.****

Another study noted that less than 1% of the patient after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass might require hospitalization due to hypoglycemia. Furthermore, less than 10% of patients may develop clinically significant hypoglycemia.
