Chromosomal anomalies detected in some types of chondrosarcomas include 9p21, 10, 13q14, and 17p13. Chromosomal structural abnormalities and genetic instability are reported in well-differentiated chondrosarcomas analyzed by cytogenetics. Moreover, the amplification of MYC and AP-1transcription factors plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of chondrosarcoma
