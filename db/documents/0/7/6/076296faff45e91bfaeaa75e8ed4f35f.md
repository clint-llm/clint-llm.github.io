The exact etiology of CLL is unknown. Genetic factors, rather than environmental factors, are the most likely cause of CLL. However, few known risk factors for CLL include occupational causes by exposure to certain chemicals, radiation exposure, and tobacco users.  Reports of farmers working around rubber manufacturing industries and workers with exposure to benzene and heavy solvent have shown an increased risk of CLL/SLL. However, these associations have not yet been proven. In atomic bomb survivors, no known increase in the incidence of CLL/SLL has been noted. However, there has been an increased risk of other types of leukemia. The uranium miner population, who suffer exposure to ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, has shown increased CLL incidence. Tobacco users and cigarette smokers show a significantly elevated risk of CLL compared to non-tobacco users. The Veterans Affairs recognizes CLL as having a relationship to exposure to Agent Orange or other herbicides during military service.
