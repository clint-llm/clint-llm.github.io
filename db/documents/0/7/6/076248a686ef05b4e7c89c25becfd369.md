Clinicians should think of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with a thunderclap headache, especially when there is recurrent thunderclap headache.

RCVS can be seen in the postpartum state, as well as in patients who use vasoactive substances, such as over the counter sympathomimetics, serotonergic medications such as migraine-abortive medications, and SSRIs, and can get triggered by substance use such as the use of THC.

Other potential triggers of RCVS include interferon, diet pills, and NSAIDs, as well as alcohol, amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, and nicotine. There are also reports that blood transfusions, erythropoietin, intravenous immunoglobulin, migraines, certain tumors such as pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, trauma, head and neck surgery, carotid dissection, and other medical conditions such as HELLP syndrome, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) can be potential triggers of RCVS.
