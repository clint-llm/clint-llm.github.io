Contraindications to hysterectomy are any factor that precludes a safe surgical approach or offers no benefit to the patient.Â  For example, traditional abdominal hysterectomy (simple hysterectomy) is curative only for microscopically invasive cervical cancer. A more extensive dissection to assure negative margins may be considered for tumors confined to the cervix with no metastatic disease. However, for advanced malignancy of the uterine cervix beyond Stage IB, there is no role for hysterectomy prior to chemoradiation.
