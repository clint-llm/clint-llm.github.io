The prevalence of hyperthyroidismÂ varies worldwide, based on dietary iodine content.

The 1977 Whickham Survey evaluated the spectrum of thyroid disorders in County Durham in northeastern England. The Whickham Survey demonstrated a prevalence of hyperthyroidism in women, approximately ten times more than that of men (2.7% versus 0.23%).

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is seen in about 6% of the individuals taking the medication in iodine-sufficient areas and about 10% in individuals taking the medication from iodine-deficient areas.
