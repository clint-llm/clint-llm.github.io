**Mitral Regurgitation is associated with**an abnormal backflow of blood from the left ventricle to the left atrium. In developed countries, the main cause is ischemic coronary disease, and in undeveloped countries, the main cause is a rheumatic disease. Mitral regurgitation in the United States is present in approximately 2 million people and is the second most common valvular disease, after aortic stenosis.

In functional mitral regurgitation the mitral valve leaflets and the mitral annulus apparatus are normal, but there is an abnormality of the ventricular wall, that results in a dysfunction between the wall motion, the papillary muscles and the annulus that increases the distance of the annulus and papillary muscles that results in the restriction of the leaflet motion. On the other hand, rheumatic mitral regurgitation is an acquired disease that presents with stenosis of the mitral valve, in this case, the leaflets are thickened and rigid, the chordae tendinae become shortened due to fibrosis as a result of inflammatory changes. There is also calcification of the leaflets and the mitral valve apparatus that can result in leaflet dysfunction and causes leaflet motion restriction and regurgitation.

Symptoms of mitral regurgitation depend on the left ventricle function; patients can present with dyspnea, fatigue, and orthopnea. Patients with severe disease can progress to congestive heart failure with pulmonary congestion and edema. On auscultation of a patient with mitral regurgitation, the S1 may appear diminished, and a classic finding is a holosystolic, high-pitched murmur due to early closure of the aortic valve.

**Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP)**is defined as the displacement of one or more leaflets by more than 2 mm into the left atrium during ventricular systole, and most commonly is a manifestation of myxomatous degenerative disease of the mitral valve.

**Mitral Stenosis**is defined as the narrowing of the mitral valve apparatus; the most common cause is rheumatic heart disease and develops years after the first episode of rheumatic carditis. The normal orifice of the mitral valve area is 4 to 6 cm^2. Patients with mitral stenosis will experience symptoms when the area of the valve is 2.5 cm^2 or less.

**Indications and surgical treatment**

Once the severity of the valve defect has been established, an indication for surgery includes all symptomatic patients, with normal or reduced ventricular function, and in asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients in whom there is evidence of contractile dysfunction. The choice of surgical timing is based on clinical and instrumental data, as well as on the evaluation of the operating risks and the preference of the patient himself. Also, the possibility of predicting the type of intervention, reparative or replacement, will condition the surgical timing. The ideal time would be to intervene before an irreversible compromise of the ventricular function is achieved. In fact, following an operation performed late, often severe dysfunction of the left ventricle persists, which portends a poor prognosis; on the contrary, an operation performed early, especially if it consists of a repair, involves a low operative risk and allows the patient a quality and life expectancy not different from the normal population. The advantages of repair over replacement include improvements in survival, the lower perioperative mortality and the better preservation of the post-operative ejection fraction, as demonstrated by several studies that have been published in the last decade.

When valvular repair is not considered feasible, mitral valve replacement with preservation of the subvalvular structures is considered the next option. Indeed, when the subvalvular apparatus is not preserved during mitral replacement surgery, the post-surgical sphericity of the left ventricle increases; this unfavorable geometric change explains the decrease in the post-operative ejection fraction compared to the substitution intervention with preservation of the subvalvular apparatus.

In considering specifically the degenerative pathology, the degree of the feasibility of the reparative intervention is very high, being executable in more than 90% of the patients. Estimates are that over 80% of valves are repairable; in highly specialized centers, more than 90% of operations on the ischemic mitral valve are performed through reparative methods.

In the specific case of ischemic mitral valve insufficiency, in patients with severe valve defects, the correction of the valve pathology in association with coronary artery bypass is certainly recommended, in particular, valve repair.
