The differential diagnoses for microcytic, normocytic and macrocytic anemias are listed below based on MCV findings in a complete blood count.

Differential diagnoses of MCV under 80 include iron deficiency anemia causes, anemia of chronic disease causes, sideroblastic anemia causes, H. pylori infection, and thalassemias. Iron deficiency anemia can have many different differential diagnoses including menorrhagia, colorectal adenocarcinoma, bleeding colonic polyp, bleeding peptic ulcer disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, hematemesis, chronic epistaxis, and duodenal malabsorption or resection. Anemia of chronic disease can have differential diagnoses including malignancy, rheumatologic conditions such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis or multiple sclerosis, chronic kidney disease, and chronic infection. Chronic alcoholism, vitamin B6 deficiency, isoniazid use, myelodysplastic disorder, lead poisoning, copper deficiency, and congenital sideroblastic anemia are all differential diagnoses for sideroblastic anemia, causing microcytic anemia. The main types of thalassemia are alpha1, alpha2, alpha3/ hemoglobin H disease, alpha4, which is fatal, beta-thalassemia minor, beta-thalassemia major, and HbS/β thalassemia heterozygote.

Differential diagnoses of MCV above 100 include megaloblastic anemia and non-megaloblastic anemia.

Megaloblastic anemia causes include folate deficiency which can be caused by chronic alcoholism, barbiturate use, phenytoin use, sulfasalazine use, methotrexate use, triamterene use, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole use, pyrimethamine use, and duodenal or jejunal malabsorption or resection. Differential diagnoses for vitamin B12 deficiency would include Crohn disease ileitis, short bowel syndrome, strict vegan diet without supplementation, diphyllobothrium latum infection, chronic metformin use, pernicious anemia, atrophic gastritis, orotic aciduria, and Diamond Blackfan anemia. Non-megaloblastic differential diagnoses include those causing hepatic insufficiency or cirrhosis which can be secondary to chronic alcoholism, fulminant hepatitis secondary to drug toxicity, alpha 1 antitrypsin disease, galactosemia, Wilson disease, chronic hepatitis B viral infection, chronic hepatitis C infection, hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, amyloidosis, chronic decompensated right heart failure, and parasitic infections such as Schistosoma haematobium.

Differential diagnoses of MCV 80 to 100 include those that cause intravascular hemolytic anemia and extravascular hemolytic anemia and aplastic anemia.

Intravascular hemolytic anemia can be caused by paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and micro/macroangiopathic hemolytic anemia due to Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome, HELLP Syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, aortic stenosis, and defective prosthetic cardiac valve. Extravascular hemolytic anemia can result from hereditary spherocytosis, sickle cell anemia, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, infections like malaria and babesiosis, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Some differential diagnoses for autoimmune hemolytic anemia causes would be chronic leukocytic leukemia, systemic lupus, erythematosus, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Also, differential diagnoses for aplastic anemia would include Fanconi anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, radiation exposure, the toxicity of drugs like chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, benzene exposure, viral infections such as parvovirus B19, especially in immunocompromised patients, HIV, Ebstein-Barr virus, hairy cell leukemia, and myelodysplastic disorders.
