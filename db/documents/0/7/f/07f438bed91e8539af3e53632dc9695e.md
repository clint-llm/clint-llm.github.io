Premature ejaculation describes the phenomenon which occurs when ejaculation happens sooner than a man or his partner would like during sexual activity. Even though premature ejaculation is the most prevalent sexual dysfunction in men, shame and embarrassment prevent many of those affected from addressing their symptoms with their healthcare professionals, and as a result, their self-esteem and intimate relationships suffer unnecessarily.

An interprofessional treatment and management approach might involve primary care clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), psychiatrists/psychologists, and urologists. Pharmacists also play a significant role in monitoring medication regimens for drug-drug interactions, verifying doses, and providing medication counsel to the patient. Nursing also plays a role but may have limited access depending on the patient's willingness to share (particularly with a female nurse), but it can verify medication compliance. As premature ejaculation has both psychological and biological origins, there are a variety of medications, therapeutic options, and sexual techniques available to delay ejaculation, which may improve sexual satisfaction and intimacy and improve the patient's quality of life.

Premature ejaculation cases require an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, mental health professionals, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level 5]
