ICVT can initially present as a severe headache. Imaging is essential asÂ it aids in differentiating ICVT from subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningoencephalitis, or a space-occupying lesion such as a tumor. Ruling out any acute metabolic encephalopathies due to infection is important. Clinical suspicion for infection should be high in patients presenting with fevers, elevated white blood count with band neutrophils, and positive blood cultures.

ICVT can be the first manifestation of a prothrombotic state. Other potential etiologies that need to be considered or worked up are vasculitis syndromes, primary/secondary thrombocytosis, polycythemia vera, antiphospholipid syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus. If ICVT is suspect or discovered, the patient could benefit from a screening for protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin deficiency, G20210 prothrombin gene variant, and factor V Leiden thrombophilia.
