According to Maudar (2017), TPN is generally contraindicated in the following conditions:

- Infants with less than 8 cm of the small bowel

- Irreversibly decerebrate patients

- Patients with critical cardiovascular instability or metabolic instabilities; such instabilities require correction before administering intravenous nutrition.

- When gastrointestinal feeding is possible

- When the nutritional status is good, only short-term TPN is needed

- The lack of a therapeutic goal, as TPN should not be used to prolong life when death is unescapable.[5]

**Boxed Warning:**FDA has issued a boxed warning for some intravenous fat emulsions due to increased risk of death in preterm neonates related to intravascular fat accumulation in the lungs. Therefore clinicians must be cautious in choosing the right TPN therapy for preterm infants according to evidence-based guidelines.

ASPEN (American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition) evidence-based guidelines suggest using a 1.2-micron in-line filter. Although 1.2-micron filters are not advised for use as standard infection control, these filters are efficacious in preventing Candida albicans infection in patients receiving parenteral nutrition.
