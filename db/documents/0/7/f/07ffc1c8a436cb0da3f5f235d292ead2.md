Perilunate dislocations (PLDs), lunate dislocations (LDs), and perilunate fracture-dislocations (PLFDs) are rare high-energy injuries. Because these injuries have the potential to cause lifelong disability of the wrist, early recognition and diagnosis are prudent to restore patient function and prevent morbidity. This activity describes the evaluation and management of perilunate dislocations and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of perilunate dislocations.
- Outline the common presenting symptoms and radiographic findings of perilunate dislocations.
- Summarize the complications and long-term sequelae of perilunate dislocations.
- Identify the importance of recognition and collaboration amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients presenting with perilunate dislocations.
