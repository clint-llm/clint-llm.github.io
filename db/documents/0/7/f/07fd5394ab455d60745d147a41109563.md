The embryonic origin of the lower limbs is from a precursor, limb buds. Limb buds develop in locations laid out by Hox genes and require retinoic acid for growth. Before the formation of a distinct prominence, the ischiadic artery takes form in the lower limb. This principle artery will give rise to the branches that will supply the lower limb and foot.  The prominence, limb buds, result from mesenchymal cells proliferating from the lateral plate mesoderm and accumulating under ectoderm covering. The mesenchymal cells secrete paracrine factor FGF10 which initiates limb forming factors. This paracrine factor causes the ectoderm to form the apical ectodermal ridge, which will become a crucial signaling point for the development of the limb and its arteries.
