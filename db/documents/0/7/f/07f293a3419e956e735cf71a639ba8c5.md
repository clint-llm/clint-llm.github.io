As with balloon angioplasty, when placing an intracoronary stent, there can be vessel can perforation and dissection, and in some cases, the placed stent can acutely occlude after the procedure has been completed. Another complication is stent embolization off of its delivery balloon. If this occurs, it can be either inflated/deployed where it lies or recovered with a snare.
