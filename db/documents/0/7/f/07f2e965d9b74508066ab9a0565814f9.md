The stage of the disease determines the differential diagnosis of Eales disease and includes the following entities:

- Vascular: branch retinal vein occlusion, Bechet syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis)

- Infectious: syphilis, Lyme disease, cytomegalovirus retinitis

- Autoimmune: sarcoidosis, frosted branch angiitis.

- Idiopathic: Coats disease.

- Neoplastic: leukemia.

- Congenital: familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, sickle cell retinopathy

- Endocrine: diabetic retinopathy.

Branch retinal vein occlusion generally occurs in hypertensives, and the site of occlusion is invariably an arteriovenous junction; meanwhile, in Eale disease, the site of occlusion could be anywhere along the course of the vein. Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is usually seen in a single quadrant, while Eales disease affects multiple quadrants generally. Vasculitis in the Eales disease predominantly involves the veins.

Features of PCR-positive tubercular retinal vasculitis include:

- Age: 11 to 32 years

- Predominant male involvement (around 70% of patients)

- Bilaterality (54% of patients)

- Vitritis (100% eyes)

- vitreous snowballs (90% eyes)

- Retinal new vessels (around 60% of eyes)

- Retinal hemorrhages (53%)

- Neuroretinitis (53% eyes)

- Focal choroiditis (around 50%)

- Vitreous hemorrhage or preretinal hemorrhage (26%)

- Serous retinal detachment (16%)
