Astute post-treatment follow-up of patients after primary surgery for endometrial cancer and adjuvant therapy, when indicated, should be intent on detecting recurrent cancer when this can be most successfully and cost-effectively treated. Authoritative groups are consistent in their recommendations for intelligible patient counseling and attention to new symptoms, particularly vaginal discharge and/or bleeding, pelvic or abdominal discomfort and pain, loss of appetite, anorexia, weight loss, lethargy, weakness, and shortness of breath. Thorough cancer-focused general and pelvic examinations are recommended every 3 to 6 months for 2 years and at 6 to 12 months intervals after that. Use of interval vaginal cytology, chest x-ray, CT or PET/CT scans, and serum CA125 determinations are not recommended routinely in the absence of suspicious symptoms and/or for surveillance of most patients after treatment for early endometrial cancer. These tests may be selectively used when following patients after treatment of advanced primary endometrial cancer and during management of recurrent disease.
