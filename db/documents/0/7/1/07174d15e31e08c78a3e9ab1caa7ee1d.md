Renal impairment: Clinicians need to consider the glomerular filtration rate(GFR) for patients with renal impairment. No dose adjustment is indicated if an individual has a GFR or CrCl greater or equal to 50 mL/min. For individuals with a GFR less than 50 mL/min, it is recommended that dosing should not exceed 7.5 mg/46 mg (phentermine/topiramate) per day.

Hepatic impairment: It is important to consider the Child-Pugh score for individuals with hepatic impairment. A Child-Pugh score of 5 or 6 indicates that no adjustment needs to be made. If the Child-Pugh score is 7Â to 9, then it is recommended that dosing should not exceed 7.5 mg/46 mg (phentermine/topiramate) per day. If the Child-Pugh score is 10 to 15, indicating severe impairment, it is advised to avoid using phentermine/topiramate.

Monitor for weight reduction and changes in heart rate. Clinicians should periodically monitor a comprehensive metabolic panel, arterial blood gas analysis, and serum electrolytes to check for non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

Monitor for flank pain and hematuria as long-term treatment with topiramate can increase the risk of nephrolithiasis.
