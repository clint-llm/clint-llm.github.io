PALM-COEIN is a useful acronym provided by the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FIGO) to classify the underlying etiologies of abnormal uterine bleeding. The first portion, PALM, describes structural issues. The second portion, COEI, describes non-structural issues. The N stands for "not otherwise classified."

- P: Polyp

- A: Adenomyosis

- L: Leiomyoma

- M: Malignancy and hyperplasia

- C: Coagulopathy

- O: Ovulatory dysfunction

- E: Endometrial disorders

- I:Â  Iatrogenic

- N: Not otherwise classified

One or more of the problems listed above can contribute to a patient's abnormal uterine bleeding. Some structural entities, such as endocervical polyps, endometrial polyps, or leiomyomas, may be asymptomatic and not the primary cause of a patient's AUB.

In the 2018 FIGO system, AUB secondary to anticoagulants was moved from the coagulopathy category to the iatrogenic category.

Conditions to be included in the not otherwise classified category include pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic liver disease, and cervicitis.

AUB not otherwise classified contains rare etiologies and includes arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), myometrial hyperplasia, and endometritis.
