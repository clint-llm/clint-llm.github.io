AllÂ diseases sharing with edema and mucin deposition must merit consideration among the differential diagnosis of scleredema of Buschke. It is commonly confused with scleromyxedema and scleroderma disorders.

Scleroderma is usually observed in systemic sclerosis and typically presents as asymmetrical thickening of the skin with pigmentation and centripetal progression. Typically, there system involvement and presence of scleroderma-specific autoantibodies, Raynaud phenomenon, and nail fold capillary abnormalities. Histopathology shows excessive collagen resulting in the thickened dermis. The distinction between scleredema and scleroderma usually has a basis on clinical features, rather than histological findings.

Scleromyxedema is also a scleroderma-like disorder. They both share the mucin dermal deposition and development of paraproteinemia. Scleromyxedema presents as cutaneous lichenoid papules that extend and form hardened plaques involving the face, the neck, and the arms and can be generalized. Unlike scleredema, it affects the hands and the fingers. Histologically it is characterized by dermal fibrosis with dermal fibers separated by excessive mucin deposits composed mainly of hyaluronic acid. Systemic involvement is common, secondary to mucin deposits. It may also be associated with monoclonal gammopathy, multiple myeloma, and thyroid dysregulation.
