Anatomically the superficial veins of the cubital fossa are classified into four types according to the presence of the median cubital vein (MCV) or median antebrachial vein.

- **Type I**: The median antebrachial vein is dominant and joins both cephalic vein (CV) and basilic vein (BV) in the cubital region. This is also called N type.

- **Type II:**The median cubital vein connects both cephalic vein and basilic vein in the cubital region. This type is also called type M type.

- **Type III**: In the cubital region, development of the brachial cephalic vein is poor or missing.

- **Type IV**: No communicating branch between the cephalic vein and basilic vein.

Type II presenting the both cephalic and basilic vein connected by the median cubital vein is most common followed by type I. Although the most common type of male and female was different as type I and type II, respectively, there is no statistical difference between them. The frequency of the types between right and left upper limbs was also not different. Because of the wide variations of these superficial veins, it has been reported that adverse effects such as bruising, hematoma, and sensory change occurred by mispuncture in various health care systems. Most medical practitioners are aware of two patterns of venous returns in the cubital fossa. This variation underlines the importance of using the intravenous illuminator for venipuncture.
