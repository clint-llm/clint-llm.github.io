Equipment required for saphenous vein grafting depends on whether an open vein harvest (OVH) or endoscopic vein harvest (EVH) is in use. An open vein harvest requires a tray of standard surgical instruments as used in any vascular case. Ultrasound guidance can also be a valuable tool when location is uncertain avoiding unnecessary incisions and dissection. Additionally, nonabsorbable and monofilament sutures, as well as clips,Â are used to ligate tributary vessels. Heparinized saline and a vessel cannula are also requirements for harvest.

In addition to these set of standard surgical instruments and suture, EVH requires additional instruments including a carbon dioxide insufflator, balloon tip trocar with a camera for videoscopic dissection, conical dissector, and bipolar cautery to achieve endoscopic hemostasis.
