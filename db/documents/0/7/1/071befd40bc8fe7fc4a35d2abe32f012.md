**Non-operative treatment**includes shoe stretching and modification. Shoes with wide toe boxes and padding over bony prominences should be recommended. For early postoperative varus deformities after hallux valgus correction surgery, taping or splinting the toes can be effective. This should be continued for 12 weeks until soft tissue healing. If there is persistent pain or inability to wear shoes, surgery is indicated.

Aims of surgery include restoring and/or maintaining normal gait pattern and weight-bearing mechanism, realigning of sesamoids, correcting of deformity in the sagittal and transverse plane, and preserving the first MTP joint range of motion, if possible.

**Operative treatment: Soft tissue or bony procedure.**

The following should be considered to plan surgery:

- The type of deformity flexible or rigid.

- The degree of deformity.

- Presence of arthritis in the first metatarsophalangeal joint.

As a rule, the flexible deformity can be corrected with a soft tissue procedure. Lengthening of the medial capsular structures may be sufficient if the deformity is not too advanced. For advanced but flexible deformities the following procedures have been described either alone or in combination:

- Adductor hallucis tendon re-attachment with medial release

- Abductor hallucis tendon transfer on the base of the lateral base of the proximal phalanx in combination with reattachment or reefing of the conjoined tendon in the webspace or transfer of a part of EHB or EHL under the transverse intermetatarsal ligament to the distal metatarsal neck.

- Abductor hallucis tendon transfer to the lateral aspect of the proximal phalanx in combination with medial capsule release and medial sesamoid mobilization

- Medial release without or with IP joint arthrodesis

- Split extensor hallucis brevis transfer and reverse Akin procedure.

- Tenodesis of the EHB tendon in combination with the release of the medial soft-tissues

- Extensor hallucis longus (EHL) transfer to the proximal phalanx to act as a dynamic stabilizer

- Keller resection arthroplasty

- Implant arthroplasty

**Contraindications for tendon transfer procedures:**

- Arthropathies (Degenerative and inflammatory).

- Active infection.

- Neurovascular compromise (e.g peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular diseases).

- Excessive resection of the medial eminence.

- Fixed deformity of the metatarsophalangeal joint.

In cases with rigid deformity, deformity with limited first MTP joint motion, or presence of arthritic changes in the first MTP joint, arthrodesis of the first MTP joint is considered.

Lateral closing wedge osteotomy +/- repair of lateral ligaments can be offered in cases of iatrogenic hallux varus due to overcorrection of a hallux valgus deformity with either metatarsal or proximal phalangeal osteotomy.
