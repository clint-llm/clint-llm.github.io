Lumateperone undergoes metabolism by the cytochrome P450-3A4 isozyme and interacts with medications that are inhibitors and/or inducers of this isozyme. Therefore, the recommendation is to avoid lumateperone in patients taking a CYP3A4 inducer or moderate to potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Also, lumateperone is likely to interact with alcohol and other sedatives as it produces sedation,Â especially at lower dosages.
