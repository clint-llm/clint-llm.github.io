CMV replicates within endothelial cells at a slow rate. Like other herpesviruses, CMV expresses genes in a temporally controlled manner.

- Early genes within 0 to 4 hours after infection are involved in the regulation of transcription.

- Early genes within 4 to 48 hours after infection are involved in viral DNA replication and further transcriptional regulation.

- Late genes are expressed during the rest of infection up to viral egress andÂ code for structural proteins.

- While CMV encodes for functional DNA polymerase, the virus makes use of the host RNA polymerase for the transcription of its genes.

Synthesis of the viral double-stranded DNA genome occurs in the host cell nucleus within specialized viral replication compartments.
