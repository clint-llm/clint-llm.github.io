Owing to the close proximity of the musculature and emerging neurovascular structures in the gluteal region, there have been case reports of compression syndrome occurring following trauma to the gluteus medius muscle, compressing the regional vascular system.

Gluteus medius syndrome (GMS) is a less common cause of lower back pain or leg pain and is similar but not the same as the greater trochanteric pain syndrome. GMS is associated with degeneration of the lumbar vertebrae and osteoarthritis at the level of the hips or the knee; it can correlate with failed back surgery syndrome.
