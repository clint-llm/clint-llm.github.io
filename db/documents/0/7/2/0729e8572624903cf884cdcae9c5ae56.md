Patients with pectus carinatum present with protrusion of the sternum and ribs, often asymptomatic but occasionally with tenderness at the protrusion site, reduced pulmonary endurance, or tachypnea with exertion.  Respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea and reduced endurance are more common in the chondromanubrial variety, as the flexibility of the chest wall is decreased compared to the chondrogladiolar deformity.
