Synuclein is clinically significant due to its involvement in synucleinopathies â€“ Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. Alpha-synuclein is the target of much research and could serve as a target for therapeutic agents. Suggested therapies include targeting alpha-synuclein aggregates with specific antibodies to encourage clearance, targeting alpha-synuclein monomers in an attempt to increase clearance, decrease synthesis, or stabilize the monomers to prevent aggregation.

Beta-synuclein is an intrinsically disordered protein but has been shown to inhibit alpha-synuclein aggregates, which have implications in the synucleinopathies. The three synuclein domains of beta-synuclein have been demonstrated to inhibit the aggregation of alpha-synuclein. This fact is of clinical significance as the interaction between the synuclein chains can serve as a basis for targeted therapeutics against alpha-synuclein aggregates.

Synuclein-gamma has implications in various types of cancers. For breast cancer, radiation therapy following mastectomy reduces recurrence and improves prognosis. Yet, radiotherapy comes with a litany of side effects and risks. Patients who were positive for synuclein-gamma demonstrated less response to radiation therapy, possibly due to a correlation between gamma-synuclein and expression of radiation repair genes.
