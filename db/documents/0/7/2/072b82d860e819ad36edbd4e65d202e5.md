Patients with snapping hip syndrome are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a sports physician, nurse practitioner, orthopedic surgeon, emergency department physician, physical therapist, and pain specialist.

The treatment depends on the presence of symptoms; asymptomatic patients require no treatment. Those with pain should be encouraged to rest and enroll in a physical therapy program. Many other modalities of treatment are used to treat this disorder but there is no evidence that one is better than the other. Surgery is the last resort treatment and should only be considered once conservative treatment has failed.

The majority of patients find relief with changes in activity, rest, ice, and stretching.
