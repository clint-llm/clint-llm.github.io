Research has determined that to accurately document a wound classification, implementing a curriculum that prioritizes wound classifications can result in a statistically significant increase in the accurate documentation of wound classifications.

A factor often overlooked is the patient's nutritional approach to improve the wound healing response. For example, a diabetic ulcer will need a careful food assessment and accompanying dietary changes not to make the wound worse and allow healing. Further, malnutrition does not lend itself to correct tissue repair. Some food supplements can help heal a wound; for example, arginine helps collagen storage, or glutamine helps the immune system.

Generally, the clinician assesses the wound, the nurse provides ongoing wound care and monitoring, and other healthcare personnel is involved in the patient's healing process. The presence of the psychologist can help with the possible emotional traumatic implications; the physiotherapist to improve or speed up the recovery processes of the patient's autonomy or to use tools (from electrostimulation to sensory stimulation, etc.) or exercises; the pharmacist with medication reconciliation and providing antibiogram information for infection treatment or prophylaxis; these are all options in the interprofessional team approach to wound care.
