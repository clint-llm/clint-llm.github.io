Horseshoe kidneys are the most common fusion defect of the kidneys, but this still amounts to only about 0.25% of the population. Many professionals are not aware of the condition, its evaluation, or treatment.

The nursing urology specialty nurse should assist the clinician in educating the patient and family. [Level V]
