Several different STS subtypes can affect the trunk and, or extremities. The most common presentation is a patient with a painless mass that requires a detailed history and physical examination upon initial evaluation. Of note, several conditions may mimic soft tissue sarcoma. These conditions include hypertrophic scars, hematoma, benign lipoma, cysts, abscesses, and melanoma. All of these can confuse the clinician when trying to work up an STS.

Neoplasms that are small, superficial, and mobile are highly suggestive of a soft tissue sarcoma. These are separate from skeletal or neurovascular structures and may be surgically resected with grossly wide margins. Tumors closer to vital organs or vascular structures are typically referred to a tertiary care center where surgeons trained explicitly in such resections can intervene. In such cases, preoperative biopsies are encouraged as there are several factors that may ultimately affect patient outcomes.
