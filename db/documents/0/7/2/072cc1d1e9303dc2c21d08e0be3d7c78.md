Chest inspection, palpation, and auscultation are key components of the physical examination of patients with respiratory disease. Palpation ascertains the signs suggested by inspecting and assessing the state of the pleura and lung parenchyma by studying the vocal fremitus. Vocal (tactile) fremitus is palpation of the chest wall to detect changes in the intensity of vibrations created with certain spoken words in a constant tone and voice indicating underlying lung pathology.

**Pathophysiology**

Sound vibrations produced in the larynx during phonation are transmitted to the bronchi and lungs and then communicated to the chest wall. Transmission of spoken tones depends on the state of the underlying lung parenchyma in the pleural space. Normal lung parenchyma is a mixture of air-filled spaces and solid lung parenchyma. Air is a poor conductor of low sound frequencies whereas a solid or dense medium increases the transmission of low sound frequencies. Vocal fremitus may be decreased in conditions affecting the lung parenchyma, pleura, or chest wall.

Vocal fremitus is decreased in bronchial asthma, emphysema, or bronchial obstruction due to air trapping and decreased density of lung parenchyma. In case of pleural effusion and pneumothorax, air/fluid accumulates in the potential space between the chest wall and lung parenchyma, decreasing the transmission of lower frequency sound vibrations. Vocal fremitus also may be decreased in individuals with obesity.

On the other hand, inflammation and consolidation create a dense medium which increases the transmission of lower frequency sounds and vocal fremitus.

Vocal resonance is the auscultatory counterpart of vocal fremitus. The following changes in vocal resonance are seen.

**Bronchophony:**A louder sound heard over an area of consolidation.

**Whispering pectoriloquy:**While the examiner auscultates over the lung fields, the patient is asked to whisper "one, two, three." Whispered words are heard clearly in the presence of consolidation. Whispered pectoriloquy has the same significance as increased fremitus and adds no new information to those approaches.

**Egophony or an "E to A" change:**A qualitative change in the voice that resembles the bleating of a goat. Select sound frequencies are able to pass through consolidation and tend to distort the sound of the vowel "E" so that it is perceived by the examiner as "A" or "AAAH."

**Other types of fremitus:**

- Ronchial fremitus - palpable ronchi

- Pleural fremitus - palpable pleural rub
