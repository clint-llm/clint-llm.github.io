Several strategies have been forwarded for the prevention of fetal growth restriction, but only a few have proven to be effective. ACOG does not recommend low dose aspirin for women at increased risk of preeclampsia as there is insufficient evidence of improved outcomes. However, recent publications have demonstrated a significant risk reduction in early-onset preeclampsia with low dose aspirin. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (RCOG) in the United Kingdom (UK) recommends low-dose aspirin before 16 gestational weeks in women with risk factors for preeclampsia.

Maternal substance abuse such as tobacco, which can potentially impede the placental vascular functions, should be identified as early as possible. Smoking is a modifiable risk factor. Smoking cessation has proven to be effective in decreasing the risk of FGR. Counseling on smoking cessation, as well as for other substance abuse, should be provided, and aid should be offered whenever possible.

Currently, there is insufficient data to recommend dietary modification or bed rest.
