A direct blow commonly causes fractures that occur in the middle third of the shaft of the humerus. Humeral shaft fractures account for about 3% of all fractures. These fractures are classified based on their location, open or closed status and the type of fracture line. The majority of humeral shaft fractures are unstable but non-surgical treatment is the standard of care.
