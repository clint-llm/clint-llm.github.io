The limb buds of the embryo begin to form about five weeks after fertilization as the lateral plate mesoderm migrates into the limb bud region and condenses along the central axis to eventually form the vasculature and skeletal components of the lower limb.

The earliest arterial supply of the lower limb bud is the axis artery and the terminal plexus, both of which come from the umbilical artery. The axis artery then gives off branches that form the anterior tibial artery and the posterior tibial artery.
