Neuropsychological testing may reveal subtle cognitive deficits (ANI or MND) in as many as 40% of HIV-infected patients treated with antiretrovirals.Â  A nationwide Danish study estimated that 1 of 1000 patients not treated with HAART and with low CD4 counts would progress to HAD. Data from the European CASCADE study suggests an incidence of HAD of 0.66 per 1000 person-years which is a decrease of almost tenfold from the pre-ART era. In the United States, the CHARTER study estimated an incidence of HAD of 10.5 cases per 1000 patient-years; this is down from 21 cases per 1000 patient years before the advent of ART therapy. Prevalence of HAND among white and non-white patients as well as between men and women appears to mimic that of HIV infection and increases with age.
