There is a pooling of approximately 300 mL to 800 mL of blood in the lower extremities secondary to gravitational forces immediately upon standing from a supine position. This results in decreased venous return to the heart, and as a result, there is a decrease in cardiac output, as defined by the Frank-Starling Curve. The human body normally compensates with an increase in sympathetic tone and a decrease in vagal tone, known as theÂ baroreceptor reflex. This increase in sympathetic outflow raises peripheral vascular resistance, which subsequently increases venous return and cardiac output, thereby limiting the fall in blood pressure. When patients lack this compensatory mechanism, they present with symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.
