The treatment of ANUG should be approached in successive stages,Â including treatment of the acute phase, treatment of any preexisting condition, treatment of disease sequelae, and transition to supportive or maintenance phase.

Treatment of the acute phase aims to halt tissue destruction and to control the patient's discomfort. This involves gentle, ultrasonic debridement of superficial gingival plaques and calculi along with localized oxygen therapy, directed at necrotic lesions.

Metronidazole (250 mg 3 times a day) is a common first drug choice due to its activity against anaerobes. Penicillin, tetracyclines, clindamycin, amoxicillin, and amoxicillin with clavulanate have been shown to produce "acceptable" results and are considered on a case-by-case basis. Oral penicillin, for example, was demonstrated in one study to show significant clinical improvement in three to six days.

After the acute phase has been controlled, treatment of any preexisting condition, such as chronic gingivitis, should be initiated. This stage involves professional prophylaxis in the form of scaling and root planning and the establishment of maintenance of oral hygiene methods by the patient.

The main goal of the maintenance phase is to comply with oral hygiene practices and control any predisposing factors.

In summary, the treatment of ANUG consists of a multifactorial approach involving superficial debridement, oral hygiene instruction, utilization of antimicrobial mouthwash and oral antibiotics, and initiation of a comprehensive prophylaxis plan involving root planning and predisposing factor management.
