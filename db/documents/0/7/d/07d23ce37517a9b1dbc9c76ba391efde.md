Prostate cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, with approximately 1.4 million new cases, and is more commonly diagnosed in developed countries. To combat the disease, advanced biomarkers are constantly in development. Even though patients with prostate cancer have improved overall survival, from a global perspective, this is a disease that requires attention in terms of better diagnostic and treatment modalities, especially in the metastatic setting. This activity describes tissue-based biomarkers useful in clinical practice to help determine risk stratification at critical decision points in prostate cancer, which will help determine the relative need for a re-biopsy or further intervention, thus aiding physicians and patients in personalizing care for their disease.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiopathology of prostate cancer.
- Review the risk factors identified as causal factors in prostate cancer worldwide.
- Identify the indications and utility of the new prostate cancer biomarker tests in patients with prostate cancer.
- Summarize the utility of a broad panel of next-generation sequencing tests in resected prostate cancer tissue in the metastatic setting.
