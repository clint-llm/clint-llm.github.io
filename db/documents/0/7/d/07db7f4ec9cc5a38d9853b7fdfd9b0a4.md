Sometimes secondary pneumonia can develop. This is usually indicated by worsening symptoms, productive cough, and fever. In such cases, a chest x-ray is indicated. This is especially important in immunocompromised adults, the elderly population, infants and newborns, and smokers. Pulmonary emboli should always be in differentials in a patient with a cough and shortness of breath. Sometimes aggressive coughing can lead to spontaneous pneumothorax and or spontaneous pneumomediastinum. Hence any acute worsening of symptoms usually requires a chest x-ray.
