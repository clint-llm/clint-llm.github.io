History provides most of the clues necessary for a diagnosis of JME. Physical examination is generally unremarkable. An electroencephalogram (EEG) provides supporting evidence for diagnosing JME. An interictal EEG is abnormal in the majority of patients with JME.

If history, examination, and EEG are indicative of JME, imaging (with magnetic resonance imaging-MRI) is usually unnecessary as it tends to be normal.
