Injury to a tendon may be managed conservatively or operatively. Whether or not to proceed with surgical intervention, as opposed to nonoperative management, is based on many factors. Therefore, a review of specific tendon injury management is beyond the scope of this review. However, the general principles that are considered when performing a thorough clinical analysis and managing patients with various types of tendon injuries include the following:

- Partial versus complete (rupture) injuries

- Region of the body affected

- Capacity to compensate (clinical significance and functional outcome in the setting of tendon injury)

- Age of the patient

- Functional goals (sedentary versus active or sport-specific lifestyle)

- Patient medical comorbidities (diabetes, inflammatory arthropathies, systemic conditions)

- Hand dominance

- Resulting cosmetic deformity

- Chronicity of injury with resulting tissue quality (consideration of direct repair versus allograft or autograft tendon reconstruction)

- Available surgical alternatives (tendon transfer principles)

- Social factors (patient compliance, smoking status, history of illicit drug use)

- Current medications (chronic steroid use, fluoroquinolones)
