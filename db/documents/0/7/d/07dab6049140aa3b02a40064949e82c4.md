Given the potential for life-threatening complications, patients withÂ pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) should undergo thorough evaluation including history and physical exam, along with the appropriate genetic testing for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Clinical signs, symptoms, and complications should be reviewed with patients beforehand. Close follow-up is also recommended in order to monitor disease progression or possible complications from interventions performed.
