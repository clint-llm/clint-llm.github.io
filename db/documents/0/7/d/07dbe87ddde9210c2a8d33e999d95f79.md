As with any surgical procedure, an infection can occur. Although infection is a relatively rare complication of syndactyly surgery, it has the potential to be devastating if not recognized and addressed promptly with surgical debridement or antibiotics. Recent data suggests a postoperative infection rate of 1.6%. Complications from the surgery are more likely to be present in patients with syndromic presentations and multiple preoperative medical diagnoses.

If nonoperative treatment is chosen, this may lead to diminished dexterity and function in the hands. Nonoperative treatment or observation of syndactyly between digits with length differences may result in increased deformity and growth disturbance. The shorter digit may create a tethering effect on the longer digit pulling the longer digit into angular deformity toward the shorter digit and also into flexion.
