Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin found in some animal food products and is also synthesized in the human body via exposure to the sun. Toxicity of vitamin D leads to hypercalcemia and an imbalance in the regulation of bone metabolism; the resultant hypercalcemia leads to clinical manifestations and symptoms of toxicity. This activity reviews the etiology, evaluation, and treatment of vitamin D toxicity. In addition, it highlights the role of healthcare practitioners in identifying the patients at risk for toxicity and the importance of appropriate medication reconciliation to help prevent such adverse outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify patients at risk for vitamin D toxicity based on clinical factors, including underlying medical conditions and medication history.
- Select and recommend appropriate vitamin D formulations and dosages considering patient-specific factors, such as age, gender, and comorbidities.
- Implement evidence-based guidelines and protocols for the prevention, monitoring, and management of vitamin D toxicity.
- Collaborate with other healthcare professionals, such as pharmacists and laboratory personnel, to ensure accurate medication reconciliation, monitoring, and interpretation of laboratory results.
