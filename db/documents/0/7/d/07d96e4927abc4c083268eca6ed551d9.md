Effective use of targeted temperature management requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals working in a coordinated and efficient manner. This starts with emergency medical technicians (EMTs) performing timely and efficient CPR, followed by emergency physicians and nurses initiating the institutions' TTM protocol, and finally, the team in the ICU who continue the TTM protocol and manage any complications that may arise. Other specialists may be involved in the care of these patients, such as cardiologists for PCI or neurologists for neurological prognostication. Early door to TTM initiation time has been shown to be associated with improved neurological outcomes.
