Equipment required for a surgical neck lift typically includes a skin marker, local anesthetic or tumescent solution, #15 blade scalpel, retractor and light source, facelift scissors, needle drivers, electrocautery, suction, and sutures for both soft tissue suspension and skin closure. Heavy 2-0 or 3-0 polyester, polydioxanone, or polyglactin sutures work well for reapproximating the medial borders of the platysma. Smaller 4-0, 5-0, and 6-0 sutures are used for layered skin closure. A Barton-style dressing with ice packs is typically applied at the conclusion of the procedure.

Skin resurfacing can be accomplished with numerous different systems, including carbon dioxide, diode, and erbium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet lasers, as well as broadband or intense pulsed light. If these systems are unavailable, a superficial chemical peel may also produce the desired effect.

Other modalities, such as cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation, may also be used to reduce excess adiposity, and these procedures require specialized equipment to perform.

Injection of botulinum toxin and deoxycholic acid requires minimal equipment: sterile saline, hypodermic needles, and a syringe.
