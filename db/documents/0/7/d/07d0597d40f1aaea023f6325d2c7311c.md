Iodine contrast medium is essential in invasive and interventional cardiac procedures. Because of an increasing number of coronary angiography and coronary interventional procedures, the increasing use of contrast media, and the increasing number of invasive cardiac procedures being performed in high-risk patients with chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and kidney failure due to contrast-induced nephropathy remains a growing concern. A sudden change in kidney function is a common complication of coronary angiography, and percutaneous coronary intervention, primarily because of contrast-induced acute kidney injury or contrast-induced nephropathy. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of contrast-induced nephropathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management and prevention.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the risk factors for contrast-induced nephropathy.
- Review the pathophysiology of contrast-induced nephropathy.
- Summarize the management of contrast-induced nephropathy.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by contrast-induced nephropathy.
