While endovascular revascularization is associated with shorter hospital stays and fewer serious complication rates, it also is associated with lower long-term patency rates and a shorter time to the return of symptoms when compared to open surgical revascularization. Restenosis occurs in up to 40% of patients, many of whom will require reintervention.

Postprandial pain also is associated with biliary disease, peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, diverticulitis, gastric reflux, irritable bowel syndrome, and gastroparesis. Malignancy must be ruled out in an older patient presenting with GI symptoms and weight loss.
