The FDA first approved the original molecule of adalimumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It was the third tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitor to be approved by the FDA after infliximab and etanercept. Subsequently, the FDA has approved adalimumab for the following indications:

- Rheumatoid arthritis

- Ankylosing spondylitis

- Crohn disease

- Ulcerative colitis

- Hidradenitis suppurativa

- Juvenile idiopathic arthritis

- Plaque psoriasis

- Psoriatic arthritis

- Uveitis

The off label uses of adalimumab include:

- Neutrophilic dermatosis â€“ pyoderma gangrenosum, Behcet disease

- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (also known as Wegener granulomatosis)

- Sarcoidosis

- Pemphigus

- Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis

- Alopecia areata.

Several biosimilar molecules have now been developed, e.g., ABP 501, BI 695501, and SB5.
