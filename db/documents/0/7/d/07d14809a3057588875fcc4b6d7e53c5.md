There are varying degrees of impairment in prosopagnosia, including:

- The inability to recognize

- Discriminate

- Identify different or own faces

- Discern differences between faces and surrounding objects.

To compensate for their deficit, patients use their other senses and cues such as voice, shapes, and anomalous contours of the face. These compensatory mechanisms, at times, are not enough to recognize familiar faces. This impairment causes a psychological and social impact leading to functional impairment, unemployment, social isolation, depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders.
