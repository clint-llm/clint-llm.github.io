Perhaps one of the most pertinent studies was the 2014 retrospective study that was done to assess the prevalence of coronary artery fistulas. This study, as stated above, uncovered a prevalence of 0.9% in the general population, using coronary CT angiography. This study was not only able to delineate a more accurate representation of the prevalence but was also able to show that coronary CT angiography was better able to diagnose coronary artery fistulas, as opposed to conventional coronary angiography.
