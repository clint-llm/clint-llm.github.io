Although pain stemming from facet joint etiology is common, the diagnosis is challenging due to non-specific findings on physical exam, history, and imaging that may overlap with other pain pathologies. Diagnostic facet joint injections provide a reliable modality to detect pain originating from the facet joint and may offer patient pain relief and guidance in future interventions or treatment.
