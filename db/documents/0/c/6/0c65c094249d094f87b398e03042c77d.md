Posterior urethral valves cause urinary tract obstruction. Depending on the extent of obstruction, posterior urethral valves may be diagnosed antenatally or present after birth with acute urinary retention. The timeliness of diagnosis can affect the lifelong function of the urinary tract. Obstruction caused by posterior urethral valves can lead to hypertrophy of the bladder wall and detrusor muscle. Changes to the bladder can impact compliance and bladder filling as well as raise intravesical pressures. Elevated bladder pressures can be transmitted into the ureters causing vesicoureteric reflux. This, in turn, is associated with infection, incontinence, and progressively impaired renal function. In severe cases, poor urine output can lead to oligohydramnios and, therefore, pulmonary hypoplasia.
