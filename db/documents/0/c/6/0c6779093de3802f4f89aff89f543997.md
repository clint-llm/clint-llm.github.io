Hypercarbia is defined by an increase in carbon dioxide in the bloodstream. Carbon dioxide is a metabolic end-product of normal metabolism, with increased production in various clinically relevant disease processes. If a patient is unable to fully compensate due to some type of central nervous system or lung impairment, acidosis results. Though hypercarbia is common in hospital settings, mortality from progressive respiratory acidosis is high if untreated. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hypercarbia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of hypercarbia.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation for hypercarbia.
- Review the management options available for hypercarbia.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding hypercarbia and improve outcomes.
