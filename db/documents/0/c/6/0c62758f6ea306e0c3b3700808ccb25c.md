The Schafer-Fuhrman classification of laryngotracheal trauma is most commonly used

- Group 1: Minor endolaryngeal lacerations or hematomas; treatment is conservative with humidified oxygen, antibiotics and observation in intensive care unit (ICU) setting

- Group 2: Mucosal edema, hematoma without exposed cartilage, nondisplaced fracture; treatment is tracheostomy and panendoscopy

- Group 3: Massive edema, large mucosal lacerations, exposed cartilage, displaced fractures, vocal cord paralysis; treatment is tracheostomy followed by surgical exploration and repair

- Group 4: Similar to Group 3 but more severe disruption, unstable fracture or more than 2 fracture lines; treatment is emergent tracheostomy followed by surgical repair (and possible stent placement)

- Group 5: Complete laryngeal separation; treatment is emergent tracheostomy followed by surgical repair including stent placement
