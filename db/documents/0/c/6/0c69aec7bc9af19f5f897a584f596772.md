The most severe fetal complication of congenital infection is fetal demise and spontaneous abortion, but the incidence of this is difficult to estimate. Congenital toxoplasmosis, rubella, CMV, and HSV can result in low birth weight, failure to thrive, and significant neurodevelopmental and motor delays in affected infants.

HEV infection is associated with a significant risk of fulminant hepatic failure and death in pregnant women compared to the general population.

Data regarding the relationship between chorioamnionitis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia or respiratory distress syndrome is mixed.
