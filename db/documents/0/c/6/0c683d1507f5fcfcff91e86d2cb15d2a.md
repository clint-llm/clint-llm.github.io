Acne fulminans is a devastating systemic disorder with severely disfiguring skin lesions. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner should know that this is a severe form of acne that should obtain a referral to a dermatologist.  The majority of patients are affected negatively by the poor cosmesis. Their quality of life is altered, and they are not able to participate in sports or social activities. Many become withdrawn and isolated. Thus, it is vital to offer psychosocial counseling to them. Many of these patients will benefit from mental health treatment and the use of antidepressants. Suicidal ideation is very common in these patients, and close follow up with a psychiatrist is highly recommended. The use of retinoids has not shown to worsen the risk of depression or suicidal ideation.

The patient also has to be educated by clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists on the skin disorder and avoidance of triggering agents. The skin should be kept clean and dry, the patient should discontinue smoking should, and one should refrain from applying unproven remedies like oils and ointments. An interprofessional team approach, including clinicians, specialists, nurses with specialty training in dermatology, and pharmacists, is most effective. [Level 5]
