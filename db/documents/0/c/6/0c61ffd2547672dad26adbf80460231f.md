SCIs involve a classic bimodal distribution pattern.

Younger patients are injured via high-energy mechanisms with the following approximate associated incidence rates

- Motor Vehicle Accidents - 50% to 75%

- Falls - 10% to 15%

- Gunshot wounds - 10% to 15%

- Sports - 10% to 15%

- Iatrogenic - estimated incidence ranges from 3% to 25% of all SCIs occurring secondary to improper immobilization and patient transport

The elderly patient population sustains the majority of SCIs via minor trauma or mechanical falls. Elderly patients are predisposed to injury secondary to an underlying degenerative spine and associated spinal stenosis.
