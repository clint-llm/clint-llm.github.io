Abdominoperineal resection is indicated in patients with operable low rectal carcinomas who meet the following criteria:

- Within 5cm of the anal verge

- Otherwise not possible to get a negative distal margin (5 cm proximally and 2 cm distally)

- And/or has an invasion of local structure such as the external sphincter

It is estimated that around 40% of patients with rectal cancer require surgical intervention as part of their management.

Less common indications include Fournier gangrene, inflammatory bowel disease, and fecal incontinence not amenable to sphincter sparing surgery.
