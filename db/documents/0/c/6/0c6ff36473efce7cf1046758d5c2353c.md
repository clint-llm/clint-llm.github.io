During embryogenesis, multiple events can occur and cause the proliferation of anatomical variants. The most common variants in the cerebral circulation are hypoplastic arteries. Duplications and fenestrations are the second most common variants, with fenestrations of the anterior communicating artery being the most common. However, the fenestrations of the internal carotid artery are very rare.

Another rare variant that can occur during the embryonic period is internal carotid artery segmental agenesis. When this occurs, the internal carotid blood flow reroutes to provide the usual blood supply distal to the agenetic segment.

The retropharyngeal internal carotid artery is another example of a rare, generally asymptomatic, but important to recognize variant. Possible symptoms to be aware of are submucosal pulsating mass in the posterior pharynx, possibly associated with hoarseness and respiratory issues depending on how medially located the aberrant artery is.

Reports of rare cases of non-bifurcating carotid artery exist, with the origin of the internal carotid artery at C1 or C2 level and branches of the external carotid artery originating from the non-bifurcating carotid artery. The presence of this abnormality can indicate a case of embryological arrest and persistence of the primitive hyoid-stapedial system. This variation normally goes unnoticed and asymptomatic, but its connection to atherosclerosis and stroke is unclear.
