Digital amputation is often associated with traumatic injuries but is also seen within the elective surgery setting, such as in the case of cancer resection and management of chronic conditions such as Dupuytren's contractures or peripheral vascular disease. It is also seen as a consequence of severe sepsis, although this often results in auto-amputation. In the traumatic setting, the primary objective of management is to salvage the amputated finger to restore function, especially if the dominant hand is affected. However, this is not always possible, as there are many factors to consider. These factors include the time from injury, mechanism of injury, and degree of contamination in a traumatic finger amputation. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of traumatic finger amputation and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the goal of treatment of finger amputation.
- Describe the common causes of traumatic finger amputation. 
- Outline the factors that must be considered in determining whether traumatic finger amputation is necessary.
- Explain the modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients requiring traumatic finger amputation.
