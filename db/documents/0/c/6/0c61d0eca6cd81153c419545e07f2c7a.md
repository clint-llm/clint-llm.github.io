Diagnosis of pubic symphysis diastasis is often straightforward, however other causes of hip, back, and leg pain all warrant consideration by the evaluating clinician. Considerations include an examination for labial and perianal tears and lacerations, venous thrombus embolisms, musculoskeletal low back pain, and lumbosacral radiculopathy. Additionally, pubic osteolysis, osteitis pubis, bone infection (osteomyelitis, tuberculosis, syphilis), tumors, postpartum fracture, abscess, and osteomyelitis have to be considered.
