FK commonly results from fungal access into the corneal stroma through a defect in the corneal epithelium; this is probably the reason behind the increased risk of FK in association with trauma and foreign bodies that lead to loss of the integrity of the protecting epithelium. Injury with vegetative matter may result in direct inoculation of fungal conidia present on their surface into the corneal stroma leading to initiation of infection or injure the overlying corneal epithelium permitting fungal invasion.

The cornea is avascular, and on top of its barrier capacity, is immune privileged with restricted defense mechanisms, dendritic cells, immune cells, and immunoglobulins, making it easy to be colonized by fungi. Fungi also secrete various toxins and enzymes including serine proteases and matrix metalloproteinases that help in corneal invasion and colonization.
