For most cases, complete surgical excision is the preferred treatment, with local recurrence extremely rare. There are currently no alternative therapies for cutaneous neurofibromas.

In rare cases of diffuse or plexiform neurofibromas where complete surgical excision is not possible, lesions are often totally resected for cosmetic or symptomatic relief. These patients require monitoring to watch for rapid growth or recurrence at the discretion of the clinical providers. Interferon-alpha has been studied as an adjunct therapy for plexiform neurofibromas, with variable results.
