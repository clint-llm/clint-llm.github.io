With the advancement of the understanding of the complexity of higher cognitive processes, there are suggestions that the term limbic system is no longer relevant but that it functioned as a historical framework upon which to build our current understanding of neuroscience.

In conclusion, many individual components comprise the limbic system, all of which play specific roles in the greater whole of the functionality of the limbic system. Emotion, memory, and social processing are essential functions when considering the whole of human health. Generally, clinical disorders involving bilateral lesions of individual parts of the limbic system are rare. However, in much more prevalent disorders, such as schizophrenia, asymmetry and cortical volume loss of limbic system components is common.
