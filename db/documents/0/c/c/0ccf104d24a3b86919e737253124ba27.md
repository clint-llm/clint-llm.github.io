The tympanic membrane is derived from the invagination and meeting of the first pharyngeal groove (cleft) with the first pharyngeal pouch, and as such, it is comprised of two germ layers (ectoderm and endoderm). The lateral (external) epithelium is ectodermal in origin and is formed from the canalization of an ectodermal plug involved in the formation of the external acoustic meatus in the first pharyngeal groove. The medial aspect of the tympanic membrane is a continuation of the lining of the middle ear, which is endodermal in origin from the first pharyngeal pouch. The fibrous middle layer is derived from mesenchyme of neural crest origin and encases both the handle of the malleus and chorda tympani of the same origin. The chorda tympani is the pre-trematic nerve (coursing in the caudal aspect) of the first pharyngeal arch.
