The diagnosis and management of asthma in children is complex. While medications are useful,Â it is important to remember that a multi-pronged approach to asthma management comprises several strategies, including education, skills training, clinical monitoring, and environmental control measures when necessary. The nurse practitioner, primary care provider, pediatrician, pulmonologist and the internist should be familiar with recent guidelines. The goals of asthma management include normal activity and good control of asthma symptoms as well as minimizing future risk from exacerbations and medication side effects. Also, another goal is to maintain lung function and lung development as close to normal as possible.
