**Chest Radiography**

While findings may be obvious if there are bowel contents or a coiled nasogastric tube in the chest, chest radiographs are non-diagnostic in up to 40% of cases. This is particularly true in intubated patients as positive pressure ventilation prevents herniation of abdominal contents into the chest. Subtle findings may include elevation of the diaphragm, atelectasis or pleural effusion. Right-sided injuries, unless resulting in large defects, may be particularly difficult to identify on chest radiographs as the liver buttresses the diaphragm.

**Ultrasound**

Ultrasound is frequently utilized in the early evaluation of trauma patients to assess for fluid in the abdomen, pericardium, and chest. An experienced operator may be able to visualize an injury to the diaphragm, but a negative study does not exclude the diagnosis.

**Computed tomography (CT)**

In hemodynamically stable patients, CT scanning may be useful in detecting diaphragmatic injury. Newer generation multidetector machines may detect even subtle injuries with a sensitivity of around 66.7%. However, most patients with penetrating injury still do not receive a correct preoperative diagnosis.

**Thoracoscopy or Laparoscopy**

Thoracoscopy may be used to visualize the diaphragm when the diagnosis is considered, but laparotomy is not required to manage other injuries. Laparoscopy has a sensitivity of about 88% and a sensitivity of nearly 100% in evaluating for diaphragmatic injury.
