TVL (Transient visual loss)Â is a very significant clinical symptom, and the most important underlying cause is retinal ischemia. Studies have shown that patients with monocular TVL associated with atheromatous carotid artery disease have a 1-year risk of recurrent stroke of 2% and in patients with associated severe Internal carotid artery stenosis, the risk of ipsilateral stroke is up to 16% after three years. This highlights the importance of a proper workup and urgent management of patients presenting with TVL, especially due to vascular causes.
