The diagnosis and management of cholecystitis is a multi-disciplinary team approach. A high index of suspicion is vital in the diagnosis. Referral to the surgical team followed by decision making on the need for laparoscopic surgery are the next steps. Good surgical care with good postoperative followÂ up is also essential. Counseling for food habits with nutritionist support and lifestyle changes are crucial in patients being treated conservatively.
