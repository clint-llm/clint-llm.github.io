The developmental biology of gastrin and somatostatin cells occurs in the antropyloric mucosa of the stomach.

Gastrin is a linear peptide that is initially translated as preprogastrin. Preprogastrin undergoes post-translation cleavage, which produces a family of gastrin peptides of variable lengths, the most common being "big gastrin," a peptide comprised of 34 amino acids. The bioactivity of gastrin is preserved in a 5 amino acid sequence called “pentagastrin,” found at the 5 C-terminal of all members of the gastrin family, regardless of the overall size of the gastrin peptide. The 5 C-terminal amino acids of gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) are identical.
