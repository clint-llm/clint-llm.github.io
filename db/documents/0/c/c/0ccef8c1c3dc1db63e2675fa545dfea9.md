Enterohemorrhagic E. coli is not invasive, making bacteremia rare. It adheres to mammalian cells, secreting bacterial proteins into host cells through a type III secretion system. Ribosome-inactivating Shiga-like toxins (Stx1 and Stx2) are secreted which are responsible for organ damage. Stx 2 has been found to be more often associated with severe disease. Shiga toxin consists of 2 subunits: A and B. Proteolysis further degrades subunit A into A1 and A2. In target organs, for example, the kidney, brain,Â and gut, subunit B attaches to glycolipid receptors on the cell surface. In humans, these receptors have been identified as Gb3 which are mainly expressed in kidney tubular cells, brain, and gut epithelium. The cytotoxicity is further amplified in the kidney due to the interplay of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. After it binds to the cell surface, Shiga toxin is endocytosed and transported to the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum in a retrograde direction from there it is then translocated to the cytosol where it inactivates ribosomes and causes cell death.
