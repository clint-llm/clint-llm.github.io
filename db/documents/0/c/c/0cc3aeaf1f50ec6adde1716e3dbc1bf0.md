**Congenital Disease**

Congenital diseases of the nose need to be addressed due to newborns being nasal breathers. Some signs that a nasal disorder is present are cyanosis when feeding that improves with crying, failure to thrive, and tachypnea.

**Choanal Atresia**

Choanal atresia occurs due to the presence of the bucconasal membrane or neural crest cell migration into the posterior nasal cavity. During development, the bucconasal membrane usually obliterates around the sixth week of gestation. If neural crest cell migration is the origin of the atresia, it can form a bony, bony-membranous, or membranous obstruction, the most common being the mixed bony-membranous.

Choanal atresia can be a unilateral or bilateral obstruction. Unilateral atresia is typically associated with a right-sided defect, and bilateral atresia is associated with CHARGE syndrome. When bilateral atresia is observed, the physician must also inspect for coloboma, heart disease, retarded CNS growth, and genital and ear abnormalities. The 'A' in CHARGE stands for atresia. Inserting a small transnasal catheter and visualizing a non-patent nasal passage via CT, endoscopy, or mirror are used to diagnose choanal atresia. The repair of the defect is typically done electively for unilateral and within the first week of life if bilateral. Transnasal and transantral endoscopic techniques are employed to repair these defects.

**Infection**

Infections of the nasal cavity are categorized as acute, recurrent-acute, or chronic. The first line treatment for these is medical management. Failure of medical management warrants consideration for surgery. Abscesses of the nasal cavity must undergo incision and drainage to prevent the spread of the infection. Other infections must be controlled immediately with combination therapy of medical and surgical treatments.

**Acute Invasive Fungal Sinusitis**

Acute invasive fungal sinusitis is an infection predominantly seen in immunocompromised states like HIV, diabetic ketoacidosis, and transplantation. The pathogens responsible for this infection are Aspergillus, Mucor, Rhizopus, and Absidia. These pathogens invade bone and soft tissue.

Mucormycosis is distinct from the others in that it can invade the surrounding vasculature leading to tissue necrosis. The necrotic tissue may present as black areas on the turbinates and palate. If not treated urgently, the patient can progress into an obtunded state and eventually, death.

The treatment for acute invasive fungal sinusitis involves surgical debridement and antifungal medications.

**Trauma**

In the setting of trauma, spontaneous or iatrogenic, surgery must be considered. CSF leaking into the nasal cavity is an indication that the roof of the nasal cavity is compromised and the cranial vault is now exposed. This can occur with a direct blow to the face or during a sinus surgery where the surgeon removes too much tissue and violates the nasal cavity boundary. Trauma can also cause profuse bleeding from the nasal cavity. When the bleeding cannot be controlled with non-invasive techniques, vascular ligation and embolization can be used. A child presenting with purulent discharge from the nose could have a foreign body in the nasal cavity. When visualization of the object is not obtained at the bedside, endoscopic surgery is utilized for retrieval.

**Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA)**

JNA is the most common vascular mass found in the nasal cavity. It is typically seen in adolescent males with recurrent epistaxis and even nasal obstruction. The site it is encountered most often is the roof of the nasal cavity near the sphenopalatine foramen. This tumor is locally aggressive but it does not metastasize. To diagnose, imaging is the preferred method; a biopsy is contraindicated due to the risk of hemorrhage. To treat JNA, the surgeon can choose between endoscopic surgery, open surgical approach, chemotherapy, and radiation, or hormonal therapy. The Fisch Classification of invasion aids in determining which treatment modality to use.

Fisch's Classification of Invasion:

- Only in the nasal cavity

- Pterygomaxillary fossa or sinuses

- Infratemporal fossa, orbit, or parasellar region

- Cavernous sinus, optic chiasm area, or pituitary fossa

Other indications for nasal surgery include cancers, nasal valve collapse, and cosmetics.
