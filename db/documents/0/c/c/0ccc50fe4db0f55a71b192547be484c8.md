When taking the history, ensure that there are no contraindications to bronchoscopy for the purpose ofÂ BAL, such as myocardial infarction within the past four weeks or unstable angina, hemodynamic instability, uncontrolled arrhythmias and refractory hypoxemia.

Taking note of smoking status and exposure history is also important to give the substantial effect smoking has on the cellular composition of BAL, namely many more neutrophils and macrophages than in nonsmokers.
