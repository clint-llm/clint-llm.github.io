A frank discussion of the risks and potential complications, based on patient's current medical status, likely cause of the obstruction, and possible postoperative outcomes. Setting expectations from the surgical perspective and understanding a patient's wishes for recovery and return to expectations is imperative. Living will and other legal documentation of patient's wishes are essential when patients are unable to communicate with the care team physically. A discussion of postoperative pain management and expectations are important as well and to use multimodal therapies to decrease the need for opioids.
