Vecuronium is prepared as a lyophilized powder because it has poor stability in solution. Therefore, it would have a very short shelf life in this form; this requires reconstituting the drug before administration.

The dose used for endotracheal intubation in the controlled setting before surgery:

- 0.08 mg/kg to 0.1 mg/kg intravenous (IV) over 60 seconds or 0.04 mg/kg to 0.06 mg/kg IV if succinylcholine was used, to allow its effects to subside before administering vecuronium.

The dose used for rapid sequence intubation:

- 0.1 mg/kg to 0.2 mg/kg IV, with the onset of intubation conditions occurring in less than 2 to 3 minutes

Maintenance for continued surgical relaxation:

- 0.01 mg/kg to 0.015 mg/kg IV to be given 20 to 45 minutes after the initial dose and every 12 to 15 minutes as needed

Maintenance for continuous Infusion (most commonly used for ICU paralysis to facilitate mechanical ventilation):

- Initial bolus dose of 0.08 mg/kg to 0.1 mg/kg IV starting 20 minutes post bolus recovery, followed by 0.05 mg/kg/hour to 0.07 mg/kg/hour IV.

No adjustment is necessary for renal impairment, although dose reduction could be considered in anephric patients, particularly in emergency situations where the anephric patient cannot be adequately prepared for non-elective surgery.
