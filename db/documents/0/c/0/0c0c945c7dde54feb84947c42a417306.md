Ketamine overdose symptoms are similar to those of PCP overdose, although the effects of ketamine tend to resolve more quickly. Physical signs and symptoms are dose-dependent through the loss of consciousness.  Patients may be unable to provide a relevant history, and clinicians should seek pertinent clinical information from witnesses. Clinicians should also maintain familiarity with street names for ketamine.

The following symptoms may be present during ketamine use and intoxication:

- General – sedation, impaired consciousness

- Head, Ear, Eyes, Nose, Throat – horizontal, vertical or rotary nystagmus, mydriasis, excessive salivation

- Cardiovascular – hypertension, tachycardia, palpitations, arrhythmias, chest pain

- Abdominal – abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, nausea, vomiting

- Neurological – altered mental status (disorientation), paranoia, dysphoria, anxiety, confusion, slurred speech, dizziness, ataxia, dysarthria, trismus, muscular rigidity, psychomotor, psychomimetic, or acute dystonic reactions

- Genitourinary – lower urinary tract symptoms

- Trauma – a thorough examination for evidence of trauma is needed as injuries secondary to ketamine intoxication can occur due to the diminished perception of pain.

Symptoms mostly unique to overdose, overly rapid infusion, or combined with other drugs include:

- Respiratory – respiratory depression, apnea

- Cardiovascular – hypotension, bradycardia, myocardial infarction

- Neurological – seizure, stupor, coma

Symptoms mostly unique to iatrogenic, intravenous delivery include

- Respiratory – respiratory depression, laryngospasm
