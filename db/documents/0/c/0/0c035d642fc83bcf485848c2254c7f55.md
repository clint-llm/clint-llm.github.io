Due to the heterogeneous presentation of coronary artery vasospasm (CAVS), it can initially be mistaken for multiple other cardiac pathologies. CAVS may or may not present with chest pain, ECG changes, and elevated cardiac biomarkers. Thus, obstructive atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, pericarditis or myopericarditis, primary arrhythmias, and stress-induced cardiomyopathy, should always be on the differential.
