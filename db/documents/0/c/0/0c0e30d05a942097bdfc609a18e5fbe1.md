Patient education is paramount in the prevention of Irukandji syndrome. Although people native to the regions endemic to Irukandji-causative species are often well aware of the dangers and necessary safety precautions, foreign travelers often fall victim to stings and therefore have a higher incidence of Irukandji syndrome. Travelers need to know that “stinger-resistant” enclosure nets, often used to prevent stings from other jellyfish species, will not prevent stings from species that cause Irukandji syndrome, due to the organisms’ small size. The most effective form of protection while swimming is a full-body lycra “stinger suit.”

Although these suits can decrease the incidence of Irukandji syndrome by decreasing the total body surface area at risk for stings, it will not eliminate their occurrence, as it only requires one sting at an exposed area to cause the full-blown clinical syndrome.
