The pathophysiology of FDG as a glucose analog used in PET imaging makes patient preparation crucial in the image acquisition process as the distribution of FDG largely follows the physiologic metabolism of glucose. Glucose and insulin, especially in excess states, act as competitive inhibitors of FDG. Patients are directed to fast for a minimum of 4 to 6 hours before FDG injection to decrease baseline insulin levels. In doing this, the highest target to background ratio images are acquired.

Blood glucose levels should be below 150-200 mg/dl to also decrease competitive inhibition. In insulin-dependent patients, administering fast-acting insulin close to FDG injection time will reduce tumor uptake and encourage physiologic uptake in adipose and muscle, which would decrease the overall tumor to background ratio. Increased physiologic uptake is still seen despite fasting in high glycolytic organs such as the myocardium and brain. Low-level homogenous uptake is typically seen in organs, including the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Proper patient preparation, including adequate documentation of patient history and current medications, allows for proper imaging acquisition and interpretation.
