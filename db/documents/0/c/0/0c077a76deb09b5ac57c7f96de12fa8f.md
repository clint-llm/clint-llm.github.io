Functional assessment of a lesion with fractional flow reserve (FFR) or instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) is appropriate in case of intermediate stenosis (40% to 70% diameter reduction angiographically), multivessel disease, serial coronary stenoses, nonculprit lesion in acute coronary syndrome, saphenous vein graft disease severity and post-intervention assessment. The various recommendations by major society guidelines are as below:

- The 2014 European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend the use of FFR to detect a hemodynamically relevant coronary lesion in stable patients when other evidence of ischemia is not available (Class I, Level of Evidence A).

- The 2012 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommends revascularization of coronary stenoses with FFR ≤ 0.8.

- The 2017 Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions guidelines recommend that if no stress test is available or if the stress results are indeterminate, the FFR ≤ 0.8 can be used to guide revascularization.
