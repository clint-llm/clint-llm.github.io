In children, bowel perforation is most likely to follow abdominal trauma. The incidence of bowel perforation is 1% to 7% in pediatric trauma patients.

In adults, ulcerative disease represents the most common etiology of bowel perforation, with duodenal ulcers causing 2- to 3-times the rate of perforation than gastric ulcers do. Perforation secondary to diverticular disease represents up to 15% of cases. In the geriatric population, perforated appendicitis represents the most common cause of perforation.

The overall incidence of perforation from colonoscopy has been reported, on average, around 2% with higher rates during colonoscopy requiring therapeutic interventions.
