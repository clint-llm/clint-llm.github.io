Neurofibromatosis type 1 is caused by a loss of function mutation, either de novo or inherited, on the neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene. It is located on band 17q11.2 and codes for neurofibromin. Neurofibromin is a tumor suppressor that functions in the RAS/MAPK and mTOR pathways. Mosaicism can occur, resulting in the segmental, generalized, or gonadal NF1 gene. Segmental NF1 gene has pigment changes, tumors, or both that are limited to one or more body segments. Generalized NF1  gene appears similar to classic NF1 but does not have the NF1 gene mutation. Gonadal NF1 gene occurs when the mutation only affects the ova or sperm.

NF2 gene is caused by a loss of function mutation of the NF2  gene. It is located on band 22q12 and codes for merlin. Merlin is a cell membrane protein that is also a tumor suppressor that functions in the PI3kinase/Akt, Raf/MEK/ERK, and mTOR pathways.
