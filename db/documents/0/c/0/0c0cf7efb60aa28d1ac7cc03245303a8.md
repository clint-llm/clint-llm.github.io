First-generation antipsychotics are dopamine receptor antagonists (DRA) and are known as typical antipsychotics. They include phenothiazines (trifluoperazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, acetophenazine, triflupromazine, mesoridazine), butyrophenones (haloperidol), thioxanthenes (thiothixene, chlorprothixene), dibenzoxazepines (loxapine), dihydroindoles (molindone), and diphenylbutylpiperidines (pimozide).

Second-generation antipsychotics are serotonin-dopamine antagonists and are also known as atypical antipsychotics. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 12 atypical antipsychotics as of the year 2016. They are risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole, paliperidone, asenapine, lurasidone, iloperidone, cariprazine, brexpiprazole, and clozapine.

**Indications**

- Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective disorders: First and second-generation antipsychotics (except clozapine) are indicated for the treatment of an acute episode of psychoses and maintenance therapy of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders. First-generation antipsychotics are better for treating positive symptoms of schizophrenia, e.g., hallucinations, delusions, among others. They also decrease the risk of a repeat episode of psychosis. Second-generation antipsychotics treat both positive symptoms and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, e.g.,  withdrawal, ambivalence, among others, and are known to reduce relapse rates.

- Acute Mania: First-generation antipsychotics are effective in the treatment of acute mania with psychotic symptoms. All second-generation antipsychotics except clozapine can also be used as a treatment of symptoms of acute mania. Antipsychotics are used with mood stabilizers like lithium, valproic acid, or carbamazepine initially, and then after symptoms stabilize can be gradually decreased and withdrawn.

- Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic features: First or second-generation antipsychotics, along with an antidepressant, is the treatment of choice for depression with psychotic features. Olanzapine and fluoxetine, as a combination therapy, have FDA approval for treatment-resistant depression.

- Delusional Disorder: First-generation antipsychotics are indicated in the treatment of delusional disorder and paranoia associated with personality disorders.

- Severe Agitation: Severely agitated, irritable, hostile, and hyperactive patients can be treated with a short-term course of first-generation antipsychotics irrespective of the etiology of the behavioral disturbance. Second-generation antipsychotics can also be used for treating acute agitation. Antipsychotics can also be used in children with severe autism exhibiting behavioral disturbances though repeatedly giving antipsychotics is not preferred. Risperidone and olanzapine are useful for controlling aggression in children.

- Tourette Disorder: Haloperidol and pimozide are the antipsychotics most commonly used for this syndrome. Tourette disorder is an off-label indication for second-generation antipsychotics.

- Borderline Personality Disorder: This type of personality disorder can have symptoms of psychosis and paranoia. Both first and second-generation antipsychotics are used for the treatment of these symptoms.

- Dementia and Delirium: A low dose of high potency first-generation antipsychotics like haloperidol is recommended for the treatment of agitation in delirium and dementia. It is essential to use caution in elderly patients as the antimuscarinic effects can cause significant adverse effects in this population. Second-generation antipsychotics can also be used for treating behavioral disturbances in dementia. Off-Label use of second-generation antipsychotics is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related dementia.

- Substance-induced psychotic disorder: In cases of severe psychosis secondary to substance use, antipsychotics can be used to control agitation symptoms. Caution is necessary when using first-generation antipsychotics in alcohol withdrawal and phencyclidine intoxication.

- Childhood Schizophrenia: Recent studies have shown the benefit of clozapine in treating early-onset schizophrenia.

**Other Indications**

Huntington disease, Parkinson disease, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder are some other conditions where antipsychotics are an option though it is not the primary drug of choice.

**Clozapine**

This drug is the agent of choice when the patient has failed multiple trials of standard antipsychotic therapies. Clozapine is also useful in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. Indications for the use of clozapine include treatment-resistant mania, severe psychotic features, obsessive-compulsive disorder, pervasive developmental disorders, childhood autism, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, and suicidal patient with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
