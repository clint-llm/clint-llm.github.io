- Diffuse esophageal spasm

- Esophageal cancer

- Eosinophilic esophagitis

- Hiatal hernia

- Parkinson disease

- Zenker diverticulum

- Multiple sclerosis

- Paterson-Kelly syndrome

- Dysphagia lusoria is a type dysphagia that develops in childhood, due to compression of the esophagus by vascular abnormality. Usually, there is an aberrant right subclavian artery arising from the left side of the aortic arch, or a double aortic arch, or other rare anomalies.
