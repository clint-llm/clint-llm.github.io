First described in the 1930s, trochanteric bursitis management typically includes activity modification, physical therapy (PT), weight loss, corticosteroid injection, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs).

In terms of physiotherapy, exercise is promoted early in treatment for tendinopathy. Eccentric exercise (EE) is recognized as a superior approach when compared to a generic exercise regimen. In eccentric exercise, the main goal is to identify an appropriate workload, thus promoting safe exercise participation, thus encouraging adequate muscle healing, musculoskeletal health, and general fitness. Research has shown that the gradual introduction of eccentric training results in large strength improvement in older adults without concomitant adverse changes in clinical markers of muscle damage (serum creatine kinase, tumor necrosis factor).

In some patients, pain persists despite conservative treatment and time. These refractory cases may require surgical intervention such as bursectomy, iliotibial band (ITB) lengthening techniques, trochanteric reduction osteotomy, or gluteal tendon repair.
