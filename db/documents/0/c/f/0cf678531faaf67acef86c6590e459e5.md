Failure of retinal pigment epithelial development in the area of a retino-choroidal coloboma may lead to hypoplasia of the choroid and sclera with formation of a staphyloma. If the fovea is involved, vision may be significantly affected. On the other hand, even with large choroidoretinal colobomas, if the fovea is not involved, vision is relatively preserved.

Children who have symptomatic unilateral optic disc abnormalities generally present during the preschool years with sensory esotropia. Visual acuity may be unaffected as in optic disc pit, or optic disc drusen. Optic nerve colobomas have been associated with microphthalmos, iris coloboma, ciliary coloboma, lens notching, retinal detachment, neovascular membranes, and macular holes. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments can develop secondary to breaks in the thin membrane that overlies the coloboma.
