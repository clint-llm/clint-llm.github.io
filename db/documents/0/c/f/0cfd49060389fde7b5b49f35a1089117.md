Pelvic kidney refers to inappropriate kidney ascent during week six to eight of development. As a result, the kidney remains in the pelvis instead of the abdomen. Because pelvic kidney rarely presents with symptoms, proper imagining must be performed prior to surgery in the pelvic area to rule out this anomaly. Pelvic kidney will also present with other anatomical variations in the vasculature that must merit consideration.
