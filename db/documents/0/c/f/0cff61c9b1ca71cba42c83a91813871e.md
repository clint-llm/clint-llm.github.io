There have been several high-quality studies as well as recommendations from the American Heart Association in utilizing procainamide as a viable option to terminate several different arrhythmias. However, procainamide should be used carefully in inpatient settings as it has several side effects that require monitoring. An interprofessional team that includes the treating physician, nurse, and pharmacist can help achieve the best possible outcomes. Care requires coordination between all interprofessional healthcare team members to ensure that everyone involved in the patient's care takes appropriate measures during therapy with procainamide. Cardiovascular monitoring, serial electrocardiograms, and frequent reassessments of the patient’s clinical status will ensure safety during usage. Instruction should be given for possible cardioversion if hypotension, bradycardia, or clinical deterioration occurs.

The coordinated efforts of an interprofessional team will optimize therapeutic results with procainamide while minimizing adverse events. [Level 5]
