Aminocaproic acid is of low acute toxicity. Research has found no fetal abnormalities in teratogenic in-vitro studies given aminocaproic acid doses up to 5000 mcg/kg/day. Retinal changes have been reported in dogs after receiving aminocaproic acid by mouth over one year in doses approximately seven-fold higher than the maximum recommended in-vivo dose. A significant concern is whether treatment with aminocaproic acid predisposes patients to thrombosis and intravascular coagulation. There are isolated reports of arterial or venous thrombosis, but underlying thrombotic comorbidity is present in each case.

Some cases of acute overdose of aminocaproic acid administered intravenously are documented. The toxicities range from transient hypotension to severe fatal acute renal failure. One patient with a history of seizures and brain tumors has experienced seizures after receiving an 8-gram bolus IV aminocaproic acid injection. There are reports of acute renal failure after 12 gm while other patients have no symptoms and tolerated doses up to 100 grams. There is no available antidote for use in the setting of aminocaproic acid toxicity. There are case reports that have described the use of tissue plasminogen activator for suspected antifibrinolytic-induced intraoperative thromboembolic events.
