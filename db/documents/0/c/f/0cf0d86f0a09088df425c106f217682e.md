Cholesterol can be introduced into the blood through the digestion of dietary fat via chylomicrons. However, since cholesterol has an important role in cellular function, it can also be directly synthesized by each cell in the body. The synthesis of cholesterol begins from Acetyl-CoA and follows a series of complex reactions that will not be covered in this article. A primary location for this process is the liver, which accounts for most de-novo cholesterol synthesis.

Since cholesterol is mostly a lipophilic molecule, it does not dissolve well in the blood. For this reason, it is packaged in lipoproteins that have phospholipid and apolipoprotein.

Within the cell, cholesterol has several vital functions. Some of the primary uses for cholesterol are related to the cell membrane. It is required for the normal structure of the membrane; it contributes to its fluidity.
