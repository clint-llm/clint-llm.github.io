Myotonic dystrophy should be suspected in patients with symptoms of weakness, a suspected family history DM, and characteristic physical exam findings. Genetic testing for CTG repeats has replaced other modalities in the diagnosis of DM. Other diagnostic testing modalities may often be obtained prior to genetic testing and involves serum creatinine kinase, hepatobiliary function testing, muscle biopsies, and electrocardiographic findings for cardiomyopathy.

**Genetic testing**

Genetic testing is performed to reveal the presence of an expanded CTG repeat in the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene and establish a definitive diagnosis. Alleles containing 5 to 34 CTG repeats are normal, and between 35 and 50 are mutable normal alleles (permutation alleles). Demonstrating full penetrance alleles of greater than 50 CTG repeats confirms the diagnosis associated with clinical manifestations. If this testing is negative and clinical suspicion is high, genetic testing specific for CCTG repeat in the ZNF9 (CNBP- Cellular nucleic acid-binding protein) gene should be pursued.

**Serum Creatine Kinase**

In patients with mild disease, it may be mildly elevated but is typically normal.

**Hepatobiliary Function**

Elevations in the hepatobiliary enzymes alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), serum aspartate aminotransferase, and serum alanine aminotransferase can be seen in 30% to 50% of patients. Elevations do not correlate with the severity of muscle weakness, disease duration, or serum levels of creatine kinase.

**Electrodiagnostic Testing**

Electrodiagnostic (EDX) testing has been the modality of choice for diagnosis prior to molecular testing. It has the capability to diagnose patients who are clinically asymptomatic or have subtle findings.

**Overview of Electrodiagnostic Findings of Myotonia**

- Sustained runs of positive sharp waves

- Trains of negative spikes

- Amplitudes and frequency that wax and wane producing a sound comparable to a dive bomber. This occurs due to rapid, spontaneous fluctuations in the membrane potential of muscle fibers.

**Muscle Biopsy**

Muscle biopsy typically reveals a morphological picture of a myopathy. The majority of biopsy findings are seen in proximal muscle groups, most notably in the biceps brachii and tibialis anterior muscles.
