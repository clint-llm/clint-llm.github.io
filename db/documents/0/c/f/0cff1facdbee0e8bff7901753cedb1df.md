The core management of Balint syndrome relies on rehabilitation and reducing the extent of disability to a bare minimum. In some instances such as infarction, PRES, and infectious etiologies, secondary preventive measures can be employed to reduce the risk of recurrence. There are different approaches in occupational rehabilitation that have been proposed to help individuals limit their disabling symptoms. The adaptive approach is where the intact abilities are used effectively to reduce the extent of disability caused by the symptoms. The remedial approach aims to repair the damaged areas of the brain by training them in perceptual skills. The third and complex approach is a multi-context approach that involves strategic learning in an environment with multiple tasks.
