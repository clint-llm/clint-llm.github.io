Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) comprises 15% to 20% of breast cancer cases. Ductal carcinoma in situ represents cancer cells that have not broken through the basement membrane. One-third of ductal carcinoma in situ can develop invasive disease. Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer. Lobular carcinoma carries similar prognosis as ductal carcinoma. Medullary, mucinous, and tubular carcinomas have a better prognosis.
