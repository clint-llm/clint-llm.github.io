Chokes, or pulmonary decompression sickness, is a rare but severe manifestation of decompression sickness (DCS) that can be rapidly fatal even with appropriate treatment.Â DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness.

Decompression sickness, also called divers' disease, the bends, aerobullosis, and caisson disease is caused by dissolved gases emerging from solution as bubbles inside the body tissues during decompression. Decompression sickness often occurs soon after a decompression ascent from diving, emerging from a caisson, decompression from saturation, flying in an unpressurized aircraft at high altitude, and extravehicular activity from spacecraft.
