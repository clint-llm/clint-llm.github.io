- Centipedes are predatory venomous arthropods. While thousands of centipede species exist, very few are thought to be clinically significant to humans, as many centipedes are too shy or too small to cause noteworthy damage to people.

- Centipede venom contains a diverse pharmacologic combination of toxins that cause severe pain as well as the potential for other significant side effects, including anaphylaxis, cardiac ischemia, and neurotoxicity.

- Treatment of centipede bites involves pain control, local wound care, and tetanus update. Systemic effect treatment typically involves supportive care or focused treatment of specific complications. There is no antidote for centipede venom. Overall prognosis after a centipede bite is excellent.
