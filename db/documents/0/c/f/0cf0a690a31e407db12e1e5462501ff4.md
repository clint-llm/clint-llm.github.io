Hyperthyroidism is a common thyroid disorder. "Hyperthyroidism" defines a syndrome associated with excess thyroid hormone production.

Hyperthyroidism can be overt or subclinical. Overt hyperthyroidism is defined as low or suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels with elevated triiodothyronine (T3) levels and/or elevated thyroxine (T4) levels.
