A study conducted in US emergency departments looking at the frequency and trends of lacerations between 1992 and 2002 found that lacerations represent 8% of cases encountered in emergency departments, with 28% of these lacerations being in the face. Roughly two-thirds of the patients presenting with lacerations were male. Facial lacerations were more common in children. However, even though the number of patients visiting emergency departments has gradually increased over this period, visits for lacerations have declined over the same period.
