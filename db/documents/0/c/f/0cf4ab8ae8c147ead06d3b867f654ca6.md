The pathophysiology of oral mucositis due to radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy-chemotherapy is thought to be due to a complex process that starts with injury to the tissue in a five-phase model, as suggested by Sonis.

The five stages of OM induced by RT and chemotherapy occur consecutively, including initiation, signaling, amplification, ulceration, and healing. Firstly, tissue injury is caused by radiotherapy or chemotherapy, resulting in the death of the basal epithelial cells and the formation of reactive oxygen species.
