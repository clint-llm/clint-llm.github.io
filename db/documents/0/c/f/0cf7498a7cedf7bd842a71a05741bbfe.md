Daunorubicin causes cardiotoxicity by forming complexes with topoisomerase IIb enzyme in cardiomyocytes. This activity is the same as when the drug forms complexes with topoisomerase IIa in tumor cells and can result in mitochondrial damage with subsequent myocardial cell death. Dexrazoxane is a cardio-protectant agent. Research has shown it to decrease the incidence and severity of cardiotoxicity when given from the first dose of anthracyclines without reducing the effectiveness of the chemotherapeutic agent. It acts by inhibiting the isomer of topoisomerase and decrease the free radical damage by chelating free iron.
