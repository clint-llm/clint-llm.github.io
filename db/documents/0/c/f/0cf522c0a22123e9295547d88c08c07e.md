The extensor pollicis longus receives vascular supply from many arterial branches, described below, going from proximal to distal

- Proximal EPL to the musculotendinous junction (before a synovial tendon sheath surrounds it): supplied by the anterior interosseous artery and its muscular branches.

- Distal to the musculotendinous junction, in the proximal tendon where the synovial tendon sheath starts: the posterior ramus of the anterior interosseous artery gives off branches that penetrate the synovial tendon sheath and supply the tendon.

- Two to three branches of the posterior ramus of the anterior interosseous artery supply the edges of the tendon, while one branch sometimes supplies the middle of the tendon.

- In the distal tendon: the dorsal carpal arch (made up of the dorsal carpal branches of the ulnar and radial arteries, which anastomose with the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries) gives off two arterial branches, one which goes to the periphery of the tendon, and one that can be found by the end of the synovial tendon sheath.

- Once the two arterial branches reach the tendon, they form a “T” shape, which gives rise to smaller branches that are descending towards the palmar surface of the tendon and to ascending branches that come back dorsally.
- The arterial branches of the distal and proximal tendon anastomose.

- The distal portion of the EPL tendon that crosses the first metacarpal, where a synovial tendon sheath does not cover it: is supplied directly by the radial artery.

- The distal portion of the EPL tendon that runs along the phalanges: receives supply from the first dorsal metacarpal artery’s digital branch, which originates from the radial artery.
