Multiple common clinical scenarios can cause damage to the nerves of the shoulder and upper limb, which this activity discusses individually below. Any nerve could be damaged in cases of direct trauma and may be diagnosed clinically based on the sensory pattern of the nerve as outlined previously.

**Supraclavicular Nerve**

Damage to the supraclavicular nerve branches is a common complication after a clavicle open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). It also can be seen in open clavicle fractures or other trauma, or when compressed due to muscle spasm of the cervical muscular along its course.

**Axillary Nerve**

Damage to the axillary nerve and its cutaneous branch can present in anterior shoulder dislocation or surgical neck of the humerus fractures.

**Musculocutaneous Nerve**

Damage to the musculocutaneous nerve is relatively uncommon but can occur with direct trauma such as a stab wound along its course – most often as it passes through the axilla. It can also incur damage during a deltopectoral surgical approach.

**Radial Nerve**

The radial nerve is particularly disposed to in compression type injuries and humerus fractures due to its proximity to the humerus as it passes through the arm. Fractures to the humerus can cause severe injury requiring repair. It can also suffer an injury due to improper and prolonged use of crutches causing continued pressure on the medial side of the arm or axilla.

**Median Nerve**

The most common injury to the median nerve is at the carpal tunnel, which is due to compression of the median nerve as it passes underneath the transverse carpal ligament at the wrist. It also can be injured at its passage through the cubital fossa from dislocation of the elbow or an increase in fluid or edema around the elbow secondary to trauma. A distinguishing feature between compression at the elbow compared to compression at the carpal tunnel is sensory involvement over the thenar eminence. In cases of carpal tunnel, the sensation over the thenar eminence is spared due branching of the palmar cutaneous branch before reaching the carpal tunnel. The palmar cutaneous branch passes over the transverse carpal ligament, so would not be affected in carpal tunnel syndrome. Although sensation over the thenar eminence is intact in carpal tunnel syndrome, atrophy of the thenar muscles can be seen in severe cases since the recurrent palmer branch providing motor innervation splits after the nerve passes under the transverse carpal ligament.

**Ulnar Nerve**

There are multiple sites of compression for the ulnar nerve, which can complicate its diagnosis. From proximal to distal, ulnar nerve compression can occur at the anterior scalene muscles, pectoralis minor muscle, the arcade of Struthers just proximal to the elbow, flexor carpi ulnaris, or as it passes through the tunnel of Guyon. At the elbow, a clinical scenario may be prolonged leaning on the elbow or overuse injuries from exercising. At the wrist, resting of the ulnar side of the wrist during prolonged typing, ganglion cyst formation, or repetitive use of a hammer can cause damage to the nerve.

**Medial Brachial and Antebrachial Nerves**

These purely sensory nerves are rarely associated with specific pathology but suffer damage from direct trauma.

**Intercostal Brachial Nerve**

Commonly injured during mastectomies or axillary lymph node dissection secondary to breast cancer. Even if it is not injured directly during surgery, post-surgical scar tissue formation can cause compression. Surgeons sometimes harvest this nerve as a donor nerve graft.

**Dermatomes**

The nerve roots that supply the shoulder and upper limb can directly be affected by pathology around the spine in cases of severe osteoarthritis, degenerative disk disease, or ruptured disk. The pattern of sensory changes is observable at the locations noted above in the Structure and Function section. Sensory lesions from the nerve roots can be distinguished from distal pathology due to the pattern of sensory distribution, although it can be difficult, especially in cases where multiple nerve roots are affected.

**Brachial Plexus Injury**

Two characteristic conditions associated with brachial plexus injury are Erb's palsy and Klumpke's palsy. The sensory pattern of distribution is typical to the dermatome associated with the nerve roots.

- Erb palsy is an upper brachial plexus lesion which usually affects the C5 and C6 nerve roots. It is associated with downward trauma over the shoulder or traumatic vaginal deliveries.

- Klumpke palsy is a lower brachial plexus lesion affecting C8 and T1. It is associated with breaking fall from a height by grabbing onto an object with the arm.
