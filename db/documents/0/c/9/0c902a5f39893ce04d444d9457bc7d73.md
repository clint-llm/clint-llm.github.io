The diagnosis and management of osteochondritis dessecans is with an interprofessional team that consists of a radiologist, orthopedic surgeon, physical therapist, nurse practitioner, and primary caregiver. The patientâ€™s age, time of presentation, the severity of symptoms, and stability of the lesion will dictate treatment. Several systems to classify the lesions have been developed, with the important feature being the degree of overlying cartilage involvement and mobility of the lesion fragment. In stable lesions, conservative management is preferred with immobilization and protected weight-bearing for a length of time, depending on which joint is affected. Patients with stable lesions that fail conservative treatment may be treated with drilling techniques (retroarticular or transarticular drilling). These procedures have shown healing rates and symptom improvement ranging from 92% to 100%, with transarticular drilling having slightly higher success rates. When lesions are unstable or displaced, surgical intervention is necessary, typically performed arthroscopically. In general, the outcomes of stable lesions are better than unstable lesions.
