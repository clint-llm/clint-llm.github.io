The prevalence of splenic ruptures is not widely reported in the literature. The mechanism of the majority of traumatic ruptures continues to be motor vehicle injury, followed by direct abdominal blows. Sports such as football, hockey, and bicycling increase the risk of abdominal, and, therefore, splenic injury and rupture. One study suggests that traumatic splenic ruptures are more likely to occur in males (2:1 male to female) in ages ranging from 18 to 34 years.

The following are six major causes of non-traumatic rupture

- Neoplasm, 30%

- Infectious, 30%

- Inflammatory disease, 15%

- Medication and medical treatment, 10%

- Mechanical causes,Â 7%

- Idiopathic, 7%
