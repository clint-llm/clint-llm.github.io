Muscarinic agonists are parasympathomimetic drugs and are indicated for ileus, urinary retention, glaucoma, Alzheimer disease, and other symptoms. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and possible adverse effects of muscarinic agonists and how the interprofessional team can work together to improve outcomes using these agents. This activity will also highlight the different mechanisms of action of different muscarinic receptors in different parts of the body.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of muscarinic agonists.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of muscarinic agonists.
- Outline the appropriate monitoring for muscarinic agonists.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance muscarinic agonists and improve outcomes.
