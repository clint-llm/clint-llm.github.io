The pathophysiology of LS plexopathy varies based on the etiology:

- Trauma - direct injury or traction on the plexus

- Tumor - direct infiltration by the tumor or metastasis, intra-neural lymphomatosis, the perineural spread of prostate cancer

- Radiation - This leads to endothelial damage leading to chronic inflammatory cell migration and a state of fibrosis, followed by an irreversible state of microvascular injury and ischemic damage

- Hematoma - Direct compression

- Diabetic and non-diabetic LS plexopathies - caused by inflammatory or microvascular changes
