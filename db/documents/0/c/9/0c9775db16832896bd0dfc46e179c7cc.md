**"Obese Microbiome"**

It has been suggested that specific microbiota patterns are associated with obesity, referred to as the "obese microbiome." While the exact mechanisms of how the "obese microbiome" contributes to the pathophysiology of obesity are not yet clear, it is reported that compared to lean individuals, patients with obesity are found to have less biodiversity of gut microbiota.Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus sakei were found in higher numbers in patients with higher BMI in adult humans.

Intervention studies involving mice show the administration of A. mucinophila decreases adiposity in experimental models.correlations of specific microbiota populations with obesity, not causation. Thus, more research needs to be done involving human interventional studies to find which gut microbiota result in the phenotype of obesity.
