Patients need to be educated that hyperpigmentation of the skin may not solely be a skin condition and should be evaluated further, especially if it occurs in middle-aged to elderly patients. Patients need to follow up with their primary care physicians regarding any abnormal pigmentation in their skin. Hyperpigmentation of the skin due to acanthosis nigricans can be treated and sometimes resolves with adequate treatment of the skin condition or treatment of the underlying condition. Patients need to be educated on identifying the risk factors and signs and symptoms of a malignant condition associated with acanthosis nigricans. Depression and low self-esteem can occur in patients with acanthosis nigricans and diagnosis and psychological treatment should be started early in these patients.
