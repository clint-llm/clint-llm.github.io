Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a minimally invasive procedure to open blocked or stenosed coronary arteries allowing unobstructed blood flow to the myocardium. The blockages occur because of lipid-rich plaque within the arteries, diminishing blood flow to the myocardium. The accumulation of lipid-rich plaque in the arteries is known as atherosclerosis. When atherosclerosis affects the coronary arteries, the disorder is known as coronary artery disease. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, complications of PTCA and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with CAD.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for PTCA.
- Describe the contraindications for PTCA.
- Review the complications of PTCA.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients undergoing PTCA.
