The ITB, being a tendinous extension of the tensor fascia lata (TFL), shares the same arterial supply:

- Ascending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery (LFCA)

- Superior gluteal artery (SGA)

The LFCA traverses the TFL as a single branch from the profundus femoris arterial system usually 6-10 cm distal from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) directly into the muscle belly.

The SGA is the largest branch of the posterior division of the internal iliac artery and exits the greater sciatic foramen where it divides into superficial and deep branches. The latter of which also providesÂ collateral arterial blood supply to the TFL in addition to the gluteus medius and minimus muscles.
