Refsum disease is a rare and complex disease. Managing this disease requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that includes nurses, laboratory technologists, dietitians, and physicians in different specialties. While the internist is almost always involved in the care of patients, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include an ophthalmologist, neurologist, geneticist, nephrologist, dermatologist, cardiologist, and audiologist. Frequent plasma levels of phytanic acid should be measured. Routine ophthalmological and cardiological evaluations are done to identify visual and cardiac problems.

Collaboration shared decision making and communication are essential factors for best patient care outcomes. The interprofessional care given to the patient must have an integrated care approach compounded with an evidence-based strategy to evaluate and manage the patient with Refsum disease.
