Phospholipase A2 inhibitors ( PLA2) have been proposed as anticancer drugs because inhibition of PLA2 could theoretically decrease the production of several metabolites implicated in cancer progression. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptors' role has been discussed in many study groups to prevent metastasis of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and melanoma to the lung.

Long non-coding RNAs can be potential therapeutic or diagnostic markers for lung cancer metastasis.

Bergamottin is a naturally occurring furanocoumarin and is known to inhibit the growth of tumor cells. It can block EMT and cause downregulation of fibronectin, vimentin, N-cadherin, twist and snail expression, and cause upregulation of occludin and E-cadherin. The treatment also inhibits multiple oncogenic cascades, such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR. The results demonstrate the possible antimetastatic activity of bergamottin against lung cancer cells.

Fronodoside A, a triterpenoid glycoside isolated from Atlantic cucumber, has been studied to prevent the progression of lung cancer invasion, metastasis in-vivo and in-vitro. Research has found it to potentiate the effects of cisplatin chemotherapy agents.
