Transgender patients are at high risk for behavioral health conditions, with 39% of respondents to the USTS having reported serious psychological distress within the month before completing the survey, and 40% demonstrated an attempted suicide at some point in the past. Verbal (46%), physical (9%), and sexual assault (47%) are extremely common.

Discrimination occurs in many different domains as well, such as wrongful termination/denial of promotion (30%), eviction or denial of lease/mortgage (23%), lack of family support (18%), rejection by their religious communities (19%), and mistreatment by law enforcement (58%), with transgender individuals of color being even more likely to suffer discrimination.

While some third-party payers consider facial surgery for gender transition to be elective at best or cosmetic at worst, these operations have the potential to be hugely beneficial to patients, and many surgeons consider them to be medically necessary for this reason. In fact, facial features are the most important external determinants of gender, in that transgender women who have undergone facial surgery are more likely to be identified consistently as female by bystanders, and as a result, are less likely to be singled out or victimized as gender non-conforming individuals, thus making them safer from physical and emotional harm.
