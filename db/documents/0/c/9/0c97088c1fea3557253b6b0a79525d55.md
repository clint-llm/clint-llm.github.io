Ipecac irritates the stomach lining and chemically stimulates the CRTZ (chemoreceptor trigger zone)  in the medulla oblongata of the central nervous system to induce near-immediate vomiting. Historically, this was the rationale for its recommendation in the management of orally ingested poisons. Over time, however, clinical research began to call this practice into question.  Syrup of ipecac has subsequently been shown to be inferior to activated charcoal in reducing absorption in toxic ingestion.  Its use often delays more effective decontamination methods.

In 1997, the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology position statement recommended against the routine use of syrup of ipecac. "Syrup of ipecac should not be administered routinely in the management of poisoned patients. In experimental studies, the amount of marker removed by ipecac was highly variable and diminished with time. There is no evidence from clinical studies that ipecac improves the outcome of poisoned patients, and its routine administration in the emergency department should be abandoned. There are insufficient data to support or exclude ipecac administration soon after poison ingestion. Ipecac may delay the administration or reduce the effectiveness of activated charcoal, oral antidotes, and whole bowel irrigation. Clinicians should not administer ipecac to a patient who has a decreased level or impending loss of consciousness or who has ingested a corrosive substance or hydrocarbon with high aspiration potential."

The 2013 position paper update on the use of syrup of ipecac remained guarded: "... there remains no convincing evidence from clinical studies that ipecac improves the outcome of poisoned patients. Furthermore, the availability of ipecac is rapidly diminishing. Conclusions. The routine administration of ipecac at the site of ingestion or in the emergency department should be avoided. Ipecac may delay the administration or reduce the effectiveness of activated charcoal, oral antidotes, and whole bowel irrigation. There is not sufficient evidence to warrant any change in the previous Ipecac position papers. There are, however, insufficient data to support or exclude ipecac administration soon after ingestion of some specific poisons in rare situations."

This final statement has caused some consternation and remains controversial. Some experts advocate only for its use in rare situations where the benefits outweigh the risks of severe toxicity to the patient and only in the setting of recent ingestion (60 minutes), with no contraindications to use and without delaying definitive treatment. Generally, its use in toxicology has been abandoned.
