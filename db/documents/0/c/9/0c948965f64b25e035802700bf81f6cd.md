- Poikilocytosis is a term for abnormal-shaped red blood cells in the blood.

- Poikilocytosis refers to an increase in abnormal red blood cells of any shape that makes up 10% or more of the total population. Poikilocytes can be flat, elongated, teardrop-shaped, crescent-shaped, sickle-shaped, or can have pointy or thorn-like projections, or may have other abnormal features.

- Poikilocytosis can be due to inherited or acquired causes. Inherited conditions are due to a genetic mutation. Acquired conditions usually develop later in life.

- The most common etiologies of poikilocytosis are sickle cell disease, thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis, iron deficiency anemia, megaloblastic anemia, and liver disease.

- The most common types of poikilocytosis are sickle cells, target cells, spherocytes, elliptocytes, ovalocytes, echinocytes, and acanthocytes.

- They are usually identified on the blood smear and play an important role in diagnosing the underlying cause and its management.

- Treatment and prognosis vary depending on the cause of the poikilocytosis.
