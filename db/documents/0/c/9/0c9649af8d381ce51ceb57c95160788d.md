Ectodermal dysplasias form a diverse group of inherited disorders characterized by a congenital defect in two or more ectodermal structures, one of which involves hair, teeth, nails, or sweat glands. Other organs derived from embryonic ectoderm include mammary glands, CNS, external ear, melanocytes, cornea, conjunctiva, and lacrimal apparatus. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of ectodermal dysplasia and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of ectodermal dysplasia medical conditions and emergencies.
- Describe the appropriate steps in the evaluation of ectodermal dysplasia.
- Summarize the management options available for ectodermal dysplasia.
- Review some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance ectodermal dysplasia and improve outcomes.
