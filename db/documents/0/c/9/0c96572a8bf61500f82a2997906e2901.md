This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of parathyroid cancer and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of parathyroid cancer.
- Describe the pathophysiology of parathyroid cancer.
- Summarize the treatment options for parathyroid cancer.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by parathyroid cancer.
