The patient complains of unilateral blurred vision, micropsia, metamorphopsia, relative scotoma, and color vision disturbances. There is temporary hyperopia. Vision ranges from 6/9-6/60, though in most cases, it is better than 6/12. On examination, there is a well defined circular or oval area of neurosensory detachment over the posterior pole. Occasionally, a yellowish feathered-edge subretinal material (presumably fibrin) and PED may also be seen.

The acute episode generally resolves within 3 to 6 months. If fluid persists beyond this period, it is called “chronic CSCR.” It is generally seen in older patients or those receiving long term corticosteroids.
