Anatomy involves studying the various wall motion abnormalities and understanding the vascular territories associated with various segments. The segments are studied in six views: the parasternal long axis, the parasternal short axis at the levels of the mitral valve, papillary muscles, and apex, apical four chambers, apical two chambers. The scoring system is based on if the wall motion is normal, hypokinetic, akinetic, or dyskinetic. Based on the wall motion, a score of 1 to 4 is assigned. The American Society of Echocardiography uses a 17-segment model for wall motion abnormalities.

**Parasternal long axis (PLAX) view**

Segments seen in parasternal long-axis view:

- Basal anteroseptal and mid anteroseptal on the septum: supplied by the left anterior descending artery

- Basal inferolateral and mid inferolateral: supplied by the right coronary artery or left circumflex artery

**Apical four chambers (A4C) view**

Segments seen in apical four-chamber view:

- Apical cap: supplied by left anterior descending artery, left circumflex artery

- The apical septum, mid inferoseptal: supplied by the left anterior descending artery

- Basal inferoseptal: supplied by right coronary artery

- Apical lateral, mid anterolateral, basal anterolateral: supplied by left circumflex artery

**Apical two chambers (A2C) view**

Segments saw in apical two-chamber view:

- Basal inferior, mid inferior: supplied by right coronary artery

- Apical anterior: supplied by a right coronary artery or left anterior descending artery

- Apical inferior, basal anterior, mid anterior: supplied by the left anterior descending artery

**Parasternal short-axis (SAX) view**

Segments seen in parasternal short-axis view at the papillary muscle level:

- Mid anteroseptal, mid anterior supplied by the left anterior descending artery

- Mid inferoseptal: supplied by right coronary artery

- Mid anterolateral, mid inferolateral: supplied by left circumflex artery

- Mid inferior: supplied by right coronary artery
