The differential diagnosis for exudative retinal detachment is large. Differentiation of exudative, tractional, and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is of utmost importance and is often achieved through clinical examination alone. In cases of diagnostic query, ultrasonography, fundus fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography, and various laboratory investigations are required for correct diagnosis and treatment. Appropriate and timely intervention by the treating physician may thus help to improve the visual and systemic status of the patient.
