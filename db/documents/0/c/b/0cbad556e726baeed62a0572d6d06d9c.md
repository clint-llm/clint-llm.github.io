Following viral entry from any route (oropharynx, nasopharynx, or intradermal), the mpox virus replicates at the inoculation site and then spreads to local lymph nodes. Next, an initial viremia leads to viral spread and the seeding of other organs. This represents the incubation period, typically lasting 7 to 14 days with an upper limit of 21 days.

Symptom onset correlates with a secondary viremia leading to 1 to 2 days of prodromal symptoms such as fever and lymphadenopathy before lesions appear. Infected patients may be contagious at this time. Lesions start in the oropharynx and then appear on the skin. Serum antibodies are often detectable by the time lesions appear.
