For bariatric surgery, the patient must be evaluated by an interprofessional team before being a surgical candidate. This team includes a nutritionist, a psychiatric specialist, the surgical team, the nursing staff, and the primary care clinician. It is recommended but not required to conduct a preoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy before laparoscopic adjusted gastric band surgery.

A clinician must be familiar with bariatric procedures and their complications. Bariatric surgery has proven highly efficacious in the treatment of obesity. The laparoscopic adjusted gastric band procedure is rarely done. However, many patients have previously undergone this surgery and may present with complications unique to this procedure. These pathologies must be understood, recognized, properly evaluated, and treated promptly.
