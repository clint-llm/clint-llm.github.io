The diagnosis and management of deep neck infections are done with an interprofessional team that can include an anesthesiologist, infectious disease consultant, ENT surgeon, radiologist, thoracic surgeon, and an intensivist. The monitoring of these patients is done by ICU nurses. Deep neck infections have the potential to cause many complications that can be life-threatening, hence prompt treatment is necessary. The prognosis depends on the age of the patient, the severity of the infection, immune status, response to antibiotics, and other comorbidities.
