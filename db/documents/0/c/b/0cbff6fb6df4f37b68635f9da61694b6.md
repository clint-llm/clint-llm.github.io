Chronic diseases always show a recurrence of very similar related disorders and symptoms. To give examples, patients with diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) present various related symptoms, such as headache, alterations in the neurophysiological behavior of the lingual complex, morphological and neurophysiological alterations of the diaphragm, alterations in the control of the pelvic floor muscles.

In patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),Â one can encounter problems such as chronic headaches, OSA, alterations in the function and morphology of the diaphragm, and problems related to the pelvic floor muscles.

Patients with chronic pain in the cervical tract may have common related symptoms, such as headache, functional changes in the lingual complex, respiratory dysfunctions, and postural changes in the pelvic area.

Chronic kidney disease causes various comorbidities, such as chronic headache, OSA, impaired diaphragmatic function, and weakness of the pelvic floor muscles.

The reasons are different and/or specific to the pathology in progress. The concept that emerges is the fact that the anatomical and neurological relationships of the five diaphragms have confirmation in the clinic. It is impossible to think and image the human body as a complex of discontinuous areas unable to influence each other.

To understand the usefulness of the osteopathic approach with the 5 diaphragms, it is essential to know the anatomy-physiology of their connections. The osteopath not only looks at the symptom but, above all, at the causes of the symptom. Shoulder pain can be caused by diaphragmatic dysfunction. Like any other nerve structure, the phrenic nerve carries electrical and biochemical information in a bidirectional way. In its path, the phrenic nerve is mixed with the brachial plexus, like the axillary nerve (shoulder muscles).

A constant diaphragmatic dysfunction (due to trauma, emotions, and more) will induce the production of paracrine substances by the diaphragm muscle (cytokines and more), which will go retrograde towards the medulla, involving all the structures in connection with the phrenic nerve. As literature demonstrates, one of the symptoms of a functional alteration of the diaphragm muscle is a dysfunction of the shoulder arthrocinematics and/or pain (somato-somatic reflex). Another cause of dysfunctional reflexes from the diaphragm to the shoulder is the fascial continuum. When the diaphragm is lowered during inhalation, the connected fascial system is pulled downwards. It is easier, in fact, to raise the arm in flexion during an act of inhalation compared to the same movement during an act of exhalation. It can be useful to evaluate and treat the 5 diaphragms to resolve a shoulder disorder, as will be described later.

To give another example, abnormal traction of the suboccipital muscles (e.g., trauma to the sacrum area) will cause abnormal mechanical-metabolic tensions in the subtentorial dural area. As shown in the literature, the dural tissue will produce irritants that will affect the trigeminal system, with cranial pain. The mechanical dural receptors are found in particular near the vascular pathways; if stimulated for non-physiological causes, they can induce a chronic inflammatory situation, which will involve all the nervous structures of the area. Considering that the subtentorial area is innervated by the same cranial nerves that involve the lingual complex, we can strongly hypothesize the presence of a motor and/or sensory dysfunction. We must also consider the fascial relationships between the tentorium cerebelli and the lingual complex, the cervical tract, and the occipital area.

A dysfunction of a fascial tract can alter the dynamics of these relationships, both in the vicinity of the symptom and if the cause is distant, such as, for example, a sacral trauma. The thoracolumbar fascia includes the deep muscles of the spine, including the suboccipital musculature; abnormal traction of the sacrum will induce an abnormal tension of these cervical muscles.

When there is a chronic, local or systemic problem, it is advisable to use the 5 diaphragm approach. In the acute phase, it is possible to use this approach, respecting the possibility or not of putting your hands on the tissue; in the event of a non-healed wound, the use of these techniques may not be effective, or the clinician's touch may cause discomfort to the patient.
