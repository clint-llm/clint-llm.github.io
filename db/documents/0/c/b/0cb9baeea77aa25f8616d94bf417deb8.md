Each year, countless amount of time and money is wasted treating terminally ill patients. In many cases, a prior DNR may have resolved the problem. All healthcare workers have a responsibility to discuss DNR and advanced directive status with their patients. The goal is to educate the family and the patient that a DNR does not mean that the patient will have a poor quality of life- just the opposite. It is vital to assure the family that the patient will be made comfortable and any pain issues will be adressed.
