Pyramidal tract lesions can have devastating consequences if not discovered quickly. The most important aspect of surgery focuses on determining the location and cause of the lesion, which will help dictate the procedure. A detailed history and physical exam will aid in guiding this process. Pyramidal tract lesions will present very similarly to upper motor lesions with symptoms such as hyperreflexia, weakness, spasticity, and a Babinski sign. Damage to the corticobulbar tract can present with additional symptoms of lower facial weakness and changes to speech.

Initial treatment for these lesions is typically intensive rehabilitation and exercise. They can also be managed with medical interventions such as botulinum toxin, benzodiazepines, and baclofen, which can all help to decrease the spasticity and contractures to improve functionality and quality of life in patients. It is only when these measures fail, and in the cases of a severe and life-threatening emergency, that surgery becomes a consideration.
