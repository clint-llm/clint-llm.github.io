The cause of liposarcoma is still unknown. The American Cancer Society has identified some apparent risk factors for soft tissue sarcomas; however, multiple cases exist where patients have no apparent risk factors for the disease. The exact genetic mutation leading to these malignancies is still under investigation. Liposarcoma risk factors identified by the American Cancer Society include radiation (especially radiation therapy used to treat other malignancies), certain family cancer syndromes, damage/trauma to the lymphatic system, and exposure to toxic chemicals. It is important to note that liposarcomas do not develop from lipomas, which are completely benign.
