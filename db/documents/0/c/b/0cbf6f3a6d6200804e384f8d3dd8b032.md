The primary cause of cardiovascular collapse from sepsis is a peripheral circulatory failure. Cardiac dysfunction due to myocardial failure plays a prominent role in meningococcal disease. Higher endotoxin (LOS) concentrations were associated with shock, renal failure, and respiratory distress. High concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 are seen in those with meningococcal shock.

TNF and IL-1 activate endothelial cells by increasing their permeability and adhesiveness for white cells. Overproduction of nitric oxide lowers arterial pressure due to vasodilation. It also impairs cardiac contractility.

Endothelial cell retraction on interaction with bacterial endothelial cells leads to a loss of integrity, causing capillary hemorrhages and the formation of thrombi in purpuric lesions. When a large number of bacteria colonize the blood vessels and leads to the corresponding signaling, this is responsible for the extensive purpuric lesions and severity of shock in Purpura fulminans.
