Assessment of fluid status is taught in nursing school, medical school, and physician assistant school.  Knowledge of fluid status and insensible fluid losses is paramount in the care of critically ill patients.  There must be free-flowing information and communication regarding fluid status from bedside nurses to the other medical professionals that are part of the patient's care team.  Physicians across the United States are more commonly turning to point of care ultrasound (POCUS) to provide quick, accurate information on the fluid status of their patients by looking at the inferior vena cava and heart using transthoracic echocardiograms.  As this becomes more common, the healthcare team will be able to accurately assess and treat fluid status and monitor for insensible fluid losses.  Interestingly, there is level I/II evidence that radiologists can provide the healthcare team with pertinent imaging findings that may help to elude the cause of hypovolemia,****
