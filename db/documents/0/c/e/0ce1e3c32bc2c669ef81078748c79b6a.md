Lemierre syndrome begins as a localized oropharyngeal infection. It is not known definitively whether F. necrophorum acts predominantly as a primary or secondary pathogen in the initial stages of LS. In addition to direct infection, it is postulated that mucosal damage of the pharynx caused by other bacterial or viral infections leads to conditions conducive for a fusobacterial superinfection. The infection then spreads into the lateral pharyngeal space and soft tissues of the neck. Venous thrombosis is initiated locally in the peritonsillar veins and then extends to the internal jugular veins. F. necrophorum has been shown to aggregate human platelets in vitro, subsequently precipitating intravascular coagulation. When combined with venous stasis from extrinsic compression and intrinsic vessel occlusion secondary to inflammation and edema, this leads to the development of septic thrombosis of the internal jugular vein. The release of septic emboli into the systemic circulation results in widespread dissemination of F. necrophorum into the lung, pleura, joints, bones, muscles, spleen, liver, kidney, and other endpoints of circulation. Direct extension or propagation of thrombus can result in central nervous system abscess formation as well as cavernous sinus thrombosis.
