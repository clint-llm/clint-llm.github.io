Urge incontinence, a form of urinary incontinence, is characterized by urinary urgency. Etiologies for urge incontinence include neurogenic, myogenic, or idiopathic causes. Disruption or damage of autonomic nerves or nerve signaling to the bladder cells may result in conditionsÂ including overactive bladder or bladder pain syndrome.
