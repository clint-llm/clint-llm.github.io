**Antibody-mediated Rejection**

- Primary graft dysfunction

- Pulmonary edema caused by left ventricle dysfunction (myocardial infarction), or fluid overload

- Pneumonia despite prophylactic antibiotics

- Vascular anastomosis complications

- Pulmonary embolism

- Occlusion of the venous anastomosis

- Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)

- Aspiration pneumonitis

**Acute Cellular Rejection**

- Humoral rejection

- Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome

- Recurrence of primary pulmonary disease

- Infection

- Airway anatomical complications

**Chronic Rejection**

- Late-onset acute cellular rejection

- Azithromycin responsive allograft dysfunction

- Esophageal reflux-related bronchiolitis obliterans

- Infection

- Airway complications of lung transplantation

- Recurrence of the underlying lung disease

- Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder

- Native lung hyperinflation
