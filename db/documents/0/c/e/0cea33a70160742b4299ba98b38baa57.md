Theophylline relaxes the smooth muscles located in the bronchial airways and pulmonary blood vessels. It also reduces the airway responsiveness to histamine, adenosine, methacholine, and allergens. It exerts these effects mainly through two distinct mechanisms:

- It acts as a competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor (inhibiting type III and type IV phosphodiesterase), which increases the concentration of intracellular cAMP, activates protein kinase A, inhibits TNF-alpha, and leukotriene synthesis, and also decreases inflammation and innate immunity.

- It is also a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist. It acts on A1, A2, and A3 receptors with almost the same affinity, which possibly explains theophylline's cardiac effects. Adenosine-mediated channels also increase the contraction force of diaphragmatic muscles by enhancing their calcium uptake.

Other proposed mechanisms of action of theophylline include:

- It inhibits nuclear factor-kappaB, preventing the translocation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor (NF-kappaB) to the nucleus, reducing the expression of known inflammatory genes in COPD and asthma.

- Increases interleukin-10 secretion; interleukin-10 has broad anti-inflammatory effects

- Increases histone deacetylase 2 through inhibiting phosphoinositide 3-kinase-delta.

- Decreases poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1)

- Increases apoptosis of inflammatory cells (T cells, neutrophils)
