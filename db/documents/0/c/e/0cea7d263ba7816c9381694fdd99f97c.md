When treated appropriately, about 90% of all microscopic polyangiitis patients show improvement, and roughly 75% achieve complete remission. The condition has a 5-year survival rate of 75%. MPA has a poorer survival rate than Churgg-Strauss syndrome or granulomatosis with polyangiitis, likely resulting from renal impairment present at the onset of the disease.

Long-term damage in a cohort of 296 patients with MPA or GPA was linked to the severity of primary disease, the number of relapses, older age, and the duration of glucocorticoid treatment. A follow-up of 7 years post-diagnosis was conducted. The mean duration of glucocorticoid therapy was 40.4 months.

In another study of 151 AAV patients, cases with lung involvement at baseline showed increased damage and disease activity scores at 6, 12, and 24 months. Patients with pulmonary involvement had a higher risk of developing renal and cardiovascular involvement and were more prone to developing pulmonary fibrosis.
