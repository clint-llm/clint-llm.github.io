The standard treatment of choice for gallbladder disease is laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Complete knowledge of all cholecystectomy techniques and indications is mandatory for a competent surgeon. Being able to convert from laparoscopic surgery to an open technique is part of the modern surgeon's arsenal. Indications from gallbladder cancer to poor visualization to indistinguishable anatomy are all reasons to convert cases to open. Preoperative preparation will also allow the experienced surgeon to prepare for the possibility of conversion to an open technique. These possibilities must also be thoroughly discussed with each patient, along with all possible risks and outcomes.
