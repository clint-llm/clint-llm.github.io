The utility of the supraclavicular fossa ultrasound window in positioning a central venous catheter (CVC) has been recommended by some authors in the literature as a methodology to position the CVC tip in real time within the cavoatrial junction while excluding arterial puncture.

Additionally, though brachial plexus blocks are often performed through axillary, interscalene, or infraclavicular approaches prior to upper limb surgery, a recent review suggests that ultrasound-guided supraclavicular blocks can be attempted with ultrasound guidance to reduce the risk of pneumothorax.
