PET/CT (positron emission tomography) is a widely utilized nuclear medicine imaging modality in which fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) follows glucose uptake into highly metabolic tissues, most commonly used in the evaluation of staging, treatment response, or recurrence of various cancers. While mammography remains the first-line imaging exam used in detecting and screening breast cancer, currently used secondary imaging modalities include ultrasound, MRI, and in special instances, PET/CT.  Fluency in the anatomy and pathophysiology of breast tissue is crucial in the interpretation of breast imaging. This activity reviews the use of PET/CT in the setting of breast cancer staging and recurrence, breast anatomy, and pathophysiology.
