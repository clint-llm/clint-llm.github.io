Differential diagnosis includes many cutaneous purpuric pathologies, including immune thrombocytopenic purpura, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, disseminated intravascular coagulation, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, meningococcemia, or hypersensitivity vasculitis. Mucosal involvement may mimic necrotizing gingivitis. Other vitamin deficiencies, including niacin, biotin, and zinc, may present with skin changes; however, a symmetric, hyperpigmented rash on sun-exposed areas with the former and alopecia and lack of petechial and follicular findings in the latter two easily distinguish them from scurvy.
