The most dreaded complication following a free flap transfer is flap failure, hence the importance of postoperative flap monitoring. The causes of flap failure include:

- Venous or arterialÂ insufficiency, more often venous (8-9:1)

- Thrombosis

- Venous congestion

- Twisting of the pedicle

- Compression of the pedicle

- Tension at flap edges leading to marginal flap loss

Other complications include:

- Color mismatch between flap and recipient site

- Excessively bulky flaps leading to fat necrosis

- Hematoma

- Seroma

- Infection

- Delayed wound healing

- Wound dehiscence

- Hypertrophic scarring of the donor site

- Failure of skin graft take over the donor site and sensory loss over the donor thigh
