Although breathing mechanics are complex, it is important to remember that air will flow from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas. During tidal breathing, the inspiration and expiration at physiologic rest, the volume of air entering and leaving the lungs is known as the tidal volume (TV). On tidal inspiration, inspiratory muscle contraction increases the volume of the chest causing the intrapleural pressure (Ppl) to drop from -5 cm H2O to -8 cm H2O. The decreased Ppl causes the alveolar pressure (Palv) to decrease 1 cm H2O below atmospheric pressure. As a result, air from the relatively high-pressure atmosphere flows into the low-pressure alveoli. Inspiration is an active process requiring the rhythmic contraction of inspiratory muscles that work to expand the chest cavity. Tidal expiration is a passive process that works in reverse. The inspiratory muscles relax, decreasing the size of the chest cavity, and increasing Ppl and Palv. Once Palv is greater than atmospheric pressure, air flows out of the lungs.

Residual volume can be understood by investigation of breathing that exceeds tidal volumes. Following maximal inspiration, the volume of air that leaves the lungs during a maximal force expiration is known as the vital capacity (VC). VC is composed of the tidal volume, expiratory reserve volume (ERV), and inspiratory reserve volume (IRV). The ERV is the volume of air that can be forcefully exhaled after a normal resting expiration, leaving only the RV in the lungs. Forcefully exhaling the ERV is an active process requiring the contraction of expiratory muscles in the chest and abdomen. This increases Ppl and Palv above atmospheric pressure. Due to the elastic recoil of the alveoli, the pressure inside of the alveoli remains higher than that of the pleura, and the alveoli remain open. The pressure inside the airways (Paw) slowly decreases as you move up from the alveoli to the trachea as a result of increased airway resistance. In sections of small, non-cartilaginous airways, pleural pressure is greater than airway pressure and causes a collapse of the airway (Figure 1B). The air that remains in the lungs after the collapse of all small airways is the residual volume.
