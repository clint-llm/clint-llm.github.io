Treatment of a Bochdalek hernia is surgical, achieved by utilizing either open repair or laparoscopic techniques, to close the defect.

Antenatally, expected management and surveillance for complications is the standard of care. Sometimes, in severe herniation, Fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO) therapy can be considered. This procedure temporarily blocks the trachea, and preliminary research suggests it improves lung development. Postnatally, management of hypoplastic lung tissue and maldevelopment takes precedence; this includes gentle ventilation, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapies. PPH is also a sequela of congenital diaphragmatic hernia and mechanical compression of the lung during development.  Treatment of PPH is usually iNO and sildenafil.
