Following a history and comprehensive physical examination to rule out features of systemic lymphoma, including generalized superficial lymphadenopathy, evaluation is mostly dependent on excluding the common causes of space-occupying liver lesions, notably hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic liver disease, hepatic adenoma, hemangioma, and hydatid cyst. A thorough workup is helpful, including HBsAg, HCV antibodies, EBV IgM or PCR, and HIV serology. A range of other biochemical and tumor markers such as serum LDH, B-2 microglobulin, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA 19-9, and CA-125 are required to prognosticate the tumor and to differentiate between the primary vs. metastatic liver disease.

Imaging studies, such as triphasic CT scan of the liver, are helpful to define characteristics of the liver lesion and can also help to determine the underlying co-existent liver cirrhosis and associated organ involvement. In contrast to hepatocellular carcinoma, which shows arterial as well as portovenous and delayed phase enhancement, the lesion of lymphoma may only show arterial phase enhancement. The lesions are mostly hypodense with heterogeneous patterns, which is suggestive of tumor-related infarction and necrosis within the lesion.

Radiologically, primary hepatic lymphoma can present in three forms:

- A solitary lesion (55 to 60%)

- Multiple lesions within the liver (35 to 40%)

- Diffuse hepatic infiltration
