The overall prognosis in primary congenital glaucoma depends on time and severity of presentation, age of presentation, and corneal clarity. Early diagnosis and management are the keys to good visual potential in these cases. Corneal edema and optic nerve head changes are reversible if timely intervention is done. Children need to be screened for any associated refractive errors from axial elongation of the eyeball and appropriately managed for the same. Intraocular pressures and optic nerve head need evaluation at regular intervals for lifelong. Late presentations can lead to sight-threatening complications.

A study from the United States showed that there was a lack of progression following adequate treatment in 90.3% at 1 year, 83.1% at 5 years, 70.8% at 10 years, and 58.3% at 34 years. Thus, highlighting the importance of appropriate management and follow-ups of these patients.
