A blood specimen is taken from a peripheral venous draw. A phlebotomist performs the procedure in most cases. The phlebotomist secures a snug rubber band around the upper arm, and the patient pumps his or her fist several times. The phlebotomist palpates the vein to confirm the location and cleanses the area with an alcohol prep pad. Once the area air dries, the practitioner introduces a needle into the vein and draws a vial of blood. He or she removes the band from the patient's arm and then removes the needle and applies pressure to the venipuncture site until hemostasis occurs, usually within one minute. A bandage is applied over the site.

The patient's medications should be reviewed, as these can affect the outcome of the test. Fasting is not required before the blood draw. There are no special procedures required. Complications include oozing at the draw site, bruising or mild tenderness at the site, or very rarely, infection at the venipuncture site. Other bodily fluids, such as synovial fluid, can be tested for in this manner but frequently are not.

Immunoassays and laser nephelometry are the methods to quantify CRP levels and are cheap, accurate, and fast. To detect lower levels of CRP (0.3 to 1.0 mg/L), high-sensitivity CRP methods are recommended as the usual CRP detection tests are less precise. High-sensitivity CRP only denotes the assay process used, allowing for detection of lower levels of CRP and not a different, or more specific, differential diagnosis.
