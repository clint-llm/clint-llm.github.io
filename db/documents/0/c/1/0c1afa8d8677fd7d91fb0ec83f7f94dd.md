**Symptoms**

Patients present with clinical features of right-sided heart failure. These may be painful hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema. In severe cases, pulsations in the neck from the distended and pulsatile jugular veins is noted. Exercise intolerance may be seen. Clinical features of the underlying condition causing tricuspid regurgitation may be observed. For example, pulmonary hypertension may cause symptoms such as weakness, shortness of breath, and exercise intolerance or patients presenting with infective endocarditis, a common cause of tricuspid regurgitation, may present with febrile episodes.

**Physical Examination**

- Jugular venous distension with a prominent V wave reflects the elevation in right atrial pressure. Increase in venous return causes jugular venous distension, and it is more prominent with inspiration (Kussmaul’s sign).

- S3 gallop is associated with an extremely dilated RV.

- Pansystolic murmur: It is high pitched and loudest in the fourth intercostal space in the parasternal region. The intensity of the murmur increases during inspiration, exercise, leg raising (due to increase in venous return) and decreases in standing position and during Valsalva maneuver.

- Ascites

- Cachexia and jaundice

- Atrial fibrillation

- Peripheral edema

- Right ventricular heave due to dilated right ventricle and S4 gallop that increases with inspiration
