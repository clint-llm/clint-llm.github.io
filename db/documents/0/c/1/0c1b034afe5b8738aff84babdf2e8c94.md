Patients with dacryocystitis often initially present to the emergency room, primary care clinic, urgent care or see a nurse practitioner. In general, dacryocystitis is managed by the ophthalmologist and primary care providers should avoid probing or manipulating the nasolacrimal duct.  The treatment of acute dacryocystitis includes conservative measures such as warm compresses and attempts of Crigler massage. For uncomplicated cases, consideration of oral antibiotics should be given.

In complicated cases or patients who appear toxic, intravenously antibiotics should be administered. Empiric antibiotics should include gram positive and gram negative coverage.  Lacrimal probing is discouraged in the acute phase. For recurrent infections, referral to ophthalmology for surgical evaluation is advised.

The outlook for most patients with simple obstruction is good but for those with complex obstruction, the outcomes are guarded and can interfere with vision and lifestyle.
