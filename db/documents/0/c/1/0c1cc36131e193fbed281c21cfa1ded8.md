Chronic lymphocytic leukemia should be suspected in the presence of the above-described clinical findings or laboratory findings such as lymphocytosis, cytopenias, or immunoglobulin abnormalities. The necessary tests for initial assessment and diagnosis of CLL consist of a complete blood count with differentials (CBC w/Diff), peripheral smear, and flow cytometry.

CLL is diagnosed using the updated 2018 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) national cancer institute guidelines. As per the criteria, CLL is diagnosed with a peripheral blood monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis more than or equal to 5,000 /microL [≥ 5 × 109 /L] sustained for at least three months.

Peripheral blood smear findings include smudge cells, leukemic cells with a narrow border of cytoplasm, and a dense nucleus with indiscernible nucleoli. Clonality of the B lymphocytes is confirmed through flow cytometry on the peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate, revealing immunoglobulin light chain restriction.

Other findings include coexpression of B-cell-associated antigens (CD23, CD20, and CD19) and mature B and T-cell antigens (CD5). Sometimes, a biclonal population is identified, one with kappa and the other with lambda light chain restriction. A recent study estimated biclonality in 1.4% of CLL cases.

Peripheral blood fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) or Sanger sequencing analysis are useful prognostication tools and may affect treatment options. For instance, loss of ATM gene or identification of Del(11q22-23) and loss of TP53 or identification of Del(17p12), which leads to the loss of TP53, is associated with poor response to drugs whose mechanism of action involves DNA damage.

NGS can also detect immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) gene mutation as a 2% or more difference in nucleotide sequence compared to germline DNA. CLL with mutated IGHV are clinically less aggressive and have a low frequency of driver mutations.
