The care of patients with facial burns requires a comprehensive approach and, in many cases, a commitment from a team of healthcare providers to care for the patient over months to sometimes years.

Prehospital providers play a vital role in stopping the burning process, stabilization, and rapid transport to a healthcare facility. Immediate life threats due to trauma and inhalation injury must receive immediate attention from the emergency physician and trauma team prior to consideration for transfer to a burn center.

Patients transferred to burn centers can expect a range of specialists available to them.

Early recognition and intervention have been shown to significantly improve long-term outcomes.

In cases of domestic abuse, particularly those involving children, social services, and law enforcement, may play a significant role.

Excellent patient-centered outcomes require a cohesive treatment team. Every member of the treatment team should understand their role and the roles that others play in overall patient management. It is important that the patient understand their care so that they can participate in it fully and be as compliant as possible. It is important that the family and social support structure of the patient is as intact as possible.
