A patient who presents with unstable vitals and heavy bleeding with abnormal hemoglobin will need emergent obstetric evaluation and possible intervention. Stable patients will need urgent obstetric consultationÂ to help manage and secure close follow-up for the patient. In many instances, the patient will need to follow up for repeated quantitative beta-hCG levels, and if needed, for further medical or surgical treatment. Patients also will need to follow up with obstetrics for contraception following an abortion.
