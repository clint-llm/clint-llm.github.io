The rarity of angiosarcoma has prevented clinicians from conducting large randomized clinical trials. This is the precise reason for discussing all patients with AS in a multidisciplinary tumor board to offer them the best approach. An expert pathologist trained in sarcoma specialty must be present at these tumor boards to appropriately identify AS and differentiate it from other tumor types, especially melanoma. Since local control offers the best survival outcome, surgical oncologists must collaborate with radiation oncologists to offer surgery with perioperative RT. Medical oncologists can offer concurrent chemotherapy and RT to the patients to achieve durable responses. Treating physicians must collaborate with radiologists to determine the results of the follow-up imaging and to discuss the best imaging modality in order to appropriately diagnose a patient with AS. Lastly, nurses, chemotherapy suites, and social workers must come together to provide comprehensive care to the patient. [Level III to Level IV]

Due to the rarity of the pathology, no large randomized trials are possible, and the evidence of treatment comes from case series, retrospective studies of international registries, and few small prospective trials. [Level III to Level IV]
