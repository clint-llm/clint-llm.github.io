Proximal humerus fractures (PHFs) account for 5 to 6 percent of all adult fractures and often occur in elderly individuals who experience low-energy falls. The healthcare burden associated with these fractures is significant and involved both the direct and indirect costs associated with osteoporosis and fragility fractures. Increased efforts are being made to detect and manage these fractures. Additionally, as the general population continues to age and an increasing percentage of patients are noted to have low bone density, the nonoperative and operative management strategies for proximal humerus fractures continue to receive considerable attention in the literature. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of proximal humerus fractures and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiologic factors associated with proximal humerus fractures.
- Describe the typical clinical presentation of a patient with a proximal humerus fracture.
- Outline considerations that influence the management of proximal humerus fractures.
- Summarize the need for a an interprofessional team approach to caring for a patient with proximal humerus fractures.
