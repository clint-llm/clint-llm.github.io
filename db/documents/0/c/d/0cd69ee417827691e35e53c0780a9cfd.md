The most readily accepted indication for supplemental oxygenation is hypoxemia or decreased levels of oxygen in the blood. For the otherwise healthy patient, oxygen saturation targets are generally at 92 to 98%. For patients with chronic hypercapnic conditions, target oxygen saturations are generally between 88 to 92%, with oxygen administration indicated at saturations below these levels. This value is commonly measured with pulse oximetry, but a pulse oximeter can give falsely elevated readings in anemia, cyanide, or carbon monoxide poisoning and is not an adequate indicator of perfusion, as seen in cases of shock.

**Chronic**

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

- Cystic fibrosis

- Pulmonary fibrosis

- Sarcoidosis

**Acute**

- Medical emergencies requiring high concentrations of oxygen in all cases:

- Shock
- Sepsis
- Major trauma
- Cardiac arrest and during resuscitation
- Anaphylaxis
- Carbon monoxide and cyanide poisonings
- Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)

- Medical emergencies which may or may not require oxygen administration

- Asthma
- Bronchitis
- Acute heart failure or heart failure exacerbations
- Pulmonary embolism

Historically, it is worth noting that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) receives treatment with morphine, oxygen administration, nitroglycerin, and aspirin; however, recent studies have shown routine oxygen administration to be non-beneficial.
