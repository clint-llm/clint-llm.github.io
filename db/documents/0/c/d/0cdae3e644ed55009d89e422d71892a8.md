Radioiodine is administered orally in pill form.

In patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk DTC with low-risk features (i.e., low volume central neck metastases with no further extension or adverse features stated above), an ablative dose of 30 mCi is the recommendation from the ATA.  However, in patients with less than complete or near-complete thyroidectomy, or adverse pathologic features, the RAI administered dose should be increased accordingly, to a maximum of 150 mCi.

To maximize RAI uptake into thyroid cells, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels preferentially increase by either the injection of recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) or withdrawal of supplemental thyroid hormone (which the patient must take in the absence of a thyroid gland). rhTSH has the advantage of maintaining a euthyroid state, thereby minimizing the unwanted side-effects of hypothyroidism. Although both methods appear to have equivalent efficacy, the ATA does not recommend using rhTSH in high-risk DTC patients due to insufficient evidence. Patients typically consume a low iodine diet for approximately 1 to 2 weeks before RAI to facilitate radioiodine uptake further.

The ATA recommends a single dose of 10 to 15 mCi to treat Grave’s disease and a single dose of 10 to 20 mCi for toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma.
