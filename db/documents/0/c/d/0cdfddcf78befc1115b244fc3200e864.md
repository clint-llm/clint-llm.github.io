Primary hepatic lymphoma is an uncommon problem, which requires a high level of suspicion for diagnosis since the presentation of PHL, commonly resembles other space-occupying liver lesions; notably, hepatocellular carcinoma, which is less chemoresponsive and requires an entirely different approach to treatment. Furthermore, around 10% of patients with primary hepatic lymphoma have features of preexisting liver disease, which could further add to the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in post cirrhotic liver among such patients. A hepatologist, interventional radiologist, hematologist, primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and finally the patients are the key components of an interprofessional team, including physicians, nurses, mid-level practitioners, and pharmacists working together to diagnose and formulate therapy to improve rates of remission, disease-free survival, and cure.
