Blue nevi are most commonly acquired, but in rare cases, they can be congenital and associated with familial or other syndromes, such as LAMB (lentigines, atrial myxomas, and blue nevi) and NAME (nevi, atrial myxoma, myxoid neurofibromas, and ephelides). One variant, the epithelioid type, is a common manifestation in the Carney complex, a form of multiple endocrine neoplasias distinguished by pigmented skin and mucosal lesions and cardiac myxomas.
