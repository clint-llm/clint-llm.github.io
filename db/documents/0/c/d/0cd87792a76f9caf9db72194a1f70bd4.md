Tardive dyskinesia is a syndrome that includes a group of iatrogenic movement disorders caused by the blockade of dopamine receptors. The movement disorders include akathisia, dystonia, buccolingual stereotypy, myoclonus, chorea, tics, and other abnormal involuntary movements, which are commonly caused by the long-term use of typical antipsychotics. However, several other medications are also associated with tardive dyskinesia. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM V) defines tardive dyskinesia as a medication-induced movement disorder that persists despite discontinuation or change of the medications. As per DSM-V, to confirm a diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia, symptoms must persist for a month after discontinuation of the drug. This activity reviews tardive dyskinesia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in recognizing and managing patients affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of tardive dyskinesia. 
- Describe exam findings consistent with tardive dyskinesia.
- Outline management strategies for tardive dyskinesia. 
- Summarize strategies to educate interprofessional teams on common etiologies of tardive dyskinesia as well as common presentations so that efforts can be made to prevent it from developing in the first place and stop it from progressing if it has already developed.
