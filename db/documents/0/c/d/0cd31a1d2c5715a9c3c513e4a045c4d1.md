The prognosis for Werdnig Hoffmann disease is very poor. The disease presents before 6 months of age, and it is a progressive muscular disorder that often results in early death. Most patients die prematurely either in infancy or early childhood, often by 2 years of life. This is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality.
