With the rise in awareness of neurodegenerative diseases at the end of the 20th century, novel drugs were in development to counter the deleterious effects of these diseases. One of the main drugs that came into creation in 1985 was rivastigmine. With its approval by the FDA in 1997, rivastigmine is indicated to treat mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimerâ€™s type. Its indications also include the treatment of mild to moderate dementia that is associated with Parkinson disease.

Recent studies have also shown that rivastigmine can improve gait stability to help reduce the risk of falls in patients with Parkinson disease.

Multiple studies have also shown that drugs like rivastigmine and other cholinesterase inhibitors can improve cognition in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies based on a computerized cognitive exam. Compared to the placebo group, patients receiving rivastigmine had an improvement of 30% or more, as well as being overall less anxious and fewer episodes of hallucinations.
