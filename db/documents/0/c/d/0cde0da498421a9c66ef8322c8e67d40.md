Filarial hydrocele is a scrotal swelling resulting from a parasitic infection with Wuchereria bancrofti, endemic to tropical regions around the world. The condition causes physical and mental anguish for males affected, as it can impact their fertility, mobility, and even their ability to earn a living. Recognizing how this infection spreads and manifests itself is critical to its eradication, as well as how already infected individuals can be treated. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of filarial hydrocele and highlights the role of the healthcare team in the care of patients with this condition.
