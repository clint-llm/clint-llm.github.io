Overwhelmingly, labia minora enlargement is congenital, although women claim to have enlargement after childbirth, hormone therapy, and increasing age.

Felicio et al. defined degrees of labial hypertrophy from type I (< 2cm) through type VI (> 6cm). Since labial hypertrophy has rarely been considered a medically necessary procedure, this scale is often relegated to research purposes. Functionally, if excess labial tissue can be removed without injuring crucial structures, a labiaplasty can be performed, and this can also be tailored to the patient's aesthetic wishes. Ancillary procedures such as clitoral hood reduction must be considered when planning a labia minora reduction, as unaddressed hood redundancies can result in unsightly bumps and bulges. There are two reliable methods for reducing labia minora: (1) the trim method, also known as the edge method, reported by Hodgkinson, and (2) the wedge method pioneered by Alter. Technique selection should be based on anatomy, patient goals, and patient preferences.
