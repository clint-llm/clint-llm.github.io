Polyhydramnios is associated with underlying conditions which increase the risk for poor maternal and neonatal outcomes. Polyhydramnios is complicatedÂ by a higher incidence of intrauterine fetal demise, preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, cord prolapse, fetal macrosomia, breech presentation, cesarean delivery, and postpartum hemorrhage. Polyhydramnios' complications depend on the excessive amniotic fluid volume, which contributes to uterine distension, a significant risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony.

Additionally, polyhydramnios is associated with the increased risk for cesarean delivery due to several factors, including the increased risk for breech presentation, umbilical cord prolapse, and labor dystocia. Other complications of polyhydramnios may be correlated directly with the disease processes, which altered the normal amniotic fluid equilibrium resulting in increased amniotic fluid. Fetal macrosomia, commonly seen in gestational diabetes, is an increased risk factor for neonatal hypoglycemia, shoulder dystocia, and cephalopelvic disproportion requiring cesarean delivery.
