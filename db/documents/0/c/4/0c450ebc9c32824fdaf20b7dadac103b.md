The diagnosis of herpetic whitlow is typically made by the appearance of lesions and the patient’s history. If the diagnosis is unclear, there are multiple tests available for HSV. A viral culture can be sent by unroofing vesicles and swabbing fluid at the base. This method is about 50% sensitive overall. Vesicles contain the highest concentration of virus within the first 24 to 48 hours after they appear (89% positive). PCR testing is much more sensitive. Serology and direct fluorescent antibody testing are other tests that may be sent but are less common. A Tzank test consists of scraping the floor of a herpetic vesicle, staining the specimen, and looking for multinucleated "balloon" giant cells, with as high as approximately 70% sensitivity and high specificity for the disease.

HIV testing should be considered in patients with atypical presentations and recurrent infections.
