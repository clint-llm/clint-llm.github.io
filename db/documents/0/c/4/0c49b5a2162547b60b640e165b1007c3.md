Yersinia enterocolitica is a gram-negative bacillus shaped bacterium that causes a zoonotic disease called yersiniosis. The infection is manifested as acute diarrhea, mesenteric adenitis, terminal ileitis, and pseudoappendicitis. In rare cases, it can even cause sepsis. Over the past few decades, yersinia infections have become very common with epidemics reported in many parts of the globe.

Since the majority of patients with yersinia infection present to the emergency department, nurses and emergency dept physicians should be aware of the presentation, diagnosis, and management. While most patients do improve with hydration, some may require antibiotics.

The public health nurse should be involved when there is an epidemic because education of the public is vital.  The key to prevention is to educate the patients on the importance of handwashing and maintenance of personal hygiene. Travelers to endemic areas should be told to wash all fruit and vegetables and avoid consuming unpasteurized milk. For those patients who are hospitalized, nurses should ensure that enteric precautions are in place.

Close communication between members of the team is essential in order to improve outcomes.
