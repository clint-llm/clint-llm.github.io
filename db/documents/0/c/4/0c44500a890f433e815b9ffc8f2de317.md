Sarcomas are connective tissue tumors, and thus the tumors may occur in bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, or vascular or hematopoietic tissues. Sarcomas are much rarer compared to carcinomas. Most tend to grow locally and invade the adjacent tissues. Most patients present with complaints of a hard mass or pain, chiefly because of pressure on nearby nerves and soft tissues.
