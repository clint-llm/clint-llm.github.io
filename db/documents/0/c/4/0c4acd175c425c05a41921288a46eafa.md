The International Continence Society definition of overactive bladder (OAB) is "urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency, nocturia, with or without urge urinary incontinence."

The medications typically used in OAB are in the antimuscarinicÂ class. However, their broad side-effect profile must be used cautiously, especially in patients with acute angle-closed glaucoma, older patients, and chronic constipation. Mirabegron, a beta-3 adrenoceptor agonist, has been shown to have high safety and efficacy profile by large random placebo-controlled clinical trials. Mirabegron is used to treat urgency, urge urinary incontinence, and increased urinary frequency found in the overactive bladder.
