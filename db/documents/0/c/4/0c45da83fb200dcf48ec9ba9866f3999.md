**Echocardiogram**

Routine antenatal screening with fetal echocardiography has been able to aid in the early diagnosis of septal defects. The cases that are diagnosed during the antenatal period generally carry a poor prognosis. When a defect is suspected in such screening, they are usually referred for a much more detailed fetal echocardiography, which can accurately depict the type of defect, associated valve morphology, presence of a shunt, and blood flow parameters. The radiological diagnosis during the postnatal period is usually performed when there are CHF signs, symptoms in a newborn, or if diagnosed (or suspected) during antenatal screening. With the recent advances in Doppler echocardiography, the diagnosis of AV canal defects is no longer dependent on cardiac catheterization.

**Chest X-ray**

In partial defect, chest X-ray shows right heart enlargement with increased pulmonary vasculature. While intermediate and complete forms show more of the diffuse enlargement of all chambers, although left atrial involvement is unusual and left ventricular enlargement is not very obvious due to the masking by the enlarged right ventricles.

**Electrocardiogram**

The characteristic ECG finding in AV canal defects is the presence of a superior axis directed more towards the left. The next most common finding is the presence of rsR’ or rR’ in the right precordial leads caused due to the volume/pressure overload. The other findings include prolongation of the PR interval and right ventricular enlargement.
