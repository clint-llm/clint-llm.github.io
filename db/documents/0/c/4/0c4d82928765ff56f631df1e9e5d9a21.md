Accurate osmometry results require using a properly calibrated osmometer. More information on this is available in the specimen requirements and procedure section. The safe operation of an osmometer includes a variety of factors. The device must be plugged into an approved electrical outlet, as exposure to AC voltage could lead to electric shock, burns, or electrocution. Power cords should be adequately secured to ensure they do not create a walking or tripping hazard. The device should not be placed or operated on any wet, unstable, or non-leveled surfaces. Furthermore, osmometers should not be operated in an explosive atmosphere or areas with extreme or highly variable temperatures.
