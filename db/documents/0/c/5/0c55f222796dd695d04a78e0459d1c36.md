Balanitis xerotica obliterans, also known as lichen sclerosus, are white inflammatory patches that can affect both males and females. In males, the affected areas usually involve the foreskin and penile glans, termed specifically balanitis xerotica obliterans. Urethral stricture disease and meatal stenosis are common sequelae of this condition.
