Hordeolum is often encountered by the emergency physician, nurse practitioner, or primary care provider. In most cases, the infection can be managed with conservative treatment. Warm compresses are aimed at softening the granulomatous tissue and facilitating drainage. Persistent lesions or larger lesions may require antibiotic therapy. This treatment may help to shorten duration and severity. However, if the infection is large or the cause is not known, the patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist.

The outcomes for most patients with hordeolum is excellent.
