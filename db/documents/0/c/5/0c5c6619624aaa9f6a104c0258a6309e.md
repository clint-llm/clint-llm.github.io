The earliest changes observed will be torso flexion, wide-based gait, and equinus posturing, which minimizes the workload on the knee extensors. Patients also exaggerate hip abduction, forward pelvic tilt, and the hyper lumbar lordosis compensating for weakened gluteus muscles in facilitating truncal extension.

The classically described Gowers sign usually presents in advanced stages. However, early stages, mild hand pressure against the thigh and prone crawl position are appreciated.
