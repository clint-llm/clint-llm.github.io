Treatment is based on the underlying etiology of pancytopenia. Nutritional deficiencies should be corrected. Any offending drug should be discontinued. Treatment for infections such as HIV or tuberculosis should be started immediately. If an autoimmune condition or malignancy is diagnosed, it should be treated. Aplastic anemia secondary to viral infections such as parvovirus is transient and symptomatic treatment should suffice. Treatment options for patients with severe aplastic anemia could include a hematopoietic stem cell transplant and immunosuppression. Hematology referral should be sought for these patients.

Supportive care for patients includes red blood cell transfusion for anemia to alleviate symptoms and perfuse vital structures. Platelet transfusion is indicated for thrombocytopenia of less than 10,000 per mcL to prevent spontaneous intracranial bleeding. Prompt initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is recommended for patients with neutropenic fever or severe neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil count of less than 500 per ml due to the risk of death from sepsis.
