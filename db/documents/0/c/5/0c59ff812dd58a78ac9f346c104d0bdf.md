Tendons and ligaments are connective tissue structures that allow for stability and elasticity between bone-muscle and bone-bone interfaces, respectively. Molecular structure high in water and extracellular matrix content provide the durability and elasticity needed for these structures. The mesoderm is the middle layer of the embryologic trilaminar disc of tissue that forms because of gastrulation in a fetus. Surrounded by the endoderm and ectoderm, the mesoderm is the structure giving rise to connective tissue of the human body aside from muscle of the head, which develops from neural crest tissue. The ITB, being a tendinous structure, therefore derives from mesoderm.
