For the procedure, the surgeon will benefit from having a specialized vascular tray, which will include vascular (typically atraumatic) clamps, vessel loops, specialized needle drivers, and fine forceps (Geralds). They will also require a graft to form the bypass, which is likely to be supplied by different manufacturers at your facility. The graft that is available at a given hospital is dependent on which manufacturer has privileges at the hospital or operative facility. The surgeon will also require suture for the anastomosis of the graft to the native vessel. Patients will also require heparin during the procedure. Heparin administration is standard prior to clamping any of the blood vessels to help prevent thrombosis. Usually, protamine is administered towards the end of the case for the reversal of the anticoagulant effect. At the end of the procedure, it is often beneficial to have various hemostatic agents readily available should they be needed.
