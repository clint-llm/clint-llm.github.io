Tobramycin is an effective antibiotic commonly used in the management and treatment of various systemic and ocular infections. As an aminoglycoside antibiotic, tobramycin is active against aerobic gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Due to its broad spectrum of activity, tobramycin is prescribed for the treatment of both superficial and deep infections. This activity provides a comprehensive review of the indications, mechanisms of action, potential toxicities, off-label uses, dosing considerations, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring requirements, and relevant drug interactions associated with tobramycin to assist the healthcare team in decision-making and optimal patient care.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the appropriate indications for tobramycin therapy in the treatment of various infections.
- Apply evidence-based guidelines and recommendations when selecting tobramycin as a treatment option.
- Assess patients for potential adverse effects and monitor for signs of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity during tobramycin therapy.
- Collaborate with infectious disease specialists, pharmacists, and other healthcare team members to optimize tobramycin therapy and ensure patient safety.
