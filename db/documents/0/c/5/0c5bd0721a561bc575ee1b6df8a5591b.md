Intestinal injury can result from either blunt or penetrating trauma. The majority of blunt abdominal trauma does not result in intestinal injury. Approximately three percent of blunt abdominal trauma results in intestinal injury, with the small bowel being the most common location. Penetrating traumatic injury is less frequent than blunt trauma; however, it more frequently results in intestinal injury. Penetrating trauma falls into two main categories: high-energy (projectiles) and low-energy (stabbings).
