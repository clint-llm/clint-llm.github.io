- Craniopharyngiomas are low histologic malignant tumors arising along the craniopharyngeal duct.

- There are two histologic subtypes, adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP) and papillary craniopharyngioma (PCP). Both of these have different age distribution, MRI appearances, and somatic mutations.

- The treatment of craniopharyngiomas is primarily surgery and radiotherapy.

- The prognosis of craniopharyngioma is good, but the quality of life is low due to hypothalamic and endocrine deficiencies.
