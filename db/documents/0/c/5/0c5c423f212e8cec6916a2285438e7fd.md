Vaginal atrophy is a condition affecting the pre and postmenopausal populations. Often its symptoms are contributed to other conditions or not relayed to the clinician at all. Healthcare providers have the ability to significantly improve identification, management, and quality of life in all of these patients. It is imperative that clinicians ask the questions needed to screen for this process and to encourage patients to relay these symptoms if they occur. If patients are reluctant to inform their caregivers of these symptoms, they will continue to suffer from decreased quality of life and ongoing symptoms detrimental to their genitourinary health. It is the responsibility of the healthcare team to assist in identifying and treating vaginal atrophy prior to any of these complications.
