Similar to the auditory organs, the vestibular organs are the constituents of the inner ear that derive from the otic vesicle, which is a sac-like epithelial tissue that arises from the otic placode. The otic placode, a thickening ectodermal layer of an embryo, is the first visible indication of inner ear development. Once the otic vesicle arises from the otic placode, neuroblasts delaminate from the otic vesicle and coalesce to form the statoacoustic ganglion (SAG). The SAG supplies the sensory innervations to the inner ear. As its development progresses, the otic vesicle modifies its shape to form a fluid-filled labyrinth with auditory and vestibular sensory organs.
