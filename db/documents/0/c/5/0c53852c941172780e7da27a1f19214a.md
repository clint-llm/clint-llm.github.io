This brief review seeks to summarize the current literature on the use of simulation in EMS education and in skill assessment. Simulation is widely used by EMS education programs. Its origins can arguably be traced back to the collaboration between the toy company Laerdal and Dr. Safar, who developed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. This partnership led to the production of the first Resusci-Anne training simulator.
