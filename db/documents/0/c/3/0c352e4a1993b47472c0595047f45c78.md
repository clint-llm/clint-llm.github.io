Initial assessment of upper gastrointestinal tract by esophagogastroduodenoscopy or barium radiography is done to rule out a mechanical obstruction. The most common test used in clinical practice is theÂ gastric scintigraphic emptying of solids. A study result of retention of solids at 4 hours is considered to be diagnostic of gastroparesis. Other alternative methods to assess gastric emptying include motility testing by a wireless capsule and 13 C breath testing using octanoate or spirulina integrated into a solid meal. Drugs that affect the gastric emptying should be held at least 48 hours prior to the study. Furthermore, patients with diabetes should have plasma blood glucose less than 275 mg/dl to eliminate acute impairment of gastric emptying from hyperglycemia.
