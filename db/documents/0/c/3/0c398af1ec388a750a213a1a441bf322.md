Cervical cancer incidence and mortality have decreased due primarily to screening programs using the pap smear. As more outcome data has become available, screening and treatment guidelines for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) have evolved. Detection of the disease in a precancerous state, close monitoring, and treatment are paramount in the prevention of cervical cancer. The screening process for cervical cancer involves pap smear cytology of the cervix along with human papillomavirus (HPV) testing in certain circumstances. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and complications of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and underscores the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiological trends for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
- Review the most commons symptoms associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. 
- Summarize the treatment options for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. 
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in prompt diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
