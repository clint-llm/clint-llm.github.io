Guyon canal syndrome is a rare neurological disorder of the hand that is most common in young people. The disorder is difficult to diagnose and requires an interprofessional team that includes a hand surgeon, radiologist, neurologist, neuro/orthopedic surgeon, and a therapist.

Treatment of Guyon canal syndrome is similar to that of carpal tunnel syndrome. Its spectrum consists of conservative management and surgical decompression. Conservative management involves patient instructions and splinting. Instructions are centered around the avoidance of mechanical compression and repetitive stress at the Guyon canal. In the case of cyclists, the utilization of more ergonomically favored handlebar positions can be used. Repetitive or prolonged wrist extension should be minimizedÂ as this exerts compressive forces on the ulnar nerve in the hand.

Patients who alter their lifestyle will note a significant improvement in the symptoms.
