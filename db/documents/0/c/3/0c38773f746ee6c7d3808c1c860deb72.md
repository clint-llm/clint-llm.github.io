During the development and differentiation of Sertoli cells from their supporting cell precursors in the genital ridge, an autosomal gene known as the SOX9 (SRY-Box Transcription Factor 9) is very much essential.  Apart from the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome (SRY), the steroidogenic factor 1 (NR5A1) also helps in the differentiation of the Sertoli cells.

The absence of these factors will result in the formation of female gonads, the ovaries. Upon reaching the essential levels of SRY and SOX9, the gonads start demonstrating morphological changes to a true testis. These changes include the epithelization of the Sertoli cells, differentiation of Leydig and myoid cells, testicular cords formation, and mitotic arrest of germ cells.
