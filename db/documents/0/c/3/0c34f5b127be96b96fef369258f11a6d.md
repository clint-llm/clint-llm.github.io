Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is a disease process that results in acute hypoxia secondary to a rapid deterioration in respiratory status. The disease process has multiple etiologies,Â all of which require prompt recognition and intervention. Increased capillary permeability and changes in pressure gradients within the pulmonary capillaries and vasculature are mechanisms for which noncardiogenic pulmonary edema occurs. To differentiate from cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is not elevated and remains less than 18 mmHg.

These findings suggest a noncardiogenic source. Arguably the most recognized form of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that has an acute onset secondary to an underlying inflammatory process such as sepsis, pneumonia, gastric aspiration, blood transfusion, pancreatitis, multisystem trauma or trauma to the chest wall, or drug overdose.
