The etiology of malocclusion is often multifactorial, mainly influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Inherited factors are also believed to be involved, but their exact role is yet to be fully understood.

While most malocclusion cases have an unknown etiology, the correlation between genetics and malocclusion has been studied extensively. Data suggests that a specific malocclusion, Class III mandibular prognathism, is passed down through generations via specific growth factors and genetic markers. Dating back to the 1300s, the heritability pattern of mandibular prognathism can be seen in the European royal Hapsburg family. Nicknamed the “Hapsburg Jaw,” interbreeding between different family members allowed the genes encoding mandibular prognathism to be expressed over multiple generations.

Inherited characteristics can also be factors that influence malocclusion. More specifically, a disproportion between the size of teeth and the size of the jaw can cause crowding or spacing. A disproportion in the size or shape of the maxilla and mandible can also cause malocclusion. The size and shape of teeth and jaws can be inherited together or independently. Studies have shown that the more independently these characteristics are inherited, the more likely there will be a malocclusion disproportion. Compared to primitive generations, malocclusion has become more prevalent as outbreeding between distinct human populations has occurred more frequently. This can be attributed to the fact that these populations inherit discordant characteristics of teeth and jaws.

Environmental factors can play a role in the development of malocclusion as well. This is often seen in children who habitually suck on their thumbs. When pressure is placed against the roof of the mouth, the lower incisors and maxillary molars are pushed lingually, and the upper incisors are pushed labially. Furthermore, the jaw is positioned downward, which allows for posterior teeth to erupt, resulting in a separation of the incisors.
