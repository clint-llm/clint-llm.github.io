Breast abscesses are a common problem, especially in lactating women. Most breast abscesses are benign. However, when a non-lactating patient presents with a breast abscess, a more nefarious etiology such as an inflammatory carcinoma should be considered. Non-lactating patients presenting with breast abscess should also be screened for new-onset diabetes. This activity reviews the breast abscess evaluation and management in both lactating and non-lactating individuals and emphasizes the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain whether there is evidence to support any single method of managing a breast abscess over any other.
- Identify whether or not data supports the use of empiric antibiotics in patients with breast abscesses.
- Describe the components of the evaluation of a non-lactating patient with a breast abscess.
- Explain the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with breast abscesses.
