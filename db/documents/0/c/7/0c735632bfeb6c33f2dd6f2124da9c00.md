When exposure to sulfur mustard is suspected, immediate decontamination including removal of clothing and scrubbing with soap and water is imperative. Management is largely symptomatic treatment and supportive care. Historical treatments such as topical bicarbonate solution and chlorinated soda have been shown to be of no added benefit over soap and water. Cutaneous burns are managed similarly to thermal burns with debridement, antibiotic ointment, collagen-laminated nylon dressings, and fluid resuscitation, as needed. Ocular injuries can be treated with irrigation, antibiotics if secondarily infected, and analgesia. Respiratory symptoms are treated with supplemental oxygen, prophylactic antibiotics, and if needed, mechanical ventilation. Most patients recover completely from sulfur mustard injuries, and mortality is most often from high-concentration exposures over a longer period.
