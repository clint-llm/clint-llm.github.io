Infliximab is an effective drug for a number of chronic inflammatory disorders. However, all interprofessional healthcare team members (clinicians, nurses, pharmacists) should work together to ensure that the patient has had a proper workup for tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and cardiac status evaluated prior to administering the drug. Close monitoring of the patient by a specialty-trained nurse is necessary, as the drug does have mild to moderate adverse effects. A clinical pharmacist can also provide valuable input on dosing, and drug-drug interactions and answer patient questions about the medication. The best outcomes will be achieved by an interprofessional team approach to the use of infliximab, which can optimize therapeutic outcomes and prevent adverse events. [Level 5]
