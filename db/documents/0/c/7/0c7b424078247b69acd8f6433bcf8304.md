As with any splinting technique, there are a few possible complications.

- Improperly padded splints can lead to skin breakdown.

- Splints that are wrapped too tight can lead to patient discomfort and possibly decrease perfusion to the extremity.

- During the curing process, splinting materials give off heat in an exothermic reaction. This heat can cause patient discomfort.

- Plaster can cause skin irritation if it makes direct contact with the skin.

- Over-padded splints can become too loose and inadequately immobilize an injury.

- Splints that are over aggressively molded can cause skin breakdown at the point of maximal pressure.
