Subungual melanomas are rare and account for 0.7% to 3.5% of all malignant melanomas worldwide. Melanoma of the nail apparatus occurs equally in all racial groups. However, it is the most common variant of malignant melanoma among African-Americans, Asians, and Hispanics. It accounts for 75% of melanomas in African populations, 25% in Chinese populations, and 10% in Japanese populations. These groups usually have a very low incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma due to the melanin pigment protecting their skin from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. It is most common in the seventh decade of life for men and the sixth for women. The great toe and thumb are the most common digits affected. These digits account for 75% to 90% of cases.
