Urine leak from a ureteral injury may lead to urinoma formation, which can eventually lead to infection and/or abscess. Extravasated urine can also irritate the intestines and peritoneum, resulting in pain and ileus. If the ureter stricture is down, and there is no drainage of urine, this obstruction can lead to loss of renal function and, ultimately, loss of a kidney. A ureterovaginal fistula can form if not recognized.
