Contraindications to a transhiatal esophagectomy in patients who otherwise require the procedure include:

- Tumor size and proximity of the tumor to vital structures in the chest. Esophageal malignancies are usually T1 lesions in the current diagnostic era and do not require operations for palliation.

- A surgeon's inexperience with the technique is a relative contraindication as well.

- An additional factor to consider is the prior treatment of the tumor. The tumor may have received neoadjuvant therapy with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, and with the timing after radiation, it may make the transhiatal approach difficult from scarring.
