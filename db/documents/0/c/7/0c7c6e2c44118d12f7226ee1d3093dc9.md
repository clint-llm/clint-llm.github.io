The RTSA preoperative preparation includes obtaining a complete history, perform a full clinical assessment, arrange the appropriate imaging modalities, and medical optimization for the surgery.

**Patient History**

Detailed history, including the personal, medical, and social history, is mandatory to identify all medical comorbidities, social circumstances, and the patientâ€™s functional baseline. For example, patients who live on their own or usually use a mobility aid will need extra support postoperatively.

**Clinical Assessment**

Full preoperative clinical assessment should be performed, including:

- The current shoulder active and passive range of movement

- Rotator cuff examination,

- Axillary nerve function,

- Deltoid muscle function,

- Skin condition over the involved shoulder,

- The entire upper limb neurovascular status.

**Imaging Modalities**

**Shoulder X-rays******

Anteroposterior, Y-scapular, and axillary views are usually obtained prior to RTSA. X-rays are useful for preparative templating, identify bony lesions and assess bone quality.

**Computed Tomography (CT) Scan**

CT scan is beneficial in assessing the humerus and glenoid bony stock and glenoid version for preoperative planning**.**A preoperative three-dimensional (3D) CT scan can determine the proximal humeral retroversion.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scan**

MRI could be used to assess the integrity of the rotator cuff before the surgery.

**Medical Optimization**

Patients with medical comorbidities, e.g., diabetes, anemia, cardiac or renal diseases, require medical assessment, medication review, and optimization prior to the surgery.
