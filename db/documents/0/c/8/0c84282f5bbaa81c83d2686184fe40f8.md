There is no intervention needed for these episodes. Anti-epileptic drugs are not helpful for these children andÂ treating with seizure medication does not prevent a child from having breath-holding spells.

Several studies suggest that there may be an association between iron deficiency anemia and breath holding spells and iron supplementation can decrease the frequency of breath holding spells frequency, with a starting dose of 4 to 6 mg/kg/day.

Since breath-holding spells do not have any long-term effect, parents should be advised to minimize the attention they give to the episodes to keep the child from developing behavioral problems.

Overall it can be stressful for parents to see their child having breath holding spells and working with a professional counselor may help to cope with the situation.
