Anesthetic considerations for surgical interventions on the laryngeal structures necessitate the maintenance of ventilation. Jet ventilation is often used, in addition to spontaneous ventilation. Complications from airway management and laser use may arise. This article describes anesthetic management concerns for laryngeal surgery and highlights the importance of communication among the inter-professional team in the care of patients undergoing laryngeal surgery, especially concerning airway management strategies and fire risk mitigation.

**Objectives:**
- Review the components of anesthesia for laryngeal surgery.
- Describe the unique challenges anesthesia providers face during laryngeal surgery.
- Identify the risks for airway and operating room fire and utilize recommended preventative techniques.
- Summarize common indications for anesthesia for laryngeal surgery.
