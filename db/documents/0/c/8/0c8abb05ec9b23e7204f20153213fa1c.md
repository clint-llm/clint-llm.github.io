The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy affects up to 50% ofÂ patients with diabetes during their lifetime, with a prevalence noted to be between 6% to 51% depending on multiple variables such as glycemic control, type of diabetes, and age.

More frequently, in practice, we see peripheral neuropathy in males; however, it has the same potential to affect females within those with diabetes and neuropathy.
