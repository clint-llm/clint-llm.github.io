The Gel-Coombs classification of hypersensitivity reactions is based on specific mediators of the allergic response. Egg allergy is IgE mediated, and so it is classified (like all food allergies) as a type one hypersensitivity reaction.

An allergic response is typically mediated by the presence of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and the process of binding of IgE to human mast cells and basophils is termed sensitization.  The IgE-immune cell binding is via the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of the IgE immunoglobulin (Fc-epsilon-RI), composed of an alpha chain, a beta chain, and two gamma chains.  The process of sensitization prepares mast cells and basophils cells for antigen-specific activation. In the activation phase, reexposure to egg protein allergens initiates degranulation of mast cells and basophils with subsequent release of pharmacoactive mediators.  As addressed earlier, these mediators include heparin, histamine, leukocyte chemotactic factors, and leukotrienes; these mediators are responsible for the clinical manifestations of egg allergy. The degranulation process is not apoptotic; on the contrary, degranulated mast cells or basophils regenerate and are able to resume their normal cellular function once their granular contents are synthesized.  In the case of egg allergy, the cross-linking of egg protein-specific IgE on mast cells in response to egg allergen occurs in mast cells in the upper and lower GI tract. The release of chemical mediators causes smooth muscle contraction and vasodilation, leading to emesis and diarrhea. The egg protein allergens can also be absorbed into the bloodstream due to increased vascular permeability due to histamine release.  The egg proteins can interact with skin mast cells, causing atopic urticaria.

IgE is the immunoglobulin responsible for egg allergy, and the IgE responses have a TH2 dependency.  While TH2-derived cytokines promote IgE response, it is balanced by TH1-derived cytokine downregulation of IgE.  Egg allergy can result from a failure of this balance, leading to an overproduction of IL-4 by TH2 cells.

A majority of the immunogenic proteins are found in the egg white with five major allergenic components of egg white: ovomucoid (Gal d 1), ovalbumin (Gal d 2), ovotransferrin (Gal d 3), egg white lysozyme (Gal d 4), and ovomucin
