The rib cage consists of typical and atypical ribs. A typical rib will have the following landmarks:

- Angle

- Shaft

- Neck

- A head that joins with the superior and corresponding vertebra

- A tubercle that connects to the corresponding transverse process

Ribs 1, 2, 11, and 12 (sometimes 10) are atypical, while 3 through 10 are typical. Rib 1 is atypical as it connects only with T1 with no angle. Rib 2 is atypical due to its large tuberosity on the serratus anterior shaft. Rib 11 and 12 both articulate only with the corresponding vertebra but have no tubercles. Rib 10 is sometimes considered atypical as it only connects to T10. The ribs further classify as true, false, and floating ribs. Ribs 1 through 7 are true ribs as they connect to the sternum by costal cartilages. Ribs 8 to 12 are called false ribs as they do not directly connect to the sternum; ribs 11 to 12 are called floating ribs because they remain unarticulated anteriorly.

There are three categories of rib movement:

- Pump-handle motion

- Bucket-handle motion

- Caliper motion

Depending on their location amidst the ribcage, all ribs may have a mix of the above movements; however, they generally tend to follow the patterns below:

- The upper ribs (1-5) generally move in a pump-handle motion.

- The middle ribs (6-10) generally move in a bucket-handle motion.

- The lower ribs (11 and 12) generally move in a caliper motion.

Muscles of inspiration refer to those muscles that uplift the chest cage. Muscles of expiration refer to those muscles that push the chest cage downward. External intercostals are the most crucial muscles of inspiration, but other noteworthy muscles are:

- Sternocleidomastoid muscles that elevate the sternum

- Anterior serrati that uplift many ribs

- Scaleni which lifts ribs 1 and 2

The muscles that push the chest cage downward are primarily the:

- Abdominal recti, which is capable of pulling the lower ribs down when they and other abdominal muscles compact the abdominal contents up contra the diaphragm

- Internal intercostals

The lungs can expand and contract in two ways:

- Downward and upward diaphragmatic motion to expand or shorten the thoracic cavity, and

- Elevation and depression of the ribs to lengthen and reduce the anteroposterior diameter.

Normal quiet breathing almost exclusively involves the first method. Diaphragmatic contraction pulls the lower lung surfaces downward during inspiration; the diaphragm relaxes during expiration while the chest wall, elastic lung recoils, and abdominal structures press the lungs and expel the air. During rapid breathing, however, the contraction of abdominal muscles becomes necessary as the elastic forces are not strong enough to produce the vital rapid expiration. The second method mentioned earlier elevates the rib cage. At rest, the ribs incline downward to let the sternum fall backward to the vertebral column. When the rib cage uplifts, the ribs protrude directly forward, allowing the sternum to move forward and away from the spine, thickening the chest about 20 percent greater at utmost inspiration than during expiration anteroposteriorly.
