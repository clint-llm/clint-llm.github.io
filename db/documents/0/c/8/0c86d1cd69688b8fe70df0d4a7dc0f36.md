Often, peripheral blood review is required to interpret the cause of basophilia. The most striking feature in basophils is the markedly intense azurophilic granules with dark blue segmented nuclei.

While basophilia usually presents as a non-specific finding under microscopic exam, the presence of other findings may suggest the need for additional workup. For example, the basophilia in the setting of left-shifted neutrophilia should raise the concern for a myeloproliferative neoplasm, especially CML.  The presence of basophilia with circulating blasts suggests the possibility of acute myeloid leukemia. Review under oil immersion is usually required to avoid misclassifying degranulated basophils, which may resemble hypogranular neutrophils.
