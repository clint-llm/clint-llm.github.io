Hemorrhage produces an acute expansion of the tumor, which produces many of the symptoms. Visual symptoms are caused by direct compression of the optic nerves or chiasm, and hormonal dysfunction is caused by the suddenÂ interruption of the release of the hormones.

Several theories had been proposed to explain the ischemic and hemorrhagic changes found in the tumor and the normal gland. Although they are proposed as separate mechanisms, probably each theory contributes to some process, and the combination of them is what ultimately produces the apoplexy. One theory postulates that the compression of the superior hypophyseal artery and its branches against the diaphragma sella leads to ischemia of the anterior pituitary gland and the tumor.
