Pulmonary barotrauma while on mechanical ventilation has correlations with increased morbidity and mortality. A prospective cohort study performed in 361 intensive care units in 20 countries looked at the outcome of 5183 patients mechanically ventilated for more than 12 hours. Barotrauma was present in 2.9% of the patients. There was an increase in mortality in patients who developed barotrauma, 51 versus 39 percent.
