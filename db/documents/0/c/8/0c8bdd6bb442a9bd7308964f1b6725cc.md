Equipment for tympanostomy tube placement includes an operating microscope or zero-degree endoscope, ear speculums, cup forceps, cerumen loops, 3, 5, and 7F Fraiser suctions; myringotomy knife, alligator forceps, curved pick-ups, and tympanostomy tube(s). Tympanostomy tubes are made of plastic, metal, hydroxyapatite, or silicone. Tympanostomy tubes are typically classified as short-term (lasting 6 to 12 months) and long-term (lasting greater than one year). Beyond this, selecting a particular TT type/shape is a matter of surgeon preference, as numerous short- and long-term TT types exist and have established results.
