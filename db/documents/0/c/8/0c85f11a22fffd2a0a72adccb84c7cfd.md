The anatomical location of actinic cheilitis on the lip is a locationÂ managed by a variety of healthcare providers. Providers in dermatology, dentistry, ENT, and primary care must be aware of actinic cheilitis as a premalignant lesion. They should have a low threshold to biopsy persistent lesions on the lips, especially if the patient has fair skin, a history of sun exposure, or a history of skin cancer. Appropriate monitoring, treatment, and consistent follow up reduces the risk of malignant transformation of actinic cheilitis to SCC. All providers need to be aware and refer a patient if they are not certain of the nature of a lip lesion.
