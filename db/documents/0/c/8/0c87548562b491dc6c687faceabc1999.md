Studies of the temporal bone revealed endolymphatic accumulation (hydrops) in the cochlea and the vestibular organ in patients with Meniere disease. Current research links endolymphatic hydrops to a hearing loss of >40dB. Vertigo may or may not be associated.

The exact etiology of Meniere diseaseÂ remains unclear. Different theories exist, but genetic and environmental factors play a role.
