Peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a relatively rare, heterogeneous neoplasm involving T lymphocytes categorized under non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL), mycosis fungoides (MF), and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PCALCL) are the most frequent subtypes of PTCL. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of these common subtypes of PTCL and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk factors associated with the three common subtypes of peripheral T-cell lymphomas: angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL), primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PCALCL), and mycosis fungoides (MF).
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL), primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PCALCL), and mycosis fungoides (MF).
- Review the management options available for angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL), primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PCALCL), and mycosis fungoides (MF).
