There are no specific antidotes for the majority of sympathomimetic drugs. Protection of the airways, breathing, and circulation take priority. The main treatment and management of these patients are to prevent further harm from the sympathomimetic effects on the CNS and cardiovascular system.

For sympathomimetic agents ingested orally, one may consider activated charcoal as long as the patient is alert. Hypertension unresponsive to the benzodiazepines should be managed with a shorting antihypertensive like labetalol or nitroprusside.

The main medication for symptomatic treatment is a benzodiazepine. This medication can treat and help prevent seizures and calm the agitated patient; therefore it helps in the prevention of excited delirium. Other adjuncts would be intravenous fluids to promote hydration and renal excretion of any metabolic breakdown products and passive cooling to maintain a normal body temperature.

Patients with aggressive and agitated behavior may require the use of antipsychotics, and patients who experience seizure may require anticonvulsants. Rhabdomyolysis can occur which requires aggressive hydration and diuresis to protect the kidneys. Because of development of cardiac arrhythmias, close monitoring is essential. Prior to discharge, some of these patients may benefit from psychiatric evaluation.
