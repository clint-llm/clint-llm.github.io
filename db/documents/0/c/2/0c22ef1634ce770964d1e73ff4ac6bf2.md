Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) allow physicians to evaluate the respiratory function of their patients in many clinical situations and when there are risk factors for lung disease, occupational exposures, and pulmonary toxicity. National guidelines for the measurements and interpretation of PFT are regularly updated, and the most recent guidelines developed by the international joint Task force from the European Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic Society (EUR/ATS) were published in 2022.

The results of the PFTs are affected by the effort of the patient. PFTs do not provide a specific diagnosis; the results should be combined with relevant history, physical exam, and laboratory data to help reach a diagnosis. PFTs also allow physicians to quantify the severity of the pulmonary disease, follow it up over time, and assess its response to treatment.
