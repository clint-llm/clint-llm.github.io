There are no absolute contraindications to performing a transabdominal pelvic ultrasound in early pregnancy. Care should be taken not to scan over a wound or incision to avoid contamination and infection. A transvaginal ultrasound is contraindicated in the setting of hypotension. It is also recommended to use settings that expose the first-trimester fetus to as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) frequencies by avoiding color and spectral Doppler during the exam.
