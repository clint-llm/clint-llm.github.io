To fully assess the location of a patient's pain, a body diagram map can be completed. Ankle sprains are solitary, acute injuries. Body diagrams may not be necessary in such a case.Â Localized pain is different than whole body pain. Yet, in a patient with multiple comorbid pain disorders such as fibromyalgia, centralized pain disorder, and rheumatoid arthritis, distinguishing between the numerous locations of a patient's pain, as well as factoring the radiation of their pain, is difficult. However, it is an essential part of guiding therapy. In a patient with widespread pain, a body diagram map helps the distinction between new pain complaints and chronic. Is the patient with multiple comorbidities experiencing a rheumatoid arthritis flare, or is it a reactivation of pain secondary to knee osteoarthritis? A body diagram helps to decipher multiple different types of pain.

A fibromyalgia survey can be used to help distinguish a new pain complaint from a patient's comorbid fibromyalgia as well.

Functional MRI and various imaging modalities can be helpful in a pain assessment.
