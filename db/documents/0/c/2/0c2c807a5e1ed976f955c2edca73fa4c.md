Glimepiride, like other sulfonylureas, has multiple adverse effects, the most deadly and notorious being its metabolic effects. As glimepiride increases endogenous insulin secretion, this can lead to hypoglycemia. In patients with long-standing diabetes mellitus, hypoglycemic unawareness can manifest where the autonomic symptoms of hypoglycemia are not experienced by the patient, leading to neuroglycopenia symptoms and potential hypoglycemic coma. This situation is particularly dangerous in drivers or those involved in skilled tasks, especially if other hypoglycemic agents are in concomitant use. Weight gain is another significant side effect of sulfonylureas such as glimepiride, which can interfere with management as weight loss is often a major target in the treatment of diabetes. Other adverse effects include vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, erythema multiforme, and exfoliative dermatitis.
