The primary symptoms common to both types include polydipsia, polyuria, and nocturia. Polyuria is defined as a urine output of more than 3 L/day in adults or 2 L/m^2 in children.

In children, symptoms can be nonspecific, and they may present with severe dehydration, constipation, vomiting, fevers, irritability, failure to thrive, and growth retardation. In patients with central nervous system (CNS) tumors, headaches and visual defects may present in addition to the classic symptoms.

The serum concentration in untreated CDI is often in the high normal range, secondary to stimulation of thirst centers in the brain to replace urinary water losses.

Patients with CDI may develop decreased bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and femoral neck. The mechanism for this is unclear.

Additional symptoms in patients with diabetes insipidus may include weakness, lethargy, fatigue, and myalgias.
