In general, non-infectious hepatics cysts are most prevalent in the female population. Their incidence also tends to increase with age. On the contrary, ciliated hepatic foregut cysts occur more commonly in men. Echinococcal hepatics cysts (also known as hydatid cysts) are more common in their endemic geographical regions which include South America, the Middle East, and the eastern Mediterranean, some sub-Saharan African countries, western China and the former Soviet Union.
