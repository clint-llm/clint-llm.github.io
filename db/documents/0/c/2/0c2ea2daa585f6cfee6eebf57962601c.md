The true incidence of GTN is difficult to ascertain with certainty. Data concerning the total number of pregnancies and trophoblastic disease vary from county to county.  Following a molar pregnancy, the risk of a complete and partial mole rises to 1 to 2%. Following two molar gestations, the risk of having a third mole is 15 to 20%.  The prevalence of choriocarcinoma or placental-site trophoblastic tumor is less well known, as these diseases can emerge following any pregnancy.

Most cases of GTN arise from molar pregnancy approximately 50%, while 25% may develop after miscarriage, termination, or tubal pregnancy.  The remaining may result after preterm or term pregnancy.

When GTN develops post molar pregnancy it is usually either molar tissue or choriocarcinoma but it is rarely placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) or epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT).

After complete molar pregnancy, approximately 15 will have persistent local disease with invasion and 5 percent may develop metastatic disease. GTN after nonmolar pregnancy occurs between 2 and 200 per 100,000 pregnancies. (dependent on reporting globally) and is usually choriocarcinoma. GTN after pregnancy loss occurs in 1 in 15,000 cases and in 1 in 150,000 cases after term pregnancy.
