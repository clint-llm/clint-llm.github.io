Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are a class of drugs indicated for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and many other autoimmune disorders, including systemic sclerosis, vasculitis, spondyloarthritis, inflammatory myositis, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and some types of cancers. Due to the high complexity involved in the appropriate use of these agents and monitoring for adverse effects, DMARDs shall be ideally prescribed by an appropriate specialist such as a rheumatologist, gastroenterologist, or dermatologist. The prescribing provider shall be familiar with these agents, their indications, and their adverse effects and should coordinate with the pharmacist regarding dosing, potential interactions, and adverse events. Nursing can also provide patient counseling and coordinate with the pharmacist and clinician to monitor the patient since all patients prescribed DMARDs need to be closely followed to monitor their effectiveness and side effects. The interprofessional approach will provide the best chances of positive patient outcomes with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]
