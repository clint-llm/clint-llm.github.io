It most commonly affects one limb or half of the body but can have a wide range of presentations. This condition was initially described in 1849. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Todd paresis and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of Todd paresis.
- Describe the typical history and physical exam of a patient with Todd paresis.
- Review the treatment and management options available for Todd paresis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving coordination and communication to advance knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of Todd paresis and improve patient care.
