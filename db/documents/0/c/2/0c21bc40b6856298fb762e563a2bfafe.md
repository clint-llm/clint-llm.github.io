For all stages of endometrial carcinoma reported by FIGO, 5-year survival rates were significantly superior for patients primarily treated from 1999 through 2001 with surgery alone compared with patients treated with radiotherapy alone. These results likely were biased by younger patients and those with fewer and less severe co-morbidities being selected for primary surgery. In the early stages of endometrial cancer clinically confined to the uterine corpus (Stage I) or with cervical extension (Stage II), the results with primary radiotherapy alone for aged and medically inoperable patients approached the results with primary surgery. Stage by stage, compared to endometrial cancer patients treated with surgery alone, the survival rates were improved in patients who received postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy.

There are fewer vaginal-pelvic recurrences, and progression-free survival may be improved with postoperative radiotherapy in surgically staged endometrial cancer patients found to have deep myometrial penetration, involvement of the uterine cervix and/or adnexa, non-endometrioid histotypes. Adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy after surgical debulking of advanced primary and recurrent endometrial cancer also reduces the rate of local-regional recurrences and improves progression-free survival rates. Extending radiotherapy to encompass the para-aortic nodes has been advocated for surgically proven metastases.  Some series show that the improved results with postoperative radiotherapy after surgical debulking may be enhanced when combined with chemotherapy.
