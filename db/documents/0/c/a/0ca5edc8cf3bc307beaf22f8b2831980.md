This procedure is routinely performed in the operating theatres or dedicated minor operating rooms due to the hazards of laser scatter. The health care professionals undertaking this procedure include the primary ophthalmic surgeon with the assistance of a scrub nurse and/or theatre team. The ophthalmic surgeon may administer a peri/retrobulbar block, or this may be performed by a supporting anesthetist if available.
