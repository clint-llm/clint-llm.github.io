As many as 10% to 15% of the cases can be complicated by ovarian torsion [the large sizes to which these tumors grow to predispose to torsion], tumor rupture (especially in large thin-walled cysts), and intratumoral hemorrhage. This can result in the presentation as an acute abdomen, which may be accompanied by hemoperitoneum and consequent hypotension. Hormonally active granulosa theca cell cancers can also result in infertility (high inhibin levels suppressing FSH levels) and endometrial carcinoma (due to unopposed estrogen stimulation of endometrium).
