Although the mechanism of angiodysplasia is not clear, the hypothesis is that as a result of increased contractility at the level of muscular propria, submucosal veins may become obstructed. Chronic obstruction of these vessels may result in age-related angiodysplasia lesions. Congestion of the capillaries and precapillary sphincter failure, lead to the formation of arteriovenous collaterals.

Angiogenesis is an important mechanism of the development of new vessels, which increases vascularity in the case of hypoxia or ischemia. In hypoxia, the expression of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor increase in angiodysplasia. These factors are significant in the development of angiodysplasia and changing the risk of bleeding.

In endothelial cells, inhibition of von Willebrand factor (VWF) expression is shown to increase proliferation by VEGF and angiogenesis showing a correlation between hemostasis and angiogenesis, which is useful in the treatment of patients with angiodysplasia and VWD.
