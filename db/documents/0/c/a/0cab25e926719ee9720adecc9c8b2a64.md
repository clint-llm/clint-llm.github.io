The diagnosis of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is not always straightforward, and definitive determination requires collaboration between neurologists and pathologists. While the neurologist is primarily responsible for treating epilepsy, the pathologist is critical in ruling out alternative diagnoses. The accurate diagnosis of SUDEP is vital for medicolegal reasons and can provide closure to patients' families.

Collaboration between physicians and patient advocacy groups is also essential to ensure accurate and accessible information is available to the public. There is ample data to inform patients of their overall risk of SUDEP, as well as evidence to suggest that ongoing seizure management in patients with uncontrolled epilepsy can mitigate SUDEP risk.[Level 2] Furthermore, some evidence exists to support nocturnal monitoring for seizure detection and SUDEP prevention. [Level 4]

Lastly, several studies have identified modifiable risk factors in SUDEP.[Level 1] Collaborative efforts between the epilepsy treatment team (including neurologists, neurology nurses, and social workers) along with patient advocacy groups (such as the Danny Did Foundation, Epilepsy Foundation) can help to properly disseminate information amongst the public and create behavioral changes in patients to mitigate risk.
