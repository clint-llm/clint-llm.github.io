In general, the diagnosis of insect bites is obvious; however, careful consideration should be given to avoid misdiagnosing other pruritic skin conditions.

Mosquito bites are frequently misdiagnosed as bacterial cellulitis; this is especially true in the very young, who may have more exaggerated reactions to bites. A general rule of thumb is that mosquito bites develop over hours, while cellulitis develops over days.
