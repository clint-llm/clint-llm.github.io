Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a type 4 or delayed-type hypersensitivity response (DTH) by an individual’s immune system to a small molecule (less than 500 daltons), or hapten, that contacts a sensitized individual’s skin. ACD accounts for 20% of contact dermatoses, and allergens differ greatly based upon geography, personal habits, and hobbies, and often, the types of preservatives that are legally permissible. This activity illustrates the etiology, pathophysiology, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of allergic contact dermatitis.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of allergic contact dermatitis.
- Describe the clinical presentation, workup, and management of allergic contact dermatitis.
- Review that allergic contact dermatitis involves a complex interplay between biological, psychological, behavioral, and dietary factors.
- Explain the role of the interprofessional team in ensuring comprehensive patient and caregiver education to achieve better clinical outcomes.
