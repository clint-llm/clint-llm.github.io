Laryngopharyngeal reflux appears to be a common, yet under-diagnosed condition. Despite the available medications and surgical procedures to manage this condition, it is important to recognize that lifestyle modifications constitute the first-line therapy. To achieve this goal, an interprofessional team approach is needed. In addition to astute clinicians, treatment and management of LPR requires specialty-trained nurses and dieticians to help educate patients regarding lifestyle and dietary modifications. When medical therapy is required, clinical pharmacists determine the lowest effective therapeutic dose of the prescribed medication and assist in adjusting other medications to minimize drug-drug interactions. A collaborative interprofessional team can help improve outcomes in patients with LPR. [Level V]
