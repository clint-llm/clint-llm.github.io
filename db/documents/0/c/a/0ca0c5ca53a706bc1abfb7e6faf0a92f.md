Procaine penicillin is widely prescribed and administered by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, internist, and emergency department physician. The drug's only administration route is IM, and great care is necessary when injecting it into the buttock area. All healthcare workers who administer this agent IM should know the anatomy and location of the sciatic nerve. Countless litigations have occurred as a result of inadvertent trauma to the nerve, which can result in prolonged pain and disability.

In most cases, the nursing staff will administer the drug; this puts them front and center for knowing proper administration, assessing for adverse reactions, verifying allergies, and monitoring for adverse effects. The pharmacist should also check against the patient's profile for drug-drug interactions, allergies, confirm dosing, as well as verify that the selection of the agent provides proper antimicrobial coverage. Any discrepancies in these areas noted by pharmacy or nursing need to be immediately brought to the ordering physician's attention, so dosing changes or alternative agent selection can occur. Procaine penicillin therapy is the safest and efficacious when the entire interprofessional healthcare team is well-informed and collaborating in the patient's regimen, resulting in the best outcomes with the fewest adverse events.
