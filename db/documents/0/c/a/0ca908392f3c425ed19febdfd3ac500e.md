The interprofessional team can provide support through variousÂ approaches, including making follow-up phone calls after hospital discharge or a clinic appointment to ensure adherence. These calls may also facilitate and address other factors contributing to the patient's presentation, which could not be captured during the appointment. Some examples include difficulty with transportation or identifying public transportation schedules, health literacy over the phone, and identifying complex family systems that may affect patients' adherence. Some such barriers can thus be identified and addressed through various public and health system programs.
