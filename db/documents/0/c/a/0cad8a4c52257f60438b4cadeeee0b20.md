The cervix and upper one-third of the vagina form from two paramesonephric (Mullerian) ducts that fuse and recanalize,Â also giving rise to the body of the uterus and the fallopian tubes. The paramesonephric ducts are present in all embryos from day 0. Without the Mullerian inhibiting factor (MIF), a hormone produced by male embryos, the paramesonephric ducts will develop into the fallopian tubes, uterus, upper one-third of the vagina, and cervix by default.

A recent study found that obvious discernment of a developing cervix is present around 18 weeks of gestation. However, before this time, at roughly 8-10 weeks, the cervical domain can be inferred based upon craniocaudal position within the uterovaginal canal and subtle histological differentiation of the epithelium.
