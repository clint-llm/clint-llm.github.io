After local anesthesia is injected into the skin at the access site the operator places one hand on top of the clavicle and the other controls the puncture needle. Usually, if the right subclavian vein is selected, the left hand is used to palpate for external landmarks and vice versa for the left side. The index finger is then placed in the sternal notch, and the thumb is placed at the angle of the clavicle, approximately two-thirds of the way lateral from the sternal notch. The puncture needle is then advanced through the skin beneath the thumb and angled toward the sternal notch. A syringe is placed on gentle suction while attempting to cannulate the vein. The thumb is used to help guide the needle below the clavicle between the clavicle and the first rib. It is important to guide the needle along a linear path and avoid a steep angle of the needle related to the clavicle. Adjusting the course of the needle while it is in the tissue can cause damage to underlying tissue and possible tearing of the vessels. Therefore, the needle should be all the way back out to the skin before adjusting the direction. Subclavian vein access is confirmed with a flash of dark red blood, and this should drip in a non-pulsatile fashion after the syringe is removed. After access is obtained, the guidewire is advanced into the vein through the needle. If any resistance is met, the guidewire should be removed, with the needle, to avoid shearing the wire on the bevel of the needle during attempted removal. After the guidewire is successfully inserted, the needle is removed. It is important at all times to keep control of the guidewire so that it does not completely enter the vein. A small skin incision is made at the access site large enough to allow the dilator and catheter to pass. The dilator is then passed over the guidewire, always maintaining at least one hand on the wire. During this process, there is usually some mild resistance as the dilator passes through the wall of the vein. The dilator is then removed over the guidewire, and the catheter is placed over the guidewire. All ports are aspirated and flushed to confirm access. If a permanent port or tunneled catheter is to be created, that can be completed at this time. If only temporary access is required, the catheter is secured to the patient's skin. A sterile dressing should be applied after completion of the procedure.
