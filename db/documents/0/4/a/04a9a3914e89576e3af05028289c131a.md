The terms pericarditis refers to inflammation of the pericardium and myocarditis. Both can occur together in clinical practice, and hence the term myopericarditis is used. Sometimes myopericarditis is used interchangeably with perimyocarditis. Myopericarditis is used when there are primarily pericarditis symptoms with evidence of the involvement of the myocardium as evidenced by cardiac biomarker elevation or imaging studies revealing normal wall motion. If there is evidence of regional wall motion abnormalities with reduced ventricular function, the term perimyocarditis has been used. This activity reviews the evaluation of myopericarditis and the role of the medical team in treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the frequency of myopericarditis.
- Outline the evaluation of patients with suspected myopericarditis.
- Summarize the treatment options available for a patient diagnosed with myopericarditis.
- Explain strategies to optimize care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by myopericarditis.
