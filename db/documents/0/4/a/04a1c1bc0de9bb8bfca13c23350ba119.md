Prevention of omphalitis requires both aseptic techniques during delivery services and proper cord care. The umbilical cord should be cut with a sterile blade or scissors. In the hospital setting where aseptic care is routine, and the risk of omphalitis is low, dry cord care is recommended. In developing countries with a higher risk of omphalitis, chlorhexidine as a topical agent has been shown to reduce the risk of omphalitis inexpensively. In a meta-analysis of studies conducted in community settings of developing countries, the use of chlorhexidine reduced all-cause mortality and the risk of omphalitis when compared to dry cord care.
