The examination is mostly performed with gray-scale 2D ultrasound. Harmonic imaging may enhance the visualization of subtle anatomic details, particularly in patients who scan poorly. High-frequency ultrasound transducers increase the spatial resolution but decrease the penetration of the sound beam. The optimal transducer and operating frequency choice are influenced by several factors, including maternal habitus, fetal position, and the approach used. Most basic examinations are satisfactorily performed with 3â€“5-MHz transabdominal transducers.
