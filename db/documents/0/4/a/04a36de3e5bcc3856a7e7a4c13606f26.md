The most common uses for nuclear medicine include examining the kidneys, thyroid, heart, brain, bones, and breasts. Procedures can be broken down into in vivo and in vitro studies. In vitro studies are less common and include taking a sample from the patient, most commonly a blood sample, and assessing it through nuclear medicine outside of the patient’s body. In vivo methods are more commonly used. In these studies, radiotracer material is given to the patient through injection, consumption, or inhalation, depending on the specific type of study. After administration of the radioactive material, a gamma camera takes photographs of the patient.

The images can either be two or three-dimensional. Two-dimensional images are obtained from a stationary gamma camera. Three-dimensional images are produced either through single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or Positron Emission Tomography (PET). SPECT uses a gamma camera that rotates around the patient to create a three-dimensional image.  PET uses the radioisotope fluorine-18, which releases positrons that are captured by the camera. This image has better spatial resolution and contrast. The images are compared to evaluate the activity at the organ, tissue, or cell level.
