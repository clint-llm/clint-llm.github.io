Typically, patients present to the emergency department first. There, they may require emergent stabilization, which may include consultation with many specialists depending on the type of exposure. Inhalation and ingestions may require respiratory interventions, respiratory therapists, or pulmonologists.

Ingestions will often require GI consultation for endoscopy - both diagnostic and therapeutic. They might require further evaluation by GI or general surgery if significant damage was done to the esophagus or stomach to help with nutrition, etc., in cases of severe esophageal strictures, etc.

Dermal injury may require general or plastic surgery to help debride wounds or burns. Ophthalmic exposure will almost certainly require an ophthalmologist evaluation after initial treatment.
