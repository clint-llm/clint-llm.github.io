It is important to have an intimate understanding of the orientation and architecture of subcutaneous fat before one can become proficient in liposuction. Clinically, it is easy toÂ appreciate that fat is divided into the superficial fat layer and the deep fat layer, which is usually separated by a superficial fascia system like the Scarpa fascia in the trunk or the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) in the face.

The consistency of the fatty tissue can be divided into two groups:

- Fibrous fatty tissue is less amenable to liposuction techniques and typically resides in the superficial layers.

- Areolar fat, which is found deeper in the adipose layer and is more loosely organized with less fibrous stromal elements between the fat cells, remains highly responsive to liposuction.

The zones of adherence (ZOA), where the subcutaneous tissue adheres to the fascia of the underlying muscle, should be avoided during liposuction to decrease the risk of contour irregularities. ZOA include:

- The lateral gluteal depression

- Gluteal crease

- Distal posterior thigh

- Mid-medial thigh

- Inferolateral iliotibial tract
