Acrokeratosis verruciformis of Hopf presents as multiple flat-topped and polygonal papules and verrucous plaques. These lesions are skin-colored and firm. Friction on the surrounding skin can produce vesicles. These lesions' predominant locations are on the dorsal surfaces of the hands and the feet. Less commonly, the lesions can occur on the legs, knees, arms, and elbows. Additional findings can include thickening of the nail plate, leukonychia, and longitudinal ridges in the nails.

Acrokeratosis verruciformis of Hopf has no predilection for follicular areas and does not involve the oral mucosa and sebaceous regions, which can help differentiate the disease from Darier disease.

Dermoscopy will show irregular white homogenous areas with a cobblestone appearance.
