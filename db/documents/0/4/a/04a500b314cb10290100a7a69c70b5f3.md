Adequate pain medication is given, as patients often report mild peri-incisional pain for 1-2 days post-operatively. In order to minimize edema and ecchymosis, the patient should place ice packs around the eyes intermittently for the first 24 hours, sleep with the head elevated for 1 week,  and avoid rigorous activity for 2 weeks. A low dose corticosteroid taper may help lessen bruising and swelling as well. Patients are asked to return at 1 week for wound assessment with or without suture removal.  Photographic documentation should occur at around 6 months postoperatively.
