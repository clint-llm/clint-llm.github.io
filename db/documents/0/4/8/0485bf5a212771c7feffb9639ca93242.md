Patients with RV infarction may present with symptoms commonly seen in left side infarction, including chest pain with or without radiation, dyspnea, nausea, and dizziness. There can be rhythm abnormalities ranging from bradycardia to complete heart block. Hypotension may also be more common in this population. Other signs of right heart failure, such as acute peripheral edema and jugular venous distention, also can occur. The triad of jugular vein distention, clear lung fields, and hypotension is the classic picture of right ventricular dysfunction. A pan-systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border may indicate tricuspid regurgitation, but due to the lower filling pressures of the right heart, this is not always present. Rarely, third and/or fourth heart sounds generated by the RV are heard at the left lower sternal border. These increase with inspiration.

More than 30% of patients with inferior wall MI also have RV involvement, but only 10% have significant hemodynamic effects attributable to RV dysfunction.

Marked sensitivity to preload-reducing agents, including nitrates, morphine, or diuretics, is a clue to the presence of hemodynamically significant right ventricular dysfunction.
