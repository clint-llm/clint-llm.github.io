Its Latin namesake translates to “dark lipid,” which is only partially correct in characterizing its variable composition.

Metals such as iron, copper, zinc, aluminum, manganese, and calcium make up only 2% of lipofuscin.

Fluorophores are another important component of lipofuscin structure. Its 400nm to 700nm fluorescence emission spectrum is a testament to its tissue-to-tissue variability.

The continuous net positive gain of intracellular lipofuscin can have a dramatic effect on the lysosomal structure. As seen in the work of Sitte and collaborators, progressive formation within fibroblast lysosomes and spillover into the cytoplasm can cause a toxic effect, hastening apoptosis.
