The internal carotid arteries (ICAs) develop from the third aortic arches, the dorsal aortae, and a plexiform primordial vascular network near the developing fore- and mid-brain.

The primitive ICAs divide into cranial (forerunner of the future anterior cerebral artery) and caudal divisions (precursor of the Pcom A). The cranial divisions initially end as the primitive olfactory arteries and ultimately give rise to the definitive anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs), and to the anterior choroidal and middle cerebral arteries. The anterior communicating artery (ACom A) is formed from a plexiform vascular network that coalesces in the midline and connects the two developing anterior cerebral arteries.

The caudal ICA divisions anastomose with the dorsal longitudinal neural arteries. Normally, the caudal divisions regress to form the posterior communicating arteries (PCom As) while the paired dorsal longitudinal neural arteries fuse in the midline to become the basilar artery. The vertebral arteries arise from the coalescing of the cervical intersegmental arteries and later anastomose with the basilar artery. As the definitive vertebral-basilar circulation matures, it annexes the posterior cerebral arteries and their proximal connections to the anterior circulation partially involute.
