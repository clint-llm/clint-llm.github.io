Careful patient selection, combined with the management of patient expectations is essential to maximizing visual outcomes and patient satisfaction. Patients should receive information regarding the risks and benefits of SMILE, and informed consent is necessary. Providing patients information on what they might expect to hear, feel, see, and smell during the procedure may serve to reduce patients’ anxiety. Patients’ medical history should be screened for any contraindications, as listed above. Most importantly, patients should only be selected if they have realistic expectations of postoperative visual outcomes. It should be made clear to patients that the goal of laser refractive surgery is not to obtain the complete absence of refractive error but rather lessen one’s reliance on glasses and contacts.

An extensive preoperative evaluation is necessary to identify potential contraindications to laser refractive surgery. Eyelids and tear film require an examination for signs of dry eye or blepharitis. The patient’s refraction, including refractive stability, degree of refractive error, and astigmatism, should be obtained. Both manifest and cycloplegic refraction are necessary; disparities between these two values greater than 1 D of sphere warrants reevaluation. The clinician should inspect the cornea for scars, vessels, or signs of inflammation. Pupil size requires measurement with the commercial pupillometer. The slit-lamp examination allows for the identification of corneal abnormalities such as keratoconus, neovascularization, scarring, or the presence of a cataract. Corneal pachymetry is an excellent screening tool for patients with corneal thinning disorders. Computed corneal topography additionally allows for the detection of keratoconus and irregular astigmatism. Intraocular pressure should be obtained to identify uncontrolled glaucoma. Fundoscopy rules out the presence of retinal holes, degenerative retina, and other types of macular disease. Computed videokeratography identifies early keratoconus, corneal warpage, and asymmetrical or irregular astigmatism.

Immediately before SMILE, topical antibiotics, and topical proparacaine, 0.5% gets instilled in both eyes. Excessive instillation of topical anesthetic should be avoided as this may loosen the corneal epithelium and increase the risk for the formation of black spots and epithelial defects.
