Cancer immunotherapy has greatly advanced in recent years, with CAR-T cells emerging as an innovative technology that harnesses the immune system to combat malignant diseases. An interprofessional team is needed to recognize and appropriately manage CAR-T AEs, including but not limited to neurology, critical care, and infectious diseases subspecialties. Most centers alert the neurology team for a neurological evaluation of the patient prior to the CAR-T administration. Efforts should be aimed at providing accommodation to the patients traveling far from home for CAR-T and assisting with out-of-pocket costs.

Patient prerequisites that are fundamental for managing complications of HSCT post-discharge are also relevant to successful CAR-T, including socioeconomic and caregiver support and patient staying within a 1-hour transportation distance from the hospital for at least four weeks post-infusion.
