Managing patients with portal hypertension is challenging due to the complexity of the disease and multiple organ involvement. For this reason, the management is multidisciplinary with an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals required including a nurse, nurse practitioner, pharmacist, primary care physician, gastroenterologist, a hepatologist, and a transplant team with the possible need of a cardiologist and a pulmonologist, depending on the severity of the disease. All healthcare workers should follow these patients and monitor them. Pharmacists should ensure that they are on the correct medications and are taking them correctly and are medication compliant, reporting any issues to the clinicians. Nurses will take care of these patients during their visits to the clinic or at the hospital if they get admitted. They will check their vitals, diet, and are the first to notice any changes in their mental status or hemodynamics. Clinicians should follow up with these patients on regular basis and make sure they are up to date on their immunizations, appropriate screening such as for esophageal varices and hepatocellular carcinoma, diet, medications, functional status, and mental health. Without proper management from an interprofessional team, the morbidity and mortality from portal hypertension are high.
