Most severe complications of sacral neuromodulation are associated with lead migration, implant site pain, or infection.

The most common concern is that the patient no longer receives a benefit from the therapy. The neurostimulator should be interrogated to confirm it is turned ON. Resistances of the electrodes should be checked to rule out an open or short circuit. Assuming the device is on, and there is no short, the programs should be adjusted. The program encodes which electrodes are active, including the frequency, amplitude, and pulse width of stimulation.

Lead migration or improper placement is possible and can be identified with an X-ray. Lead revision surgery may be required but should be used only as a last resort.

Sacral bilateral electrical pudendal nerve stimulation has been used successfully in patients who, after initial success, eventually fail standard sacral neuromodulation.
