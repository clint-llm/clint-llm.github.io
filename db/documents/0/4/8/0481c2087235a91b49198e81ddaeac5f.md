Odontogenic cysts are frequently identified on routine examinations with head and neck imaging such as orthopantomograms and computed tomography (CT). Clinicians must obtain a complete medical history and perform a thorough head and neck exam on all patients. In evaluating odontogenic cysts, the clinical examination and interpretation of radiographic studies are essential phases; however, tooth vitality testing is equally important. Tooth vitality testing is required in formulating an appropriate differential diagnosis for odontogenic cysts. This step is essential in determining treatment and ultimately guides patient outcomes. This activity reviews the most common odontogenic cysts, etiologies, appropriate therapies and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating, managing, and treating patients with these entities.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical and radiographic presentation of common odontogenic cysts.
- Review the potential etiologies of the most common odontogenic cysts.
- Identify methods to differentiate the most common odontogenic cysts from one another and formulate appropriate differential diagnoses of radiolucency lesions on a radiographic exam.

- Summarize the appropriate treatment modalities for the most common odontogenic cysts.
