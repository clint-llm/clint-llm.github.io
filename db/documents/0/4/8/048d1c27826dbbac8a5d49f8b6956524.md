Fibrinogen is a 340kDa hexameric plasma glycoprotein synthesized by the liver and is the major structural component of a clot. The type of fibrinogen disorders that require replacement therapy can be congenital or acquired. There can be an abnormality in the amount or function of circulating fibrinogen. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of fibrinogen replacement so that providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the different forms of fibrinogen replacement therapy.
- Summarize the indications for initiating fibrinogen replacement therapy.
- Explain the monitoring that must take place when administering fibrinogen replacement therapy.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance fibrinogen therapy and improve outcomes.
