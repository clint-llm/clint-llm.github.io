Atrial fibrillation is commonly associated with conditions that alter the structure of the heart. Important causes and risk factors for AF are as follows:

**Cardiac Causes**

- Hypertensive heart disease

- Coronary artery disease

- Valvular heart disease

- Heart failure

- Congenital heart disease

- Cardiomyopathy

- Infiltrative cardiac disease

- Sick sinus syndrome

- Pre-excitation syndrome

**Non-Cardiac Causes**

- Chronic lung disease

- Pulmonary embolism

- Electrolyte abnormalities

- Acute infections

- Thyroid disorders

- Pheochromocytoma

- Hypothermia

- Post-surgical (seen in 35% to 50% of patients post coronary artery bypass graft)

**Risk Factors**

- Age-related fibrosis

- Diabetes

- Obesity

- Metabolic syndrome

- Obstructive sleep apnea

- Chronic kidney disease

- High-intensity exercise

- Genetic factors
