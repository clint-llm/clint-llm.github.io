A patient's history rarely is obtained on the scene of a pregnant trauma patient in arrest. If any information can be gathered, the prehospital provider should focus primarily on three questions, and later on a secondary history including allergies, medication, past medical history, last meal intake, events of the accident, and prenatal care history. The first three pertinent questions are:

- How many fetuses are present in the uterus? This will allow adequate equipment and personnel preparation for multiple fetal resuscitations, if necessary.

- What is the estimated date of confinement (due date), last menstrual cycle, or estimated gestational age? This will help to determine the age of the fetus and subsequently the viability. Only a fetus of viable age should be considered to be delivered via perimortem cesarean section.

- Are any drugs present in the maternal system? This information can be utilized to direct antidote treatment of the fetus.
