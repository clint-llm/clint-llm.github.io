Postoperatively, pulmonary complications require extraordinary attention from the medical community, as they are a direct cause of morbidity and mortality. The incentive spirometer can be easily used in pulmonary rehabilitation as a tool in inspiratory muscle training to reduce or prevent postoperative pulmonary complications and exercise the lungs. This activity reviews the use of the incentive spirometer in inspiratory muscle training and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, treating, and managing the care of patients who meet the criteria to receive pulmonary rehabilitation.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the proper use of an incentive spirometer.
- Identify indications for incentive spirometry and inspiratory muscle training.
- Review anatomy and physiology of lungs and diaphragm during inspiration.
- Outline the clinical significance inspiratory muscle training has on pulmonary complication prevention by an interprofessional team.
