Penetrating trauma can occur as a result of intentional or accidental acts. While most penetrating injuries are due to firearms or stab wounds, additional mechanisms also exist; penetration of blunt objects (sticks, metal bars, etc.) have transpired following falls and high-speed motor vehicle accidents. While chest and abdominal trauma are more common, groin trauma must not be ignored or forgotten. Gastrointestinal and genitourinary organs are at risk of injury. Major vascular structures traverse the groin, and injuries can result in significant morbidity and mortality.
