There are several different rubber band ligation systems available. Some banders utilize a grasp, while others use suction to pull internal hemorrhoids into the banding instrument. With some devices, an atraumatic clamp is used to retract mucosa and redundant hemorrhoidal tissue at the apex of the bundle into the applicator, where a small rubber band is placed.
