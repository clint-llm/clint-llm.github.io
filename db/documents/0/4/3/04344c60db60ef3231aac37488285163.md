In extremity development, the apical ectodermal ridge forms at the most distal end of the limb bud. This apical ectodermal ridge through its interaction with the underlying progress zone mesoderm subsequently determines appropriate longitudinal growth of the extremity, as well as differentiation of distal and proximal structures of the limb bud. Cell death due to apoptosis from any cause such as vascular insufficiency or drug toxicity that interrupts this relationship between the apical ectodermal ridge and the progress zone can result in phocomelia.
