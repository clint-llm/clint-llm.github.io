Vitamin A toxicity can occur from either the topical or oral form of Vitamin A. Each has its own set of adverse effects. Oral vitamin A toxicity can be acute or chronic. In acute toxicity, ingestion occurs because of the ingestion of a large amount of vitamin A over a short period of time. In chronic toxicity, intake is over a longer duration. The most common adverse effect of topical retinoids is skin irritation, notably erythema and peeling. The most severe adverse effect of systemic retinoids is teratogenicity. Each year, in the US alone over 60,000 cases of Vitamin toxicity are reported. Unlike the water-soluble vitamins, the fat-soluble vitamins tend to accumulate in the body.
