There are multiple compression neuropathies of the upper extremity. Some neuropathies, like carpal tunnel, are quite common; others like posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) syndrome are not. Knowledge of the anatomy and function of each nerve is essential to diagnose which nerve and compression site is involved correctly. The posterior interosseous nerve is a branch of the radial nerve, which comes off the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. The posterior interosseous nerve supplies motor innervation to the posterior forearm. The terminal branch of the posterior interosseous nerve travels distally into the floor of the 4th dorsal compartment of the wrist to innervate the dorsal wrist capsule. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of posterior interosseous nerve syndrome and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of injury and pathophysiology of posterior interosseous nerve syndrome.
- Outline the evaluation and examination techniques necessary to properly diagnose posterior interosseous nerve syndrome.
- Review the potential treatment and management options available for posterior interosseous nerve syndrome.
- Explain strategies to optimize care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by posterior interosseous nerve syndrome.
