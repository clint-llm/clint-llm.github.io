Patients with juvenile open-angle glaucoma may initially present to the emergency department physician, primary care provider, or other medical providers. Good communication between health care providers is necessary to improve the patient's vision outcomes. These patients should receive a referral to an ophthalmologist for definitive diagnosis and treatment planning. The prognosis depends on the time of diagnosis and the treatment received. Practice patterns should be developed and followed so that this disease can be recognized early, preventing irreversible loss of vision.
