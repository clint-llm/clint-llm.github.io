TCD allows for non-invasive interrogation of intracranial structures such as the vasculature. Since this technique is based on ultrasound imaging, it is non-ionizing and can be performed portably; therefore, it is a good option for ICU patients who need repeat testing, may be difficult to move, and clinical neurologic examination may be limited. In the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage, daily TCD testing can be performed to monitor for signs of vasospasm.Â  This allows for prompt identification and treatment of vasospasm to prevent delayed cerebral ischemia.

**Implications for Sickle Cell Disease**

Based on the American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for sickle cell disease, TCD is recommended as an annual screening exam for children with HbSS.
