The care of Muslim patients requires meeting the needs of specific cultures and beliefs. Islam provides spiritual guidance as well as an emphasis on maintaining health. Islamic beliefs affect Muslim patients' attitudes and behavior. It is important for healthcare professionals to have an understanding of these issues to provide culturally appropriate care. However, it is important for medical practitioners to remember that preservation of life overrides guidelines; in a life-threatening situation, there are no restrictions on medications or surgical interventions. Muslims believe Allah (God) preserves life, even if a health professional provides care. When caring for a Muslim patient, professionals should strive to understand that a Muslim patient may or may not be following recommended treatment because of his or her religious beliefs.
