**Imaging**

Computed tomography (CT) is the diagnostic method of choice in splanchnic vein thrombosis. In cases of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, the first study to perform is typically a Doppler ultrasound. Doppler ultrasound is less costly and more comfortable to achieve than CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

In portal vein thrombosis, Doppler ultrasound shows hyperechoic material in the portal vein. There could be a decrease or even absence of flow to the portal vein, based on the thrombus caliber. The mesenteric or splenic vein can also be enlarged since they merge to make the hepatic portal vein. If portal vein thrombosis is strongly suspected, it is best to omit the ultrasound and start with a CT scan or MRI of the abdomen (CT scan is preferred over MRI).  CT scan of the abdomen shows thrombus as a densely packed vein. CT scan is also additionally beneficial since it shows other pathology that might be present such as a cancerous tumor. Another diagnostic tool for portal vein thrombosis is angiography. Angiography is not as frequently considered as a CT or MRI. It is a more invasive evaluation that is mostly used when planning for shunt surgery.

Doppler ultrasound is the best initial diagnostic test in cases with a suspicion of splenic vein thrombosis when considering all these facts. A normal splenic vein doppler will make the diagnosis of splenic vein thrombosis highly improbable.

In mesenteric venous thrombosis, studies have shown that a CT scan of the abdomen has 90 percent accuracy. In cases where CT scan is nondiagnostic, it is suggested to do CT angiography. Magnetic resonance (MR) venography is the most reliable imaging for mesenteric venous thrombosis. However, most cases can be seen on a CT scan without the use of MR venography.

Doppler ultrasound diagnoses hepatic venous thrombosis, and a CT scan of the abdomen or MRI will confirm it. Doppler shows hyperechoic material in hepatic vein and other findings such as hepatomegaly, ascites, or hepatic lobe atrophy.

**Laboratory**

It is essential to check for coagulation defects in anyone with thrombosis and, most specifically, patients with portal vein thrombosis without cirrhosis.

**Endoscopy**

An upper endoscopy is needed in cases of hematemesis or upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopy will check and confirm variceal bleeding. Patients with portal vein thrombosis and cirrhosis will be monitored for varices (esophageal or gastric) by endoscopy. This fact holds accurate about patients with splenic vein thrombosis.
