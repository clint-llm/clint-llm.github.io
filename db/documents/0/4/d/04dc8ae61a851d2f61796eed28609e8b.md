Patients with gallstone ileus should be educated regarding their disease process and the importance of close follow-up with their providers. They should be made aware of the signs and symptoms of common postoperative complications and be advised to seek care immediately should any of these develop. Patients should also be encouraged to maintain a healthy weight by eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise.
