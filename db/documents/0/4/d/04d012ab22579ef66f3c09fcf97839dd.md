Differential diagnoses of hemolytic uremic syndrome include several other conditions that may present with hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury.

- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP is thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by a pentad of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction, fever, and neurological dysfunction. It is due to deficiency or mutation in "a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif member 13" (ADAMTS13) and usually has the adult-onset of symptoms.

- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): DIC is the systemic activation of the coagulation cascade and is characterized by abnormal coagulation studies, including prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time and elevated D dimer and fibrin degradation products which are usually normal in HUS. Patient with DIC usually has a very serious underlying illness like septic shock, trauma, malignancy, etc.

- HELLP syndrome: It is characterized by hemolysis of red blood cells, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count occurring in pregnancy and severe preeclampsia.

- Systemic vasculitis: These patients typically present with inflammatory signs like fever, rash, and arthralgia, and lack prodromal diarrhea.
