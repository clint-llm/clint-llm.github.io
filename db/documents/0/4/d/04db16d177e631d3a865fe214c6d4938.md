**Common Side-effects of Antitubercular Drugs**

- Isoniazid: hepatitis, toxic neuropathy, headache

- Rifampicin: red/orange colored urine, arthralgias

- Pyrazinamide: painful joints due to hyperuricemia

- Ethambutol: optic neuropathy

**Side-effect Management**

- Hepatotoxicity can occur with isoniazid, rifampicin, or pyrazinamide. Hence, liver function tests (LFT) should be performed every two months. The offending drugs should be stopped immediately if the LFT is abnormal.

- Pyridoxine is used to prevent peripheral neuropathy, which can occur due to isoniazid or ethambutol.

- Ethambutol use can result in optic atrophy. Visual acuity and color vision should be checked before starting ethambutol with regular monitoring for deterioration in the vision.
