Carbon monoxide toxicity occurs after breathing in excessive levels of carbon monoxide. This is a tasteless, odorless, and colorless gas and victims are usually unconscious before they realize they are being poisoned. Patients may have a headache, weakness, dizziness, and nausea along with tachycardia and tachypnea. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of carbon monoxide toxicity and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of carbon monoxide toxicity.
- Review the use of arterial blood gas samples with co-oximetry analysis in the evaluation of carbon monoxide toxicity.
- Explain the use of supplemental oxygen in the treatment of carbon monoxide toxicity.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to enhance the delivery of care for patients with carbon monoxide toxicity.
