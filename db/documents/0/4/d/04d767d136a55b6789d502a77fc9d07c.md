Nitisinone should be administered with a diet strictly low in phenylalanine and tyrosine. Serum levels of phenylalanine and tyrosine should be monitored continuously in patients treated with nitisinone. Phenylalanine should be restricted in the diet because it is a precursor amino acid to tyrosine when it is metabolized by phenylalanine hydroxylase. A deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase is the cause of phenylketonuria (PKU).

NTBC causes an elevation of tyrosine in the blood, which is thought to be the cause of many adverse effects. Laboratory studies have shown that a restrictive diet of phenylalanine alone was ineffective in preventing NTBC-induced tyrosinemia. However, the same studies proved that concurrent restriction of phenylalanine and tyrosine significantly reduces NTBC-induced tyrosinemia. A diet utterly restrictive of protein, composed of amino acids, also considerably reduced tyrosinemia after NTBC therapy.

Because of the potential ocular adverse effects of nitisinone treatment, a slit-lamp exam should be done before beginning treatment. Patients experiencing keratopathy or other ocular manifestations should be subjected to slit-lamp examination. A previous study showed that corneal keratopathy could occur asymptomatically in patients treated with nitisinone.

Due to potential hematological side effects such as thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, platelet and white blood cell counts should be monitored. This is especially true of patients presenting with signs and symptoms of hematological pathology.
