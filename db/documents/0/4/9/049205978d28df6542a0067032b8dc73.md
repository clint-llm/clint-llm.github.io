The primary concern with propofol toxicity is the development of fatal conditions.  Hypertriglyceridemia can lead to pancreatitis.  Metabolic acidosis can develop, leading to other derangements.  Cardiac failure and rhabdomyolysis are significant concerns for propofol toxicity.  If PRIS continues without any timely intervention, the condition can be fatal.  Some complications correlate with complex multimodal treatment options.
