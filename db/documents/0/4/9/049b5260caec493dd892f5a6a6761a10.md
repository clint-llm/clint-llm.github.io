Almost all patients with juvenile absence epilepsy have absence seizures, while generalized tonic-clonic seizures are seen in about 79 to 95% of patients, and myoclonic jerks are seen in 21 to 39% of patients.

Absence seizures are characterized by sudden impairment of consciousness and may be combined with mild clonic, atonic, tonic components, or automatisms. In JAE, these are typically described as non-pyknoleptic absences where they occur infrequently (less than every day). Patients with myoclonic jerks may overlap with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.
