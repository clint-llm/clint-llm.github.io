Histologically, MAC can mimic infiltrative/morpheaform basal cell carcinoma, desmoplastic squamous cell carcinoma, desmoplastic trichoepithelioma, trichoadenoma, and syringoma.

Histopathological examination reveals small basaloid cells/keratocysts on the top, hence the term “microcystic.” This is a key feature. On higher power, one can see cords and strands of basaloid epitheloid cells displaying ductal lumina that invade the dermis and subdermis. There is also fibrotic stroma. A key feature in distinguishing MAC from other tumors is a zone of separation between the epidermis and tumor. Additionally, the ductal structures distinguish MAC from desmoplastic trichoepithelioma and trichoadenoma.

MAC is distinguished from morpheaform basal cell carcinoma and desmoplastic squamous cell carcinoma based on ductal differentiation.

**Immunohistochemistry**

- Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is utilized in the pathologic evaluation of MAC to help support the diagnosis. In particular, the carcinoembryonic antigen stain (CEA) is positive in approximately 50% of MAC cases. This helps distinguish MAC from basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, where CEA is negative.

**Stains**

- Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain is the standard stain used in the diagnosis of MAC.
