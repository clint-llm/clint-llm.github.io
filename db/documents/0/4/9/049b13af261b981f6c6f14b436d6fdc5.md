Hantavirus begins with a prodromal phase of approximately 3 to 4 days of vague, flu-like symptoms. Nausea, vomiting, thrombocytopenia, dizziness, and dyspnea without a cough may help distinguish hantavirus from acute respiratory distress syndrome or other atypical and viral types of pneumonia. After the prodromal phase, there can be rapid development into hantavirus characterized by pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, tachycardia, and hypotension. This often occurs within 48 hours and rapidly turns to respiratory failure. Patients often will develop metabolic acidosis due to severe infection. Orthostatic hypotension can quickly progress to cardiogenic shock with cardiovascular decompensation. Patients with the renal disease could develop oliguria followed by diuresis. Pulmonary auscultation may demonstrate rales. Descent into the pulmonary syndrome carries a mortality rate of around 50% to 70%.

Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever and renal syndrome have five distinct phases: Febrile, Hypotensive, Oliguric, Polyuric, and Convalescent. The incubation period is approximately 2 to 4 weeks and starts abruptly with a high fever, headache, vomiting, abdominal pain, and back pain often associated with blurred vision and somnolence. The high fever is typically present for 3 to 7 days and ends with conjunctival hemorrhages and palatal petechiae. Hypotension is then present for the next several hours to 2 days, with approximately one-third of HFRS deaths due to fulminant, irreversible shock during this phase. If the hemorrhagic disease becomes severe, bleeding may present as hematemesis, epistaxis, melena, hematuria, and possibly fatal intracranial hemorrhages. Oliguria will last for 3 to 7 days with a transient decrease in renal function accompanied by back or abdominal pain that may need dialysis. Approximately half of the deaths from HFRS occur during the oliguric phase. The polyuric phase is a positive prognostic sign with evidence that renal function is improving and urinary output will increase up to several liters per day. Full recovery with return to baseline clinical and laboratory markers is reached over the next 6 months without significant long-term complications.
