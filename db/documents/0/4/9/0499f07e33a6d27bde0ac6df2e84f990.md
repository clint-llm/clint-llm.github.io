The cause of EED is not well understood, but it is thought to be secondary to immune complex deposition in dermal blood vessels, which results in complement fixation and subsequent inflammation. The findings appreciated on examination of the skin may be seen due to deposition of immune complexes in small vessels, which leads to activation of complement, the influx of neutrophils, and the emission of destructive enzymes. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies may be pathogenic in EED. Furthermore, the initiation of EED may occur via activation of cytokines (interleukin-8), which causes selective recruitment of leukocytes to blood vessels. This leads to repetitive damage to the vessels and ultimately develops into fibrosis.
