Culturally responsive health care is not a matter of clear formulas or prescriptions that provide a single conclusive answer. Instead, it needs awareness of the founding valuesÂ of health care and how those principles can be affected by culture. Education may affect the health and health care of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. From its founding years, the growth, significance, and importance of multicultural health care are crucial. In postgraduate clinical education, knowledge of community needs, traditions, and values should be integrated.

- Establish formal, coordinated advocacy or joint initiative with organizations such as AAMC and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) to facilitate substantial increases in the proportion of students and residents of medical schools who are people of AI/AN tribes and in the ration who choose primary care and, eventually, hospitalist professions.

- Collect accurate racial, ethnic, and gender data about AI/AN members and consider working with IHS to integrate demographic concerns into its survey tool for individual hospital compensation and productivity data. Regulate the Practice Study Committee in charge of the survey to continue surveying the demographics of the leadership.

- 
              
- Consider formal expansion opportunities by 2022 via ACGME.

- Implement a public relations initiative to highlight the under-representation of AI/AN hospitalists in management roles to health systems and other employers and to inspire deliberate efforts to expand those ranks.

- Build scholarships to attend SHM-sponsored leadership development programs such as Academic Hospitalist Academy, Leadership Academy, and Quality and Safety Educators Academy for hospitalists from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups to grow their ranks in positions of authority in healthcare.

- Establish an educational route, mentoring program, or other development initiatives for new hospitalist leaders and those interested in improving leadership abilities.

- Ensure that initiatives to increase the proportion of AI/AN hospitalists in leadership roles are given special attention.

- Evaluate and review current SHM papers and position statements to ensure that diversity, equality, and inclusion are discussed, all about the staff and leadership in hospital medicine, patient care, and eliminating health inequalities.

- Establish non-profit organizations-led healthcare programs to serve primary care and specialized needs in remote AI/AN communities.

- 
              
- Lobby for federal funding and secondary fundings.

- Build culturally competent clinical guidelines for treating AI/AN patients, ensuring preventative measures are taken:

- 
              
- Nutritionist and dietitian coverage
              
              
- Annual glucose checkup
              
              
- Early digestive and other cancer screening
