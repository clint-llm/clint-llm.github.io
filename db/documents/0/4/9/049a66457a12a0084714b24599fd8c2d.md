On histopathologic examination, interstitial lung disease associated with collagen vascular disease includes usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP), and apical fibrosis.

Usual interstitial pneumonia appears as architectural distortion, fibrosis with honeycombing, and fibroblastic foci. There are heterogeneous areas of fibrosis interspersed with normal lung parenchyma.

Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia can be classified as the cellular or fibrotic type, depending on the degree of interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. There is diffuse cellular inflammation in a homogenous pattern with patchy intervening lung tissue and preservation of lung architecture.

Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia appears as intraluminal organizing fibrosis in the distal airspaces with patchy preservation of lung architecture and mild chronic interstitial inflammation.

Diffuse alveolar damage appears as alveolar edema, hyaline membranes, and fibroelastic proliferation with little mature collagen.

Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia appears as infiltration of T-lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages with lymphoid hyperplasia.

Acute lupus pneumonitis may appear as alveolar damage and necrosis, leading to inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, and hyaline membrane formation. Histopathologic findings are commonly those of usual interstitial pneumonia or nonspecific interstitial pneumonia.

In rheumatoid arthritis, interstitial pneumonitis and fibrosis are the most common manifestations.

Systemic sclerosis frequently involves pulmonary fibrosis in both limited and diffuse forms of the disease, secondary to nonspecific interstitial pneumonia or usual interstitial pneumonia, and follicular bronchiolitis or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is occasionally seen.

Although diffuse interstitial pneumonitis is uncommon in systemic lupus erythematosus, histopathologic findings are those of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia or usual interstitial pneumonia.

Interstitial lung disease associated with polymyositis or dermatomyositis may manifest as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, usual interstitial pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, or diffuse alveolar damage, each of which determines a different prognosis. Diffuse alveolar damage and usual interstitial pneumonia portend a worse prognosis (30% survival at 5 years), contrary to those with cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or nonspecific interstitial pneumonia.

Mixed connective tissue disease may demonstrate interstitial fibrosis secondary to usual interstitial pneumonia or nonspecific interstitial pneumonia.

Sjogren’s syndrome most commonly presents with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, characterized by diffuse interstitial infiltration of lymphoplasma cells, often with mild fibrosis.
