Iron Dextran is an injectable low-molecular-weight ferric hydroxide complex indicated for patients with iron deficiency anemia where oral iron therapy is ineffective or poorly tolerated. It is particularly useful in iron deficiency resulting from excessive iron loss (e.g., hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, excessive blood loss, etc.) or iron malabsorption (e.g., Crohn disease, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, gastric bypass, etc.). Appropriate uses also include iron deficiency anemia resulting from menometrorrhagia, pregnancy, and surgical blood loss.
