Sleep is the natural periodic suspension of consciousness characterized by lessened consciousness and slowed metabolism. The sleep-wake cycle is one of the most important circadian rhythms, which alternates in a lawful periodic fashion lasting for about 24 hours. Sleep is characterized by relative immobility and reduced responsiveness to environmental stimuli. This in contrast to the state of wakefulness which is characterized by presumably purposeful motor activity and the ability to respond to environmental stimuli appropriately. This activity reviews the electroencephalographic (EEG) findings of normal sleep patterns as well as abnormal sleep and discusses the role of the interprofessional team in educating patients on when it may be necessary to seek professional intervention if abnormal sleep patterns develop.

**Objectives:**
- Explain natural sleep.
- Describe and compare sleep versus wakefulness.
- Review normal sleep patterns compared to abnormal sleep on an EEG.
- Outline EEG normal sleep patterns as well as abnormal sleep and address the role of the interprofessional team in educating patients on when it may be necessary to seek professional intervention if abnormal sleep patterns develop.
