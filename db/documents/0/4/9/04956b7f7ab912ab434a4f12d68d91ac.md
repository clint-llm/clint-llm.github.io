While accurate assessment of intravascular volume status is best accomplished through various methods, CRT can provide rapid and practical information regarding peripheral perfusion status without the associated patient inconvenience, cost, or time delay associated with more conventional markers. As demonstrated by the ANDROMEDA-SHOCK trial, its utility extends beyond diagnostic purposes and may be used to guide fluid resuscitation strategies in unstable patients. While interpretation is subject to external factors and examiner variability, developing newer technologies to measure CRT emphasizes its usefulness and emerging role in medicine.

Capillary refill time is an easily performed and interpreted examination, and all interprofessional team members should at least be knowledgeable regarding the importance and interpretation of results. This includes clinicians, specialists, mid-level practitioners, and nurses, all sharing information and coordinating activities to optimize patient outcomes. [Level 5]
