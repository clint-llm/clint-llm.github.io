An aspergilloma is a fungus ball or mycetoma composed of Aspergillus hyphae along with cellular debris and mucus. It is a noninvasive type of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. Aspergillus species colonize the preexisting cavity in the lung parenchyma and form a fungus cavity. This activity describes the presentation and management of aspergilloma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Aspergillus infection in pulmonary and extrapulmonary sites.
- Outline the typical and atypical clinical presentation of a patient with aspergilloma.
- Review the treatment and management options available for pulmonary and extrapulmonary aspergilloma.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to manage aspergilloma and improve outcomes.
