An open fracture is an injury where the fractured bone and/or fracture hematoma are exposed to the external environment via a traumatic violation of the soft tissue and skin. The skin wound may lie at a site distant to the fracture and not directly over it. Therefore, any fracture that has a concomitant wound should be considered open until proven otherwise.
