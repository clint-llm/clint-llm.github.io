Patient preparation must be carried out considering that the procedure, although well-tolerated and safe in most cases, can still lead to serious complications:

- Informed Consent: Before conducting the intervention,Â informed consent is mandatory for getting permission. It must contain details of the procedure and possible complications (possibly with frequency).

- An intravenous line may be placed.

- Aseptic technique should be maintained throughout the procedure.

- Positioning: The patient's position depends on the procedure to be performed.

- Sedation: Although sedation by hypnotics may be necessary for certain painful acts such as chemical neurolysis, excessive sedation of the patient should be avoided to allow patients to remain alert enough to report symptoms suggestive of any complication.
