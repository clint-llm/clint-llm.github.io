Starting zinc supplements within 24 hours after cold symptoms begin may reduce the symptoms and make the symptoms less severe. Experts do not recommend supplementation beyond the RDA. Food sources include beef, pork, lamb, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and yeast. Zinc is in most multivitamins and mineral supplements. Zinc is present in some over-the-counter medicines, such as cold lozenges, nasal sprays, and nasal gels. The best way to get the daily requirements is to eat a balanced diet that contains a variety of foods.

The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) is the average daily level of intake that is sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97 to  98%) healthy people. The adequate intake (AI) is the level established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA. The following is the case for zinc:

**Infants (AI)**

- 0 to 6 months: 2 mg per day (mg/day)

- 7 to 12 months: 3 mg/day

**Children (RDA)**

- 7 to 12 months: 3 mg/day

- 1 to 3 years: 3 mg/day

- 4 to 8 years: 5 mg/day

- 9 to 13 years: 8 mg/day

- Supplementation Dose: 5 to 20 mg/day

**Adolescents and Adults (RDA)**

- Males, ages 14 and over: 11 mg/day

- Females, ages 14 to 18: 9 mg/day

- Females, ages 19 and over: 8 mg/day

- Pregnant females, 19 years of age and over: 11 mg/day

- Lactating females, 19 years of age and over: 12 mg/day
