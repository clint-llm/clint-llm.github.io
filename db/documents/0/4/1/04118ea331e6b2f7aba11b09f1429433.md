In emergencies and before crossmatch compatible blood components are available, group O red cells and group AB plasma (some facilities use group A plasma) can be transfused appropriately. A properly labeled blood sample from the intended recipient before transfusion is critical to safe blood transfusion. Most hemolytic transfusion reactions are caused by misidentification of the patient or labeling errors of blood samples.

**Selection of appropriate red cell units:**Recipients should receive ABO and Rh D identical or compatible units unless warranted. In situations where Rh D negative units are unavailable, Rh D positive units may be given to men and women over reproductive age after they have been determined to lack anti-D antibodies. Fresh red cell units (less than seven days old) should be selected for large-volume transfusions (> 25 ml/kg) in neonates.

Selection of other blood products: All plasma-containing components should be compatible with the recipient's red cells. All products containing more than 2 ml of red cells must be ABO compatible with the recipient's plasma. When RhD-positive products are given to RhD-negative recipients, RhIg should be administered.
