Obesity in orthopedics requires a multidisciplinary approach. There are several team members that can positively improve a patient's outcome and help manage obesity. This team includes a nutritionist, an endocrinologist or internal medicine doctor to manage related disorders such as thyroid disease or diabetes, a personal trainer, and in severe cases, a nurse who specializes in weight loss, a psychologist or therapist, a general surgeon who specializes in bariatric surgery.

Through interprofessional communication, these team members can maximize improved outcomes and enhance team performance. For example, a trainer may communicate that a patient is working out hours per day and the dietician also notes that the patient is eating a healthier diet. This communication to the endocrinologist may encourage them to do a further metabolic workup on the patient. Physical therapy may help the patient learn proper exercises to help recover from injuries that result from excessive weight-bearing. A systematic review has shown that the consultation of a dietician has been shown to improve dietary change, cholesterol, blood pressure, and triglycerides.

In summary, using interprofessional team strategies results in improved patient outcomes when addressing obesity-related orthopedic issues. [Level 5]
