The management of Bennet fracture is complex and best done with an interprofessional team that includes a hand surgeon or orthopedic surgeon, specialty care nurse, and physical therapist. When the fracture is encountered by the emergency department physician and nurse practitioner, it is important to refer the patient promptly to a hand surgeon. Poorly treated bennet fracture has very high morbidity. Even after adequate treatment, extensive rehabilitation is required. An orthopedic nurse provides patient and family education, assists with referrals, and provides status updates to the team. The outcomes for Bennet fracture are guarded.
