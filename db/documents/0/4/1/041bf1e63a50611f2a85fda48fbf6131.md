MacConkey agar (MAC) is a bacterial culture medium named after bacteriologist Alfred T. MacConkey (1861-1931). MacConkey agar is a selective and differentiating agar that only grows gram-negative bacterial species; it can further differentiate the gram-negative organisms based on their lactose metabolism.
