Lisinopril has been available for three decades and is a relatively safe medication for hypertension. It is often prescribed by primary care clinicians (including PAs and nurse practitioners), emergency department physicians, internists, and cardiologists. However, the drug does require monitoring. Potassium levels and renal function need periodic monitoring, which can be watched by both clinicians and nursing staff. Patients should understand to avoid high potassium diets, which is another area where counsel can be provided by clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists. Female patients also need to be aware of the potential adverse effects on pregnancy while taking lisinopril, so interprofessional counsel from clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists is vital for these patients. Pharmacists should also check for potential interactions and answer any patient questions. Thus, even though lisinopril is a common and well-tolerated drug, it still requires the efforts of an interprofessional team to optimize safety and therapeutic outcomes and minimize or prevent adverse events.
