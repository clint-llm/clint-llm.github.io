Patients with lupus nephritis already have varying clinical manifestations of SLE. These clinical symptoms include malar or discoid rash, fatigue, fever, rash, photosensitivity, serositis, oral ulcers, non-erosive arthritis, seizures, psychosis, or hematologic disorders. Lupus nephritis is diagnosed through laboratory findings, such as proteinuria or cellular casts. Typically, patients with lupus nephritis are asymptomatic. Some patients with lupus nephritis may develop polyuria, nocturia, foamy urine, hypertension, and edema. Early signs of proteinuria, which indicate tubular or glomerular dysfunction, are the presence of foamy urine or nocturia. If the degree of proteinuria meets the nephrotic syndrome criteria of more than 3.5 grams per day of protein excretion, then peripheral edema develops due to hypoalbuminemia. There may also be microscopic hematuria that is not grossly visible.

Some patients have an asymptomatic disease; however, in regular follow-up, laboratory abnormalities such as raised serum creatinine levels, hypoalbuminemia, or proteinuria or sediment indicate active lupus nephritis. This is frequently observed in mesangial or membranous lupus nephritis.

Symptoms seen in active lupus nephritis may include peripheral edema because of hypertension or hypoalbuminemia. Significant peripheral edema is more commonly seen in patients with diffuse or membranous lupus nephritis because these renal lesions have a remarkable association with heavy proteinuria.

Other symptoms that are directly linked to hypertension are commonly seen in diffuse lupus nephritis and they include dizziness, headache, visual disturbance, and signs of cardiac compromise.

The physical examination in focal and diffuse lupus nephritis may reveal evidence of generalized SLE with the presence of oral or nasal ulcers, a rash, synovitis, or serositis. Signs of active nephritis are common as well.

Signs of an isolated nephrotic syndrome are commonly seen in membranous lupus nephritis, such as peripheral edema, ascites, and pericardial pleural and effusions without hypertension.
