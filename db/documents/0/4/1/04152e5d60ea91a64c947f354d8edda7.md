The various structural anomalies of diabetic embryopathy resemble other various types of syndromes having similar defects.

**Neural Tube Defects (NTDs)**

NTDs are birth defects due to failure neural tube formation caused by several factors besides gestational or pre-existing diabetes in the mother. Folic acid deficiency is the major cause of NTDs. Other causes of NTDs include Vit B 12 deficiency and many other genetic syndromes.

**DiGeorge Syndrome**

TheÂ clinical presentation and structural defects can resemble that of diabetic embryopathy. Cardiac anomalies, facial dysmorphism, and impaired learning abilities mimic that of diabetic embryopathy complications.

**VACTERL**

It consists of **v**ertebral anomalies,**a**nal atresia,**c**ardiac defect,**t**racheo**e**sophageal fistula,**r**enal abnormalities, and/or**l**imb abnormalities. Maternal prenatal history of diabetes can help differentiate this condition from diabetic embryopathy.

**CHARGE Syndrome**

This disorder affects many organ systems of the body. It consists of **c**oloboma,**h**eart defects,**a**tresia choanae (also known as choanal atresia), growth**r**etardation,**g**enital abnormalities, and**e**ar abnormalities.
