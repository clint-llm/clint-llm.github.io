Studies on the embryologic development of the locus coeruleus within humans are limited. As the neural tube forms during embryonic development, it divides into segments called rhombomeres in the region of the hindbrain. In studies performed on mice, researchers discovered that the locus coeruleusÂ to originate from the dorsal alar rhombomere 1 (R1). The dorsal subcoeruleus (SubC) also predominantly arises from dorsal alar R1 (Oliveira et al., 2017). Brain development requires regulation via homeobox genes. A homeobox contains a DNA sequence that regulates embryological development and is involved in the segmental organization of the embryo. Engrailed (En) 1 is a homeobox gene that, when expressed, allows the migration of locus coeruleus and SubC to move from ventrocaudal to the basolateral position, placing the structures close to the fourth ventricle.
