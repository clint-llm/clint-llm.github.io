**Femoral Hernia**

Femoral hernias are the least common kind of groin hernia, accounting for between 20% and 31% of groin repairs in women and only 1% of groin repairs in men.

The typical clinical presentation of femoral hernia is a swelling inferior to the inguinal ligament and inferior and lateral to the pubic tubercle.

**Femoral Vascular Access**

The femoral vein is a relatively safe option for gaining central venous access when more proximal locations are less easily accessible. Ultrasound guidance helps reduce vascular bleeding by 60% when used for femoral vein cannulation.

**Node of Cloquet**

The node of Cloquet, which lies within the medial compartment of the femoral sheath (otherwise known as the femoral canal), is the junctional pointÂ between the external iliac lymph chain and the deep inguinal nodes.
