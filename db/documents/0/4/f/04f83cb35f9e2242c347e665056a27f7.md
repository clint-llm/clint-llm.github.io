At least two to three medical professionals are required to manage the airway for rapid sequence intubation. A clear delineation of roles is necessary for successful endotracheal intubation.Â The lead clinician is responsible for directing the team, managing the patient's airway, and intubating the patient.

A nursing staff member is responsible for providing induction and paralytic medications at the onset of the procedure. The nurse should wait for the clinician performing the intubation to give their approval prior to administering medications. An independently trained clinician that can procure equipment, operate the bag valve mask, apply cricoid pressure, and confirm tube placement after completion of the intubation should be at the bedside as well. Discussion and preparation for a backup plan in case of procedure failure should be addressed prior to the start of the procedure.
