A temporary transvenous pacemaker should be placed and kept for 2 or 3 days after the procedure. Dual arterial access should be obtained. A 6F or 7F left coronary guide catheter is used to engage the left main coronary artery, and another access is used to introduce a 5F or 6F pigtail catheter to LV for measurement of LV, LVOT, and aortic gradients. A coronary wire is advanced to the first septal perforator via a guide catheter in the left-main. Then, the wire balloon (OTW) is advanced over the wire and inflated at the proximal portion of the septal perforator to completely occlude the vessel.

After that, the dye is injected into the septal branch to ensure no reflux into the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and no collaterals supplied by this septal branch. Echocardiographic contrast dye is injected into the septal branch to spot the area of interest by a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). After delineating the targeted myocardium, 1 to 2 cc of absolute alcohol is injected into the septal perforator via OTW balloon. LV to the aorta and LVOT gradients are measured by pigtail and TTE, respectively. Another 1 to 2 cc alcohol infusion can be repeated if a <50% reduction in gradients is noted. The OTW balloon should be inflated for around 10 minutes after the last alcohol infusion. Then, a coronary angiogram is performed to view LAD for any unintended consequences.
