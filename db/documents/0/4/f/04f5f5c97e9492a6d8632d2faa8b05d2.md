The pathophysiology of PKU is primarily attributed to elevated levels of Phe and its metabolites such as the keto acid, phenylpyruvate. Decreased levels of Tyr may also play an adverse role since this amino acid is an important precursor of 3 catecholamine neurotransmitters: dopamine, norepinephrine, and adrenaline. Tyr is also a precursor of the skin pigment, melanin. Reduced Tyr can cause decreased melanin synthesis and light skin and hair. The precise molecular pathophysiological mechanisms giving rise to cognitive impairment in PKU are not fully understood.
