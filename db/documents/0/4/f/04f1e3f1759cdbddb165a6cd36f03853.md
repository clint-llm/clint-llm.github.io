C. diphtheria is a nonencapsulated, nonmotile, gram-positive bacillus that appears club-shaped and is arranged in palisades or V- or L- shaped formation. These are non-spore-forming gram-positive rods. Besides C. diphtheria, Corynebacterium ulcerans causes cutaneous diphtheria and, in rare cases, is the cause of respiratory diphtheria.
