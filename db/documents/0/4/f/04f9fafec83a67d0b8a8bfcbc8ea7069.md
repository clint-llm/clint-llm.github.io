The ulnar artery branches from the brachial artery shortly after it passes through the antecubital fossa. It then journeys medially toward the hand. In the distal forearm, it is located directly lateral to the ulnar nerve. As the ulnar artery nears Guyon canal, it gives off dorsal carpal branches and volar carpal branches supplying the carpal bones. After it travels through GuyonÂ canal, it contributes to the superficial and deep palmar arterial arches. These vessels eventually anastomose with superficial and deep palmar arches from the radial artery in the hand. Special consideration should be taken when surgery of the hand is performed due to anatomical variants of the superficial and deep palmar arches and their respective branches.

Venous and lymphatic vessels typically travel close to the arterial vessels.
