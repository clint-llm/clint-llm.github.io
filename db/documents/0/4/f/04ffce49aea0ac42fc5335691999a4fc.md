Adenomas are primarily located in the rectosigmoid region of the colon and might occasionally present in the proximal colon. Patients are commonly asymptomatic, and these growths are usually found on screening colonoscopies. If symptomatic, the most frequent symptom is hematochezia, i.e., painless bright or dark red blood per rectum on wiping or with bowel movements mixed with stools or dripping. Occasionally patients might have a history of alterations in bowel movements (either diarrhea or constipation), weight loss, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, symptoms of partial bowel occlusion, or iron deficiency anemia due to bleeding. A physical exam is usually non-contributory; however, clinicians may rarely find rectal polyps on the digital rectal exam.
