Atelectasis is usually a clinical diagnosis in a patient with known risk factors. If imaging is warranted, a chest X-ray, chest CT, and/or thoracic ultrasonography are useful in the diagnosis of atelectasis. A chest x-ray will reveal platelike, horizontal lines in the area of atelectatic lung tissue. Atelectasis is not typically evident on convention chest radiographs until it is significant.

On chest X-ray, atelectasis will result in the displacement of interlobar fissures, pulmonary opacification, and/or tracheal shift toward the affected side.

Chest CT often reveals dependent lung densities and loss of volume in the affected side of the chest.

Atelectasis may also be directly visible with fiberoptic bronchoscopy.   Fiberoptic bronchoscopy can be both diagnostic and therapeutic, often revealing the cause of any obstruction contributing to the atelectasis (i.e., tumor, mucous plug, or foreign body).

An arterial blood gas may reveal arterial hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis. The PaCO2 is often normal; however, it may be lower secondary to increased minute ventilation, which often accompanies atelectasis.
