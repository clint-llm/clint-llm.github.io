Early disease recognition and an adequate treatment strategy are the most important interventions to improve overall prognosis. In a current retrospective study of 319 patients from three tertiary care centers, recurrences and metastases occurred in 14.1% and 7.8% of the cases, respectively.

The 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 60% and 48%, respectively. Interestingly, in another publication, the 5-year disease-specific survival and recurrence rates were significantly worse in radiation-associated UPS than sporadic UPS, suggesting there might be distinct mutational profiles for the disease.

Follow-up visits are important to detect local recurrences or metastasis. Physical examination of stage I tumors should be performed at 3-to-6-month intervals for the first two years and then annually.
