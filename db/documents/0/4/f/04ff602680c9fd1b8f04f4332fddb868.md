All interprofessional healthcare team clinicians, including the primary care provider, mid-level practitioners (NP or PA), and emergency department physicians, need to know how to manage potential bleeding associated with warfarin. After prescribing warfarin, patients require education regarding the importance of regular follow-up, foods that can interact with warfarin, and when to seek medical help. The prescriber should enlist the services of a pharmacist to help "dial in" the warfarin dose, and inpatients often have their INR and dose adjustment handled by a pharmacist. Nurses must be aware of the signs of warfarin toxicity so that they can alert the attending/prescribing clinician. More importantly, interprofessional team members need to be mindful that there are other options today instead of warfarin, including the novel oral anticoagulant drugs, which are generally safer and require less intense monitoring. Given the potential severity of warfarin toxicity, there needs to be an interprofessional team approach to prescribing and managing warfarin, including clinicians, specialists, pharmacists, and nursing staff, so positive therapeutic benefit has the greatest chance with minimal adverse effects.
