The history and physical examination can help to elucidate the cause of air leaks.

**Symptoms**

The onset, duration, and location of symptoms and other associated signs should be elicited from the patient.

**History**

From the history, the clinician should be able to determine the underlying disease that caused the development of air leak syndrome.

Wheezing and difficulty breathing is highly suggestive of obstructive lung diseases like asthma and COPD.

Coughing, dyspnea, and fever might point towards pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Weight loss, hemoptysis, and nighttime fever might indicate tuberculosis or lung cancer. A history of recent thoracic surgery, especially procedures that involve the bronchi, lungs, and pleural cavity, might be related to the development of air leak and ALS.

In an intubated patient on mechanical ventilation at high settings, a sudden change in the clinical status of the patient, like the development of hypoxia, desaturation, and change in hemodynamics, might be related to the development of pneumothorax.

**Chief Complaint**

Most patients with pneumothorax will have a sudden onset of chest pain with dyspnea. If the pneumothorax is very large, the discomfort and respiratory distress might be severe.

**Physical Assessment**

The physical assessment of a patient with an air leak, ALS begins with an evaluation of the general appearance. If the air leak is small, the patient might be totally asymptomatic. The presence of moderate to large size pneumothorax might produce the following physical signs:

- Dyspnea

- Tachypnea

- Tachycardia

Subcutaneous emphysema produces a painless swelling of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Palpation of the skin produces the feeling of tissue paper in the hands. Subcutaneous emphysema may track deeper into the mediastinum, peritoneum, retroperitoneal space, scrotal wall, and even the extremities.

Percussion of the chest wall will elicit hyper-resonance in the area of the chest cavity filled with air. Auscultation might demonstrate diminished breath sounds or total absence if the pneumothorax is very large.
