The major variables governing the delayed weaning and extubation process have been observed to be related to the SBT timing and making the final call for extubation.

Protocol-based weaning extubation algorithm needs to be followed.

**Critical Components During the Weaning Process**

- Assessment of the readiness of the patients for extubation

- Safe tolerance of SBT

- Implementation of prophylactic NIV, and

- Monitoring of the patients after extubation.

**Various Clinical Parameters Governing the Safe Weaning Process**

- Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) since respiratory pump failure has been observed in almost 60% of mechanically ventilated patients.

- A cough peak flow between 55 and 65L/minute.

- Glasgow Coma Scale (motor score ≤5), prolonged ventilation (≥7 days), and copious secretion have a high risk of weaning and extubation failure.

- Elevated PaCO2 values during SBT have increased the odds of weaning failure.

- Adequate nutrition for the patient is crucial.

- Hypoalbuminemia and hypophosphatemia also delay the weaning process.
