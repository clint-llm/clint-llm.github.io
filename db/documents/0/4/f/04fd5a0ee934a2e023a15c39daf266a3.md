Ciguatera toxicity is the most common worldwide fish poisoning with up to 50,000 cases occur globally every year. This number is felt to be under-reported because most physicians do not realize that it is a reportable disease. While thought to be endemic to the South Pacific and Caribbean, it was recently isolated in the Red Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. It affects 3% of travelers to endemic regions.  It is the most common fish-related foodborne illness in the United States. Ciguatera toxicity is most commonly caused by eating barracuda, grouper, moray eel, amberjack, sea bass, sturgeon, parrotfish, surgeonfish, and red snapper.
