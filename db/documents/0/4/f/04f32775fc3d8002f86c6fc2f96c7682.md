Pancrelipase refers to a class of medications designed to treat malabsorption and abdominal pain secondary to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. These agents serve as exogenous versions of digestive hormones and enzymes required for normal digestion and are ingested with meals to improve digestion, absorption, and abdominal pain frequently seen in chronic pancreatitis and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Pancrelipase can be used in all age groups. FDA Indications include exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic surgery, or cystic fibrosis. There are also non-FDA-approved indications. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of pancrelipase, so providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes where pancrelipase is effective.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of pancrelipase.
- Review the approved and off-label indications for using pancrelipase.
- Identify the contraindications and adverse effects associated with pancrelipase use.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to properly use pancrelipase to improve patient outcomes in the varied scenarios where it can be effective.
