Here are some important points to take note of:

- Frotteurism is a rarely reported paraphilia and may not warrant treatment due to a lack of clinical impairment. However, in the case of Frotteuristic disorder or those with repeat offenses, or an associated history of violent sexual behaviors, the court may mandate treatment. This may also involve assessing the moral responsibility of the crime (of sexual assault) over a nonconsenting individual and thus is considered a criminal activity.

- The psychiatrist needs to be familiar with this paraphilic disorder, its diagnosis, and treatment. The psychiatrist may need to look at standard actuarial care assessments, as well as sex offender laws for the state.

- Most treatment options include case reports with relatively small sample sizes. Larger studies, including randomized-controlled trials (RCTâ€™s), may be helpful in a better understanding of this disorder.

- Victims may be explained that this behavior is considered a sex offense, and charges can be filed. Victims should be educated and encouraged to confront these individuals. Additional sexual deviant behaviors may warrant aggressive intervention, such as a formal entry in the sex offender registry.

- Ethical challenges regarding forced or coerced therapeutic interventions must be looked at and considered carefully.
