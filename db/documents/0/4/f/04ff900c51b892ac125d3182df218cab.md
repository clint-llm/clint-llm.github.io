Due to its cardiovascular risk, celecoxib is contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graph (CABG) surgery.

Celecoxib also contains a sulfonamide group and is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated severe allergic reactions to drugs with a sulfonamide group, e.g., sulfamethoxazole. Studies have shown that allergies to sulfonamide antimicrobials are indeed a risk factor for allergic reactions to the sulfonamide chemical group. Non-antimicrobial drugs that contain a sulfonamide chemical group such as celecoxib, a history of penicillin allergy is at least as strong a risk factor for an allergic reaction. Thus, providers should understand that this phenomenon is likely not solely due to cross-reactivity of sulfonamide-containing antimicrobials and non-antimicrobials and that certain patients have an increased propensity to celecoxib allergy if they are allergic to any antimicrobial drug.

Since CYP2C9 metabolizes celecoxib, its use requires caution in patients taking medicines that inhibit CYP2C9, for example, fluconazole, which is an antifungal drug.

Like all NSAIDs, celecoxib should not be taken after 29 weeks of pregnancy.
