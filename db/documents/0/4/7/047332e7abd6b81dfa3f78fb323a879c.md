Prognosis is good for small and moderate defects both in terms of anatomical reconstruction of the defect and functionality of the lid. It may be more challenging to achieve a good cosmetic outcome in severe defects. Associated astigmatism and eye coverage in lid sharing surgeries could cause amblyopia and decreased visual acuity. In one case series, all 21 patients that received surgical intervention for eyelid colobomas had acceptable cosmetic outcomes and visual acuity compared to the other eye was similar, indicating a good prognosis in patients with eyelid colobomas that undergo early surgical intervention.
