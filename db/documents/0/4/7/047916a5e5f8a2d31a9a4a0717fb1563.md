The ACC/AHA 2011 consensus guidelines also identify situations where the use of CABG has been associated with harm and is contraindicated as summarized below.

- Emergency CABG in a hemodynamically stable patient who has persistent angina but only a small area of viable myocardium

- Emergency CABG after PCI reperfuses the epicardium but not the microvascular circulation (no reflow).

- Emergency CABG after failed PCI but no active ischemia or imminent occlusion

- Patients with ventricular tachycardia and myocardial scar but no sign of active ischemia

- Stable ischemic heart disease with either <70% stenosis of non-LM vessel, the disease only implicating the RCA or Cx, or maintained fractional flow reserve >0.80.

- RCA should not be grafted with an arterial graft unless stenosis is >90%.

- Patients with end-stage kidney disease with limited life expectancy due to non-cardiac conditions

Furthermore, CABG performed in a three-day interval after a transmural myocardial infarction or within a six-hour interval of a non-transmural myocardial infarction are both associated with in-hospital mortality, so clinicians should avoid CABG should during those time frames.
