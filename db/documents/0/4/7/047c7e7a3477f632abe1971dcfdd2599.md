The levator labii superioris is a thin, quadrilateral muscleÂ that serves to elevate the upper lip, particularly during smiling, but it also provides eversion. It originates on the infraorbital rim of the maxilla and inserts into the orbicularis oris muscle.

Medial to the levator labii superioris is the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle (sometimes called the angular head of the levator labii superioris muscle). The levator labii superioris alaeque nasi can be further subdivided into a furrow portion (nasolabial), an alar portion, and a lip portion. Some of the fibers lie superficial to the levator labii superiors, and some lie deep, with different authors reporting differing proportions of each.

Lateral to the levator labii superioris is the levator anguli oris muscle, which raises the corner of the mouth. This belly arises from the maxilla, just lateral to the origin of the levator labii superioris, and it inserts on the modiolus of the orbicularis oculi. Its fibers run deep to the levator labii superioris, and for that reason, this muscle is innervated from its superficial surface. Also associated with the lateral aspect of the levator labii superioris muscle is the zygomaticus minor muscle, which elevates and lateralizes the upper lip while smiling. The zygomaticus minor lies superficial to the levator labii superioris muscle.
