Peripheral neuropathy (PN) encompasses a broad range of clinical pathologies potentially presenting with peripheral nervous system dysfunction.

Although there are many possible causes of peripheral neuropathy, the most prevalent subtype, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, can lead to significant complications. Early assessment of symptoms of peripheral polyneuropathy helps avoid neuropathic foot ulcers to combat potential morbidity and mortality resulting from the pathophysiologic poor wound healing potential, which can lead to limb compromise, local to systemic infection, septicemia, and even death.

The exact cause of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is not known. Proposed theories include metabolic, neurovascular, and autoimmune pathways have been proposed. Mechanical compression (e.g., carpal tunnel), genetics, and social and lifestyle factors such as chronic alcohol consumption and smoking have all been implicated. Perpetually high blood serum glucose appears to lead to damaged small blood vessels, compromising oxygen and nutrients to the nerves. First, the distal sensory and autonomic nerve fibers are damaged; the damage then continues with proximal progression leading to a gradual loss of protective sensation in both the skin and foot joints. Half of the diabetic peripheral neuropathies may be asymmetric. If they are not recognized and preventative foot care is not implemented, patients have an increased risk of injury due to their insensate feet.
