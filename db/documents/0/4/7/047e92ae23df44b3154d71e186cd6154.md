The most common cause of PVT is cirrhosis. In a non-cirrhotic liver, PVT is mainly due to inherited or acquired pro-thrombotic states. Primary myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) are the most common procoagulant state found. Other pro-thrombotic conditions that cause PVT include paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), antiphospholipid syndrome, hyperhomocysteinemia, inherited pro-thrombotic disorders such as protein C, S and antithrombin III deficiencies, and less frequently, factor V Leiden mutation, factor II mutation, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutation.

The intra-abdominal inflammatory conditions leading vascular endothelial injury can cause PVT. These include pancreatitis, cholangitis, appendicitis, and liver abscess. Local injury to portal venous axis following splenectomy, laparoscopic colectomy, or abdominal trauma with the above acquired or inherited pro-thrombotic conditions can lead to PVT.

Etiology for EHPVO in children is phlebosclerosis with thrombosis as a secondary event. Omphalitis, neonatal umbilical sepsis, umbilical vein cannulation, repeated abdominal infections, sepsis, abdominal surgery, and trauma later progress to EHPVO.
