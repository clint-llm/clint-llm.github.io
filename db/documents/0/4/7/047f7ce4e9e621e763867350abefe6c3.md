Treatment of vitamin A deficiency is vitamin A supplementation (VAS). A multitude of studies has concluded that VAS in vitamin A deficient populations reduce childhood morbidity and mortality.

In regions with a high prevalence of VAD, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends universal VAS of select populations. They recommend a one-time dose of 100,000 IU in children 6 to 11 months of age followed by doses of 200,000 IU every 4 to 6 months up to 5 years of age.

International guidelines do not clearly outline dosing of VAS for asymptomatic vitamin A deficiency in resource-rich regions. Instead, dosing of VAS is based on the severity of deficiency and provider discretion. The WHO recommends treating xerophthalmia with VAS of 50,000 IU for children less than 6 months of age, 100,000 IU for children 6-12 months of age, and 200,000 IU for children greater than 12 months of age daily for 2 days followed by an additional dose after 2 weeks. For any patient with a severe case of measles, the WHO recommends the aforementioned dosing once daily for 2 days, regardless of whether the patient is known to be vitamin A deficient or not.

In resource-rich countries, post-bariatric patients and neonates have particular dosing recommendations. Post-bariatric surgery patients are recommended to take 10,000 IU VAS daily and adjust as needed based on regular serum retinol level monitoring. Some bariatric patients have been known to need up to 100,000 IU VAS daily.
