There are varying degrees of inflammation found with acalculous cholecystitis. Findings are similar to calculus cholecystitis, only with an absence of gallstones. The gallbladder wall will be thickened to variable degrees, and there may be adhesions to the serosal surface. Smooth muscle hypertrophy, especially in chronic conditions, is present. At times sludge or very viscous bile can be seen. These findings are usual precursors to gallstones and are formed from increased biliary salts or stasis. Various species of bacteria can be present in 11% to 30% of the cases. Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses are present 90% of the time in cholecystitis specimens. These are a herniation of intraluminal sinuses from increased pressures possibly associated with ducts of Luschka. The mucosa will exhibit varying degrees of inflammation from mild to ulcerations with gangrenous changes. Extreme situations may show total gangrenous changes of the gallbladder with perforation.
