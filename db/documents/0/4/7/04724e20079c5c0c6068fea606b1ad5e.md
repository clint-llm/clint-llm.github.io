Penile injection and aspiration are indicated if a patient is experiencing ischemic priapism for less than 72 hours, and the erection has not resolved with other less invasive techniques. If the patient has surpassed the 72-hour mark, the chances of organic erections in the future are virtually none, and he can be treated conservatively, controlling his pain.
