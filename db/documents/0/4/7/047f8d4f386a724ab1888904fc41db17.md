Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder due to mutation in the dystrophin gene that results in progressive muscle degeneration and proximal muscle weakness. This condition is less common and less severe than Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The onset of symptoms is late compared to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, although it varies widely between 5 to 60 years of age. This activity covers the role of an interprofessional team in the diagnosis and care of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Becker muscular dystrophy medical conditions and emergencies.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of Becker muscular dystrophy.
- Describe the management options available for Becker muscular dystrophy.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate diagnosis and management of patients with Becker muscular dystrophy and to enhance outcomes.
