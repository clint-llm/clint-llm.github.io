The cannabis plant comes from the family Cannabaceae and contains hundreds of compounds called cannabinoids. These compounds have been isolated and discovered, with the most relevant being tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Research in the late 20th century identified the first cannabinoid receptor.

CB1 receptors are commonly found in the central nervous system (CNS), whereas CB2 are generally found in the periphery in the immune and hematologic systems.

On the other hand, CBD functions as a negative allosteric modulator of CB1 and has effects on other endogenous systems involving the vanilloid receptor (TRPV1), adenosine A2A, and others. It has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and anti-psychotic effects.
