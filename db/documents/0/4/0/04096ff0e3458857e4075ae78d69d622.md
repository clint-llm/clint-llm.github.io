Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an RNA retrovirus of genera lentivirus. It can be classified into two types, HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the more virulent and prevalent of the two genotypes. Peripheral neuropathy is the most common neurological complication associated with HIV-1.

Progressive polyradiculopathy in HIV infection presents with gradual sensory, motor, reflexive, and sphincter disturbances in a radicular pattern. Although frequently appearing in advanced stages of the disease, it may sometimes be a presenting feature with rapid progression leading to irreversible deficits or a fatal outcome unless treated promptly.

Rapidly progressing polyradiculopathy occurs in HIV-infected patients with advanced disease and severe immunosuppression. In the antiretroviral therapy (ART) era, this disease is far less frequent than before and is now primarily seen in untreated patients. In patients receiving treatment for HIV, opportunistic infections leading to this syndrome may present with atypical features.
