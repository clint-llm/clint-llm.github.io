When suspecting achlorhydria, multiple tests are conducted to confirm the diagnosis and to find its primary cause:

- Antiparietal and anti-intrinsic factor antibody

- Biopsy of stomach

- Gastric pH monitoring

- Serum pepsinogen level (a low serum pepsinogen level indicates achlorhydria)

- Serum gastrin levels (high serum gastrin levels greater than 500 to 1000 pg/mL may indicate achlorhydria)

- Tests for detecting H. pylori infection (urea breath test, stool antigen test, biopsy, polymerase chain reaction-PCR, or fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH])

- Hemoglobin level
