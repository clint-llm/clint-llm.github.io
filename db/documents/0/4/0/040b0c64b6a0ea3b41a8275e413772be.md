- Zollinger-Ellison syndrome - This is associated with ectopic secretion of gastrin. The tumor is located in the duodenum or pancreas. Due to excess secretion of gastric acid, there is the development of peptic ulcers in the GI tract. On histopathology examination, there is parietal cell hyperplasia.

- H. pylori gastritis - Evidence of gastritis present, and the H. pylori tests are positive.

- Hypertrophic lymphocytic gastritis - It presents very similar to Menetrier disease. In this condition, on histopathological examination, gastric mucosa shows severe inflammation with predominant intraepithelial lymphocytes.

- Hypertrophic hypersecretory gastropathy - There is hypersecretion of all glandular cell types of the stomach. There is excess acid secretion, pepsin, and mucin secretion as well. On histological exam, there is hyperplasia of the foveolar epithelium as well as oxyntic glands.

- Gastric polyps - These are more focal than a diffuse disease. They can be numerous and mimic Menetrier disease.

- Gastric adenocarcinoma - On the histopathological exam, it shows dysplasia and neoplastic features, and loss of architecture helps to differentiate it from Menetrier disease.

- Infectious etiologies like histoplasmosis, syphilis, tuberculosis, and infiltrative disorders such as sarcoidosis can mimic Menetrier disease.
