Hydrofluoric acid is a common chemical that is utilized in several domestic and industrial products and treatments for producing other manufactured products.   Though the literature for treatment of hydrofluoric acid is based upon animal studies and some case reports / small case series, the mainstay treatment has not changed since the mid 1970's.   Prehospital and emergency medicine physicians should be familiar with the initial and ongoing management and treatment with potential life threatening arrhythmias from the sequestration of calcium, magnesium and release of potassium.   Easy transfer to burn centers should be in place for continued monitoring and treatment for patients with profound hydrofluroic acid burns.
