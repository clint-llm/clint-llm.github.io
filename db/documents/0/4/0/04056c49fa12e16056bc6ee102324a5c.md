There are several items needed before performing ECT. The American Society of Standard of care for monitoring a patient under general anesthesia includes monitoring heart rhythm with an electrocardiogram and monitoring heart rate, oxygenation, ventilation, and blood pressure. A tourniquet should be used on one of the patient's extremities to prevent the muscle relaxant from affecting that extremity, which allows monitoring of the effectiveness of the motor portion of the seizure.  Electroencephalogram (EEG) monitors, or processed EEG, monitor the status of the brain during the seizure. Emergency airway equipment should be readily available. A soft bite block is provided in the oropharynx to prevent tongue and tooth injury, as a generalized epileptic seizure has been shown to cause such trauma even in the setting of muscle relaxation.
