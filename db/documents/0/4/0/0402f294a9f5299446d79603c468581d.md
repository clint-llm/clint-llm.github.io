A single ventricle or univentricular heart is a broad term covering various cardiac structural abnormalities in which one ventricle is severely underdeveloped, or a ventricular septal wall did not form. Through various mechanisms, the anomalous structure typically results in the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Occurrences are generally caused by genetic factors, though environmental factors are known to promote malformation.
