Osgood Schlatter disease is a clinical diagnosis, and radiographic evaluation is usually not necessary. Plain radiographs may be used to rule out additional diagnoses such as fracture, infection, or bone tumor if the presentation is severe or atypical. The radiographic evaluation may also be indicated to evaluate for avulsion injury of the apophysis or other injuries after a traumatic event. Classic radiographic findings in Osgood-Schlatter disease include an elevated tibial tubercle with soft tissue swelling, fragmentation of the apophysis, or calcification in the distal patellar tendon. It is worth noting that these findings can also be seen as normal variants and do not always represent pathology, so clinical correlation is of utmost importance. If ordering radiographs consider comparing bilateral images to delineate normal versus abnormal in the individual patient.
