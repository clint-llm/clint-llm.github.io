Endometriomas can often be visualized on imaging. However, they appear similar to other cystic lesions on imaging, and final pathology is only discovered through surgery. If these findings are not seen on imaging, the diagnosis becomes even more elusive. It is important to remember that the definitive diagnosis of endometriosis is made through surgical visualization of the lesions. Therefore, there is no diagnostic test that can be done. However, there are a limited number of tests that can be used as a tool to assist with the diagnosis.

Laboratory evaluations that can be considered for these patients include a complete blood count (CBC), cancer antigen (CA)-125, CCR1, urinalysis, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing. The CBC can help guide the concern for infection and anemia. If there is an elevated white blood cell count, the suspicion of an infectious cause of the patient’s pelvic pain would be higher. The hemoglobin can also help guide you to the level of blood loss, as these patients typically have heavier periods and may be anemic as a result. CA-125 can become elevated in women with endometriosis. However, this is a non-specific marker and is not routinely ordered.

When it comes to imaging, a transvaginal ultrasound is commonly ordered for these patients to determine if there is a cause for their pelvic pain that can be visualized. Superficial implants of endometriosis cannot be seen on ultrasound or any other imaging modality. However, ultrasound is often where endometriomas are found. Endometriomas typically appear as simple cysts. However, they can also be seen as multi-loculated cysts or cystic-solid lesions. The typical appearance of these lesions on ultrasound shows low-level homogenous echos, otherwise described as a ground-glass appearance. This is consistent with old hemorrhagic debris. These lesions are also typically devoid of any vascularity when examined with doppler flow.

Other imaging modalities that can be considered are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). MRI has shown a higher sensitivity for detecting a pelvic mass than ultrasonography. However, due to the cost of an MRI, the benefit does not outweigh the financial burden; thus, ultrasound is more commonly used. Like ultrasound, MRI is limited in detecting diffuse pelvic endometriosis and may only be beneficial for finding endometriomas.

The gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis is via laparoscopy. Because imaging and laboratory studies are of limited benefit in diagnosing endometriosis, direct visualization through surgery is the standard. During laparoscopy, endometriosis lesions will typically appear blue or black. However, they can appear as red, white, or non-pigmented lesions. At this time, the severity of the disease can also be evaluated. If there are significant adhesions, peritoneal defects, or endometriomas present, this is indicative of a more severe disease. The visualized lesions can be biopsied and evaluated by pathology for endometrial glands and stroma.

Laparoscopy is an important procedure in patients with endometriosis because it is both diagnostic and therapeutic, especially in cases with endometriomas. This is an integral part of treatment for these patients with refractory endometriosis or patients with symptomatic endometriomas.
