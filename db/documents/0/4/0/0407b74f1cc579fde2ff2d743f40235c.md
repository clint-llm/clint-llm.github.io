The goal of modern dentistry is to restore the patient to normal profile, function, comfort, esthetics, speech, and health regardless of the atrophy, disease, or injury of the stomatognathic system.

People are living longer on average. This fact, combined with an existing population of patients with minor and major dental problems, guarantees the future of implant dentistry for several generations of dentists. Dental implants are increasingly used to replace single teeth, especially in the posterior regions of the mouth. Rather than removing sound tooth structure and crowning two or more teeth, increasing the risk of decay, endodontic therapy, and splinting teeth together with pontics, which may have the potential to decrease oral hygiene ability and increase plaque retention, a dental implant may replace the single tooth.

Organized dentistry has finally accepted implant dentistry. The current trend to expand the use of implant dentistry will continue until every restorative practice uses this modality for abutment support of both fixed and removable prostheses on a regular basis as the primary option for all tooth replacements.
