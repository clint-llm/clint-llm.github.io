Autologous fat grafting requires the following equipment:

- Wetting or tumescent solution - 500 mL normal saline, 25 mL of 1 to 2% lidocaine, and 0.5 ml epinephrine (1:100,000 or 1:200,000)

- Local anesthetic (lidocaine or bupivicaine)

- Infiltration needle or cannula - used to administer local anesthesia (to cannula entry sites) and the wetting/tumescent solution (to graft harvest sites)

- Fat harvesting and donor cannulas - the Coleman type 2 (side-port cannula) is the most commonly used injection cannula. For facial injections, the cannula should be no more than 5 to 9 cm in length. The choice of the cannula, including gauge and length, depends largely upon the graft recipient area as well as upon the experience and preferences of the injector.

- Luer-lock syringes - large syringes (10 mL or 20 mL) for harvesting and several 1 mL syringes for injecting

- A closed suction machine may be used as an alternative to syringes for harvesting large volumes of fat (low power suction may be used if harvesting large amounts of fat, though this may be traumatic and affect the integrity of the harvested fat)

- Plug to seal the Luer-lock while loading fat into the injection syringes

- #11 or#15 blade scalpel - to create an entry site for harvest cannulas

- 18 ga needle - to create an entry site for fat injection

- Sterile skin markers

- Gauze

- Compression garment

- Luer to Luer connector for micro-fat and nano-fat (for skin regeneration) processing

Depending upon the method of fat processing selected (e.g., sedimentation, filtering, washing, and centrifugation), the following may be required:

- 1 mL syringes with absorbent material (e.g., non-adherent gauze) to absorb supernatant oil

- Commercial fat grafting preparation kit

- Strainer and saline

- Centrifuge (3,000 rpm for 3 min to isolate the fat and minimize trauma)
