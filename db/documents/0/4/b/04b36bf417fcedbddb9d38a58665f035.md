Complications for NGU in men are rare but include epididymitis, prostatitis, abscess formation, and reactive arthritis. One percent to 2% of males with NGU develop epididymitis. One percent to 2% develop conjunctivitis. Urethral stricture or stenosis is possible after NGU due to post inflammatory scar formation but is rare.

Complications in women are more common than in men (10% to 40%). Women with urethritis can potentially develop pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy.

Children born to mothers with chlamydia urethritis can potentially develop complications including conjunctivitis, iritis, and pneumonia. Routine treatment of all newborns with antibiotic eye ointment has significantly decreased the incidence of these.

Chlamydia urethritis can also cause lymphogranuloma venereum, a genital ulcer disease which presents as lymphadenitis or lymphangitis and can lead to lymphatic obstruction, strictures or fistulas.
