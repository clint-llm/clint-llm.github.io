Working in the medical field does not come without its hazards. Unfortunately, even in the pursuit to provide aid to those in need, those same patients can become agitated and violent. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) stated that 75% of annual assaults in the workplace occur in the healthcare and social service fields. As reported in the National Crime Victimization Survey,Â healthcare workers face a 20% higher chance of being victimized in the workplace when compared to other workers. Because patient violence can occur in any clinical setting, it is imperative for providers to be prepared in order to minimize the risk of injury to the patient and caretakers. This document will discuss guidelines for harm reduction in the healthcare setting with a focus on patient restraint and seclusion.
