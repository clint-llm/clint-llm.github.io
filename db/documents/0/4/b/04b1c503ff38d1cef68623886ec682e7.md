Though conditions leading to ARDS are the most common causes of refractory hypoxemia, some conditions such as atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale, which can cause significant intracardiac right to left shunting have to be ruled out. Intrapulmonary shunts such as secondary to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations and hepatopulmonary syndrome must be thought of in some cases of refractory hypoxemia. Acute pulmonary embolism and pulmonary hypertension, which are life-threatening, are also important differentials in patients with refractory hypoxemia.
