The diagnosis and management of an AAA includes an interprofessional team consisting of a radiologist, vascular surgeon, internist, nurse practitioner, and cardiologist. When an AAA is suspected the initial test of choice is ultrasound. This diagnostic imaging modality permits routine monitoring of patients who are managed non-surgically, while limiting radiation and IV contrast exposure. An MRA or CTA is recommended for surgical planning if the patient is hemodynamically stable. Unstable patients should be managed in close consultation with the vascular surgeon and intensivist.
