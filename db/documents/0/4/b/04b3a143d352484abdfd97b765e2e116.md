Triptans can cause vasoconstriction of the coronary and limb arteries; therefore, they are contraindicated in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accidents, hemiplegic migraines, uncontrolled hypertension, or peripheral vascular disease.

Triptans should not be administered with ergot alkaloids or monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

There is not enough evidence that triptans increase the risk of serotonin syndrome either as monotherapy or in patients taking a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).
