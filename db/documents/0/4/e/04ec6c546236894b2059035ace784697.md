Initial assessment includes general appearance, GCS, and vital signs to determine how sick the patient is.

- Airway, Breathing, Circulatory, Disability, Exposure (quick assessment to identify and simultaneously provide appropriate management)

- Check patient notes (the type of procedure, timing of the procedure, intraoperative complications, anesthesia records, patient comorbidities, last ward rounds)

- Check patient Intake and Output (including the type of stools, if the patient with type 7 stools rule out Clostridium difficile enterocolitis)

- Check patient orders (is the patient being treated with antibiotics or not, receiving deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis or not)

- System based assessment (pulmonary, cardiac, gastrointestinal, urinary)

- Sites of infection that are visible (i.e., skin for bedsores, cellulitis, vascular access sites)

- Besides tests, vital signs should be monitored. If the patient is hypotensive, venous blood gas is needed to measure serum lactate. It will guide fluid resuscitation; if the patient is tachycardic, bedside ECG might be important to confirm their rhythm, might rule out myocardial infarction; oxygen saturation 96% to 98% in patients with healthy lungs or 89% to 92% in carbon dioxide retaining patients, for example, COPD patients; monitor blood glucose levels because high blood glucose levels point towards septic response; urinalysis to rule out urinary tract infection

- Blood tests: WBC, CRP especially if trending upward might point towards a septic response, hemoglobin level would point toward the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, liver function tests to rule out liver injury, coagulation parameters, and platelets to rule out disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal function to rule out kidney injury or electrolyte abnormalities

- Microbiology: Cultures (blood, urine, wound, and sputum if producing it), if suspecting line sepsis (blood culture from the line, remove the line and send the tip to the lab)

- Imaging: Chest x-ray (prove or rule out pneumonic process), abdominal imaging (ultrasound, CT scan to rule out collections)

- Venous doppler of the legs to rule out deep vein thrombosis
