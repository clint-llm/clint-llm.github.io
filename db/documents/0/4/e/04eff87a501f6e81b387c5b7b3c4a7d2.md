The sympathetic nervous system maintains the peripheral capillary bed tone and thereby controls the facial flushing and sweating of the face. These fibers originate from the hypothalamus. They descend posterolaterally in the brain stem and terminate at the C8-T2 level of the spinal cord. Second-order neurons come out of the spinal cord at the T1 to T3 level. They ascend in the cervical sympathetic chain and synapse with the third-order neuron at the superior cervical ganglia at the C3-C4 level. Two branches come off the superior cervical ganglion. They run along the internal and external carotid artery and carry the sudomotor and cutaneous vasodilator fibers to the face (T2-T3). The oculo-sympathetic fibers to the iris, responsible for the pupillary dilation, originate from the T1 level.

Unilateral injury, compression, or blockade of T2-T3 sympathetic fibers along its pathway from the hypothalamus to the face cuts down the sympathetic supply to the ipsilateral face. It results in hemifacial vasoconstriction and anhidrosis on the affected side, manifesting as the Harlequin facies. The facial discoloration may extend into the upper chest and arms if T4 fibers are involved, and Horner syndrome manifests if T1 fibers are compromised.

Horner syndrome, a triad of pupillary constriction, ptosis, and ipsilateral anhidrosis, may occur with or without the Harlequin sign.Â The discoloration may be extensive depending on the extension of the sympathetic blockade by the underlying pathology.
