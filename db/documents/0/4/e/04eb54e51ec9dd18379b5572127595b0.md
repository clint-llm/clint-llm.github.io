The median location of the sternum in the thoracic cage and its attachment to the costal cartilage allow it to function as a protective bone to the underlying mediastinal structures.

The anterior surface of the xiphoid process is primarily occupied by the insertion of the flat longitudinal muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. The rectus abdominis muscle serves as a strong trunk flexor and stabilizer. The aponeurosis of the internal and external oblique muscles also attaches to the anterior portion of the xiphoid process. These abdominal muscles, together with other core muscles, function to stabilize the trunk and assist in increasing intra-abdominal pressure.

The posterior surface of the xiphoid process serves as an attachment point for several structures; the most important is the attachment of the diaphragmatic muscular slips providing the diaphragm with its fundamental contractile function in respiration.

The seventh costal cartilages attach to bilateral demifacets to form the costoxiphoid/ chondroxiphoid ligament. These demifacets are located on the superior end of the xiphoid, precisely at the point where it articulates with the sternal body to form the xiphisternal joint.
