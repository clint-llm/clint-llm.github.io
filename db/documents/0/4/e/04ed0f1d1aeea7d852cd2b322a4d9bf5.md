Because the arteries of the hand make up a vast network of highly branched and anastomosed arteries, there are numerous anatomic variations of the arterial patterns of the hand. These variants generally demonstrate either complete or incomplete superficial and deep arterial arches. When an anastomosis is present between the vessels, the arch is considered complete. An incomplete arch is present when there is the absence of anastomosis between the vessels. With recent advancements in hand microsurgery, the understanding of the vasculature of the hand and its variants has become increasingly important. A recent meta-analysis found that the complete superficial volar arch presented in 81.3% of cases. Research has reported seven different types of complete superficial volar arches and five different types of incomplete superficial volar arches.Â The deep volar arch was found to be less variant with complete arch found in 95.2% of cases.
