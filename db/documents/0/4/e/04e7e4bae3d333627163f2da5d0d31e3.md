Debriefing is a core component of simulation-based learning. Reflection on the events of a completed simulation is a crucial step whereby participants learn and modify their behavior.

Fewer models exist to facilitate the debriefing of the faculty running the simulation. As of this publication date, the International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and Learning (INASCL) has created a curriculum of best practices in simulation, including session facilitation and debriefing. While the summary article mentions maintaining debriefing skills through observed practice and peer evaluation in general, these evaluation tools are not explicitly addressed.
