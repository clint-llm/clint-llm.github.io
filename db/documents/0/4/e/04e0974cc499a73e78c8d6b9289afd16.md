Trapped lung, persistent air leaks after chest tube insertion (for iatrogenic pneumothorax), and septated effusion are all potential complications. Complications of treatment have been mentioned in the article elsewhere. These include complications associated with procedures used for draining pleural fluid (thoracoscopic talc poudrage, talc slurry, tunneled catheter insertion, and pleurodesis). MPE does not have a cure, and the goals of treatment include palliation of symptoms. The financial difficulty related to repeated procedures in families strained by the economic hardships brought on by cancer treatment also needs to be recognized.
