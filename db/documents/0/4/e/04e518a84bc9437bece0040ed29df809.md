Glucagon binds to its membrane-bound receptor, a seven-pass transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor (G-stimulatory protein).

Glucagon signaling, while promoting glycogenolysis, it inhibits glycogen synthesis in the liver. Upon glucagon stimulation, activated PKA phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase kinase, which phosphorylates serine-14 residue of glycogen phosphorylase. This activated glycogen phosphorylase phosphorylates glycogen, resulting in increased glycogenolysis and the production of glucose-6-phosphate. Glucose-6-phosphate is converted to glucose by glucose-6-phosphatase, resulting in increased plasma glucose levels. Glucagon modulates glucose-6-phosphatase activity via the PKA-dependent mechanism.

In addition to promoting glycogenolysis, glucagon also inhibits glycogenesis in the liver at the same time. Glycogen synthase is a significant regulatory enzyme in the glycogenesis pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a glucosyl residue from UDP-glucose to a nonreducing end of the branched glycogen molecule. Glucagon induces phosphorylation of glycogen synthase and thereby inhibits glycogen synthase activity in the liver. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase by multiple kinases, including PKA and other serine/threonine kinases leading to a graded inactivation, which leads to decreased glycogen synthesis and therefore increases the glucose output to the blood.
