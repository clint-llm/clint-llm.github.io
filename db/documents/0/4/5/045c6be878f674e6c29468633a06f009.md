Cherry hemangiomas are seen in about 7% of adolescents and 75% of adults over 75 years of age.****These lesions develop in adults in the third or fourth decade of life. About 5% to 41% of people begin to have cherry hemangiomas in their 20s. These lesions begin as small red macules or papules. They are initially 1mm in size and can reach up to 2.3 mm by the age of 50 but are usually less than 3.5 mm.

Cherry hemangiomas are distributed equally in individuals of all races and ethnicities. They do not show any gender predisposition.
