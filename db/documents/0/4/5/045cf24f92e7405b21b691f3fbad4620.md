Progressive spondylolisthesis is among the primary concerns in patients with pars defects. Overall, the risk of progression is small, running at about 3 to 4%.

In low-grade spondylolisthesis, the pelvic incidence is a significant predictor of the risk progression.

The majority of adolescents return to activities after six months of conservative treatment. Skeletally immature children and adolescents with bilateral spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis require standing lateral radiographs to assess the progression of slippage every 6 to 12 months until reaching skeletal maturity. Adolescents with over 50% slip (Grade 3 or 4) warrant orthopedic referral and possible surgical treatment.
