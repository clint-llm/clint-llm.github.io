The deep peroneal nerve provides nerve supply to the anterior compartment of the leg. It is a branch of the common peroneal nerve, which is a branch of the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve branches at the apex of the popliteal fossa into the tibial and common peroneal nerves. The tibial nerve continues its course down the leg, posterior to the tibia supplying the deep muscles of the posterior leg. It terminates by dividing into the medial and lateral plantar nerves of the foot. The common peroneal nerve wraps around the neck of the fibula then divides and terminates into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves. The superficial peroneal will supply the lateral compartment of the leg, and the sensory to the dorsum of the foot. The deep peroneal will supply the motor innervation to the anterior compartment of the leg and sensation to the first dorsal toe webspace.
