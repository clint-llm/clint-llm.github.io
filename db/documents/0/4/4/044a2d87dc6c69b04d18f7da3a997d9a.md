The patient should have an appropriate IV cannula whose size ranges from 14G to 26G. In an adult, we normally use sizes 18G to 22G, while in the pediatric age group, it ranges from 25G to 26G. In rare cases where IV access is not available, the intraosseous route can also be used for transfusion.

Pretransfusion medication has been used in certain situations, such as antihistamines, in patients with a previous history of an allergic reaction during transfusion. Occasionally, meperidine or corticosteroid are occasionally ordered in patients with a history of severe rigors during transfusion.

The patientâ€™s pretransfusion vitals are recorded by the transfusionist, thereafter connecting the PC bag by aseptically spiking the blood transfusion set to the IV line. A standard blood transfusion set with an inline filter of 170 to 260 microns is used. A transfusion rate of 2 to 5 ml/min is used, thereby completing the transfusion in 1 to 2 hours. Slower flow rates are used in patients at risk of fluid overload. The patient is closely monitored during the transfusion, with the vitals recorded every 15 minutes. If a transfusion reaction is suspected at any point, the transfusion is stopped immediately, with management protocol followed.
