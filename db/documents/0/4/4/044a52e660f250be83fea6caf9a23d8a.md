**Techniques of Viscoelastic Removal**

**Rock and Roll Technique**

In this technique, the irrigation and aspiration (I/A) tips are positioned away from the posterior capsule. The optic is pushed and angled to one side, and viscoelastic is removed from under the optic. A similar maneuver is performed on the contralateral side to remove the remaining viscoelastic.

**Compartment Technique Using Bimanual Irrigation and Aspiration**

The irrigation and aspiration tip can be moved back and forth to assist the removal of viscoelastic compartments.

**Tapping Technique**

The IOL surface is tapped with the I/A tip to dislodge the viscoelastic under the surface of IOL and then can be removed by simple I/A.

**Spinning Technique**

After IOL implantation, the IOL can be dialed 360 degrees to remove the remaining residual viscoelastic at the equator.
