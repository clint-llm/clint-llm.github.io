Due to the possible long-lasting effects of Pneumocystis pneumonia, prophylaxis should be initiated without delay, when clinically indicated. Pneumocystis jirovecii primarily affects immunocompromised individuals; therefore, the underlying etiology of the patient’s immunosuppression should be first addressed. In cases of patients with AIDS, an infectious disease specialist should be on board. Markers of T cell integrity and function should be closely monitored, tailoring the specific treatment and prophylaxis to the patient’s CD4 count, CD4%, and HIV viral load.

In other populations, immunosuppression may be indicated due to solid organ transplant and rheumatologic conditions, to name a few. Therefore, prophylaxis should be initiated in these patients on a case by case basis. This requires an interprofessional team approach incorporating clinicians from several specialties, such as rheumatology, nephrology, pulmonology, hematology, and oncology. Furthermore, in cases where compliance with medication regimen has been compromised, behavioral health and psychiatry could be involved to better assess the patient’s reasoning. On the other hand, nutrition, social work, and other non-clinician personnel should be involved to maximize response to treatment.
