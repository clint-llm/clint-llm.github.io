Retinal macroaneurysm is an uncommon entity affecting the posterior segment of the eye, and it has variable presentations. Most macroaneurysms undergo spontaneous resolution. Visual acuity is affected because of edema, hemorrhage, exudates, or other secondary complications. These changes can be identified at an early stage using different investigative modalities, which include FFA (fundus fluorescein angiography), ICG (indocyanine green angiography), OCT (optical coherence tomography), OCT-A (OCT- angiography), and USG B scan (brightness scan). Proper management can avoid vision-threatening complications. This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and management as well as highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology and pathophysiology of retinal artery macroaneurysm.
- Describe the clinical findings and investigations required for the evaluation of retinal artery macroaneurysm.
- Review the available management options as well as outline the various differentials and complications of retinal artery macroaneurysm.
- Summarize the importance of patient education and interprofessional team strategies to improve the outcomes of retinal artery macroaneurysm.
