Patients with inflammatory breast cancer

Patients who do not meet guidelines for the Z0011 criteria

Patients with three or more axillary sentinel nodes that are positive for cancer

Persistently positive lymph nodes after neoadjuvant therapy

Axillas with failed radiotracer and/or lymphazurin/methylene blue during sentinel lymph node biopsy

Axillary lymph node recurrence after prior breast cancer treatment
