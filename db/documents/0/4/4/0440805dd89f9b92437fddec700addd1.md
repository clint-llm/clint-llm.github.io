Sevoflurane is usually administered by the anesthesiologist or anesthesia nurse. As with any form of general anesthesia, a dedicated staff member such as a nurse should continuously monitor the vital signs while the patient is under anesthesia. Communication of the ongoing patient status should occur between all members of the interprofessional medical team, including clinicians, surgeons, nurses, and anesthesiologists/nurse anesthetists, so that that patient safety can be addressed at all times. This interprofessional approach will result in improved patient outcomes with fewer adverse effects. [Level 5]
