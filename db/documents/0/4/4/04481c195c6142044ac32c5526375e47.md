Healthcare providers should monitor patients on clomipramine for metabolic effects and cardiac abnormalities by obtaining weight, BMI, fasting glucose, fasting lipid panel, BMP, magnesium, and EKG at baseline and routinely during treatment.

If patients on clomipramine experience adverse effects, the medication regimen should be titrated down, discontinued, or the patient referred to a psychiatrist or mental health nurse. A pharmacy consult is necessary for potential interactions and to verify dosing, making recommendations to the team as needed. The treatment outcomes for clomipramine in OCD are superior to S-RIs, but adverse effects limit medication tolerability; this is why an interprofessional team collaborating across disciplines can optimize the therapeutic benefits of clomipramine while minimizing adverse effects.
