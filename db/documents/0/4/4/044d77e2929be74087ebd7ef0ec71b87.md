Other pathologies that are part of the differential diagnosis must be ruled out. One of the more serious conditions is bowel ischemia. Infarction must be considered as a differential diagnosis, especially in patients with vascular disease, cardiac failure, and atrial fibrillation. The clinical presentation of diffuse abdominal pain with abnormal laboratory values warrants intestinal infarction rule out. Furthermore, with bowel ischemia, underlying causes such as strangulated internal hernia, abdominal abscess, and/or ileus must be considered.
