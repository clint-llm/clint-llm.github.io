One of the most common reasons for the inability to abduct the arm or pain with the abduction of the arm is a tear of the rotator cuff. The rotator cuff is a group of muscles—supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor—responsible for the movement and stabilization of the shoulder joint.

Several physical maneuvers may be used to assess the rotator cuff for possible supraspinatus tear or injury. However, the empty can test is the most commonly utilized assessment for supraspinatus injury. In this test, the patient elevates the arm to parallel the ground and fully internally rotates the arm so that the thumb points downwards; the patient is then asked to resist applied downward pressure. Pain and/or weakness from this action results in a positive test and is indicative of supraspinatus injury.

Scapular winging is another sign that a clinician can check to examine muscles and nerves involved in should abduction.

- Long thoracic nerve- controls serratus anterior

- Spinal accessory nerve - trapezius

- Dorsal scapular nerve - rhomboid muscles

Physical therapists can play an essential role in helping to diagnose and rehabilitate shoulder injuries where abduction is affected. In such cases, they can coordinate their activities with orthopedists, chiropractors, and family clinicians.
