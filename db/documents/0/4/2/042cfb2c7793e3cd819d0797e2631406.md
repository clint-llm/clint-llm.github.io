Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CRP) is a condition due to disordered keratinization. The disease was originally described by Gougerot and Carteaud and is also called Gougerot-Carteaud syndrome. Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis presents as asymptomatic hyperpigmented papules, that can coalesce into plaques, located on the upper trunk and neck in teens and young adults. The cause of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis has been under debate. Malassezia furfur infection was thought to be the cause of the disease, but studies have shown that patients with confluent and reticulated papillomatosis are not always colonized with the yeast. The current theory is infection with Dietzia papillomatosis, a gram-positive aerobic actinomycete. Other possible causes for confluent and reticulated papillomatosis include diabetes, obesity, ultraviolet (UV) light, amyloidosis, and overexpression of keratin-16 (K16). First-line treatment is minocycline. The papules can take 12 to 39 months to resolve. There is a recurrence rate of 13.8% to 15.4%.
