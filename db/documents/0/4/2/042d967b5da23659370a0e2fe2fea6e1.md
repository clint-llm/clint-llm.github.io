Anterior cord syndrome is often a severe, life-changing disease. It affects multiple organ systems throughout the body and thus requires a team approach to optimally care for the patient. Emergency department providers must be able to quickly recognize the clinical signs and move to confirmatory imaging as well as treatment.

Neurologists play a vital role in the evaluation and treatment of spinal cord injury, as do vascular surgeons if an aortic etiology is suspected. Nurses will be able to identify and prevent developing complications such as pressure sores, urinary retention, or deep vein thrombosis. Pharmacists manage the multiple medications that patients with cord infarction may often require, helping to avoid developing complications of the spinal cord injury.

Physical and occupational therapy play an important prognostic role, helping the patient with rehabilitation and improvement of their functional motor status. Overall lifespan and functional independence of patients with spinal cord injury have made significant improvements over the years, and this is a result of improvements across a wide variety of fields coming together to enhance patient care.
