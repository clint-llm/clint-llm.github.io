A  reference range for fructosamine in non-diabetic individuals is generally 200 to 285 umol/L.

While GA assays also suffer from standardization, the newer assay developed by Asahi Kasei appears to be much improved. According to this assay, normal persons have values around 14% and those with diabetes greater than 17%. Values in diabetes can go as high as two to five times the upper limit of normal.
