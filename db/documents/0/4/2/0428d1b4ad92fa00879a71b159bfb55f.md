Once the decision to proceed with the brain death determination has been made, three conditions must be present: coma, the absence of brainstem reflexes, and apnea.

Coma should be evaluated by ensuring a lack of responsiveness to noxious stimuli; no eye or motor reflex should be present in response to stimuli. Additionally, the cause of the coma should be identified by neuroimaging, history, and physical or laboratory testing.

The following brainstem reflexes should be tested in the physical exam of a patient deemed for brain death evaluation; they all must be absent for a patient to be diagnosed as brain dead:

- The pupillary reflex to light – must be fixed at a mid-position, usually around 4 to 9 mm, and must not respond to light

- Oculocephalic reflex – performed by rapidly turning the head

- Oculovestibular reflex (cold caloric) – absence when the head is held at 30 degrees and cold water is instilled in the ear canal

- Corneal reflex – stimulate with a swab.

- Gag reflex – stimulate posterior pharynx

- Cough reflex – stimulate with endotracheal suctioning

- The facial movement to noxious stimuli – apply noxious pressure to the supraorbital ridge; there should be no facial muscle response

- Any external injuries causing blood loss
