Argyria is a dermatologic condition that is acquired by exposure to or ingestion of silver, and it presents with the insidious onset of gray or blue mucocutaneous discoloration. While it is considered a benign condition, the diagnosis is difficult, and it is often mistaken for other more common dermatologic conditions. This activity describes the evaluation and explains the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the sources of exposure to silver in the etiology of argyria.
- Describe the physical exam findings in patients with argyria.
- Outline the histopathologic findings of a skin biopsy of an individual diagnosed with argyria.
- Summarize the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in patients with argyria to improve outcomes.
