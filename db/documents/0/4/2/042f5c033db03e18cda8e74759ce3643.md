Radiation therapy has a significant role in local disease control. The risk of cancer recurrence decreases by about 50% at 10 years, and the risk of breast cancer death reduces by almost 20% at 15 years when radiation therapy follows BCS. However, radiation is not necessary for women 70 years of age and older with small, lymph node-negative, hormone receptor-positive (HR+) cancers because it has not been shown to improve survival in patients who take hormonal therapy for at least 5 years. Radiation therapy is beneficial in large tumors (greater to 5 cm) or if the tumor invades skin or chest wall and if there are positive lymph nodes. It can also be used as palliative therapy in advanced cases, such as a central nervous system (CNS) or bone metastasis. It can be delivered as external beam radiation, brachytherapy, or a combination of both.
