A deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of spontaneous intestinal perforation may lead to better preventative strategies. Antenatal and postnatal conditions which cause hypoxemia and decreased intestinal blood flow have been implicated as risk factors for developing spontaneous intestinal perforation. Medications such as early indomethacin and early postnatal glucocorticoids must be cautiously used for infants with such risk factors. Enteral feeding, especially breast milk, and colostrum care should be encouraged from birth.
