Carvedilol is a non-selective adrenergic blocker indicated for the chronic therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), hypertension, and left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction (MI) in clinically stable patients. Using this agent to manage these conditions requires the participation of an interprofessional team. The clinician or specialist will order/prescribe carvedilol when appropriate. However, a pharmacist should be involved to ensure proper dosing for the condition and patient and verify there are no potential drug interactions. Any concerns the pharmacist notes should be reported to the prescriber promptly so that they can consider alternative therapy. Nursing will administer the drug in inpatient and outpatient settings and should have the knowledge to counsel the patient on proper administration, what side effects to watch for, and answer any questions. Nursing can also verify patient adherence and note any potential adverse effects on follow-up visits, reporting concerns to the clinician. Thus, the interprofessional team should work together to watch for signs and symptoms of toxicity, monitor treatment progress, and optimize outcomes. In addition, a study demonstrated that guideline-directed medical therapy (including carvedilol) could decrease mortality in patients suffering from HFrEF (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction).
