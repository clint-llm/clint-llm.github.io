CMNs are usually noted at birth or in the neonatal period. CMNs of small to medium size normally present as well-defined round or ovoid lesions with a smooth surface and uniform brown color. While larger CMNs may present with an irregular border, different pigmentations, and rugous or nodular surface textures.

CMNs may evolve over time with changes in pigmentation, development of dermal nodules, and development of hair in some lesions. Pigmented hair growth or hypertrichosis has an incidence of 75%.

Although usually asymptomatic, larger lesions may have clinical features of xerosis, ulceration, pruritis, or skin erosion.

A particular type of nevus is the "divided nevus." These are paired nevi that may occur on the penis, fingers, or eyelids. They are sometimes called "kissing nevi." Kissing nevi were first described by Fuchs in 1919. These nevi are a single lesion up to the 24th week of gestation. When the eyelids separate after the 24th week of gestation, the nevi divide. Although these nevi are generally present since birth, they can also present at a later age. Associated problems with eyelid kissing nevi are epiphora, eyelid malposition (ptosis or ectropion), or amblyopia.
