Paraproteinemic keratopathy is a correctible cause of vision loss and therefore has an excellent prognosis with treatment. Where the systemic gammopathy is successfully treated, ocular disease progression usually ceases. If treatment occurs early enough, corneal damage may be kept to a minimum and require no further intervention. Where there is significant visual impairment, the corneal transplant has a high degree of success in returning short-term functional vision. If the systemic gammopathy is not resolved, there is a high probability of recurrence after a corneal transplant. With the resolution of systemic disease, ocular symptoms may regress on their own, and patients requiring corneal transplants are likely to have more durable results.
