Numerous variations exist throughout the spinal venous system.

- Variations of intramedullary veins:

Venous angiomas, also called developmental venous anomalies are normal variants of intramedullary spinal veins and appear to correlate with cavernous malformations.

- Variations of the anterior spinal vein:

There is considerable variability in the course that the anterior spinal vein takes in becoming the vein of the filum terminale. It has been shown to deviate from the conus medullaris and course along a sacral or lumbar nerve root.

- Variations of the posterior spinal veins:

The position, course, and anastomotic pattern of the posterior spinal veins show considerable variability. It is usually a single vessel near the conus, but it can be paired or form a plexus called the posterior venous plexus.

- Variation of radicular veins:

While 60% of radicular veins exit the dura with the nerve root, 40% exit through different foramina between adjacent spinal nerves.
