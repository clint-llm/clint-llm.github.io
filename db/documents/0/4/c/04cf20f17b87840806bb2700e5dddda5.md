There are three major mechanisms by which abortion complications can be classified. Infection can be the result of a failure to exercise universal precautions prior to the procedure, such as hand washing, surgical glove use, proper sterilization of the field, use of non-sterile instruments, as well as the presence of a pre-existing infectious process in a patient such as cervicitis or endometritis. Incomplete evacuation of the products of conception leads to the collection of blood in the uterus, causing overdistention and atony which results in hemorrhage. It can also lead to infection and possible sepsis. Injury from the surgical procedure itself depends upon the method used and includes vaginal or cervical lacerations, as well as uterine, bowel, or bladder injury.
