The systemic lupus erythematosus lesions have a characteristic distribution with either papulosquamous lesions or annular lesions with central clearing. These two forms can occur concurrently, and the lesions typically heal without atrophy or scarring. The patient may have hypopigmentation or telangiectasia, but in most patients, the skin returns to normal. Patients with SCLE frequently have a mild illness with musculoskeletal complaints and serologic abnormalities.
