Lyme disease is most commonly reported in theÂ  Northeastern and upper Midwestern United States. The primary states with endemic Lyme disease are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Sporadic cases have been reported in northern California, Oregon, and Washington.

In states where Lyme disease is common, the incidence is about 40 per 100,000 people. The infection occurs during late spring, summer, and early fall.

For some unknown reason, Lyme is commonly reported in Caucasians but can infect all races. Perhaps the skin lesion may not always be obvious in dark-skinned individuals.

Lyme disease affects people of all ages but appears to be slightly more common in females.
