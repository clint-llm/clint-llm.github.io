The NK-1 receptor—the receptor of substance P—is found on chromosome 2 in humans and is a cytoplasmic receptor (located on the cell’s surface). It contains seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains (reaching across the cell membrane seven times) and has three extracellular (EL1, EL2, and EL3) and three intracellular loops (C1, C2, and C3). The amino tail is facing the extracellular space, and the carboxyl-terminal is facing the intracellular space. Between the second and third transmembrane domains of the NK-1 receptor, the binding site for substance P and NK-1 receptor agonists/antagonists is found. Notably, loop C3 contains the G protein system.

The G protein-coupled receptor and the bound substance P molecule are internalized, degraded through the beta-arrestin pathway, and are eventually recycled.
