Patients with metastatic disease often present with progressive pain or other skeletal-related events (SRE). It is not uncommon for a patient to associate an unrelated or nonspecific low energy injury with the SRE.  Often, a patient is treated with pain medication and the symptoms do not completely resolve. A detailed history and physical exam can identify red flags such as night pain, unintentional weight loss,  pain with weight-bearing, or an enlarging mass in the area of concern. The physician should inspect the skin overlying the area of concern for swelling, pain with direct palpation, open wounds, or skin changes/dimpling. The limb can be immobilized with a noninvasive splint to prevent the propagation of the injury or pathologic fracture. The vertebra is the most common site affected, followed by the femur, pelvis, ribs, sternum, proximal humerus, and skull.

As a result of the destruction of normal bone architecture, the following SRE should be considered when evaluating patients with suspected bone metastases:

- Bone pain: Pain associated with bone metastasis is a frequent symptom. It is typically gradual in onset and described as a dull, boring pain that is worse at night.

- Nerve root or spinal cord compression: Bone metastases causing nerve root compression can present as radicular pain different from mechanical pain.

- Spinal cord compression: As the vertebra is the most common site of metastasis, a significant complication includes spinal cord compression, which is an oncologic emergency. Metastatic spinal cord compression occurs either through pathological vertebral collapse or direct epidural extension. Patients may present initially with back pain. Limb weakness is the second most common symptom of cord compression. Sensory symptoms include paresthesia and numbness at and below the level of cord compression. Autonomic dysfunction, including bowel and bladder incontinence and impotence, is typically a late presentation. Early recognition, workup, and prompt surgical consultation are pertinent to prevent permanent neurological damage with resultant paraplegia.

- Hypercalcemia: In the setting of malignancy, this can be multifactorial and confers a poor prognosis overall. Osteolytic bone metastases are associated with 10-30% of the cases of hypercalcemia of malignancy.

- Pathological fractures: Bone metastases cause bone destruction increasing the patient’s risk for atraumatic or impending fracture. The presentation is dependent on the site of the disease however, constant pain is a prevalent symptom. Fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine present with pain characteristically worse with sitting or standing. Pathologic fractures result in significant morbidities resulting from pain, radiculopathy (e.g., sciatica with pelvic fracture), deformities, and immobility.

- Myelophthisis: Symptomatic anemia resulting from infiltration of the bone marrow with metastatic tumor cells. Pancytopenia may also be present in late stages.
