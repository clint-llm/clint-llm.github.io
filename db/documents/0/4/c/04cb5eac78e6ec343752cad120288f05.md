The epidemiology of asplenia differs depending on its etiology. Nearly 100% of sickle cell anemia patients (i.e., those with hemoglobin SS disease) will develop asplenia, and they are prone to overwhelming post-splenectomy infection.

Other diseases associated with reduced function of the spleen include celiac disease, with an estimated prevalence of 33% to 76%, WhippleÂ disease is 47%, and alcoholic liver disease is 37% to 100%.

Remark syndrome is seen in 1 in 10,000 to 40,000 cases.
