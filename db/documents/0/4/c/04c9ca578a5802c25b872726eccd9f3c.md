Sea snakes are not aggressive, although if they feel threatened or surprised, a bite can occur. FishermenÂ are the most at-risk population for sea snake bites, as contact with sea snakes can occur when fishermen attempt to remove sea snakes from their netting. Much like terrestrial snakes, not all bites result in envenomation.
