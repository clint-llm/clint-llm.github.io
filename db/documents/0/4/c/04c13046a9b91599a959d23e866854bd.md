TBG deficiency is a benign disease state subject to easy misdiagnosis as hypothyroidism.  It is important for the clinician to assess the patient appropriately for symptoms of thyroid disease. Though most patients with TBG deficiency are clinically euthyroid, there have been case reports that illustrate concomitant disease with other thyroid abnormalities such as Graves disease.  As such, clinicians should possess a low threshold to refer to endocrinology when patients have a known history of other thyroid disease states and are now presenting with TBG deficiency even if they are euthyroid.

In summary, TBG deficiency requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level V]
