The internal pelvic organs receive nerve supply from the autonomic nervous system, sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. AutonomicÂ  T11 and T12 innervate the uterus, and it derives its sympathetic nerve supply from the hypogastric plexus, and the parasympathetic supply is from S2 to S4. The uterus and cervix are insensitive to cutting and burning. So the cervix can be cauterized without anesthesia during therapeutic procedures. However, the uterus and cervix are sensitive to stretch (distension), and dilation of the cervix causes pain during normal vaginal delivery.
