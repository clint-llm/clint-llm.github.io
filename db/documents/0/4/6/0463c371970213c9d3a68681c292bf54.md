Nerve blocks targeting the greater occipital nerve can be used as the primary treatment of headaches but are more often used to treat intractable headaches when other methods have failed.

The greater occipital nerve block can be an effective and safe treatment option for several headache disorders, including occipital neuralgia, migraine, post-dural puncture headache, cervicogenic headache, and cluster headache.

Patients who report allodynia of the scalp and those who have reproducible pain with palpation of the GON are most likely to achieve the desired analgesic response after receiving treatment. The GON-block is also a viable treatment option for headaches in the elderly and pregnant population who have comorbidities that prevent them from receiving other first-line treatment regimens.
