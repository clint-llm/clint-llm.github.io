The prognosis of FBAO depends on the degree of obstruction and duration of hypoxia. Patients with partial FBAO that can clear the airway have little to no complications and can be managed based on any existing risk factors for future aspiration events. In a complete FBAO, loss of consciousness occurs in seconds to minutes. For patients requiring CPR, outcomes are particularly grim as mortality reaches 90% for out of hospital cardiac arrests, and of those who survive to hospital admission, mortality reaches 60%-70%.
