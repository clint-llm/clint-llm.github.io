Theophylline is a drug derived from methylxanthine (a purine derivative) and has smooth muscle relaxant, bronchial dilation, diuretic, cardiac and central nervous system (CNS) stimulant activities. It is naturally present in small amounts in tea and cocoa beans and was initially extracted and synthesized in 1895 and used as a diuretic. In 1922, it came out as a clinical treatment for asthma after identifying its bronchodilator effect. It is used to treat various respiratory conditions that obstruct the airways, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

**Medical Uses**

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

- Asthma

- Infant Apnea

- Anosmia, which is currently under investigation. A clinical study in 2008 reported that theophylline could potentially improve the sense of smell in those with anosmia.

**Asthma Exacerbations**

Treatment of asthma exacerbation with theophylline is not recommended from the current clinical practice guidelines (2018 GINA Report, Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention; National asthma education and prevention program-NAEPP 2007).

**COPD Management**

According to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) in 2018, the management of acute COPD with IV theophylline is not recommended by the current clinical practice guidelines due to its significant side effects.
