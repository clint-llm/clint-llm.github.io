Condyloma acuminata are usually asymptomatic, although they may occasionally cause bleeding, pruritus, and pain. Patients will generally present concerned about the appearance of the lesions, as they often cause psychological and psychosexual distress. Condyloma acuminata may also be found incidentally during routine female gynecological examinations. The appearance of the lesion depends on the type of HPV and the site of infection.

Lesions are generally found in multiples and can coalesce into a larger lesion. However, solitary lesions are also possible. Oral condyloma acuminata are typically present on the tongue and lip.
