A Baker's Cyst typically is diagnosed by having the patient stand and extend the knee full; this is when the mass should be most prominent. When the knee is flexed to 45 degrees, the mass often either softens or fully disappears (e.g., Foucher's sign) due to the relief of tension within the cyst. The patient also should be examined in a supine position, where the knee is passively moved from full extension to at least 90 degrees flexion, to ensure adequate examination of the knee joint.

If a Baker's Cyst is located more laterally or no changes are elicited in the cyst when the knee is examined in a full range of motion, it may be difficult to conclude a diagnosis of Baker's Cyst through physical examination alone, especially in a setting of no prior history of knee pathology.

If this is the case, and a diagnosis of Baker's Cyst remains uncertain, imaging should be performed. This includes plain radiography and ultrasonography, followed by MRI, especially if considering surgery.
