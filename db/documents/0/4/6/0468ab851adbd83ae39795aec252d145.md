Many factors contribute to the hemodynamic and cardiorespiratory changes that induce leakage of fluid from the capillary into the interstitial space and eventually, into the alveolar airspace. IPE is likely due to stress failure secondary to increased pulmonary vascular resistance, transudative edema, and pulmonary capillary leak. With immersion, there is an increase in pulmonary and systemic arterial pressure caused by passive redistribution of venous blood from the extremities to the heart and pulmonary vessels. This increase in intrathoracic blood volume results in a measured decrease in vital capacity. Cold water will augment this further with a reduction in vital capacity to 91% of baseline and increased shunting centrally as a means of heat conservation. This cold water effect is primarily seen with exposure to the torso and limbs rather than the head. Extreme physical exertion will also increase peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) causing increased afterload as well as increased pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), and pre-load from redistribution of blood from peripheral to thoracic vessels which are augmented further in cold water immersion.
