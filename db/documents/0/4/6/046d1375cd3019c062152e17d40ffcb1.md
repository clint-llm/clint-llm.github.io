The preferred specimen is non-hemolyzed, non-lipemic serum. One study found no significant difference between heparinized plasma and serum, although results from EDTA plasma samples were significantly lower than serum samples.

Urine samples should be collected without preservatives and assayed within 24 hours of sample collection. If the test is not performed immediately after sample collection, the urine sample should be kept at 2^oC to 8^oC and centrifuged to remove any debris before the assay.
