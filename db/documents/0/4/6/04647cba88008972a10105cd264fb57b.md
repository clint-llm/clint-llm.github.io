Delirium is a sign that something may be wrong and should be appropriately evaluated.

Preventing delirium is important, and monitoring intake and output, treating pain, optimizing sleep, and using hearing and visual aids as needed can help prevent and treat delirium.

It is essential to monitor for hypoactive as well as hyperactive delirium.
