The role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating women is critical. As mentioned, surgical procedures on the breast can influence breast milk production and ejection. The main factors include the type of surgery performed, whether neural or ductal pathways were disturbed, and the amount of breast tissue removed. Breast augmentation usually does not interfere with full breastfeeding, but breast reduction surgery often leads to the inability to breastfeed. Some breast reduction surgery involves completely removing the nipple and then reattaching it after excess breast tissue is removed; this will interfere with nerve and ductal pathways. The pedicle technique involves keeping the nipple attached, and tissue around this pedicle is removed. This has a somewhat higher chance of allowing breast milk production and ejection to occur. Breast surgery for benign tumors or cancer also can affect the ability of the breast to produce milk.
