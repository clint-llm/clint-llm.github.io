Red blood cells can be visualized via light microscopy and electron microscopy, each revealing specific details of the erythrocyte structure. Below are descriptions of how both light microscopy and electron microscopy contribute to the understanding of red blood cells. Histochemical stains have also played a role in identifying key components within a red blood cell, assisting in disease diagnosis. The hallmark stain for histological evaluation of erythrocytes is hematoxylin and eosin. Other stains though have allowed for more specific pathologic finding to be identified on light microscopy. For example, Giemsa stains have been utilized in the histology of red blood cells for identification of the plasmodium of malaria and are useful in the diagnosis of lymphoma.
