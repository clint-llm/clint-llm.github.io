LCA is a rare splenic vascular tumor discovered either as an incidental finding or patients may present with abdominal pain. It appears to affect individuals of age group. However, most reported cases are in the middle-aged adult population and very few in children. There is no gender predilection, and the incidence appears to be equal in both males and females.
