Dieulafoy lesion is a developmental vascular malformation of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) first described by a French Surgeon, Paul Georges Dieulafoy, in 1898 as “exulceratio simplex.” It is a rare cause of life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding that constitutes about 1% to 2% of all the causes of gastrointestinal bleeding and 6.5% of all causes of upper gastrointestinal non-variceal bleeding.

The Dieulafoy lesion is composed of a normal blood vessel with an abnormally wide diameter of 1 to 3 mm, protruding into the mucosa from the submucosa. The protrusion results in a small wall defect in GIT with fibrinoid necrosis at the base of the lesion; 70% of these lesions are found in the stomach, usually along the lesser curvature.
