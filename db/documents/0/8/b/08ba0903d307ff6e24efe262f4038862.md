DED has traditionally been classified into two categories: aqueous deficient and evaporative.

Meibomian glands line the eyelid margins and secrete oils that become the lipid layer of the tear film and reduce the evaporation of tears. Meibomian gland dysfunction may be caused by inadequate secretion due to atrophy, drop out of the glands, or obstruction of the gland orifices. Other major causes of increased tear evaporation include poor blinking (low rate, incomplete lid closure), disorders of the lid aperture, deficiency in vitamin A, contact lens use, and environmental factors (low humidity, high airflow).

A hallmark of DED is hyperosmolarity of the tear film, which may damage the ocular surface directly or indirectly by inciting inflammation.
