There are a wide variety of pathologies that interrupt normal sleep physiology. A few of the most common are included below:

**Physiological Disruptions of Sleep**

Narcolepsy results from the inherited loss of orexin-releasing neurons in the lateral hippocampus, which causes somnolence, sleep cycle disruptions, and cataplexy.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the cessation of airflow despite normal respiratory effort due to partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway.

**Psychiatric Disruptions of Sleep**

Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated with decreases in REM latency, increased REM density, and a prolonged first REM cycle.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by the broad range of sleep disturbances that are observed as a patient fluctuates between episodes of mania, bipolar depression, and euthymia.

Schizophrenia is associated with several changes in REM sleep, including reduced REM latency, higher REM density, and the failure to rebound from REM sleep deprivation.

Parasomnias are a class of pathologies defined as behavioral manifestations of partial arousals from sleep, particularly REM sleep.

REM behavior disorder (REMBD) is a particularly interesting parasomnia. REMBD is an idiopathic disturbance of sleep architecture characterized by significantly decreased REM muscle atonia that results in the active enactment of dreams during REM sleep.

Insomnia is characterized by the dysfunction of sleep onset or maintenance not caused by substances or secondary medical conditions.

Several common substances and medications are associated with REM sleep disruption. Alcohol is a commonly used substance for self-medication and significantly delays the first onset of REM sleep.
