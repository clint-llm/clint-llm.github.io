Neurotransmission medication occurs via the vesicular release of neurotransmitters at presynaptic nerve terminals. Specifically, calcium-evoked exocytosis of the presynaptic vesicles is what enables the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse. Active zones, specialized areas on the presynaptic plasma membranes, tether the neurotransmitter-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane. Once an action potential triggers calcium influx into the presynaptic cleft, active zones undergo fusion with the vesicles, allowing neurotransmitter release.
