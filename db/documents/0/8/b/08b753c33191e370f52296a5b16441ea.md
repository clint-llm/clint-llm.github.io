Midgut volvulus is a twisting of malrotated bowel, which can present in the first month of life with bilious vomiting. An upper GI series will show a "corkscrew" appearance of the bowel. An abdominal CT scan will show an inverted relationship between the superior mesenteric artery and the superior mesenteric vein.

Also in the differential diagnosis are gastroenteritis, acute renal failure, sepsis, hernia, colic, constipation, necrotizing enterocolitis, trauma, toxic megacolon, Hirschsprung disease, testicular torsion, appendicitis, and urinary tract infection.
