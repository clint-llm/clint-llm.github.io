Acute giardia enteritis symptoms include the onset of frequent diarrhea.  One study noted maximal stools of 8.5 per day as a median when the number of maximal stools was analyzed.

Chronic symptoms include intermittent chronic diarrhea or loose stools, bloating, abdominal pain, functional dyspepsia, secondary lactose intolerance, malnutrition, and weight loss. Interestingly, there is evidence of chronic giardia infection in approximately 5% to 10% of patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel syndrome (IBS).

Due to the possible extraintestinal manifestations of Giardia enteritis, in addition to a thorough abdominal exam, fundoscopic, musculoskeletal, and skin exams should be conducted to rule out any retinal, arthritic, myopathic, or allergic components.
