Low back pain is among the most common complaints in active workers and a significant cause of absenteeism from work. Sciatic pain radiates from the buttocks to the leg and is frequently associated with low back pain. In this regard, a neurological examination is fundamental in distinguishing patients with isolated lower back pain from those with associated radiculopathy. Consequently, early recognition of radiculopathy allows targeted treatment and diminishes disability.

This maneuver can provide information for many interprofessional team members, including physicians, mid-level practitioners, nursing staff, physical therapists, and chiropractors. Performing this maneuver correctly, when indicated, helpsÂ the interprofessional team assess the need for imaging studies such as X-rays and MRI and the potential need for a referral from primary care to a spine specialist. Each team member must record the test result in the patient's health record and report these findings to other team members as appropriate. The best possible outcome for patients with low back pain could never be achieved without the interprofessional collaboration of the various mentioned disciplines. The need for clear communication strategies between interprofessional healthcare members and their patients is key to attaining the best possible standards of care.
