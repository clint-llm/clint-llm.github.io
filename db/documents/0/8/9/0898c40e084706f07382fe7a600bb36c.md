A fistula is created when long-term hemodialysis is required. Nephrologists consider a measurement of eGFR and other of signs and symptoms associated with kidney failure when initiating hemodialysis. Typically, symptoms develop as eGFR declines below 10 mL per minute per 1.73 m. Uremic pericarditis and uremic pericarditis are absolute indications that develop with eGFR less than 5. Other more commonly seen symptoms include declining nutritional status, inability to maintain fluid volume, or difficulty treating fluid overload, fatigue, or cognitive impairment. Patients with chronic kidney disease are frequently monitored and may develop acidosis, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia. As these values continue to worsen, initiation of hemodialysis should be considered. Creatinine clearance less than 25 ml per minute is a commonly used lab indicator along with serum creatinine greater than 4 mg/dl.Â Any patient with a suspected need for hemodialysis within 1 year should have long-term access planning initiated.
