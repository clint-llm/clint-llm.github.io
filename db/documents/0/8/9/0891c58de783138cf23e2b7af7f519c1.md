It is important to evaluate the piriformis muscle before engaging in treatment for two reasons, first to address and note the severity of the dysfunction prior to treatment, and second, to assess improvement of the dysfunction after treatment.

Evaluation of the piriformis muscle can occur in one of three ways depending on which technique an osteopathic physician is using to treat

- Supine

- Grab the ankles above the medial malleolus bilaterally (apply gentle traction to ensure that any rotation is coming from the hip and not the knees) and internally rotate to compare both sides
- The extremity that does not internally rotate can potentially have a spasm within the piriformis muscle.

- Prone

- Bend knees at 90 degrees and have the patient drop their legs laterally
- The extremity that laterally drops the least can potentially have a spasm within the piriformis muscle.

- Tender-point/trigger-point

- Find the point of tenderness at the body of the piriformis muscle.
