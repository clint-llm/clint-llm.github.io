Enchondromas are cartilaginous tumors of the benign bone tumor family. Common benign bone tumors include enchondroma, osteochondroma, chondroblastoma, and chondromyxoid fibroma, all hail from a cartilage origin.

These tumors are usually solitary, central, metaphyseal lesions of tubular bones, favoring the small bones of the hand and feet, followed by the femur and humerus. These are also the most common primary bone tumors of the hand.

Some benign bone lesions do, however, have malignant potential; enchondromas and osteochondromas can transform into chondrosarcoma.
