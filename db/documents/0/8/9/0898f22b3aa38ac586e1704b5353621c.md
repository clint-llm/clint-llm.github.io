Ataxia telangiectasia (Louis-Bar Syndrome) is a rare autosomal recessive condition characterized by cutaneous telangiectasias, cerebellar atrophy with progressive ataxia, and a higher incidence of malignancy, immune deficiency, radiosensitivity, recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in serum. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of ataxia telangiectasia and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the abnormal ATM gene in the etiology of ataxia telangiectasia.
- Outline the pathophysiology of ataxia telangiectasia.
- Describe the use of genetic testing to diagnose ataxia telangiectasia.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by ataxia telangiectasia.
