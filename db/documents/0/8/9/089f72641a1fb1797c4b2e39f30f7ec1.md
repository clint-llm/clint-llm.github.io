There are various issues of concern with LVA. These include the following:

**Non-availability of Low Vision Aids Services**

The presence of LVA services in a region does not necessarily mean good coverage of services. A survey in 195 countries revealed that only 115 had coverage of LVA services; among 115, 39% had <10% coverage, 22 had coverage between 11 to 50%, and 8 had coverage of more than 50%. Only 23 countries had coverage in the Asia Pacific region, and five countries had >10% coverage.

The countries or areas with >10% coverage had a higher proportion of older people and a more urbanized population. The survey also revealed that LVA services were primarily monodisciplinary and were available at secondary and tertiary eye care levels.

**Poor Socioeconomic Strata**

Patients with poor income, daily wage earners, rural areas, small children, women, patients with disabilities, ethnic origin, refugees, and the elderly are also the vulnerable age group who miss LVA services.

**Other Barriers**

- Long traveling distance to access the services

- Access to cost and affordability

- Lack of awareness

- Lack of referral services

- The communication gap between patients and doctors

- Lack of motivation for visual rehabilitation

- Patient misconceptions and wrong perceptions
