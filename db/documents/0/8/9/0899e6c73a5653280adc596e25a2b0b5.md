Biopsy of the minor salivary glands is the ideal test to confirm the diagnosis of Sjogren syndrome. The minor salivary glands are accessed by making an incision in the inner lip. However, a biopsy is not mandatory in all cases if the clinical and laboratory features are suggestive of the syndrome. The typical findings on a biopsy will reveal aggregates of more than 50 lymphocytes, some macrophages and plasma cells. CD4 cells are predominant, and about 10% of lymphocytes will be CD5 positive B cells that produce IgG and IgM antibodies.
