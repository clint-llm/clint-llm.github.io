The basis of autonomic pharmacology reflects the physiology of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) to regulate involuntary reactions to stresses on multiorgan systems within the body. When a pathologic process is present that affects the homeostasis achieved between the SNS and PSNS in this process, either of these branches can become overactive while the other is excessively inhibited. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, safe administration, adverse effects, contraindications, toxicology, and monitoring of the broad array of physiological possibilities when using autonomic pharmacology.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the four major classes of pharmacological agents in autonomic pharmacology.
- Summarize the mechanism of action of each of the four main categories of autonomic pharmacological agents.
- Review the side effects of each of the four classes of autonomic pharmacological agents.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance appropriate clinical outcomes with these classes of medications, leading to optimal patient outcomes.
