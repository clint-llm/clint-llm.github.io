Egg allergy is IgE-mediated and healthy individuals are capable of generating antigen-specific IgE upon exposure to egg allergens.  It is believed that there may be a genetic component to the development of egg allergy as the progeny of atopic individuals are more likely to suffer from allergies themselves.  The consensus is that IgE responses are genetically controlled by MHC-linked genes that are found on chromosome six. Other components that may be associated with atopy and allergy include the IgE Fc receptor located on chromosome eleven.
