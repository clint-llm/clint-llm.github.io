Exposure varies depending on the locale and season. Jobs requiring climbing trees or working closely with plants is a risk factor in adults.  Children, being naturally curious and tending to pick up or touch caterpillars, are at somewhat increased risk of exposure.  Cases among males are more numerous than with females.  Areas, where indigenous species shed setae carried through the air, can result in multiple exposures, especially in seasons when they are plentiful.

Spring or summer can result in a spike of cases with regards to school recess, camping/hiking, logging activity, or landscaping.
