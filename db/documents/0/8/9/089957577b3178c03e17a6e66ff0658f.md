Renal scintigraphy usage and indications have changed with the improvements in other modalities particularly regarding each modality's ability to resolve kidney anatomy and evaluate the kidneys for the disease. Despite improvements in anatomic resolution by various other modalities lessening the role of scintigraphy for anatomic evaluation, scintigraphy maintains a key role in evaluating renal function. It has a role in evaluating renal, pylocalyceal, ureteral, and bladder anatomy.

Areas of clinical evaluation with nuclear medicine agents include:

- Reno-vascular hypertension

- Obstructive uropathy

- Renal anomalies

- Renal transplant

- Renal parenchymal infections particularly pyelonephritis and postinfectious scarring

- Renal masses

- Renal trauma

- Ureteric trauma
