**Histochemistry**

Since the outer membrane of the RER is studded with ribosomes, it will have a relatively basophilic stain in the cytoplasm when using H&E stains, due to the presence of negatively charged rRNA.

**Cytochemistry**

A cytochemical study revealed that BiP is found exclusively within the RER.
