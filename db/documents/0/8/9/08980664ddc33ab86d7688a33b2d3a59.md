Malignant tumors of the palate incorporate a wide range of differing histologies with their own distinctive characteristics. The location is rich in minor salivary glands with close interaction between the mucosa and underlying periosteum, which creates a unique array of tumor histologies from their adjacent subsites. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of malignant tumors of the palate and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of malignant tumors of the palate 
- Summarize the physical evaluation of malignant tumors of the palate.
- Outline the management options available for malignant tumors of the palate.
