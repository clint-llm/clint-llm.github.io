Aphasia is an impairment of language function which is localized to the dominant cerebral hemisphere. Wernicke aphasia is characterized by impaired language comprehension. Despite this impaired comprehension, speech may have a normal rate, rhythm, and grammar. The most common cause of Wernickeâ€™s aphasia is an ischemic stroke affecting the posterior temporal lobe of the dominant hemisphere. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of patients with Wernicke aphasia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the typical presentation of a patient with Wernicke aphasia.
- Describe the pathophysiology of Wernicke aphasia.
- Review the importance of imaging studies in making the diagnosis of Wernicke aphasia.
- Explain the importance of coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients presenting with Wernicke aphasia.
