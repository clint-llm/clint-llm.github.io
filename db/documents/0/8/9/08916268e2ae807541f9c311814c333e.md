Most acute zinc ingestions present with gastrointestinal symptoms alone, making the diagnosis extremely difficult when there is no reported history of exposure. Severe toxicity may also mimic many other pathologies and rarely present with acute kidney injury, pancreatic injury, liver failure, and hemodynamic instability. Septic shock, acute GI bleed, and other toxic ingestions may present similarly, to name a few. The clinical challenge is to consider zinc toxicity as a potential diagnosis among many more common causes. Inhalation injury from zinc compounds such as smoke bombs may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is seen in many other disease processes. Metal fume fever can present as an upper respiratory infection, though the clinician should suspect it in patients who are only symptomatic after occupational exposure. Chronic toxicity of zinc should be considered when iron-deficiency anemia does not respond to iron supplements. More common causes of anemia would be blood loss, an iron-deficient diet, and bone marrow abnormalities, among many others. Sideroblastic myelodysplastic syndrome unresponsive to conventional therapy may be caused by copper deficiency due to chronic zinc toxicity.
