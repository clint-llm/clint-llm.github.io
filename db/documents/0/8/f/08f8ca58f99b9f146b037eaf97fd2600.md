Surgery for MTM is technically challenging. The visual contrast in high myopic eyes is poor, and ILM peeling becomes difficult. The thin ILM in such eyes is extremely fragile and is very difficult to grasp and peel. Therefore, an iatrogenic tear of ILM and the formation of a macular hole post-surgery is not uncommon. For fear of forming a macular hole, some surgeons advocate fovea-sparing ILM peeling. Cataract formation is quite common following pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade. Macular buckling is technically challenging and may have complications like an incomplete resolution or recurrence of MTM, choroidal detachment, subretinal hemorrhage, or extrusion of the buckle in the post-operative phase.
