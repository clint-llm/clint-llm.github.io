The most common complaint of female patients with uterine prolapse is the visualization or sensation of a bulge in the vaginal area, associated with vaginal pressure. Other symptoms include increased urinary urgency or frequency, the sensation of incomplete bladder emptying, and dyspareunia. The symptoms will come on gradually and may worsen over time as the prolapse progresses. The number and degree of symptoms have been shown to increase with worsening severity of prolapse. However, specific symptoms that patients experience do not correlate well with the stage of prolapse,Â and many patients are completely asymptomatic in the early stages of uterine prolapse.

In addition to symptoms reported by patients, the pelvic exam is crucial to the diagnosis of uterine prolapse due to direct visualization of the prolapsed segment. A pelvic exam should be performed while the patient is at rest and during the Valsalva maneuver. Visualization of the prolapsed segment with respect to the hymen or introitus is used for staging purposes (see below for the POP-Q method of staging).
