The location of the bifurcation of the obturator nerve is variable between sites within the pelvic cavity, obturator canal, or medial thigh. Typically, the obturator nerve enters the thigh after passing through the obturator canal and divides into the anterior and posterior divisions. However, the bifurcation of the obturator nerve can be within the obturator canal (51.78%), in the thigh (25%), or intrapelvic (23.22%). Additionally, the anterior branch can form anywhere from two to four branches, with three branches being the most predominant. In comparison, the posterior branch can form one to four subdivisions, with two divisions being the dominant variant. The articular branches of the obturator nerve demonstrated nine different branching patterns. In terms of cutaneous innervation, research has shown that the obturator nerve provides innervation to the skin surface of the medial thigh, although, has been shown to provide no cutaneous innervation in more than 50% of cases.
