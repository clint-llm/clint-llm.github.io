Sigstad developed a diagnostic index for Dumping syndrome, which includes multiple signs or symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and shock. A score of greater than seven may suggest Dumping syndrome.

A rating scale based on a self-assessment questionnaire, the Dumping Symptom Rating Scale, is another way to identify patients with severe symptoms.

An oral glucose challenge test can trigger the signs and symptoms of Dumping syndrome. After a 50-gram oral glucose challenge following a 10-hour fast, if the patient has an elevated heart rate by ten beats or more per minute in the first hour, studies demonstrate 100% sensitivity and 94% specificity for early Dumping syndrome.

Additional methods to elicit more information regarding the anatomy include endoscopy, barium upper GI study, and gastric emptying scan.
