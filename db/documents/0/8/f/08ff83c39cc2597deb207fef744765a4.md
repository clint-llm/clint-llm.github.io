Mid-forehead brow lifts are ideally performed by experienced and skilled surgeons with intimate knowledge of the relevant anatomy and physiology and familiarity with preoperative and postoperative care of brow lift patients. A team experienced in managing periocular and aging face issues is indispensable when caring for brow lift patients, as preoperative visual assessment, preoperative photography, and postoperative suture removal are often performed by personnel other than the operating surgeon.
