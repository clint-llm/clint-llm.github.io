The pathophysiology of gait disturbances is complex. Normal gait involves a gait cycle that has a stance phase and a swing phase. When one limb swings, the contralateral limb stance. The duration in each phase varies depending on the velocity of gait and can be altered in different gait disturbances. Normal gait is a combination of central nervous system control, as well as peripheral nervous system feedback.

Initially, the normal physiology must be delineated to understand how deviations from this norm contribute to gait disturbances. At rest, in the erect position, an individual relies on sensory feedback to maintain its center of gravity.

Gait occurs in a cycle from initiation of the first leg heel strike to termination with the next heel strike to propel the movement of an individual.
