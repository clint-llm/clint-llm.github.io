GERD is an extremely common condition with prevalence rates ranging from 8-40% worldwide. BE is found in 1.3 to 1.6% of the general population and 5 to 15% of symptomatic GERD patients undergoing endoscopy. The prevalence of BE among children is much less, only up to 4.8%. The incidence of GERD, BE, and EAC has been increasing significantly over the last four decades, though this may partially be attributable to increased numbers of endoscopies, it remains an alarming indication of how current management of these conditions is in great need of improvement and further research. More than 95% of patients with BE do not develop cancer. Studies indicate the absolute annual risk of EAC in nondysplastic BE is 0.1 to 0.5%/year, a highly variable 1 to 43%/year for low-grade dysplasia, and 23-60%/year for high-grade dysplasia. A greater extent of dysplasia has a significantly higher risk of cancer as well as the presence of an endoscopic abnormality.
