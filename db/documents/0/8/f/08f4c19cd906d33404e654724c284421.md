Glycogenolysis is the biochemical pathway in which glycogen breaks down into glucose-1-phosphate and glucose. The reaction takes place in the hepatocytes and the myocytes. The process is under the regulation of two key enzymes: phosphorylase kinase and glycogen phosphorylase.

Blood glucose is a source of energy for the entire human body. During the fasting state, to maintain normal blood glucose levels, the liver plays a central role in producing glucose via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.

Glycogen is a branched polysaccharide consisting of glucose units. In humans, it is the principal storage form of glucose. During times of need, the body breaks down glycogen to produce glucose.
