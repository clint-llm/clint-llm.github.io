Islet cell transplantation is currently approved for patients with type I diabetes mellitus who experience unrecognized hypoglycemic episodes that are refractory to medical management. Long term follow-up has shown as many as 50 to 70% of patients remain insulin independent five years after transplant. These results show promising potential for allograft islet cell transplantation use for the treatment of type I diabetes mellitus. One of the major deterrents to this procedure gaining acceptance as a definitive cure is the requirement of lifelong immunosuppressants to prevent graft loss. Promising research in mice has shown improved graft survival with inhibition of a Prostaglandin D2 receptor. This receptor, GPR44/DP2, results in impaired insulin secretion once activated.

Inclusion criteria:

- Mentally stability and able to adhere to protocols

- History consistent with type I diabetes, age of onset <40 years, insulin-dependent for >5 years

- Age range 18 to 65

- Despite adherence to intense insulin regimen and expert direction, the patient has at least two documented episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia within a six month time interval.
