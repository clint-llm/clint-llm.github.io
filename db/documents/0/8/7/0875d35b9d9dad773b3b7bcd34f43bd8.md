Lumbosacral facet joint syndrome will increase with age, especially when secondary to its most common cause of facet joint osteoarthritis. Conservative treatments, including physical therapy, should serve as first-line management. Patient's who fail conservative treatment with physical therapy and medications may undergo a diagnostic medial branch block indicative of facetogenic etiology of pain. In patients with successful diagnostic blocks, radiofrequency ablation has been shown to relieve pain for six months up to 1 year, at which time repeat neurolysis may be performed if indicated.
