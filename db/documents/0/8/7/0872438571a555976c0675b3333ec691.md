Cerebellopontine angle (CPA) is a triangular space in the posterior cranial fossa that is bounded by the tentorium superiorly, brainstem posteromedially and petrous part of temporal bone posterolaterally. It is an important landmark anatomically and clinically as it is occupied by the CPA cistern, which houses the cranial nerve V, VI, VII, and VIII along with the anterior inferior cerebellar artery.

The clinical significance of CPA stems from the variety of lesions that involve this region and present with a myriad of non-specific symptoms, the most common of which are sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and dizziness.
