Below are the Tanner Stages described in detail for clinical reference. Tanner Stage 1 corresponds to the pre-pubertal form for all three sites of development with progression to Tanner Stage 5, the final adult form. Breast and genital staging, as well as other physical markers of puberty such as height velocity, should be relied on more than pubic hair staging to assess pubertal development because of the independent maturation of the adrenal axis.

**Pubic Hair Scale (both males and females)**

- Stage 1: No hair

- Stage 2: Downy hair

- Stage 3: Scant terminal hair

- Stage 4: Terminal hair that fills the entire triangle overlying the pubic region

- Stage 5: Terminal hair that extends beyond the inguinal crease onto the thigh

**Female Breast Development Scale**

- Stage 1: No glandular breast tissue palpable

- Stage 2: Breast bud palpable under the areola (1st pubertal sign in females)

- Stage 3: Breast tissue palpable outside areola; no areolar development

- Stage 4: Areola elevated above the contour of the breast, forming a “double scoop” appearance

- Stage 5: Areolar mound recedes into single breast contour with areolar hyperpigmentation, papillae development, and nipple protrusion

**Male External Genitalia Scale**

- Stage 1: Testicular volume < 4 ml or long axis < 2.5 cm

- Stage 2: 4 ml-8 ml (or 2.5 to 3.3 cm long), 1st pubertal sign in males

- Stage 3: 9 ml-12 ml (or 3.4 to 4.0 cm long)

- Stage 4: 15-20 ml (or 4.1 to 4.5 cm long)

- Stage 5: > 20 ml (or > 4.5 cm long)
