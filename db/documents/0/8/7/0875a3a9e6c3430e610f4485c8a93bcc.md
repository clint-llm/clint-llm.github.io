The effective management of jugular foramen syndrome requires an interprofessional approach.

TheÂ clinical skills of an astute physician or neurologist are needed to diagnose this condition. Confirmation of the diagnosis requires the presence of a neuroradiologist, specialized in interventional neuroradiology, who is skilled in interpreting the MRI and DSA images. If the patient needs surgery, the active involvement of a neurosurgeon, otorhinolaryngologist, plastic surgeon, and neuro anesthetists is necessary for a good outcome.

In the postoperative period, the timely decisions to do tracheostomy and feeding gastrostomy, with appropriate care by neuroscience specialty nurses is mandatory. A dietitian should be involved in the care to determine the type of nutrition. Also, since most patients need a tracheostomy, respiratory therapists need to educate the caregivers on its management. Nurses should provide and administer deep venous thrombosis and pressure ulcer prophylaxis, and alert the clinicians of any concerns they encounter. The social worker should be involved to ensure that the patient has adequate home facilities and support services. Since many patients do become depressed, enlisting a mental health nurse consult is a recommended step.

Both the physiotherapist and voice therapist have their unique roles in the long run. Open communication among members of the healthcare team is vital if one wants to improve patient outcomes. [Level 5]
