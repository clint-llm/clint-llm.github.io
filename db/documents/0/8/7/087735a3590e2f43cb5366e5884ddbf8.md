Given the favorable outcome and often spontaneous resolution of the vast majority of low back pain symptoms, extensive imaging is usually not necessary in patients with low back pain of less than four to six weeks duration. As stated above, work-up begins with a thorough physical exam. Neurologic deficits in a focal distribution warrant further workup. In cases of low back pain that fails to resolve within one to two months, MRI is considered the gold standard in evaluating radicular low back pain. Of note, MRI with contrast is recommended in patients with previous spinal surgeries. For patients unable to undergo MRI, a CT scan is an alternative option. However, CT is not as sensitive in visualizing soft tissue or tumors and is not recommended for routine use. X-rays are simple, readily available in most developed countries, and can reveal gross bony abnormalities such as fractures, disc space narrowing, and other osteodegenerative changes. Often, it is not clinically possible to distinguish lumbosacral radiculopathy from peripheral neuropathy or plexopathy. In these instances, electromyography and nerve conduction studies can be utilized to localize a lesion with relatively high diagnostic specificity.
