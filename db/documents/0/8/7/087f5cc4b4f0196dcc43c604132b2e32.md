It is important to identifyÂ triphasic waves and differentiate them from normal EEG variants and other abnormal EEG waveforms. The absence of asterixis in a patient with triphasic waveforms must warrant neuroimaging to evaluate for structural abnormalities, which can cause triphasic waves. It is important to understand that triphasic waves are not specific to any disease or pathology. These waveforms may also be seen in association with subclinical status epilepticus. Hence, careful consideration must be made to evaluate for subclinical status epilepticus and to follow other EEG guidelines, including rhythmicity, change in morphology, evolution, and correlation with clinical changes.
