Basal cell cancer is a common presentation in the outpatient clinic. While the dermatologist or the plastic surgeon manages the majority of basal cell cancers, other healthcare workers need to know the presenting features- so that an appropriate referral can be made. The majority of basal cell cancers remain localized, and metastatic spread is rare. However, if treatment is delayed, these cancers can invade local tissue and cause severe cosmetic problems, including loss of vision. The best way to treat basal cell cancers is to prevent them in the first place, which means patient education by physicians and nurses. Patients should be told to avoid direct sunlight and wear sunscreen when going outdoors. Also, a wide brim hat and long-sleeved garments can protect against the harmful effects of UV light. Pharmacists should review prescriptions for topical medications and counsel patients about their use and potential side effects. Dermatology and plastic surgery nurses provide patient education, arrange follow-up visits, and report changes or issues to the team.

Finally, patients should be taught the warning signs of basal cell cancer and when to seek medical help. The outcomes for most patients with basal cell cancer are excellent, but long-term follow-up is necessary as there is a chance of recurrence.
