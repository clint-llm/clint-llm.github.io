Patellofemoral arthritis is a common cause of anterior knee pain. The patellofemoral joint is composed of the bony patella, which is a sesamoid bone embedded in the quadriceps and patella tendons and the femur. A prepatellar bursa separates the patella from the overlying skin. Patients with patellofemoral arthritis frequently have a history of instability, including dislocation or subluxation, laxity, malalignment which usually manifests as lateralization, muscle imbalance, or high riding patella. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology and progression of patellofemoral arthritis.
- Review the components of a proper evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with patellofemoral arthritis, including any indicated diagnostic imaging studies.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for patellofemoral arthritis.
- Explain possible interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and treatment of patellofemoral arthritis and improve outcomes.
