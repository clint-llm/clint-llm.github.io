As an enzyme, acetylcholinesterase exists as a monomer that often polymerizes into a dimer with a disulfide bond. Along with Van der Waals forces, two dimers may be linked to become tetramers. The tetramers assemble and bind themselves to what is described as “tails” made up of three strands. Chemically and immunologically, these tails structurally resemble collagen and may be broken down by collagenases. With an additional disulfide bond, the dimers of the tetramer link to each tail. A study by Brimijoin et al. describes the six combinations of AChE: three forms of the globular structure (monomers, dimers, tetramers) and three forms of tetramers (tailed, double, triple).
