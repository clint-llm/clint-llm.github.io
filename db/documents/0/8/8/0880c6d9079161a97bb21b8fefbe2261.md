Permissive hypotension is the act of maintaining a blood pressure lower than physiologic levels in a patient that has suffered from hemorrhagic blood loss. The practice is employed in order to maintain adequate vasoconstriction, organ perfusion, and prevent an undesired coagulopathy during initial fluid resuscitation. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of permissive hypotension and highlights its role in the improvement of clinical outcomes of critically ill patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of permissive hypotension.
- Describe the typical management of permissive hypotension.
- Outline management considerations for patients requiring permissive hypotension resuscitation.
- Identify the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients receiving permissive hypotension resuscitation.
