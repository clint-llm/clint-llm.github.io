The cause of Legg-Calve-Perthes disease is not known. It may be idiopathic or due to otherÂ etiology that would disrupt blood flow to the femoral epiphysis, such as trauma (macro or repetitive microtrauma), coagulopathy, and steroid use. Thrombophilia is present in approximately 50% of patients, and some form of coagulopathy is present in up to 75%.
