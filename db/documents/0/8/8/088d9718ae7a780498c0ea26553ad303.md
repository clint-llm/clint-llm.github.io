**Chemotherapy Side Effects**

Acute side effects mentioned by patients while using chemotherapy for different (breast, colorectal, lung) cancersÂ include chest pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspnea, fatigue, mucositis, pain, rash, vomiting, anemia.

- Oral and gastrointestinal mucositis may cause local ulceration and pain, which in turn may lead to anorexia, malabsorption, weight loss, anemia, fatigue, and increased risk of sepsis.

- Many anti-cancer drugs can cause chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), including platinum-based agents, vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and proteasome and angiogenesis inhibitors.

- Liver and bone marrow toxicity

- Muscle wasting, muscle collagen deposition, and changes in muscle mitochondrial function (seen with oxaliplatin)

**Postsurgical Complications**

Based on a retrospective analysis of 776 thoracotomies following results were found. The postoperative complication rate was 9.3%.

- Infection n=19

- Atelectasis n=29

- Cardiac arrhythmia n=18

- Stroke n=2

- Myocardial infarction n=3

- Prolonged air leak ( more than three days) n=28

- Renal failure

- The 30-day mortality rate was 0.2% (n=2, due to respiratory failure and stroke).

**Radiation Side Effects**

- Radiation pneumonitis

- Post-radiation tumors
