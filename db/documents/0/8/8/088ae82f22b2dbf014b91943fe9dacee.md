Carotid artery dissection is a rare vascular disorder that has the potential to cause a severe stroke. Thus, it is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, emergency department physician, radiologist, vascular surgeon, and internist. The diagnosis is made by CT scan but the management depends on patient symptoms and whether the disease is extra or intracranial. Asymptomatic patients may be treated with systemic anticoagulation but if there is a risk of bleeding or rupture, the patient may require surgery.Â A viable option is stenting. These patients should be monitored in a neuro ICU by nurses until they are hemodynamically stable and have no evidence of any neurological deficit. Patients need to be educated about blood pressure control as the recurrence of dissection has been reported in up to 10% of cases.
