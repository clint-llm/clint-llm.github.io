Radiographic studies that are necessary for all patients presenting with varying degrees of elbow trauma include:

- Anteroposterior (AP) elbow

- Lateral elbow

- Oblique views (optional, depending on fracture/injury)

- Traction view (optional, can facilitate the assessment of comminuted fracture patterns)

- Ipsilateral shoulder to wrist orthogonal views 

- Especially in the setting of high energy trauma or when exam and evaluation are limited

- Fat pad sign:

- Seen with intra-articular injuries
- Normally, anterior fat pad is a narrow radiolucent strip anterior to humerus
- The posterior fat pad is normally not visible
- Anterior fat pad sign indicates joint effusion/ injury when raised and becomes more perpendicular to the anterior humeral cortex (sail sign)
- Posterior fat pad sign indicates effusion/injury

- In adults, posterior fat pad sign without other obvious fracture implies radial head fracture
- In children, it implies supracondylar fracture

**Pediatric Considerations:**

- Fractures in children often occur through unossified cartilage, making radiographic interpretation confusing

- A line of mensuration drawn down the anterior surface of the humerus should always bisect the capitellum in lateral view.

- If any bony relationship appears questionable on radiographs, obtain a comparison view of uninvolved elbow.

- Suspect nonaccidental trauma if history does not tip injury.

- Ossification centers: 1 appear: (**CRITOE**)
- **C**apitellum 3 to 6 months
- **R**adial head 3 to 5 years
- Medial (**I**nternal) epicondyle 5 to 7 years
- **T**rochlea 9 to 10 years
- **O**lecranon 9 to 10 years
- Lateral **E**picondyle

- It is essential to do bilateral radiographic imaging in pediatric cases.

- Nurse elbow can reduce spontaneously when the patient supinates the arm.

**Advanced imaging sequences**

Computerized tomography (CT) scans are often a consideration in the setting of comminuted fracture patterns for pre-operative surgical planning.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be an option in the setting of soft tissue and ligamentous injury evaluation, or when suspecting stress or occult fractures.

**Alert**

Based on the complex anatomy of the elbow, a few things require attention:

- Neurovascular injuries to numerous structures that pass about the elbow, including anterior interosseous nerve, ulnar and radial nerves, brachial artery

- Volkmann ischemic contracture is compartment syndrome of the forearm
