All patients with a nuclear or radiation exposure should have a baseline complete blood cell count (CBC) with a differential, blood type and screen, and electrolytes. A CBC should be repeated every six to 12 hours so as to be able to monitor the white cell count depletion if any. Lymphocyte depletion kinetics are the best predictor of radiation exposure and clinical outcome. Mucosal surface swabs for radiation should be sent to the appropriate labs. Make every effort to document all baseline labs appropriately as they can help determine future therapies. All baseline radiation levels should be taken before and after decontamination.
