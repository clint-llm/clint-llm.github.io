It isÂ difficult to accurately estimate the incidence and prevalence of bilirubinuria, as it is a laboratory abnormality associated with a number of different clinical etiologies. It is estimated that 3.9% to 6.9% of Americans have some form of chronic liver disease. However, bilirubinuria can also be present in patients with acute liver and biliary disease. It can be observed in patients with unrelated systemic illnesses.
