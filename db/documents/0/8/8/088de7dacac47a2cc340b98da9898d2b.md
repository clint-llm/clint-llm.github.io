Entomopthorales thrive in fatty substances. Therefore, there is a predilection of the organism for areas with adipose tissue. Virulence factors for these organisms include lipases andÂ proteases such as elastase, esterase, collagenase, and many other enzymes that help penetrate and invade human tissues. Basidiobolomycosis is believed to spread by traumatic implantation of the fungus into the thigh, buttock, or trunk subcutaneous tissues.

Conidiobolomycosis is transmitted by inhalation of fungal spores, which involve the nasal tissue, paranasal sinuses, facial soft tissues. Host defense includes macrophages with epithelioid and multinucleate giant cell formations, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells, resulting in a chronic granulomatous reaction.
