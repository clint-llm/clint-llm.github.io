When obtaining a biopsy from patients with suspected lipodystrophy, it is important to consider the depth of pathology. An ideal specimen would extend to at least include epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat. There may be a benefit to increasing the depth of the biopsy to include fascia to allow visualization of the full subcutis. The histopathological findings of the lipodystrophy syndromes are somewhat nonspecific. The background is typically pauci-inflammatory, and individual adipocytes become shrunken and separated. In certain circumstances with localized involvement, a perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates may be seen.
