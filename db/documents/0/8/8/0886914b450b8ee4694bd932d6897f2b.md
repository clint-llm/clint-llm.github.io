Most esophageal webs and rings cause no symptoms. Patients can become symptomatic if an esophageal web or ring protrudes into the lumen enough to cause esophageal narrowing. Patients usually present with intermittent dysphagia to solid food. Some patients may develop food impaction and will present with acute dysphagia and inability to swallow saliva. In the case of Plummer-Vinson syndrome, patients may demonstrate with the triad of dysphagia, esophageal webs, and iron deficiency anemia.

Isolated esophageal webs and rings usually do not have physical exam findings. However, a comprehensive physical exam may point towards an associated condition. Plummer-Vinson syndrome might have the skin manifestations of iron deficiency anemia including koilonychia, glossitis, and cheilosis.
