The characteristics of a patient’s pain offer indications regarding its pathogenesis. A brief explanation of classes of pain is thus useful clinically to assist in the management of pain as a symptom and possible diagnosis of the underlying condition.

- **Acute pain**: At the site of local tissue injury, the activation of nociceptive transducers contributes to this form of pain. The local injury environment may further alter the characteristics of nociceptors, central connections, and the autonomic nervous system.

- **Chronic pain**: Persistent pain is frequently related to conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus, arthritis, and tumor growth) which potentiates chronic tissue inflammation or alteration of the properties of peripheral nerves (neuropathic). Given the unrelenting nature of chronic pain, expectations are that external factors such as stress, emotions, and the environment may produce a summative effect with the damaged tissue to enhance the intensity and persistence of the pain.

- **Somatic pain**: This form of pain may be acute or chronic and is pain activated by the nociceptors in the cutaneous or deep tissues. In the case of cutaneous somatic pain, for instance, in the case of a skin cut, it is described as sharp or burning and is well localized. In the case of somatic pain arising from the deep tissues, such as in the joints, tendons, and bones, it is described as more throbbing or aching and is less localized.

- **Visceral pain**: This pain arises mainly from the viscera and deep somatic structures (e.g., pain from the gastrointestinal tract). Visceral pain that is not distinctly localized is carried by the C fibers from the deep structures to the spinal cord.

- **Neuropathic**: This persistent pain is often a consequence of damage to these nerve fibers, leading to increased spontaneous firing or alterations in their conduction or neurotransmitter properties.

- **Allodynia**: Pain resulting from a typically harmless stimulus is referred to as allodynia. Though the mechanism is not fully understood, it is thought to potentially arise from 1) sensitization of the skin, leading to a decreased threshold of silent nociceptors or 2) damage to peripheral neurons inducing structural changes leading touch-sensitive fibers to reroute and form synapses in areas of the spinal cord that normally receive pain input.

- **Hyperalgesia**: Occurs when noxious stimuli generate an exaggerated pain response. Similar mechanisms as proposed in the case of allodynia, with patients demonstrating amplification of pain or hyperalgesia, as well as a lengthened persistence of the pain.

- **Referred pain**: When there is pain perception at a location other than the site of the painful stimulus, it is known as referred pain. The classical example of referred pain involves pain brought down the neck, shoulders, and back following a myocardial infarction. There is no current consensus regarding the true mechanisms behind referred pain, and there are several theories.  Referred pain may be visceral or somatic, with the former describing pain from an organ and the latter describing pain from the deep tissues such as muscles or joints. In the Ruch’s 1961 convergent-projection theory, where afferent visceral sensory pain fibers and somatic fibers enter the same spinal dorsal root ganglia segments of the spinal cord, causing the CNS to misinterpret the pain as arising from somewhere on the body wall rather than from the viscera. Somatic referred pain occurs when spinal structures such as discs or joints receive a noxious stimulus, and the pain is subsequently interpreted to be localized in the deep tissues - most commonly those of the lower extremity. This is proposed to occur by neurons that innervate these somatic tissues converging with nociceptive afferent neurons on the same second-order neurons in the spinal cord.
