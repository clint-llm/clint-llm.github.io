Management and prevention of congenital varicella syndrome involve the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team, consisting of clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nursing staff, and pharmacists.

Since vaccination is the key to preventing neonatal varicella infection complications, all clinicians should urge their patients who are not immunocompromised or pregnant to receive two doses of the varicella vaccine if they have not already had chickenpox. Clinicians should educate pregnant women who are seronegative for VZV to avoid contact with active varicella infection individuals. A team of specialists should manage pregnant women who develop chickenpox to determine treatment for them and their neonates. Pharmacists can assist with immunoglobulin therapy, and nurses will guide administration. Maternal herpes zoster, however, poses little risk of neonatal complications or CVS due to the established circulating maternal antibodies.
