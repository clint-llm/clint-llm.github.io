**Relation Between Radius of Curvature and Power of Cornea**

This is indicated by the following equation D= n-1/r, where D is the power of cornea in diameters, n is the refractive index of the cornea, and r is the radius of curvature. Ever since the invention of the keratometer by Helmholtz, the refractive index of the cornea has been 1.3375 for calibrating the instrument. Therefore the formula is read as D= 1.3375-1/r or 0.3375/r or r = 0.3375/D. Hence, the parameters of the keratometers are always labeled for the radius of curvature and dioptric power.

**Range of Keratometer**

This ranges from 36 to 52 D (6.5 to 9.38 mm). The lower limit is 30D (5.6 mm), and the upper limit is 61 D (10.9 mm) using a lens of -1.0 D and +1.25 D, respectively, in front of the telescope's objective.
