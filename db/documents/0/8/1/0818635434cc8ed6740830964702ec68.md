Vascular anomalies such as arteriovenous malformations or aneurysms necessitate surgical treatment. Perfect knowledge of the brain vasculature is mandatory in the pre-operative assessment of vascular diseases. In this pre-operative assessment, an armamentarium of studies can be used such as angioscanner, digital subtraction angiogram (DSA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Of those, the angiogram represents the exam of choice.
