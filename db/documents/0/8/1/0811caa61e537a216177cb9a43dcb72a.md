Patients with ophthalmomyiasis externa can be misdiagnosed as viral/ bacterial conjunctivitis. A thorough examination of the fornices is mandatory. The larvae of Oestrus ovis are photophobic and tend to hide in the fornices.Dermatobia hominis has a central hole through which larva can be seen.

In cases of ophthalmomyiasis interna, a dilated fundus examination aids in the diagnosis. Clinically, multiple subretinal tracks can be seen, which are evident on optical coherence tomography as hypo-reflective areas.

Fundus autofluorescence may reveal the subretinal tracks. For specific diagnoses, entomologists are involved. The first instar larva of Oestrus ovis contains hooks located more anteriorly attached to the cephalo-pharyngeal skeleton. For orbital myiasis, the imaging of orbit, brain, and paranasal sinuses is necessary. The larva should be sent for entomological examination in 70% ethanol.
