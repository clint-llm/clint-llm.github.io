While novel therapies involving substance P and NK-1R antagonists are currently undergoing clinical testing, the biggest clinical impact of Substance P research is as NK-1 receptor antagonists. NK-1 receptor antagonists were originally tested as antidepressants, but research revealed them to have antiemetic effects. Aprepitant and its prodrug fosaprepitant are NK-1 receptor antagonists used as antiemetic agents. Aprepitant is available by oral and intravenous (IV) administration and fosaprepitant are only available intravenously (IV). Both of these drugs are useful for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy agents. Netupitant, an NK-1 receptor antagonist only available by oral administration, is also used as an antiemetic agent and is combined with palonosetron.

Capsaicin, a molecule found in chili peppers, has been shown to decrease the amount of substance P at the terminal and peripheral nerve endings of afferent nerves. Due to substance P's role in pain transmission, capsaicin decreases the awareness of painful stimuli.
