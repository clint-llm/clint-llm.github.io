Typical Clinical presentation, characteristics, symptoms and signs, and suggestive family history are considered the starting point for adrenoleukodystrophy evaluation. Several states started using newborn screening tests as a screening tool to identify newborns with a potential genetic predisposition for X-ALD.

Nonspecific laboratory workup may reveal an abnormal liver function and reduced response to ACTH administration. The more indicative test results will show

- Increased VLCFA plasma concentration

- Decrease red blood cells' plasmalogen concentration

- Increase in the concentration of pipecolic and phytanic acid concentration in both plasma and fibroblasts

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is an essential part of the evaluation; Typical findings are:

- White matter demyelination pattern

- Microgyria

- Germinolytic cysts in the caudothalamic groove

Further genetic testing to identify the specific genetic mutation is recommended to confirm the diagnosis.
