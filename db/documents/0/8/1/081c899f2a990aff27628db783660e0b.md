Beta-1 receptors are primarily found in cardiac nodal tissue, cardiac myocytes, other heart conduction pathway tissues, and kidneys. Beta-1 blockers exert their effect by binding to the beta-1 receptor sites selectively and inhibiting the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine on these sites. Beta-1 receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors (specifically Gs alpha subunit) whose action is exerted through the cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase action with resultant calcium ion concentration increases.

Normally, activation of the beta-1 receptor in the heart increases sinoatrial (SA) nodal, atrioventricular (AV) nodal, and ventricular muscular firing, which leads to increased heart rate and contractility. Stroke volume and cardiac output will also increase as a result. In the kidney, renin is released when smooth muscle cells in the juxtaglomerular apparatus are activated. Blood volume is eventually increased because of the downstream production of angiotensin II and aldosterone production triggered by renin.

Ordinarily, this adrenergic response results in increased inotropy, chronotropy, and dromotropy. The blockade of this pathway with beta-1 blockers results in decreased contractility (inotropy), decreased heart rate (chronotropy), increased relaxation (lusitropy), and decreased cardiac conduction times (dromotropy).
