Almotriptan is a selective serotonin agonist on the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors in the cranial arteries. Activation of the 5HT receptors is associated with reducing neurogenic inflammation, which researchers hypothesize to be involved in the migraine relief process.

Almotriptan works by narrowing the blood vessels in the brain, thereby reducing the cerebral blood flow stopping the transmission of pain signals to the brain center.
