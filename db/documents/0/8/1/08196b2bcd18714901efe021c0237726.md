The prognosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma mainly depends on histopathology, the extent of involvement, and patient factors. International Prognostic Index (IPI) and its variant are used as the main prognostic tools in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It helps to determine overall survival after standard-of-care treatment. IPI is assessed by factors including age>60 years, Serum LDH more than normal, Eastern Cooperative oncology group(ECOG) performance status more than or equal to 2, clinical stage III or IV, and >1 extranodal involvement. One point is given for each factor, a total score from (0 to 5), which determines the degree of risk. These are classified as low risk (0-1 adverse factor), Intermediate risk (2 adverse factors), and poor risk (three or more adverse factors). Congenital or acquired immunodeficiency states are associated with an increased risk of lymphoma, and response to therapy is poor.

Patients with aggressive T- or NK cell lymphomas usually have a worse prognosis. Patients with low-grade lymphomas have increased survival, which is usually 6 to 10 years. However, they can have the transformation into high-grade lymphomas.
