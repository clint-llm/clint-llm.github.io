The timely use of AEDs by bystanders has been consistently demonstrated to be effective in improving OHCA. This makes AED use one of the most beneficial interventions known for cardiac arrests secondary to a shockable rhythm. PADs can substantially reduce the time to defibrillation, particularly in the United States when EMS response time from to dispatch to scene for an adult arrest is on average 9.4 minutes.

Data from the ARREST study indicated that when the location of a public AED was promoted, the use of the AED increased threefold.

AEDs save lives – they need to be available, and people need to know how to use them. Improving outcomes starts by instilling a culture of action. Culture change can occur early, by having CPR and AED classes in schools. Third-grade students have been shown to use AEDs effectively. Sixth-grade students have demonstrated AED competence similar to EMS providers.

In summary, the three essential elements for a successful PAD program include

- Establishing a functional and practiced internal emergency response plan

- Offering adequate training for CPR and AED use

- Integrating with local EMS
