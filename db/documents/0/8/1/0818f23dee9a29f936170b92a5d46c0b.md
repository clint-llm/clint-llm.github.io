Metabolic acidosis is a clinical disturbance defined by a pH less than 7.35 and a low HCO3 level.

The anion gap helps determine the cause of the metabolic acidosis. An elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis can be caused by salicylate toxicity, diabetic ketoacidosis, and uremia (MUDPILES). Non-Gap metabolic acidosis is due to GI loss of bicarbonate (diarrhea) or a failure of kidneys to excrete acid.

Lab tests that help evaluate metabolic acidosis are those that assess renal and lung function including electrolytes, venous or arterial blood gas, and toxin levels such as salicylate if an overdose is suspected.

Treatment of metabolic acidosis is case-dependent.
