There are no evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of shrinking lung syndrome but treatment almost invariably involves corticosteroids in the first instance. The usual dose is between 0.5Â to 1mg/kg of prednisolone daily and may be preceded by a short course of intravenous methylprednisolone depending on initial severity. Corticosteroids are typically successful as monotherapy. Adjunctive treatments include inhaled beta-2 agonists, theophylline, analgesia, and chest physiotherapy.

In treatment-refractory cases, rituximab has emerged as a promising option based, with case reports of success after the initial failure of treatment with steroids.
