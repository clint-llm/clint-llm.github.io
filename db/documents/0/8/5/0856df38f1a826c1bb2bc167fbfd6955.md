Patients who are stable on hormone replacement usually have a good prognosis. Mortality increases in patients with acute decompensation who are in a critical state. Morbidity is variable and depends on the type of hormone deficiency. The systemic effects of hypopituitarism are also variable depending on the extent of pituitary involvement. Some clinical states that result from the acute decline in pituitary production may lead to increased mortality risk, such as deficiency of ACTH leading to adrenal crisis or TSH deficiency causing myxedema coma and death.
