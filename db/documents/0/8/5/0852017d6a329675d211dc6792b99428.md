The most common side effect of an endometrial biopsy is cramping. This can be significantly reduced with the administration of pre-procedure NSAIDs. Once the procedure is completed, women may report light vaginal bleeding or spotting for several days. Less common side effects include uterine perforation, pelvic infection, and bacteremia. They are monitored by instructing the patient with strict return precautions, including returning to the office for fever, cramping for more than 48 hours, increasing pain, bleeding heavier than a normal menstrual period, or any foul-smelling discharge.
