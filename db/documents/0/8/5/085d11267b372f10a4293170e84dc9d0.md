Antenatally, TGA is challenging to diagnose. Screening ultrasounds do not routinely reveal TGA in-utero.

Postnatal:

The clinical features of D-TGA are solely dependent on the degree of mixing between the parallel circuits. Most patients present with signs and symptoms during the neonatal period (first 30 days of life). The following are the typical clinical manifestations of TGA:

- Cyanosis: The degree of cyanosis is dependent on the amount of mixing between the two parallel circuits. Factors affecting intracardiac mixing include the size and presence of an ASD or VSD. Cyanosis is not affected by exertion or supplemental oxygen.

- Tachypnea: Patients usually have a respiratory rate higher than 60 breaths per minute but without retractions, grunting, or flaring and appear comfortable.

- Murmurs: murmurs are not typically present unless a small VSD or pulmonic stenosis exists. A murmur resulting from a VSD will be pansystolic and prominent at the lower left sternal border. Pulmonic stenosis causes a systolic ejection murmur at the upper left sternal border.

Patients with L-TGA are typically unaffected until later in life when the right ventricle can no longer compensate for the increased afterload of the systemic circulation. These patients present with signs and symptoms of heart failure.
