Abdominal vascular sonography is performed to evaluate major abdominal vessels for pathologies such as dissection, aneurysm, or venous thromboembolism. This activity reviews the interprofessional team's role in the assessment, protocols, and interpretation of major abdominal vessels visualized by sonography.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical sonographic findings associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms.
- Describe the typical sonographic findings associated with abdominal aortic mural thrombi.
- Describe multiple methods to optimize the sonographic appearance of abdominal vasculature.
- Identify limitations of ultrasound when evaluating major abdominal vascular structures.
