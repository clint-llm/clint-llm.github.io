The treatment of acute pyelonephritis is usually done by a team of healthcare professionals that includes a nephrologist, infectious disease consultant, pain specialist, internist, urologist, and obstetrician if the patient is pregnant. Both the nurse and pharmacist play a critical role in the monitoring of the patient, administration of antibiotics, and monitoring for recovery.  A dietary consult should be called if the patient is diabetic, but the key is hydration. Today, the emphasis is on the prevention of the condition. Women should be educated about safe sex, contraceptive use, and early treatment of cystitis. If reinfection occurs within 14 days of discharge, the urologist should be consulted to investigate for an anatomical problem predisposing to the condition. The pharmacist must follow the culture results and ensure that the patient is on the right drugs to cover the organisms that cause the infection. In addition, the pharmacists must ensure that the patient is on no nephrotoxic agent that can exacerbate the renal damage. (Level V)

**Outcomes**

The key to outcomes in patients with acute pyelonephritis is prompt diagnosis and treatment. Any delay in treatment can often lead to very high morbidity. Delays in proper management can lead to longer hospital admissions, severe pain, and disability. Even after discharge, follow-up is needed to ensure that full recovery has occurred. Pregnant females with acute pyelonephritis are at very high risk for premature delivery.

Further, the infection tends to be much more severe in diabetics compared to the general population. The mortality rates are higher in the elderly who have other comorbidities. Complications known to occur from acute pyelonephritis include sepsis, acute renal failure, renal scarring, and renal transplant pyelonephritis. [Level 5]
