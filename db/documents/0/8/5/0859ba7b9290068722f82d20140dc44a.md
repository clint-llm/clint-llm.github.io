The ideal strictureplasty technique depends on the length of the stricture to be stricturoplastied, as follows:

- Short strictures (fewer than 10 cm in length), the Heineke Miulicz strictureplasty technique

- Medium strictures (10 to 20 cm in length), the Finney strictureplasty technique

- Long strictures (more than 20 cm in length), the side-to-side isoperistaltic strictureplasty technique

The Heineke-Mikulicz strictureplasty is the commonest among the conventional stricturoplasties. This technique is done by making an elongated cut on the antimesenteric side of the intestine, extending from 2 cm proximal to 2 cm distal to the stricture. Two sutures are then placed at both ends of the opening of the stricture. The stay sutures are then approximated perpendicular to the long axis of the bowel. The enterotomy is then closed in one or two mucosal layers.

The Finney strictureplasty is the most commonly used intermediate strictureplasty. The bowel is folded at the stricture site, forming a U shape. A long cut between the mesenteric and the antimesenteric side of the folded loop is performed. The opposed edges of the bowel are then sutured together in a side-to-side handsewn anastomosis.

The side-to-side isoperistaltic strictureplasty, sometimes known as the Michelassi Stricureplasty, is used to prevent losing high amounts of small bowel when long segments strictures are detected and caused by Crohn disease.
