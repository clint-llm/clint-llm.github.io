With successful treatment, most individuals return to normal tasks and function. Although complications are rare, the most common is persistent pain or recurrent symptoms. In cases managed surgically, complications include nerve injury (medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve and/or ulnar nerve), or infection. For refractory cases treated surgically, pain is likely to improve, but about 20% of patients do not return to the prior level of sporting activities.
