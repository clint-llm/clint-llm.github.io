The digital nerve block procedure is one that requires an interprofessional team of professionals in the healthcare field which includes: clinicians, nursing staff, and a pharmacist. It is critical for these patients to receive a full history and physical before the procedure including a history of adverse drug reactions. In particular, this will include a history of local anesthetic use to identify alternatives, if required. A team-based approach to this procedure will limit deleterious events and should include the following before the start of the procedure: assessment of adverse events to local anesthetics and availability of alternative agents, calculation of maximum weight-based dosage of local anesthetic, consult with the pharmacist about the availability of a lipid emulsifying agent in the event of LAST, monitoring the patient for signs and symptoms of LAST such as altered mental status (AMS), metallic taste, seizures, respiratory distress, tachycardia, dysrhythmia, atrioventricular (AV) block, or cardiovascular collapse [Level 3], and availability of ACLS trained staff in the event of cardiovascular symptoms.
