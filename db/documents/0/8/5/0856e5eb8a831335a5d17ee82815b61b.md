Benign para tubal cysts may be found incidentally on ultrasound or during surgeries. These cysts appear most often in middle age and are usually asymptomatic. The previously mentioned hydatid of Morgagni, an embryologic remnant, may also be present at the distal-most part of the fallopian tube.

There have been rare reported cases of fallopian tube diverticula, agenesis, and duplication. Diverticula or duplications increase the risk of tubal pathologies such as hydrosalpinx or torsion, as well as ectopic pregnancies. Tubal abnormalities leading to occlusion or tubal agenesis may contribute to infertility. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure in utero, in particular, has been linked to abnormal development of the fallopian tube.
