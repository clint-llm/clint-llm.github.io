In the last few years, many investigative avenues involving the collecting ducts have been subject to research. One study from 2017 characterized the role of TFCP2L1, a transcription factor, in mediating collecting duct development. Another study from 2018 demonstrated the development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis with the suppression of microRNAs within collecting duct cells. Most recently, a 2019 study found that tamoxifen downregulated collecting duct aquaporin 2 in an ADH-independent manner. These recent scholarly endeavors demonstrate the scientific and clinical necessities of understanding the renal collecting ducts.
