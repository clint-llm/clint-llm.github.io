Preventing adverse effects of medications in the elderly population requires special care and communication between physicians, pharmacists, and nurses. Selective alpha-1 antagonists are commonly used agents in an outpatient setting for patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy. These drugs can have significant interactions with other medications that have similar adverse effects. Clinical staff must review in detail the medical and social history of the patient before prescribing and ordering an alpha-blocker.

If a patient taking an alpha-blocker resides in a nursing facility, there should be close communication with the nursing staff closely monitoring the patient due to an increased risk of orthostatic hypotension, which can lead to a fall. Fall precautions such as bed rails, a bed alarm, and a floor protection fall mat should be a consideration. The administration of alpha-blockers requires an interprofessional team that includes physicians, pharmacists, and nurses to collaborate to prevent adverse effects, especially in the elderly.
