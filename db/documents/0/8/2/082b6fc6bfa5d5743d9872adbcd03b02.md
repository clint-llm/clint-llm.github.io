Traumatic injuries of the spleen can be either blunt or penetrating. The management of splenic trauma has become largely non-operative, as non-operative treatment leads to a reduced risk of post-splenectomy immunocompromised status. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of splenic trauma and stresses the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with splenic trauma.
- Summarize how to evaluate for splenic trauma.
- Review the indications for operative versus non-operative management of splenic trauma.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team in optimizing the care of patients with splenic trauma.
