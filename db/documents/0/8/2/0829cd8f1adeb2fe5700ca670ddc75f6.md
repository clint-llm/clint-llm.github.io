Radiation proctitis (damage to the lower parts of the colon) is soft tissue radionecrosis and a delayed effect of therapeutic radiation.  As such, it is thought to be a sequela of radiation-induced, progressive, obliterative endarteritis resulting in a lack of small blood vessels in the affected tissue with chronic mucosal ischemia, submucosal fibrosis, progressive epithelial atrophy, and new vessel formation (telangiectasia). It occurs 6 months to years after exposure to the radiation.
