The initial evaluation of a patient with subacute neurological symptoms and anemia should include a complete blood count, peripheral smear, and serum vitamin B12 and folate levels. Specific indices like mean corpuscular volume (MCV) andÂ mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration will reveal macrocytic anemia (MCV>100).

The presentation of neurological signs alone in the absence of anemia has been noticed as well.

Investigations should cover possible dietary deficiencies and gastrointestinal causes such as Crohn's or celiac disease.

In patients with a history of autoimmune disease, an evaluation that includes anti intrinsic factor antibodies is warranted.
