Causes of blepharitis differ depending on whether it is an acute or chronic process and in the case of chronic the location of the problem. Acute blepharitis may be ulcerative or nonulcerative. An infection causes ulcerative blepharitis. This is usually bacterial and most commonly staphylococcal. A viral etiology such as infection with Herpes simplex and Varicella zoster is also possible. Nonulcerative is usually an allergic reaction such as atopic or seasonal. Its location best classifies the chronic form of blepharitis. In anterior blepharitis, an infection, usually staphylococcal, or seborrheic disease process is involved. Individuals frequently have seborrheic dermatitis of the face and scalp. Also, anterior blepharitis may be associated with rosacea. Meibomian gland dysfunction causes posterior blepharitis. The glands over-secrete an oily substance becoming clogged and engorged. Commonly, this is associated with acne rosacea, and hormonal causes are suspected. Both anterior (Demodex folliculorum) and posterior (Demodex brevis) blepharitis may be caused by a Demodex mite. Their role is not well-established since asymptomatic individuals have also been found to harbor the mites at approximately the same prevalence.
