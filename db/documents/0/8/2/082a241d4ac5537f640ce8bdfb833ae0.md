The greater splanchnic nerve is a target in the surgical treatment of chronic upper abdominal pain. Surgical interruption of the thoracic splanchnic nerves has proven effective in the management of pain in pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. The literature has also implicated splanchnicectomy as a potential option for treating patients with chronic spastic constipation, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and hypertension.

The French surgeon Pierre Mallet-Guy pioneered this operation with his laparoscopic work in 1943. He performed a bilateral transection of the distal thoracic splanchnic nerves below the diaphragm. Surgeons began accessing the GSN and associated nerves within the thoracic cavity for splanchnicectomies in 1990. A less invasive alternative to the open thoracotomy approach entered the literature in 1993 with reports of thoracoscopic splanchnicectomies. Several studies in the late 1990s interrupted the path of the GSN proximally with complete unilateral transection of the sympathetic chain. This riskier operation successfully palliated chronic abdominal pain, but it endangered the fibers of other vital sympathetic pathways within the sympathetic chain.

Video-assisted thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy (VATS) is now a common operative method for approaching the GSN and associated nerves. Insufflation of carbon dioxide induces partial ipsilateral lung collapse and provides space for the introduction of surgical instruments to the thorax. The GSN and its collaterals are located and transected. Some surgeons follow the GSN superiorly and divide all roots coming from the sympathetic chain. Others may track the GSN inferiorly and purposefully divide and/or cauterize it as close to the diaphragm as possible.

A 2008 systematic review of thoracoscopic splanchnicectomies highlighted the debate on the efficacy of unilateral versus bilateral transections. Surgeons who perform unilateral operations generally transect the left thoracic splanchnic nerves in cases of centralized or left-sided abdominal pain. Along the same lines, transection of the right thoracic splanchnic nerves is the approach in patients with predominantly right-sided pain. Nonetheless, some institutions prefer the bilateral division of these nerves because they feel this method achieves better pain control.

The majority of patients who undergo splanchnicectomy experience a significant reduction in their pain scores. Many patients eliminate their dependence on opioid narcotic medications following a splanchnicectomy. Upper abdominal pain that remains uncontrolled in a minority of patients following the operation may be due to anatomical variations in the GSN or extensive collateral formations with other thoracic splanchnic nerves.

Common side effects of the operation include increased bowel movements and orthostatic hypotension. The interruption of sympathetic innervation to the alimentary canal and adrenal medulla, respectfully, cause these side effects.

The effects of the operation typically wane over time. By 18 months post-operation, many patients experience as much pain as before their splanchnicectomy. Regardless, for patients with unresectable tumors, the operation has merit. Two-thirds of patients report that they would have a splanchnicectomy again.
