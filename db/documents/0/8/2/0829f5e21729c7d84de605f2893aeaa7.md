- In the U.S., newborn screening identifies most cases of PCD. The disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team approach that involves a metabolic specialist and genetic counselor, pharmacist, dietician, pediatrician, neurologist, hepatologist, endocrinologist, and cardiologist. All patients must be treated right after being diagnosed, or else this disorder may be potentially fatal.

- In PCD, the patient and caregiver should be educated on the importance of medication compliance.

- Genetic counseling should be provided in patients with inborn errors of carnitine metabolism. Antenatal diagnosis, using chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, should be performed for high-risk pregnancies as the recurrent risk in each pregnancy is 25% due to their autosomal recessive inheritance.

- Chronic management of FAO defects and carnitine shuttle disorders consists of avoiding fasting, frequent feedings, high carbohydrate, low fat, and carnitine supplementation. Potentially hepatotoxic medications such as valproate should be avoided.

- Patients with carnitine deficiency disorders with the risk of hypoglycemia can be recommended to wear medical alert devices such as bracelets. This will help paramedics and emergency department physicians to quickly recognize and manage emergencies such as hypoglycemia in carnitine deficit states.
