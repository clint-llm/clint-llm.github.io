A craniotomy is a neurosurgical technique, whereby part of the skull is opened or removed for intracranial access to treat conditions such as brain tumors, aneurysms, and arterio-venous malformations.Â Post-craniotomy headaches (PCH) are among the most frequently encountered adverse events after craniotomy, appearing in over two-thirds of patients undergoing the procedure.
