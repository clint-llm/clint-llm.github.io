Misdiagnosis is a frequent complication of pneumothorax. Multiple factors, such as incomplete or inadequate history or physical exam, low index of clinical suspicion, failure to obtain a chest radiograph, or failure to recognize a pneumothorax on a chest radiograph, can contribute to misdiagnosis. Misdiagnosis leads to failure to treat the pneumothorax, and in some cases can lead to devastating consequences such as

- Conversion to tension pneumothorax

- Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure

- Shock

- Respiratory arrest

- Cardiac arrest

- Empyema

- Re-expansion pulmonary edema

- Iatrogenic complications from the needle decompression or thoracostomy procedure - the failure of the lung to re-expand, lung laceration, infection of the insertion site and pleural space, laceration of intercostal vessels or internal mammary artery, hemothorax, persistent air leak, damage to the intercostal neurovascular bundle, etc

- Chest tube-induced arrhythmia

- Pneumomediastinum - air from the pneumothorax can track into the mediastinum. This can be visualized on the chest X-ray as air leuncy around the heart.  Additionally, a crunching sound may be asculated during the cardiac examination.  This is called Hamman's crunch and is best heard in the left lateral decubitus position.
