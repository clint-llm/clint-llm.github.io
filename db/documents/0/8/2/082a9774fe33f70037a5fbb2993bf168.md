Thyroid cancer is the most common and steadily increasing endocrine malignancy. The increased incidence is due in part to improved diagnosis and screening. There has been a hypothesis that the increased incidence may also be related to iodine excess. Changes in iodine intake appear to affect the histologic type of thyroid cancer, and it is unclear whether iodine deficiency or iodine excess increases the overall risk of thyroid cancer.
