Now the mortality is found to be longer than what has been reported in the previous decade. The median transplant-free survival in patients with LAM is estimated to be 29 years from symptom onset and 23 years from diagnosis.

Due to the potential of pressure changes associated with air travel, there is an increased risk of pulmonary cysts rupture and spontaneous pneumothorax in patients with LAM. Therefore, patients should be counseled about air travel-associated risks and the possible need for inflight oxygen supplements.
