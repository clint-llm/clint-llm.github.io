With the advent of thrombolytic therapy and improved reperfusion therapies, the incidence of post-myocardial ventricular septal rupture has decreased dramatically.

Timely management of myocardial infarction to limit the extent of myocardial injury seems to be the only prevention strategy available. Once VSR develops, aggressive management of congestive heart failure to prevent cardiogenic shock can deter poor outcomes. A judicious treatment strategy for VSR when it occurs can help improve the survival rate as well.
