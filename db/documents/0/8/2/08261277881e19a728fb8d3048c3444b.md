Proper sleep hygiene may prove as the best intervention to halt subsequent NREM and REM sleep behavior disorders. Furthermore, by implementing precautions such as installing alarms on doors, having a patient sleep on the first floor, and placing latches on windows, the patient can sleep with the assurance that they will have protection from injury. The bed partner should also be educated regarding possible violent behavioral patterns to obviate impending harm.
