Benztropine belongs to the synthetic class of muscarinic receptor antagonists (anticholinergic drugs). Thus, it has a structure similar to that of diphenhydramine and atropine. However, it is long-acting, so that its administration can be with less frequency than diphenhydramine. It also induces less CNS stimulation thanÂ trihexyphenidyl, making it a preferable drug of choice for geriatric patients.

- Benztropine is FDA approved as adjunctive therapy of all forms of parkinsonism, including:
- Idiopathic parkinsonism
- Postencephalitic parkinsonism

- It is also useful for drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms, the prevention of dystonic reactions, and acute treatment of dystonic reactions.

- Furthermore, benztropine is used off-labeled as it can treat chronic sialorrhea occurring in developmentally-disabled patients.

- Several clinical studies have been reported on using benztropine in managing intractable hiccups.
