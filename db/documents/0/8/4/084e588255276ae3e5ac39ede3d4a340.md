The suboccipital muscles are innervated by the suboccipital nerve, which arises from the dorsal rami of C1. Before the formation of the rami, rootlets emerge from the spinal cord at the level of C1. Ventral and dorsal rootlets combine to form ventral and dorsal rami. The dorsal or posterior ramus exits through the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane before branching into different segments to innervate the suboccipital muscles and the semispinalis capitis.
