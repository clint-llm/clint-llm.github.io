The preparation of IVUS imaging catheters varies slightly with each manufacturer but is mostly a straightforward process that consists of flushing the catheter system with saline and connecting the catheter to a console.  Systemic anticoagulation and intracoronary nitroglycerin should be administered before the insertion of IVUS to minimize and prevent the risk of thrombus and vasospasm.
