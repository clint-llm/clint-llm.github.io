These tumors are often very symptomatic, and may cause fight-or-flight sympathetic symptoms like dry mouth, flushing of the face, racing heart, dilated pupils, fidgetiness, constipation, fatigue, profuse sweating, headache, tremors, panic-like symptoms and generalized weakness due to exhaustion. It may also present with blurry vision, lightheadedness, weight loss, excessive thirst or hunger, mood disturbances, high blood sugar, and weight loss.

Examination usually reveals signs of sympathetic overload or mass effect, including but not limited to vocal cord paralysis causing hoarseness, cranial nerve paralysis, fidgety, tachycardia, diaphoresis, uncontrolled episodic hypertension (more common in pheochromocytoma than other paragangliomas), perspiration; cold/clammy skin, dilated eyes, dry mouth, and sometimes piloerection could be noticeable. Signs and symptoms like bradycardia and syncope due to carotid sinus syndrome or hemoptysis, dysphagia, or chest pain in superior venous sinus syndrome may occur.
