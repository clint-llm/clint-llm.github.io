Common symptoms of inherited bone marrow failure syndromes are related to aplastic anemia. They include fatigue and pallor due to anemia, hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia, and fevers, mucosal ulcerations, and bacterial infections from neutropenia. Many patients have extra-marrow features specific to each syndrome; however, clinicians cannot rely on the absence of such findings to exclude inherited bone marrow failure syndromes because many patients do not have them.

Fanconi anemia presents in children more often than adults. Patients will have:

- Low birthweight

- Cafe au lait spots

- Short stature

- Microcephaly

- Renal or cardiac malformations

- Hypogonadism

- Absent radii and thumbs

- Histories of bone marrow failure or malignancies, specifically, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), at younger ages (younger than 40 years) in the patient or family members.

Dyskeratosis congenita also presents in children more often than adults. While dyskeratosis congenita shares many features with Fanconi anemia (short stature, low birth weight, hypogonadism, and histories of premature malignancies including MDS/AML and SCC), it has the following differences:

- Lacy reticulated skin pigmentation with telangiectasias affecting the upper body

- Maldentition

- Alopecia

- Premature graying of hair,

- Dystrophic nails

- Hyperhidrosis of glabrous skin

- Pulmonary fibrosis

Blackfan-Diamond anemia presents in all ages with bone marrow failure (predominantly neutropenia), exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, and skeletal abnormalities.
