Citrate toxicity can occur with the administration of fresh frozen plasma. The majority of citrate in whole blood products is present in fresh frozen plasma and platelets, not packed red blood cells. Citrate chelates calcium,Â and citrate intoxication causes hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia signs and symptoms include hypotension, decreased pulse pressure, arrhythmias, mental status changes, and tetany. Treatment includes calcium administration.
