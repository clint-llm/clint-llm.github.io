The differential diagnosis should include optic nerve neoplasms such as meningiomas and optic nerve gliomas, vascular malformations, and systemic conditions such as neurofibromatosis and Von Hippel Lindau. Increased CSF pressure due to a cerebral lesion, vascular lesion, or idiopathic intracranial hypertension should be considered especially if optic nerve sheath dilatation is bilateral.
