Rotational vertebral artery syndrome is rare, and there is not one single consensus on the best course of treatment. Conservative management with avoidance of head and neck rotation using a brace or collar is one option, while adjunct anticoagulation therapy may improve morbidity.

Most patients are offered conservative treatment initially and undergo surgical intervention if symptoms fail to improve. Decompression and fusion of the cervical spine, generally at C1-C2 or occiput-C2, may be employed.

Cornelius et al. described a case of bow hunter's syndrome caused by dynamic vertebral artery stenosis. The patient in question had a history of focal dissection, and after failing conservative management, he received treatment with coil embolization of his right vertebral artery.
