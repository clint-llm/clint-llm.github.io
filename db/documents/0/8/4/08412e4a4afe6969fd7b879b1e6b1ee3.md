Arterial blood supply to TMJ is ensured by the superficial temporal artery and the maxillary artery, as well as by the masseteric artery. There are other arterial branches, such as the posterior auricular artery and the ascending pharyngeal artery (derived from the external carotid artery), and from the ascending palatine artery.

The venous drainage occurs through the pterygoid plexus in the retrodiscal area, in communication with the internal maxillary vein, the sphenopalatine vein, the medial meningeal veins, the deep temporal veins, the masseterine veins, and the inferior alveolar vein.

Lymphatic drainage is not always straightforward to describe because, in the case of TMJ disease, lymph nodes can increase in number. Generally, the lymphatic system that affects TMJ comes from the area of the submandibular triangle.
