Basic comprehension of orbital anatomy and structural relations is paramount to understanding the mechanism of action and potential complications of the retrobulbar block. Generally, the orbital space can be divided intoÂ 2 compartments that communicate freely. The intraconal compartment encloses the orbital fat, ciliary ganglion, ophthalmic artery, several cranial nerves (optic, oculomotor, abducens), and a nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic nerve. The extraconal compartment consists of orbital fat, lacrimal gland, abducens nerve, and the frontal branches of the ophthalmic nerve.

**Orbits:**Despite the classical description of the orbits as pyramidal in shape, their walls are irregular, curvilinear, and perforated by fissures and foramina at their apex. Orbit height can be around 35 mm at the rims, with an approximately 40 mm width and 42 to 54 mm depth from the optic foramen to the orbital rim. For this reason, the use of needles more than 38 mm for the retrobulbar blockade is not advisable. The medial orbital wall is thin from the apex to the base; it is separated from the ethmoid sinus by the lamina papyracea. Perforation of this lamina with a needle may result in an abscess or orbital cellulitis.

**Ocular globe:**The eyeball is spherical and lies anteriorly in the orbital cavity. It has an axial length of 25 mm, an essential anatomical characteristic to consider when planning a retrobulbar blockade. Myopia increases the anterior to the posterior diameter of the eyeball. Several studies have shown that more than 26 mm axial length is associated with a higher risk of ocular globe perforation. The presence of staphylomas (protruding defects of the sclera lined with uveal tissue), which typically lies in the posterior or inferior surface of the ocular globe, is also associated with higher perforation risk.

**Extraocular muscles:**Six muscles control ocular globe movements; four of them are the rectus muscles (superior, inferior, lateral, and medial), and the other two are the oblique muscles (inferior and superior). The rectus muscles are inserted anteriorly into the sclera where their tendons join in the intraconal space, forming the Zinn ring that encircles the optic canal. Ample fat-filled space, devoid of major anatomical structures, is created by diverting the medial rectus from the medial orbital wall, making it an ideal area for infiltration.

**Motor and sensorial innervation:**Motor innervation of the inferior oblique and rectus muscles, with the exemption of the lateral rectus, is provided by the oculomotor nerve. The trochlear nerve innervates the superior oblique muscle. This nerve exits the annulus and runs along the muscular surface, making it typically unaffected by inferotemporal blocks. The orbicularis muscle is innervated by the facial nerve, which frequently must be blocked to prevent blinking during surgery. For this reason, a Van Lind block is used at the same time as the retrobulbar block.

Sensorial innervation of the eye is majorly provided by the first branch of the trigeminal nerve (V1) and its branches (frontal, lacrimal, and nasociliary). The lacrimal and frontal branches of V1 innervate the peripheral conjunctiva. However, these branches run in the extraconal space; thus, the intraconal blockade will not provide any anesthetic effect in these branches. The second branch of the trigeminal nerve (V2) provides only a minor contribution to sensorial innervation through the infraorbital nerve.

**Blood supply:**The ophthalmic artery irrigates the extraocular muscles and the ocular globe. From its original trajectory entering the orbital space through the optic canal, blood vessel distribution is skewed towards the superior nasal quadrant. Consequently, this is a high-risk area for local anesthetic infiltration and must be avoided.

**Connective tissue:**The****Tenon capsule surrounds the ocular globe and extraocular muscles. This dense fibroelastic tissue covers the sclera and forms the episcleral space (Sub-Tenon space). It originates at the sclerocorneal limbus and extends toward the posterior pole of the globe to reach the optic nerve. Local anesthetic injected into Sub-Tenon space diffuses into the retrobulbar space, blocking the extraocular muscles and nerves supplying the globe in this space.

**Imaging and contrast spread of retrobulbar block:**One small case series comparing gadolinium distribution for the peribulbar vs. retrobulbar block observed that the spread of contrast medium was intense in the intraconal space, laterally greater than medially. Five minutes after injection, contrast surrounded the optic nerve sheath and was visible beyond the optic canal, around the internal carotid artery in its cavernous portion. Contrast remained visible even 90 minutes after injection. At that point, significant signal intensity was observed within the pterygopalatine fossa.

**Physiology applied to anesthesia for ocular surgery:**Regional anesthesia techniques for ocular surgery can increase intraocular pressure (IOP). The volume injected in the intraconal, or extraconal compartment generates external compression on the ocular globe, increasing the IOP by more than 20 mm Hg. Additionally, using digital pressure to improve local anesthetic spread, control bleeding, or reduce chemosis should be avoided. Digital pressure can increase the IOP to 400 mmHg

**Oculocardiac reflex:**The Oculocardiac reflex is mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system. The traction of the extraocular muscles (most commonly the medial rectus muscle) produces direct pressure on the ocular globe, which generates bradycardia, auriculoventricular block, ventricular ectopia, and asystole. The afferent pathway involves activating stretching receptors localized in the extraocular muscles. These receptors transmit a signal through the short and long ciliary nerves to a division of the ophthalmic trigeminal nerve, the ciliary ganglion, and subsequently to the Gasser ganglion. Once the signal reaches the trigeminal ganglion, it is conducted to the sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve near the fourth ventricle. The internuncial nerve fibers then carry the signal to the motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. The efferent branch of the vagus nerve increases parasympathetic inputs to the heart conduction system.
