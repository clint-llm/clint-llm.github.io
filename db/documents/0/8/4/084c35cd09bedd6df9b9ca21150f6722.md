Most annular fissures or annular tears are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on imaging.  If an annular fissure or tear is symptomatic, it may cause one of two findings: localized pain secondary to the tear or radicular symptoms secondary to irritation of the passing nerve root. The pain may either be acute if the tear occurs suddenly or more chronic if there is a slower development of the annular fissure.

If the annular fissure is locally symptomatic, it may cause pain localized deep pain worse with movements that can stress or irritate the focal annular tear. In such cases, there is no radicular nerve involvement, and the physical exam may be unrevealing.  Sometimes the annular tear can irritate the traversing nerve and cause radiculopathy. If the annular fissure or annular tear is significant enough, disc material can herniate to irritate or compress traversing nerves or spinal cord.  In either case, when the traversing nerve is irritated, it can cause radicular symptoms including pain, paresthesia, and/or weakness depending on the extent of nerve irritation or compromise.
