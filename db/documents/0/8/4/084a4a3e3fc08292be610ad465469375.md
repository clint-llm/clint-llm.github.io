Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of a CTO lesion on average requires more fluoroscopy time, higher contrast volume, and carries a lower success rate compared to non-CTO PCI’s. CTO PCIs also have a higher complication rate than non-CTO PCIs with major complications, including myocardial infarction, stroke, vessel perforation, and death. However, vascular access site complications during CTO PCI occur at a similar frequency as routine PCI; these include poorly controlled bleeding, hematoma, acute thrombosis, distal embolization, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, dissection of the access artery, arteriovenous fistula, and pseudoaneurysm. Other potentially serious complications include ventricular tachyarrhythmias, bradycardia, allergic reactions, atheroembolism, and contrast nephropathy.

Data analysis of the National Cardiovascular Data Registry-Cath PCI Registry in the United States showed higher in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular event frequency (1.6 versus 0.8 percent; p<0.001) which included mortality (0.4 % versus 0.3%; p<0.001), stroke (0.1% versus 0.1 %; p = 0.045), tamponade (0.3% versus 0.1%; p<0.001), MI (2.7% versus 1.9 %; p<0.001), and urgent CABG surgery (0.8% versus 0.4%; p<0.001) in 22,365 patients who underwent CTO PCI compared with 572,145 patients who underwent non-CTO PCI. CTO PCIs also had lower procedural success rate (59% vs. 96%, p < 0.001) in this registry.

Another multicenter registry (OPEN-CTO) from 12 CTO-PCI centers of 1,000 consecutive patients undergoing CTO PCI evaluated success rates, complication rates, and health status benefits at one month.  CTO PCIs showed a success rate of 86%, with an in-hospital mortality of 0.9%, 1-month mortality of 1.3%. 4.8% of the patients had coronary perforations requiring treatment. Additionally, major adverse cardiovascular events were 7%, myocardial infarction 2.6%, acute kidney injury 0.7%, and stroke 0%.
