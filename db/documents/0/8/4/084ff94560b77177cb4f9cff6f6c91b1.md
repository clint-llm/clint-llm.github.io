Many complications can exist with cerebral palsy, including intellectual disability, epilepsy, speech and hearing issues, orthopedic disorders, neurobehavioral disorders, and sleep disturbances.

In dyskinetic CP, as the motor impairments are more severe than other types of cerebral palsy as well as the characteristic involuntary movements, there are complications associated specifically with the severe motor impairments. This includes being underweight. Despite patients with dyskinetic CP usually being born with normal birth weights, many will be underweight on follow up, and this is thought secondary to involuntary movement leading to higher energy expenditure as well as combined with poor feeding and dysphagia, which are other complications.

Non-motor complications of DCP include severe intellectual impairment, language disability, epilepsy, as well as a combination of these, which can occur in more than half of the patients with DCP.
