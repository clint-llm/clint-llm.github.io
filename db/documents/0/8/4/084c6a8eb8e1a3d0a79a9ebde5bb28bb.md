Physiologic variations between individuals exist when discussing specific measurements of the superior oblique muscle. Certain measurements, such as the size of the muscle, the length of the tendon, the insertion point, and the angle the muscle takes upon approaching the trochlea may differ from individual to individual. Furthermore, as discussed above, the superior temporal vortex vein differs in its path relative to the superior oblique muscle when comparing individuals, passing either through or around the muscle.
