Orf disease, also known as contagious pustular dermatitis or ecthyma contagiosum, is a zoonotic infection caused by the parapoxvirus, Orfviridae.

Orf plagues young sheep and goats, which are their natural host range. The virus causes a vesicular papular lesion, prominent in the lips and mouth. Orfviridae is notorious for jumping hosts to human populations after close contact with a zoonotic source that sports active lesions or even via fomites.
