Bronchodilators are indicated for individuals that have lower than optimal airflow through the lungs. The mainstay of treatment is beta-2 agonists that target the smooth muscles in the bronchioles of the lung. Various respiratory conditions may require bronchodilators, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They are used to either reverse asthma symptoms or improve lung function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of bronchodilators, pertinent for interprofessional team members to treat patients with obstructive lung pathology.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the different classes of bronchodilator drugs.
- Identify the various mechanisms of action of the bronchodilator drug classes.
- Describe the adverse event profile and interactions of bronchodilator class medications.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the use of bronchodilating medications and improve outcomes in obstructive lung disease treatment.
