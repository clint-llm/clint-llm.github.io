Aortocaval compression syndrome is also known as a supine hypotensive syndrome. It typically occurs in pregnant females, usually after 20 weeks of gestation, when the patient is in the supine position. Blood flow from the lower extremities back to the maternal heart and central circulation is impeded due to the uterus compressing the inferior vena cava and aorta. This subsequently limits blood flow to the placenta and may result in morbidity and mortality to the mother and fetus. Therefore, it is critical that the health care team be familiar with this entity as a cause of hypotension in pregnant patients, and immediately initiate maneuvers to correct it. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of aortocaval compression syndrome and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of aortocaval compression syndrome.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with aortocaval compression syndrome.
- Identify the management considerations for patients with aortocaval compression syndrome.
- Explain the importance of optimizing care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients at risk of aortocaval compression syndrome.
