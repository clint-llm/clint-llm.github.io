Cafe-au-lait macules (CALMs) are common pigmented lesions found in the general population. They can be described as well-circumscribed, pigmented macules or patches ranging from light to dark brown. Their size may range from a few millimeters to several centimeters (>20cm) and may appear at birth or early life. Multiple CALMs are often associated with genetic syndromes for which the patient and family members need to be evaluated by an interprofessional team. CALMs are mostly benign and are treated with laser therapy for cosmetic purposes. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of cafe-au-lait macules and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology and associated genetic syndromes with cafe-au-lait macules.
- Summarize the diagnostic criteria for NF1.
- Explain the evaluation of a patient presenting with cafe-au-lait macules.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication between the interprofessional team and to enhance the delivery of care for patients diagnosed with CALMs associated with genetic syndromes.
