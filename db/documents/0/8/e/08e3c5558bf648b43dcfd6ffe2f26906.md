In general, the prognosis for pharyngitis is good as both viral and bacterial infections are typically self-limited to 5 to 7 days.

In developing countries, over 20 million individuals are affected by group A streptococci and develop acute rheumatic fever. This disorder is the leading cause of death in young people.Â  Mortality from pharyngitis is rare but does occur if the airway is compromised.

Most cases of pharyngitis resolve within 7 to 10 days. Treatment failures are usually due to antibiotic resistance, poor compliance, and untreated close contacts.
