A clinician usually performs femoral vein cannulation, but the nursing staff monitors the line. In general, femoral vein cannulation is not preferred because the groin site is challenging to keep clean, and patient ambulation is difficult. These lines should not be kept for more than 24 to 48 hours. Nurses should monitor the site for bleeding, infection, and hematoma. The only benefit of a femoral line is that, unlike a subclavian or IJ central line, the risk of a pneumothorax is non-existent. Interprofessional care coordination between nurses and clinicians is crucial; the nurse should promptly report any concerns, including possible infection, so corrective measures can be implemented if necessary. Any problems should also be noted in the patient's permanent medical record. This interprofessional approach will enable optimal outcomes with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]
