Management for children with lissencephaly is symptomatic and supportive. Treatment aims to improve the intake of nutrients in patients with feeding difficulties and the use of anticonvulsant drugs to prevent or control seizures. Genetic counseling is usually offered to families of affected children, coupled with genetic studies.
