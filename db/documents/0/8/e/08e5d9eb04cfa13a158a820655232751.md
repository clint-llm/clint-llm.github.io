HBOT can be used for emergent or elective interventions. The primary emergent indication for HBOT is decompression sickness from gas embolism and decompression illness. It is also used for acute management of carbon monoxide toxicity, chronic refractory osteomyelitis, radiation injuries to soft tissue, and clostridial myonecrosis, although evidence for its use is less robust. It has also been used in necrotizing wounds, retinal artery occlusion, and acute trauma, though clear evidence of efficacy for these conditions is somewhat lacking.

Additional research indicates that patients recovering from head and neck tumors after radiation and surgical intervention may experience progressive fibrosis of soft tissue within the jaw. Studies have shown that patients who receive coadministered HBOT experience better outcomes than those without and conclude that patients who are irradiated for head and neck tumors should be referred to HBOT centers. Physicians should coordinate this effort with planned surgeries to optimize tissue healing.

There is also evidence that HBOT treats severe anemia where transfusions are refused (as with observant Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses) or cannot be safely performed.

One of the main drawbacks of this treatment method is the relative lack of access. There is a national shortage of HBOT centers in the United States, limiting its use and study as a mainstay treatment.
