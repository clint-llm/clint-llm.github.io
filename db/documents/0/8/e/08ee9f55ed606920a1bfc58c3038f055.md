Fractures of the clavicle are quite common, accounting for up to 10% of all fractures. It is the most common fracture of childhood. A fall onto the lateral shoulder most frequently causes a clavicle fracture. Radiographs confirm the diagnosis and aid in further evaluation and treatment. While most clavicle fractures are treated conservatively, severely displaced or comminuted fractures may require surgical fixation. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of clavicular fractures and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the various mechanisms of injury that can result in clavicle fractures, including the prevalence in the bimodal age distribution of these injuries.
- Summarize the components of proper evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with a potential clavicle fracture, including any indicated imaging studies.
- Review the treatment and management options available for clavicle fractures, based on the specific fracture type, location, and patient characteristics.
- Discuss how an optimally functioning interprofessional team would coordinate care to enhance outcomes for patients with arthritis of the facet joints.
