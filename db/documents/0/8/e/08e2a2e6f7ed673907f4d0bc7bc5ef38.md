The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) does not recommend screening asymptomatic individuals for CKD.

Patients with end-stage renal disease should be educated about the following:

- Avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

- Advanced counseling for renal replacement modalities, including peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, and transplantation

- Timely placement of vascular access for hemodialysis

- Pregnancy could be fatal in ESRD

- Avoid phosphate-rich foods

- Potassium restriction in diet

- Sodium and water restriction to avoid volume overload

- Protein restriction to delay the onset of uremic symptoms

- Reduction in salt intake may slow the progression of diabetic CKD
