Q-switched (QS) lasers work by delivering high-powered pulses in very short pulse durations which results in the fragmentation of the tattoo particles. The high-powered pulses form acoustic waves, which are thought to be the main mechanism of tattoo particle destruction. Recently, picosecond lasers have become the mainstay of tattoo removal due to their shorter pulse durations. The picosecond pulse duration is considerably less than the thermal relaxation time of the tattoo pigment particles (< 10 nanoseconds), leading to rapid heating of the chromophore with minimal surrounding thermal damage. Furthermore, an inflammatory response is ignited in the weeks following treatment leading to macrophage phagocytosis of residual extracellular tattoo pigment.
