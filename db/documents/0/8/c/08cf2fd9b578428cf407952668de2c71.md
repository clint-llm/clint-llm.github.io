The first successful corneal transplant was more than 110 years ago. At the moment corneal transplants worldwide are one of the most common transplants performed. The US has the highest rates of corneal transplants worldwide, with an exponential increase of EK transplantations over PK, the former representing approximately 60% of all transplants.

Selective keratoplasty techniques have revolutionized the corneal transplantation field with improvements in graft survival, refractive and visual outcomes.

Corneal endothelial cells (CECs) cannot at present be expanded in laboratory conditions following biopsy. Recent work has focused on using alternative stem cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells,in vitro have shown promise in large animal models.
