Platypnea is a symptom; therefore, management should be directed toward the underlying disorder. Detailed management of each disease is beyond the scope of this review, but the following measurements apply:

- Supplemental oxygen should be provided to all hypoxic patients.

Examples of managing causative disorders include:

- HPS: The only definitive treatment for cirrhotic patients with HPS is liver transplantation. Supportive management should be provided waiting for transplantation.

- Lung disease: Management depends on the underlying disease, but examples include antibiotics for pneumonia, embolotherapy for large pulmonary arteriovenous malformations and disease-specific treatment for patients with interstitial lung disease.

- Intracardiac shunts: PFO usually does not require any treatment as it may present in up to 25% of people. If the patient is symptomatic with platypnea-orthodeoxia or to prevent paradoxical embolic stroke, then device closure may be an option. Consultation with a cardiologist and cardiovascular surgeon is often required for the management of other intracardiac shunts.
