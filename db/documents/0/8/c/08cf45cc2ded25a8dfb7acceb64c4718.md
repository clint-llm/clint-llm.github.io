Ectropion is an outward turning of the eyelid margin. This typically occurs on the lower eyelids. When the globe is not protected properly, the eye can become very dry. This dryness may lead to symptoms of redness, tearing, and foreign body sensation secondary to exposure of the ocular surface and an inadequate tear film. In extreme cases, the cornea can develop punctate epithelial erosions, ulceration, and permanent vision loss. Management almost always begins with lubrication with artificial tears, gels, and ointments. Surgical repair is commonly needed to improve the function of the eyelid and to protect the globe permanently.
