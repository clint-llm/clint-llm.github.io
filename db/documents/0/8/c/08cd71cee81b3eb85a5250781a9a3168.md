In the clinical setting, the mylohyoid nerve's sensory innervation of the first molar tooth is essential in nerve blocks. The mylohyoid nerve, along with the lingual nerve, is anesthetized during the extraction of the first molar tooth. The inferior alveolar nerve may require anesthetization in procedures involving the chin, lower lip, and gingivae. The nerve block on the inferior alveolar nerve will also block the mylohyoid nerve and the mental nerve, which allows for teeth extractions, suturing, and other procedures in this sensory territory.
