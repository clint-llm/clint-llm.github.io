The ascending palatine artery most commonly originates from the facial artery and runs alongside the pharynx and passes between the styloglossusÂ and the stylopharyngeus muscles. Its location is with the levator veli palatini where it divides into two branches to supply the soft palate and palatine glands. It later anastomoses with the descending palatine artery; which is a branch of the maxillary artery.

The ascending palatine artery can be divided into anterior and posterior branches as they supply the soft palate. However, this division may not be present in all individuals. The anterior branch without the posterior branch occurs in 25% of individuals, posterior branch without the anterior branch is present in 35%, and both anterior and posterior are the arrangement in 40% of individuals.
