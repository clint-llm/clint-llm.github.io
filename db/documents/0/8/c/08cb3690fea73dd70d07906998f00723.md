Kyphosis is defined as an increase in the forward curvature of the spine that is seen along the sagittal plane, whereas lordosis is an increase in the backward curvature seen along the sagittal plane. When the forward curvature becomes excessive this is called hyperkyphosis. The presentation can vary and may be caused by degenerative changes in the intervertebral discs. The curvature can be normal variance when presented in the thoracic spine or in excess be a cause for instability and concern. This activity describes the presence and evaluation of kyphosis and highlights the presentation in patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of kyphosis.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of kyphosis.
- Outline the management options available for kyphosis.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to identify and improve outcomes of kyphosis as warranted.
