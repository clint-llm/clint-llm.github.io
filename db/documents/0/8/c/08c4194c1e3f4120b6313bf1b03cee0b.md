Colonic tubular adenomas characteristically demonstrate nuclear hyperchromatism (i.e., dark purple nuclei), nuclear crowding (i.e., nuclei are bunched-up), elliptical/cigar-shaped nuclei, and loss orÂ reduction in the number of goblet cells. They may not show dysplasia at first but will gradually develop dysplastic features and may eventually transform into colorectal cancer.
