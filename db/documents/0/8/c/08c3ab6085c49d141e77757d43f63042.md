PFTs are safe in general, and there are no complications. There is some potential harm from 4 key factors:

- Maximal pressures generated in the thorax and their impact on abdominal and thoracic organs/tissues

- Large swings in blood pressure cause stress on tissues in the body

- Expansion of the chest wall and lungs

- Spread of infections (e.g., tuberculosis, hepatitis B, HIV)

Contraindications of PFTs are related to those four factors to prevent potential complications like acute coronary syndrome, rupture of aneurysms, and dehiscence of the surgical wound.

Patients with myocardial infarction, unstable heart disease, or stroke within the previous three months should not perform bronchoprovocation testing. In addition, patients with an FEV <70 % of predicted are usually excluded from performing bronchoprovocation testing.
