Ogilvie syndrome can occur due to many causes and is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a surgeon, radiologist, internist, nurse practitioner, and gastroenterologist. The primary goal of treatment is urgent bowel decompression. Treatment options for ACPO include conservative therapy with observation, direct pharmacologic interventions, and endoscopic therapies. Surgical or open-operative interventions are reserved for those failing endoscopic procedures or for patients who develop ischemia or perforation. The recommendations discussed in this article are consistent with those of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons 2016 guidelines.

The expected prognosis is confounded by the association of multiple co-morbidities in the usual patient population, as well as the underlying disease contributing to the development of ACPO. In general, the expected mortality after diagnosis of uncomplicated ACPO is approximately 15%. Complicated ACPO occurs in 3% to 15% of patients, which is associated with a much worse prognosis with average mortality rates between 30% and 40%.
