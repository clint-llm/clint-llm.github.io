The major salivary glands have essentially the same structure: secretory end-pieces termed acini that produce saliva, which flows into arborized ducts that open into the oral cavity. All salivary glands are encapsulated and divided into divisions called lobes, which further subdivide into lobules, each of which is separated by a connective tissue septum. Each salivary gland is made up of two separate parts: a serous portion, responsible for secreting watery saliva, and a mucous portion, responsible for a more viscous fluid. The three major salivary glands are all composed of a mixture of these two types of cells. The parotid gland is composed primarily of serous acini and produces watery saliva, which lubricates the oral cavity and helps with swallowing, talking, and maintaining homeostasis. The submandibular gland has a predominance of serous cells with some mucous cells. The sublingual gland is composed of mostly mucous acini and thus produces the thickest and most viscous saliva. Both parasympathetic and sympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system stimulate the secretion of saliva via aquaporins, specifically aquaporin 1 and 5. Electrolytes that will ultimately get released in saliva are first secreted from the acini through the intercalated ducts, into the striated ducts where they are moved out into the lumen through each gland’s respective duct via transmembrane active pumping.
