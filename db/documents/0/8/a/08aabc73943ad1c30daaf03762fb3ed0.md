HCM patients are symptomatic due to dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, arrhythmias, diastolic dysfunction, ischemia, and autonomic dysfunction. Dynamic LVOT obstruction is due to left ventricular (LV) septal hypertrophy and abnormal morphology of mitral valve or sub-mitral valvular apparatus. LV hypertrophy can be observed in any pattern and distribution, with a basal anterior septum and anterior free wall being the most predominant location. It causes the systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM), mostly the anterior mitral leaflet, resulting in worsening of LVOT gradient and mitral regurgitation. This further leads to high intracavitary pressure built up and exacerbation of diastolic heart failure and ischemic symptoms. LVOT obstruction is considered significant if the peak LVOT gradient is ≥30 mm Hg. The ECHO finding in HCM, SAM, and LVOT gradients are illustrated in the images below.
