Symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema (SDRIFE) is a symmetrical erythematous rash on the gluteal and intertriginous areas observed after exposure to systemic drugs.

Previously, in 1984, it was referred as baboon syndrome, due to the distribution of the lesions which localized to the buttocks and inner thighs (resembling the red rump of baboons), and observed as a response to systemic or local administration of contact allergens and drugs.

Hausermann proposed the term SDRIFE in 2004 as more appropriate for those reactions occurring after exposure to systemic drugs, regardless of prior sensitization.
