Insulin taken in large doses will cause symptoms of hypoglycemia in the patient. Some of these symptoms include headache, dizziness, palpitations, sweating, abdominal pain, and blurred vision. The immediate therapy for such patients is increasing the levels of glucose. In a conscious patient, this can be done by eating a high-energy bar or drinking a glass of glucose water. If the patient is unconscious, he needs to be hospitalized, given dextrose solution intravenously, and continuously monitors glucose levels.
