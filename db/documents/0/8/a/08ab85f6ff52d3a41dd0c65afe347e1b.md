Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FED) is a progressive hereditary disease of the cornea characterized by the slow deterioration of endothelial cells and, in most cases, development of guttae, which are excrescences of Descemetâ€™s membrane. As the disease progresses, loss of a majority of corneal endothelial cells can lead to corneal edema, scarring, and significantly decreased visual acuity. This activity reviews the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, evaluation, management, and prognosis of FED, and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Fuchs endothelial dystrophy.
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of Fuchs endothelial dystrophy.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for Fuchs endothelial dystrophy.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance Fuchs endothelial dystrophy and improve outcomes.
