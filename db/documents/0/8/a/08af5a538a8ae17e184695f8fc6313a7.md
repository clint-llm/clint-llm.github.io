Physicians should examine all patients for any movement disorders before initiating treatment with dopamine D2 receptor antagonists. Tardive dyskinesia presents clinically as stereotypical involuntary movements of the tongue, neck, and facial muscles, truncal musculature, and limbs. Buccolingual movements, including masticatory muscles, are characterized by lip-smacking, tongue protrusion, perioral movements, chewing movements, or a puffing of cheeks. Sometimes these movements may be hard to distinguish from stereotype posturing seen in chronic psychotic patients. However, tardive dyskinesia is seen in patients with chronic exposure to dopamine D2 receptor blockade.

The onset of tardive dyskinesia is insidious and can be difficult to distinguish as the nascent stages demonstrate only subtle deviant motion. Tardive dyskinesia can manifest as early as 1 to 6 months following the initiation of a dopamine receptor antagonist. Diagnosis of acute or chronic dyskinesias may be challenging without a careful history. A thorough history of movement disorders and medication history will aid in diagnosing tardive dyskinesia accurately.

Specific conditions that can occur with anti-dopaminergic agents include:

- Tardive akathisia

- Tardive orofacial dyskinesia

- Tardive dystonia

- Tardive blepharospasm

- Tardive tics
