When caring for patients with endometriomas, it is important to discuss the expectations for treatment and possible complications of having endometriosis. Endometriomas are treated using laparoscopic surgery. Therefore, the patient must receiveÂ education on the risks and benefits of laparoscopic surgery before undergoing a laparoscopic cystectomy. It is also important that the patient understand that endometriomas develop from endometriosis, a chronic condition. The patient should be advised that approximately 25% of women experience a reoccurrence of an endometrioma. Apart from reoccurrence, the patient may also experience issues with fertility and chronic pelvic pain related to their underlying endometriosis, which may require further treatment.
