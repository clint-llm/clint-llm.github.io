Theories suggest increased acute phase reactants can lead to thrombus formation and subsequent BRVO, with C-reactive protein and pentraxin-3 being the most likely substances. Prolonged retinal ischemia in concert with inflammation and vascular dysfunction leads to documented increases in VEGF mRNA which can result in deleterious effects such as increased capillary permeability and neovascularization.
