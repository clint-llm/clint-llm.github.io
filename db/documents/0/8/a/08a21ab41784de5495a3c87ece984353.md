Airway obstructions can be acute or chronic.Â Acute causes of supraglottic obstruction include laryngotracheobronchitis, croup, foreign body aspiration, epiglottitis, angioedema, acute bacterial tracheitis, facial or oral cavity burns, retropharyngeal abscess, and peritonsillar abscess. Chronic causes of supraglottic airway obstruction include laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia, laryngeal cysts, hemangiomas, obstructive sleep apnea, and progressive compression from masses. The obstruction presents as stridor, a harsh vibrating sound heard best during inspiration. The level of obstruction directly corresponds to the intensity of the stridor. Etiology may not be clear on initial presentation, and key factors in history and examination have to be taken into account.

In obtunded patients, the tongue is the most common cause of upper airway obstruction.

Inspiratory stridor represents supraglottic obstruction while expiratory stridor originates at or below the glottis level; this can be challenging to accurately assess in a patient breathing extremely rapidly.

In neonates there are several congenital craniofacial anomalies that are associated with airway obstruction. These include craniofacial clefts, Pierre Robin sequence, midface hypoplasia, achondroplasia, and Down syndrome. Such complex patients may have micrognathia, obstructive sleep apnea, or tongue-based airway obstruction, in addition to other neurologic or airway abnormalities that can cause distress.
