The underlying cause of all forms of Gaucher disease is mutations in the GBA1 gene resulting in a lysosomal deficiency of glucocerebrosidase activity. All forms of Gaucher disease lead to the toxic accumulation of glucocerebroside lipids, primarily in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. A glucocerebroside is composed of a glucose molecule linked to the oxygen atom on carbon atom 1 of the sphingosine moiety of ceramide. All forms of Gaucher disease are also classified as lysosomal storage disorders. There are at least 40 other lysosomal storage disorders including mucopolysaccharidosis, Tay-Sachs disease, and Fabry disease

Despite knowing the precise genetic causes of most forms of Gaucher disease, the exact cause remains unknown. It is possible for patients with the same mutation to have very different signs and symptoms. It is also possible for patients with similar signs and symptoms to have very different genetic mutations. Environmental factors, as well as an individual's particular genetic makeup, most likely influence theÂ phenotypic expression of Gaucher disease.
