There are relatively few contraindications for radiofrequency ablation. Absolute contraindications include patient refusal, increased intracranial pressure, and local infection. Because of the proximity to the spinal column for many procedures, sound clinical judgment and standard of care must be taken when confronted with anticoagulation medications and bleeding diathesis. Typically, ASRA (American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine) guidelines are followed. A brief review of when to stop common anticoagulation therapies includes aspirin for primary prophylaxis (6 days), clopidogrel (7 days), apixaban (3-5 days), rivaroxaban (3 days), warfarin (5 days), and intravenous heparin (4 hours). Coagulation studies also should be reviewed as appropriate. Relative contraindications include bacteremia and aberrant congenital or surgical anatomy. Because these are elective procedures, it is imperative to weigh risks and benefits and document patient agreement and understanding.
