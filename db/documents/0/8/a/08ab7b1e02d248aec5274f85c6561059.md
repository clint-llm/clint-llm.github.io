Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by a protozoa in the family Trypanosomatidae, order Kinetoplastida, genus Leishmania. The two stages of development are the amastigote and the promastigote, with the former infecting lysosomal vacuoles in phagocytic cells. The promastigote is an extracellular form that attaches to the insect microvilli. The insect vector, the sandfly, has multiple species but distinct subsets. Those that most commonly transmit Old World disease are Phlebotomus and Sergentomyia. The sandfly species notorious for spreading New World disease is Lutzomyia. A summative list of common leishmaniasis sub-species involved in New and Old World disease can be seen in table 1.

Adult sandflies are very small, about one-third the size of a small mosquito or < 3.5 mm in length. They are susceptible to dehydration and therefore thrive in moist climates, hence the distribution of disease. These flies are nocturnal, and during the day are found in burrows and under rocks or other shelters. They have a characteristic “V” shape over their backs when at rest and a distinct thoracic hump that pushes the head down. While males and females both obtain carbohydrates from plant juices, females require a blood meal. It is during this meal that the vector fly transmits the protozoa to the human host.
