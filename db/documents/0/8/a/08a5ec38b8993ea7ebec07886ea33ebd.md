The differential diagnoses of DON include other causes of sight-threatening TED, such as ocular surface diseases. Alternative etiologies of optic neuropathy such as those due to toxic and nutritional causes must be ruled out, specifically in the presence of central and paracentral scotomas. Unilateral disc edema with the enlarged blind spot along with electrophysiological changes, may also raise the suspicion of optic neuritis. It is not uncommon to have secondary glaucoma in TED that may be the cause of visual acuity changes, arcuate field defects, RNFL defects, and ocular blood flow changes. A meticulous history, clinical evaluation, and dedicated investigative workup help to differentiate each of the above from DON.
