On a large scale, strategies to counter obesity are abundant with multiple programs and policies in place, tackling the first intervention in obesity management, diet, and exercise. These programs aim to improve access to healthier food and provide a more friendly environment that encourages physical activity. Some examples of these programs include Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing Incentives, Kids in Parks, and Baltimore Healthy Stores.

On the primary care level, the treatment of obesity tends to be poor. In a prospective cohort study, researchers found that many obese patients are not receiving appropriate counsel during primary care visits. Possible reasons for the lack of counseling include time constraints, compensation, and low self-efficacy. When patients did receive counseling, it correlated with a moderate reduction in weight.

The US Preventative Serves Tasks Force recommends for Primary care providers to use the 5 As approach which includes: Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist, and Arrange. This method helps the physician identify any medical issues, delivers thorough counseling, and provides the patient with resources to make healthy lifestyle changes. This approach also helps build a multidisciplinary team for the patient, which is more likely to produce clinically significant weight loss than if the physician treated the patient alone.
