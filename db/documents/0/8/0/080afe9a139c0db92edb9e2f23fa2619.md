The amniotic cavity is an enclosed space within the uterus in which the fetus develops and is protected during the antepartum period. The amniotic cavity is comprised of a dual-layer membrane, which includes an inner layer known as the amnion and an outer layer known as the chorion. This potential space forms early in pregnancy and is filled with serous fluid during the first few weeks of pregnancy. With further development of the fetus, specifically, the fetal urinary system, the fluid in this potential space increases as the developing fetus excretes urine. Fetal urine comprises most of the amniotic fluid. Typically, this barrier remains intact throughout the duration of gestation, and the amniotic membranes will spontaneously rupture, releasing the amniotic fluid either immediately preceding spontaneous labor or sometimes after the onset of spontaneous labor.
