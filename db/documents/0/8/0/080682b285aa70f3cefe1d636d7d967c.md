Complications are very rare because the site of injection is far from the pleura, major blood vessels, and the spinal cord. Infection at the needle insertion site, local anesthetic toxicity/allergy, vascular puncture, pleural puncture, pneumothorax, and failed block are the primary complications. Because of the few published data, more investigations (e.g., randomized controlled trials, RCTs) are needed to verify the safety, complications rates, and efficacy of this strategy. A recent evidence-based study, indeed, identified only four RCTs and their endpoints were heterogeneous.
