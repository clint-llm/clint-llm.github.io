The most common radiopharmaceutical is 18F FDG obtained via bombardment in cyclotrons. Their relatively long half-life (T 1/2 = 110 min) allows for production and shipping the same day of the study.

The study requires a PET/CT scanner, a hybrid system that includes a single table for sequential acquisitions of PET and CT images. Compared to the gamma camera commonly used in radioiodide scans, this modality allows for increase spatial resolution through high-energy gamma rays from the emission of positrons without requiring collimators to improve image quality. Additionally, image reconstruction with cross-sectional CT permits better characterization of increased uptake in specific anatomical structures.
