In hand surgery, the knowledge of the long flexor muscles of the hand can aid in successful surgeries by preventing avoidable damage to the muscles, nerves, or blood supply. In carpal tunnel syndrome repair, the transverse carpal ligament is split to allow more room for the structures that descend underneath the transverse carpal ligament. When dividing the ligament, it is crucial to avoid damage to the muscle tendons, vessels, and median nerve.

Surgeons commonly use the tendon of the palmaris longus muscle as a graft. When a tendon ruptures in the hand, the palmaris longus tendon may be used as a graft to repair that damaged tendon.
