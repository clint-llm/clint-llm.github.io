The initial stages of the POW virus disease result from viremia that develops in the setting of an infected tick bite. Animal models have shown that infection can occur in as short as 15 minutes after tick attachment. Babesia microti, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Borrelia burgdorferi. After primary infection occurs, patients can develop non-specific flu-like symptoms that are typically self-limited. Subsequently, days to weeks later, a subset of patients will develop neurologic manifestations that most commonly present as encephalitis or meningoencephalitis.
