MSAF is more common inÂ post-term newborns. Its incidence varies with gestational age. One study reported MSAF in 5.1%, 16.5%, and 27.1% of preterm, term, and post-term newborns, respectively.

The incidence of MAS is also affected by access to care and is higher in areas where post-term deliveries are frequent. It was also lower in areas with a high frequency of early cesarean sections, despite other complications associated with cesarean sections.
