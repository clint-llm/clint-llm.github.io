There are many relative contraindications to consider. First and foremost, the overall health and prognosis of the patient must be considered, as a perfectly reconstructed tracheal lumen may still require a tracheostomy tube and ventilatory support in certain circumstances. The goals of the patient, the family, and the surgical team must be aligned, and expectations must be clearly communicated and understood.

Fitness to undergo surgery must be considered, and if questionable, could be a reason to continue observation over reconstruction. Laryngeal stenoses must be addressed before embarking on tracheal reconstruction or perhaps concomitantly in select patients. Â Severe pulmonary dysfunction must be ruled out, and airway inflammation from underlying pulmonology or gastroenterology conditions must be addressed preoperatively to ensure a favorable environment for healing. Conditions resulting in poor wound healing, such as active infection, diabetes, previous irradiation, steroid use, or underlying inflammatory conditions may also preclude surgical intervention.
