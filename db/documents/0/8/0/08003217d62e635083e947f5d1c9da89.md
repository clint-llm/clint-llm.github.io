Hearing loss in the elderly is complex and multifactorial. Aging is complicated since syndromes of age interplay among various organ systems, and basic homeostasis and physiology become altered with advancing age.

ARHL is defined strictly as bilateral sensorineural hearing loss solely attributed to age without any other causative explanation.

The traditional approach to hearing loss separates causes into conductive, sensorineural, or mixed.
