History, physical examination, and laboratory investigations, along with any significant radiological findings, can help to arrive at the diagnosis early and start treatment.

Most commonly advised laboratory tests are:

1. Complete blood count- will have normal platelet levels (1.5-4 lacs/cubic mm)

2. Clotting profile:

- International normalized ratio (INR) greater than or equal to 4

- Prothrombin time (PT) more than 4 times the normal

- Prothrombin time will be increased due to decreased activity of factor 7

- Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) will also be increased due to decreased activity of factors 2,9 and 10

- Clotting time will be increased due to clotting factor deficiency

- Fibrinogen levels will remain normal

3. Protein induced by vitamin K antagonist (PIVKA) estimation- PIVKA are proteins induced in vitamin K absence. These are evaluated by HPLC (high-pressure liquid chromatography), ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), or immuno-electrophoresis. Any amount of PIVKA is abnormal and indicates vitamin K deficiency.

4. Chest X-ray or ultrasound to determine if there is bleeding in body cavities- intrathoracic, intra-abdominal

5. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies to evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage
