The term os odontoideum (OO) refers to an anatomic anomaly of the upper cervical spine which was first described by Giacomini in 1886.**(See Figure)**. The ossicle is usually cranially migrated relative to the expected position of the odontoid tip and can adopt two anatomic types (Fielding et al.): orthotopic (ossicle located in the position of the normal odontoid) and dystopic (ossicle located near the occiput in the area of the foramen magnum).

Researchers have described variable radiological sizes regarding OO. However, most present are half the size of a normal odontoid process, some are so small and cephalic that it may be hard to diagnose on plain X-rays or computed tomography (CT).

One of the main risks of this anatomical entity is the association of anterior atlantoaxial subluxation. Posterior atlantoaxial subluxation is extremely rare.
