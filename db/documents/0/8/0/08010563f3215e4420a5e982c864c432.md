The phrenic nerves provide motor innervation to the diaphragm and work in conjunctionÂ with secondary respiratory muscles (trapezius, pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, sternocleidomastoid, and intercostals) to allow respiration.

The accessory phrenic nerve, if present, may provide motor innervation to the subclavius muscle. The subclavius muscle originates at the costochondral junction of the first rib and inserts at the subclavian groove of the clavicle. The subclavius muscle stabilizes the clavicle.
