HHV-6A, HHV-6B, and HHV-7 all share some level of homology with human cytomegalovirus (CMV), the only other human beta-herpesvirus.

By adulthood, more than 95% of the population is seropositive for HHV-6A, HHV-6B, or both variants. Present serologic methods are ineffective in isolating one variant from the other.
