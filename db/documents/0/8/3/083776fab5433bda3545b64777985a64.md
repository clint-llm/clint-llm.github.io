The brain is covered by three meningeal layers, dura mater, pia mater, and arachnoid mater. Meningitis is an inflammation of these meningeal layers, especially the pia and arachnoid.

A positive Kernig sign patient should undergo a CT scan followed by a lumbar puncture and antibiotics. Common causes of meningitis are inflammation due to infections, i.e., bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. These infections can be differentiated based on cerebrospinal fluid analysis, staining, and culture after a lumbar puncture. In bacterial and fungal infections, glucose is reduced in CSF. Lymphocytes areÂ predominant in viral and fungal infections in the CSF. CSF opening pressure is increased in fungal and bacterial infections.
