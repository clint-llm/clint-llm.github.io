The septum pellucidum is formed embryologically by two closely opposed leaves enclosing a cavity called the CSP. The leaves of SP fuse in a caudal to the rostral direction at approximately six months of intrauterine life. The CSP cavity usually disappears by three months of postnatal life. However, if the gap is not closed, CSP may persist and can be seen even in adults.
