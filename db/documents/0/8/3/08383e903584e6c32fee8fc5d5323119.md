Rhinophyma is considered the final and most severe stage of rosacea, primarily affecting white males over the age of 50.

Hypertrophy of the sebaceous glands and fibrosis of underlying connective tissue is the pathologic basis of this condition.

Diagnosis of rhinophyma isÂ typically a clinical diagnosis.

Treatment of rosacea does not prevent rhinophyma development. Definitive treatment requires surgery composed of excisional, ablative, or laser methods.
