The presentation of Page kidney may range from non-specific clinical presentation with an insidious onset, to a catastrophic event of hypertensive urgency or emergency.

Ultrasound of the kidneys and contrast-enhanced computed tomography are generally adequate in making a diagnosis of Page kidney.

It is important for the providers to remember that a significant time lapse could be seen between trauma and the diagnosis of hypertension. The interval could range between days and decades, as has been reported in many cases. The traumatic event may even go unnoticed.
