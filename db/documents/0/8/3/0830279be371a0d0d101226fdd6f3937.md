The stigmatization of overweight and obesity negatively impacts the health care provided to patients. Because of this stigmatization, patients are reluctant to seek healthcare, decreasing healthcare visits. The healthcare team's conscious and subconscious biases contribute to the suboptimal care of this patient population. It is the responsibility of all healthcare team members to take whatever steps necessary to ensure the best quality of care is given to each patient. This is only achievable if each healthcare organization aims to end the stigma associated with weight. [Level 4]

The following steps outline ways for the healthcare team to decrease the stigma of obesity and improve the care provided to these patients.

- Step 1: Recognize that obesity is a chronic disease with diverse causes.

- Step 2: Create a weight-friendly space that is sensitive to the needs of people with obesity.

- Step 3: Use motivational interviewing and coaching techniques to set individualized and realistic goals in collaboration with the patient.

- Step 4: Individualize a treatment plan including lifestyle and behavior modification, pharmacotherapy, and referrals to nutrition, psychology, physical therapy, and bariatric surgery when necessary.

- Step 5: Implement zero-tolerance policies for negative language and practices that stigmatize patients with high body weight.
