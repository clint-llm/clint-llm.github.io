**First Trimester**

Patients with a higher risk of genetic disorders based on ethnicity also should be screened in the first trimester. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common genetic diseases in Caucasians and relatively common in Ashkenazi Jews and Hispanics. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued a consensus statement in 1997 indicating that CF testing should be offered to adults with a family history of CF, to partners of people with CF, to all couples planning a pregnancy, and to couples seeking prenatal testing. Patients of Ashkenazi Jew descent are predisposed to several genetic disorders.  Both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommend carrier testing for three carrier tests:  Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, and familial dysautonomia along with CF testing in this population. The ACMG also recommends screening for Fanconi anemia group C, Niemann-Pick type A, Bloom syndrome, mucolipidosis type IV, and Gaucher disease to all Ashkenazi Jewish couples. Screening for sickle cell disease should be offered to individuals of African, African-American, Mediterranean basin, Middle Eastern, and Indian descent.

**Third Trimester**

Before delivery, an assessment of fetal position and estimated fetal weight should be documented.
