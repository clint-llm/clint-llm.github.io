The subclavian vein (SVC) is classified as a deep vein and is the major venous channel that drains the upper extremities. Other deep veins of the upper extremity that accompany the major arteries include the radial, ulnar, brachial, axillary veins. The SVC is a paired deep vein in the normal variant of human anatomy, the left subclavian vein, and right subclavian vein, arising as a continuation of the axillary vein at the lateral border of the first rib on each upper extremity and continues to pass over the first rib in its groove on the rib. The subclavian artery is just posterior to the subclavian vein. The subclavian vein continues its path posterior to the clavicle, toward the sternal notch until the medial border of the anterior scalene muscle behind the sternoclavicular joint. Here, it joins the internal jugular vein, which becomes the brachiocephalic vein (also known as the innominate vein), to enter the superior vena cava, which drains into the right atrium of the heart.
