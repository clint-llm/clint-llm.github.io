Early prevention is key to improving outcomes of radon exposure. One important role of primary clinicians is the screening and prevention of diseases such as cancers. This presents an ideal opportunity for primary clinicians to educate patients on the risks of radon exposure. As with other cancers, a clinician's intervention may prevent the development of cancer by offering resources about the measurement and the reduction of radon levels, further decreasing mortality rates from radon toxicity.
