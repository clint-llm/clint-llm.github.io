Albinism is a relatively common genetic disorder which affects many organ systems. Thus, the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team. Vision deficits are the major source of debility in non-syndromic albinism subjects. These should be addressed early to maximize outcomes and limit the social and educational impact. Squamous cell carcinomas are the most common malignancy in albinism, which can increase the relative risk as much as 1000 times. Albinism is not curable. The focus should be on early assessment and correction of visual deficits and lifelong, risk-factor modification, early detection, and treatment of the skin malignancies. Early consultation to ophthalmology and dermatology, as mentioned above.  Family referral to geneticist may be beneficial.
