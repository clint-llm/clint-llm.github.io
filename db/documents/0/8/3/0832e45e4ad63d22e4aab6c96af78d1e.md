The first step in evaluating suspected ACO is the pulmonary function test (PFT) with FEV1 level reflecting disease severity. Spirometry in ACO should show a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC of less than 0.70. Patients with ACO typically exhibit a bronchodilator response, which is defined as an increase in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or forced vital capacity (FVC) after bronchodilation of more than 10% of predicted value; however, asthma is associated with a more significant increase in FEV1 or FVC of more than 15% of the predicted value. In individuals with ACO, postbronchodilator FEV1 and FEV1/FVC typically stay abnormally low, while a normal postbronchodilator, FEV1, and FVC are more consistent with asthma.

There are multiple criteria for ACO diagnosis. In 2016, a global expert panel share that patients must meet all 3 main and at least one minor criterion to be diagnosed with ACO. The main criteria are as follows:

The patients should be at least 40 years old with chronic airflow obstruction (post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC 0.70 or the lower limit of normal)

They have at least 10 pack-years of tobacco use

They have a history of asthma before age 40 or more than 400 milliliters (mL) increase in FEV1 after bronchodilator use.

A documented history of atopy or allergic rhinitis, a bronchodilator response in FEV1 of at least 200 ml and 12% from baseline values during two or more visits, or a peripheral blood eosinophil count of at least 200 cells/mL are the minor criteria. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) posted the same categories to support the diagnosis of ACO. A reduced diffusion capacity is not consistent with asthma but could be seen more often in individuals with COPD.

Other workups should include peripheral eosinophils count, immunoglobulin E level, and respiratory allergen panel.

When evaluating dyspnea, a chest radiograph is usually taken. Chest radiographs may reveal hyperinflation in ACO patients, but they often cannot distinguish between asthma, COPD, and ACO.
