It is held that the energy from the radiation affects three different components of the bladder: (1) It affects the urothelium by disrupting tight junctions, increasing elements of the cytoplasm, affecting DNA replication, and causing cellular edema. Once the mucosal cells die and shed, urine can then irritate submucosal cells. (2) It affects bladder vasculature by causing edema and perivascular fibrosis. (3) Finally, radiation affects the detrusor muscle by causing vascular ischemia, increasing fibroblasts and collagen deposition, and causing smooth muscle edema.
