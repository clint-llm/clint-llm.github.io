Cyclobenzaprine is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant structurally related to tricyclic antidepr

Cyclobenzaprine does not work directly on skeletal muscle or the neuromuscular junction, although an overlapping action on the spinal cord may contribute to its overall skeletal muscle relaxant activity. Evidence implies that the resultant impact of cyclobenzaprine is a decline of tonic somatic motor activity, affecting both gamma(γ) and alpha(α) motor systems. Recent research suggests that cyclobenzaprine is a (5-HT2) receptor antagonist, and this additional action is responsible for its antispasmodic effect.

Cyclobenzaprine effectively improves muscle spasms, reduces local pain and tenderness, and increases the range of motion in acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Absorption: The time to peak plasma cyclobenzaprine concentration (Tmax) is 7 to 8 hours for cyclobenzaprine extended-release formulation and approximately 4 hours for immediate release formulation. The steady-state plasma concentration is attained within 3 to 4 days. Food increases the extent(AUC) and rate of absorption of cyclobenzaprine.

Distribution: Cyclobenzaprine is highly bound to plasma protein(93%) and binds primarily to alpha-1 glycoprotein, an acute phase reactant protein elevated in inflammatory conditions).

Metabolism: Cyclobenzaprine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP31A2, and CYP2D6).

Excretion: Cyclobenzaprine follows first-order pharmacokinetics. The mean elimination half-life for the immediate-release formulation is 18 hours(range 8 to 37 hours), and for the extended-release formulation is approximately 32 hours. Cyclobenzaprine is excreted predominantly as glucuronides via the kidney.
