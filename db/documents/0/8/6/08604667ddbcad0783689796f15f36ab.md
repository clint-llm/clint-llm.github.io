Knowledge about enzymes is essential in medicine for diagnosing many diseases. In clinical studies, enzymes can act as markers that identify disease states within the body. Doctors can often determine what kind of disease is affecting a patient and which organ is damaged by characterizing the enzymes released into circulation. Enzymes can also be a component in a tissue biopsy and provide detailed diagnostic information.
