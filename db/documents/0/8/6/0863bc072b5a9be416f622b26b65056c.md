Tinea manuum is a superficial dermatophyte infection of one or both hands, and the involvement can include the palms. It is worldwide in its geographic distribution and can be caused by a variety of dermatophytes. As with other dermatophytoses, the history and physical exam are key elements for reaching a correct diagnosis, but laboratory or pathological studies may be required. Tinea manuum can be misdiagnosed and, as a result, mismanaged; therefore, this activity discusses predisposing factors, reviews the correct diagnosis and management of tinea manuum, and explains the role of interprofessional teamwork in achieving the best outcomes, especially when the diagnosis is in doubt or the condition is recurrent or refractory to treatment.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of tinea manuum.
- Review the evaluation of tinea manuum.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for tinea manuum.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients with tinea manuum.
