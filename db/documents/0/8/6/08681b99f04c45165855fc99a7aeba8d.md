Assessing laryngeal function and mobility is valuable for both the otolaryngologist and primary care physician. As an outpatient, primary care physicians can use laryngeal mirrors to visualize the larynx for basic screening purposes to investigate foreign bodies, masses, or inflammation. To better assess laryngeal function and visualize anatomy more intimately, an otolaryngologist or another trained practitioner can use a flexible laryngoscope. After the nasal administration of a topical anesthetic, the scope is passed through the nasopharynx as far as tolerated by the patient. Performing this well-tolerated procedure on an alert patient allows for outpatient visualization of the dynamic larynx. For most diagnostic visualization and biopsies, rigid laryngoscopy under sedation is necessary.

Hoarseness and dysphagia can be the presenting symptoms of countless diseases. Trauma, stroke, malignancy, neuromuscular disorders, and psychiatric illness can cause combinations of these diseases. An appropriate differential can be generated based on demographics, exposures, and detailed history.
