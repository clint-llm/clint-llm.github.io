Allergic interstitial nephritis is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate in the renal interstitium. The classic clinical triad of rash, fever, and eosinophilia is only present in about 10% of cases. Worsening renal function, eosinophilia (about 30% of cases), eosinophiluria, WBCs in the urine, proteinuria (typically non-nephrotic), and evidence of tubular injury (e.g., high fractional excretion of sodium, Fanconi syndrome) are common laboratory findings.
