There are no reported complications to the Apley compression test. While patients may experience localized knee pain, this is necessary to elicit, as that indicates a positive test.

As stated in the contraindications section, this test should not be performed on a patient with gross deformity of the knee after major trauma. More serious complications can arise, such as worsening existing fractures or potentially converting a closed fracture to an open fracture.
