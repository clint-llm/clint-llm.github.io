Neurilemmomas of the extremities are typically asymptomatic and only create a mass. Sometimes, however, the mass effect of the neoplasm can cause dysfunction of the nerve. While most symptoms are pain in the distribution of the nerve and sensory deficits or paresthesias, neurilemmomas of the anterior nerves of the spinal cord may produce symptoms of weakness and motor dysfunction as well.

If excised surgically, neurilemmomas are typically removed without damage to the nerve, as the tumor is derived from the surrounding cells of Schwann and not directly from the nerve axon themselves. That being said, any surgery carries risk. Injury to the nerve itself is uncommon, but always a possibility through traction injuries or disruption of the axon. As with all surgery, wound complications may occur as well. Recurrence is possible, but rare in benign tumors of the nerve sheath.
