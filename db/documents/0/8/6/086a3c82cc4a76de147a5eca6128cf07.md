Asthma is a wide-reaching, chronic inflammatory illness that impacts millions of people daily. It is frequently responsible for unscheduled healthcare usage, missed school, and workdays. It is an inappropriate immune response, much like an environmental allergy, to a triggering factor that induces bronchial hyperreactivity constriction with the remodeling of smooth muscle and increased mucous secretion into the airways. Several classifications of medications are utilized to treat and manage chronic asthma to improve symptoms and reduce exacerbations. This activity reviews the considerations for the use of asthma medications and discusses the role of the interprofessional team in educating patients on when they are necessary.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of asthma.
- Explain the mechanism of action of different asthma medications.
- Summarize the side effects of different asthma medications.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and educating the patients regarding the proper use of asthma medication.
