Hospital-acquired infections, also known as healthcare-associated infections (HAI), manifest 48 hours after admission to the hospital.Clostridium difficile (C. diff.), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

The rate of these potentially deadly infections can be reduced by following precaution notice signs at the door, clear communication between the interprofessional teams, and proper education on which disinfectants are most effective on these pathogens. Familiarity with the different types of disinfectants and their coverage and proper use of each and scheduled cleaning could significantly reduce the HAI and improve patient outcomes.
