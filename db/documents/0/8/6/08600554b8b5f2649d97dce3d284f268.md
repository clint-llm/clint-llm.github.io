Meningitis is the most common complication associated with CSF leak and is seen in 25 to 30% of patients. The risk is significantly higher among patients with a delayed onset of the leak in the range of 50 to 60% compared to 5 to 10% in the patients with early-onset. It is also more common in patients with penetrating injuries. There is no proven role of antibiotics in patients with no clinical evidence of meningitis.Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae.

Polymicrobial and anaerobic infections can occur in cases with penetrating injuries. CSF over-drainage is a common complication following CSF diversion procedures like lumbar drain insertion. This leads to sagging of the brain parenchyma, which can lead to injury to bridging veins and result in a subdural hematoma. Hence, following any CSF diversion procedure, controlling CSF drainage, and preventing intracranial hypotension is very important.
