By assessing the prognostic factors, clinicians can decide whether a standard therapy or more intense therapy would be helpful in maintaining CR and OS rates. The prognostic factors are chromosomal abnormalities (favorable abnormalities include t(8;21), t(15;17), inversion of chromosome 16), genetic mutations (NPM1 gene has a favorable prognosis, and FLT3 gene has unfavorable prognosis). Worse outcomes have been noted with older age, white blood cell count greater than 100,000 at the time of diagnosis, s-AML, t-AML, the presence of leukemic cells in the central nervous system (CNS).

Recent techniques such as PCR and flow cytometry can detect the presence of minimal residual disease among CR patients. Persistently elevated levels of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 despite induction therapy in patients with t(8;21) AML are associated with an increased incidence of relapse.
