The concept of contrast is the foundation upon which imaging rests. Contrast is simply the ability to distinguish two objects. In medical imaging, it allows adjacent substances or tissue to be distinguishable and visualized. Contrast allowed Marie Curie to identify her bones from the outline of her hand.

The optimal use of contrast will depend on the modality and physics of the imaging system. Radiographs and consequently computed tomography (CT) reflect how a target tissue depletes an energy signal as it passes through the tissue. The variables contributing to the signal loss include both the energy beam’s and the target’s physical properties.

Various types of contrast media are useful in medical imaging. The two largest groups include CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) agents. The contrast groups are not interchangeable. Additional, less commonly utilized contrast agents, including fluoroscopy-based air or CO2, and molecular imaging (nuclear imaging), will not be discussed in depth here.
