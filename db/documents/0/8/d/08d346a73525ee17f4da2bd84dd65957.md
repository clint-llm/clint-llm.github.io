In challenging cases, admission to an epilepsy monitoring unit or similar facility with combined video-EEG monitoring may be needed to secure the diagnosis. The best treatment is not known but may consist of a combination of medicationÂ if depression or anxiety exists and cognitive behavioral therapy. An honest and clear discussion of the patient's diagnosis is of utmost importance. In cases of conversion disorder, it is important to acknowledge that the spells are real and cause distress to the patient, family, and friends. It should be articulated that the episodes are not seizures. A respectful approach and the reassurance that supportive therapy will most likely decrease or even eliminate the frequency of spells should be outlined. If the diagnosis of PNES is secure, anti-epileptic drugs should be withdrawn.
