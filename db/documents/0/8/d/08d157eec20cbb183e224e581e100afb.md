The round ligament of the uterus develops from the gubernaculum. In a fetus, the gubernaculum is an undifferentiated mesenchymal tissue attached to ovarian tissue in a female fetus and testicular tissue in a male fetus. During the early stages of urogenital development in the female fetus, the gubernaculum develops as a connective tissue band.  This connective tissue ligamentous band is attached to the ovary on one side and the labia majora on the other side. During its course, from the ovary, it runs to the cornu of the uterus and adheres to the uterus.  Then it continues upward to the labia majora.

In adults, the gubernaculum develops into the following two parts:

- The round ligament of the uterus: The part between the cornu of the uterus and the labia majora. It is also called ligamentum teres uteri, and it is longer than the ovarian ligament.

- The ovarian ligament: The ovarian ligament is the part between the cornu of the uterus and the ovary.
