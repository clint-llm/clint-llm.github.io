Bacteroides fragilis is a part of the colonic microbiota, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is more abundant than B. fragilis in the microbiota but has been less frequently identified as a pathogen. Humans acquire Bacteroides fragilis likely at birth. In the early months of life, the bacterial flora changes considerably, and by the age of one year, the intestinal microbiota converts toward an adult microbiota profile.

Bacteroides fragilis infection is one of the common organisms involved in intrabdominal infection. Disruption of tissue barriers and the spread of intestinal flora into adjacent tissue causes polymicrobial infection. That is why Bacteroides fragilis is seldom the solitary organism of infection and usually part of other anaerobic organisms and Enterobacteriaceae.
