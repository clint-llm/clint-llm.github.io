Oral mucositis is a frequent complication in patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) to the head and neck, chemotherapy for solid tumors or lymphoma, and high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy prior to hematopoietic cell transplantation. The incidence of oral mucositis varies amongst the different chemotherapy agents.

The basal epithelial layer of the oral mucosa has a rapid cellular turnover, making the oral epithelium susceptible to radiation injury.
