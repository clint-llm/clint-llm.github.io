The focus of acute tetanus management should center around toxin mitigation and aggressive symptom management, including airway protection. All patients with tetanus-prone wounds should undergo immediate cleansing and debridement to eradicate spores and avoid further spread of the toxin from the tissue to the bloodstream. Patients with signs and symptoms of tetanus should be admitted to the intensive care unit for initial management. Some patients may even require mechanical ventilation. Symptom management is of the utmost importance.

Tetanus toxin binds irreversibly to the tissue, so the focus of neutralization is the unbound toxin. Human tetanus immune globulin should be given as soon as tetanus is suspected at a dose of 500 units. Antimicrobial therapy for the wound is typically given for 7-10 days. It is important to note that antimicrobial therapy plays a relatively minor role in the management of tetanus.

Muscular spasms in the setting of tetanus are life-threatening and can lead to respiratory compromise, aspiration, and exhaustion. Benzodiazepines can be used in controlling the rigidity and spasms associated with tetanus. In situations where sedation is not sufficient, neuromuscular blocking agents such as pancuronium or vecuronium can be used. Infection with C. tetani does not provide immunity, and thus, all patients with the diagnosis of tetanus should receive immunization as soon as possible with tetanus toxoid.

Autonomic complications may require management with magnesium sulfate in combination with benzodiazepine. If magnesium is administered intravenously, the patellar reflex should be monitored. If areflexia occurs, the dose of magnesium should be lowered. Morphine can also be used to manage pain and other autonomic symptoms, but it can cause hypotension. Patients with bradycardia may need a temporary pacemaker.
