This is an invasive technique for assessing the vascular abnormalities and was performed more commonly in the past, prior to the advent of CT. The downside is the high dose of ionizing radiation and the use of intravenous contrast. An added advantage of this technique is the fact that it can be used for treatment as well. Bronchial artery embolization for hemoptysis is one of the most common indications for this study.
