Inconsistencies in the AST results must be investigated and acted upon immediately.  No results should be released when quality control measures are not satisfactory.  Releasing inaccurate drug susceptibility or resistance results can inflict more harm to the patients, leading to severe clinical conditions and poor prognosis.  A worse consequence in delivering false AST results can result in wrong treatment management plans which might cause further mutations to these infectious organisms, exposing the patients and the community to a higher risk.
