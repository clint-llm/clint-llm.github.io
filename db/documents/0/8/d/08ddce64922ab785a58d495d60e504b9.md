Blood work is not specific for an intra-abdominal abscess but may reveal leukocytosis, abnormal liver function, anemia, or thrombocytopenia. These are features that signal an infection. Blood cultures are often negative but, when positive, may reveal predominantly anaerobic organisms, the most common being Bacteroides fragilis.

Plain abdominal x-rays are not sensitive for identifying an intraabdominal abscess; hence a CT scan is required and is considered the most definitive test to rule out an intra-abdominal abscess. A CT scan can reveal the location, size, and presence of bowel thickening, thumbprinting, and ileus. Intra-abdominal abscess almost always requires intravenous (IV) antibiotics. If the abscess is localized, CT-guided aspiration can be performed to drain the abscess. CT scan has the advantage that it avoids general anesthesia and wound complications. It also prevents contamination of other parts of the abdominal cavity.

In some patients, ultrasound may help identify abdominal abscesses.

Nuclear scans are rarely used today to detect abscesses because the technique is time-consuming and has a high rate of false positives.
