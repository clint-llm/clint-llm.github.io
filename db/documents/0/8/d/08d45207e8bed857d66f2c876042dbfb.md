The diagnosis of reentrant supraventricular tachycardia s usually made in the emergency department based on electrocardiographic features; however, certain points in history may indicate the possible diagnosis. The first step in evaluation for a patient with a reentrant arrhythmia is to obtain a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) during tachycardia (if possible) and compare it with an ECG in sinus rhythm.

An ambulatory ECG monitoring may be considered in symptomatic patients when resting ECG is normal, and there is no electrocardiographic evidence of arrhythmia. The contemporary guidelines recommend echocardiograms in patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter to assess the underlying cardiac structure and function. Thyroid function tests and other targeted investigations are also recommended in selected patients.

The diagnosis of reentrant ventricular tachycardia is made on a 12-lead ECG. A 12-lead ECG in sinus rhythm should be compared with ECG during tachycardia. A 12-lead ECG sinus rhythm should be evaluated for myocardial ischemia or infarction. For patients with exercise-related symptoms, an exercise ECG is recommended to document exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias. For symptomatic patients with undocumented ventricular arrhythmia, an ambulatory ECG is recommended to assess the correlation of symptoms with arrhythmia. While those patients with infrequent symptoms, implantable cardiac monitors may help in the diagnosis.
