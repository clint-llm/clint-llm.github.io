Eales disease is largely reported in Asia, especially the Indian subcontinent. Eales disease is very rarely reported in the western world. It more commonly affects males than females. Males are generally afflicted by the disease at 20-40 years of age.

The pediatric population may also be afflicted by Eales disease, though it is uncommon.
