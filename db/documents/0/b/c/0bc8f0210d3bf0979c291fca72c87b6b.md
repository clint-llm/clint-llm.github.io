Researchers did encounter treprostinil overdose during the trials, which presented with signs and symptoms of vasodilatation such as flushing, hypotension, and headache. It can also result from pump dysfunction, accidental bolus administration, or prescribing the wrong dose. These symptoms are self-limited and will be resolved by temporarily discontinuing the medication or reducing the dosage.
