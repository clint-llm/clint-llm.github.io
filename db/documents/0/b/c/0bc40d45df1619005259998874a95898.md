Macrocytosis is indicated by a high MCV on CBC. This is confirmed by the analysis of a peripheral blood smear. A peripheral blood smear may reveal findings of megaloblastic change, as discussed in the histopathology****section. Target cells may suggest liver disease, although this is not a specific finding.

Additional tests that help determine the etiology of macrocytosis include reticulocyte count, vitamin B12 and folate levels, methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, iron studies, TSH, and free T4 levels, liver and renal function tests. HIV antibody tests may be performed initially. Urinalysis may also be obtained to check for protein.

More specific tests may be undertaken when indicated to confirm a suspected etiology. Schilling test may be performed in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency to assess absorption and evaluate for conditions such as pernicious anemia. Serum protein electrophoresis may be performed if multiple myeloma is suspected based on initial testing.

In cases in which the etiology is undetermined, or if pancytopenia is present, a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy may be indicated to evaluate for aplasia, dysplasia, or malignancy.

Special precautions should be taken in evaluating patients susceptible to iron deficiency or anemia of chronic disease (e.g., those with chronic neoplastic or inflammatory conditions), as these processes may normalize the MCV, masking the pathology that would otherwise be responsible for macrocytosis.
