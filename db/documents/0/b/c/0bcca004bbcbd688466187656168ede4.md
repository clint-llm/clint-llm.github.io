Survival for IRD is generally 5-13 years and maybe until adulthood. Survival for CRD is until the 4th-5th decade. The prognosis is poor in untreated or non-compliant patients. The progressive degeneration of myelinated nerve fibers and the cardiac electro-conduction pathways lead to central and peripheral neuropathic symptoms, cardiac arrhythmias, impaired vision, and hearing loss. Arrhythmias are a frequent cause of death.

A relapse-free period and a good prognosis can be achieved with strict diet control augmented with TPE. Patients who are diagnosed early and are treated promptly have demonstrated that decreasing phytanic acid is always followed by an improvement of ichthyosis and, to some extent, the resolution of neurological manifestations such as cardiac arrhythmias, paraesthesia, loss of muscle tone and ataxia. Hearing and visual loss are not reversible, but the progression gets slowed. Even with complications, as long as patients are compliant with their treatment, comfortable life is expected.
