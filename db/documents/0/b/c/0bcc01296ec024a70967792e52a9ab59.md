**TAVR Preparation**

Heart Team evaluation of any proposed TAVR patient is required. This consists of an interprofessional group including interventional cardiology and cardiac surgery. There must be Heart Team consensus for recommending TAVR over SAVR. The Heart Team must also review all relevant procedural planning aspects including valve sizing and planned vascular access. Preoperative diagnostic studies include echocardiogram (TTE or TEE), coronary artery evaluation with angiography, and TAVR-protocol computed tomography (CT) scanning. These studies help to evaluate the severity of aortic valve disease, anatomy of the aortic valve and root apparatus, size of the annulus and aortic root sinuses, degree of valve calcification, vascular access options including the lower and upper extremities, and functional status of other cardiac structures including ventricular function.

The patient is instructed to continue medications as they would for any other surgical procedure. Antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and clopidogrel may be already part of a patientâ€™s list of drugs, or they may be newly administered before the procedure. Aspirin in a dose of 75 to 300 mg should be delivered before the procedure if there are no contraindications to the use.

**BAV Preparation**

Prior to BAV a TTE is performed to assess the anatomy and severity of the AV disease. The aortic valve area and the mean transaortic valve gradient are noted. A coronary angioplasty is also performed prior to BAV and in the evaluate for and treat for coronary artery disease.
