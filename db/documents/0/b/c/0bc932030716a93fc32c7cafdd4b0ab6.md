Luminal obstruction can cause an increase in pressure within the lumen. The appendix continues to secrete mucosal fluid, leading to distention of the appendix. Organ ischemia, bacterial overgrowth, and eventual perforation follow distention. It is a progressive process in which the patient's symptoms worsen over the course of the illness until perforation occurs.

Beware that the patient may feel temporary relief due to a decrease in intraluminal pressure, but will subsequently become more unwell due to the development of peritonitis.
