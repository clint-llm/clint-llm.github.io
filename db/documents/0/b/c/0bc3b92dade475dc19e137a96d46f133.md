The tilt table test is an additional procedure performed after the initial evaluation of syncopal patients. The initial assessment consists of medical history, physical examination, orthostatic test (blood pressure in the supine position and after 1 to 3 minutes of standing), and a 12-lead electrocardiogram.

The indications for the tilt table test include:

- Recurrent syncope of unknown origin

- Syncope of unknown origin with traumatic injury

- Even one syncopal event of unknown origin without a prodrome

- Suspicion of pseudo syncope or psychogenic syncope

- Jerking movements during the loss of consciousness to differentiate them from epilepsy

- A fall, which may mask syncope.
