Accurate and robust reconstruction of the mandible is necessary to restore many essential functions and improve life quality. A thorough pre-operative evaluation, meticulous intra-operative manipulation, and close post-operative care can restore a patient's ability to chew and swallow, restore a natural facial appearance, relieve pain, and, following, improve patient's confidence and independence in their activities of daily life. Poor reconstruction of the mandible, by contrast, can be devastating and lead to lifelong disability.
