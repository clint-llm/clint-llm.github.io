Hand, foot, and mouth disease can start with a low-grade fever, reduced appetite, and general malaise. The most common hand, foot, and mouth disease presenting symptom is usually mouth or throat pain secondary to the enanthem. The presence of vesicles is surrounded by a thin halo of erythema, eventually rupturing and forming superficial ulcers with a grey-yellow base and erythematous rim. The exanthem can be macular, papular, or vesicular. The lesions are about 2 mm to 6 mm in size, are non-pruritic, and are typically not painful. They last about ten days, tend to rupture, and result in painless and shallow ulcers that do not leave a scar. The exanthem can involve the dorsum of the hand, feet, buttocks, legs, and arms. Oral lesions commonly involve buccal and tongue ulcers but may also involve the soft palate.

HFMD can also present with atypical features like concomitant aseptic meningitis. Enterovirus infections that cause hand, foot, and mouth disease are notorious for involving the central nervous system (CNS) and may cause encephalitis, polio-like syndrome, acute transverse myelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, benign intracranial hypertension, and acute cerebellar ataxia.
