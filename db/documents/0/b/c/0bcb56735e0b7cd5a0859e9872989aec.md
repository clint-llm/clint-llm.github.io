Laboratory evaluation in children suspected of having pneumonia should ideally start with non-invasive, rapid bedside testing including nasopharyngeal swab assays for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus when available and appropriate. This can help minimize unnecessary imaging and antibiotic treatment in children with influenza or bronchiolitis. Children who present with severe disease and appear toxic should have complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, renal/hepatic function testing, and blood cultures performed.

Sputum gram stain and culture are not productive as the samples are often contaminated by oral flora. Blood cultures can be done but are often negative. Today, serology is being used to determine the presence of mycoplasma, legionella, and chlamydia species. PCR is becoming available in most hospitals, but still, the results take 24-48 hours.

There are no clear guidelines for the routine use of chest x-ray in the pediatric population.
