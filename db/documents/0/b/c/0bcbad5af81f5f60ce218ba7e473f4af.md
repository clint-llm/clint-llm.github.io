Exploding head syndrome (EHS) is a benign parasomnia characterized by the perception of a loud sound while asleep, which leads to abrupt awakening. These events occur during the wake-sleep/sleep-wake transition period and generally last less than a second.

EHS was first described in medical literature in 1876 by American neurologist Silas Weir Mitchell. He reported a case study of two patients, who experienced the nocturnal sensation of loud sounds he described as “sensory shocks.”

The phenomenon is often frightening to those who are unaware of its benign nature. Patients may initially fear a more ominous cause is responsible for the sounds, such as a stroke, brain tumor, or brain hemorrhage. These concerns are the reasons many seek medical evaluations. It is an underdiagnosed and under-reported syndrome because patients may feel embarrassed about their symptoms, and healthcare providers may not be familiar with the diagnosis.
