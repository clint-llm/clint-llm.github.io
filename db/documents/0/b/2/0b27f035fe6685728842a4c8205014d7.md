The most significant component of the assessment for a patient who presents with signs and symptoms of sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia is history and physical exam. These should include vital signs (respiratory rate, blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate) and an electrocardiogram. A patient presenting with SANRT should undergo evaluation for any unknown underlying coronary artery disease or heart failure. During an assessment, it should be established whether the patient is hemodynamically stable based mainly on his blood pressure, mental status, and respiratory rate. Initial evaluation of patients with SANRT can include testing to access the patient's thyroid and pulmonary function, together with routine blood work. Since there is a frequent association between SANRT and structural heart disease, part of patients evaluation might also include echocardiography.
