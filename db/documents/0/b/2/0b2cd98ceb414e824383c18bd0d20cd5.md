Nevus anemicus is an uncommon, congenital vascular malformation resulting in hypopigmented cutaneous macules and/or patches that characteristically do not become erythematous in response to trauma, heat, or cold. Nevus anemicus typically presents as an isolated lesion with no other systemic manifestations. Nevus anemicus is attributed to the increased sensitivity of cutaneous blood vessels to catecholamines such as epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). This hypersensitivity results in permanent vasoconstriction leading to hypopigmentation. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of nevus anemicus and addresses the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its evaluation.

**Objectives:**
- Explain when to include nevus anemicus on a differential diagnosis.
- Identify conditions that should be ruled out before the diagnosis of nevus anemicus is made.
- Explain how to rule out conditions that can mimic nevus anemicus.
- Describe the need for a well-integrated, interprofessional team approach to improve care and ensure appropriate evaluation of patients with nevus anemicus.
