There is little data on the safety of an extra dose of MMR vaccine. The administration of an additional dose of a vaccine may occur as sometimes there is a need to provide immunization to a person with uncertain vaccination history or due to a programmatic error (e.g., vaccination error). Out of 5067 reported excess doses of vaccine administered between 2007 and 2017,  three-fourths of cases did not experience an AEFI (Adverse Events Following Immunization). The most commonly reported adverse health events (AHEs) were pyrexia (12.8%), injection site erythema (9.7%), injection site pain (8.9%), and headache (6.6%). The percentage of AHEs among these cases was comparable to all cases submitted to VAERS during the same study period.
