Placenta accreta spectrum is best managed when it has been diagnosed antenatally. Many steps can be undertaken to minimize risks. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has recommended delivery between 34 0/7 – 35 6/7 weeks of gestation via cesarean hysterectomy to optimize neonatal maturity and minimize the risk of maternal bleeding.

Cesarean sections are typically performed in a manner that allows for easy conversion to hysterectomy. This includes dorsal lithotomy positioning and a vertical skin incision. The uterine incision should be made in a manner that would avoid the placenta. After the delivery of the neonate, if the placenta does not deliver spontaneously, the current recommendation is to leave the placenta, close the hysterotomy, and perform a hysterectomy. This approach minimizes the risk of hemorrhage. Often, supracervical hysterectomies are not possible due to bleeding. The surgeon may also need to consider cystotomy to separate the placental tissue.

Close monitoring of hemodynamic status and blood loss should be performed. ACOG recommends monitoring blood loss, hemoglobin, electrolytes, blood gas, and coagulation factors to determine the need for transfusion objectively. Most often, massive transfusion protocols involve a 1 to 1 to 1 ratio of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets. However, patients may also consider autologous donation ahead of the procedure.

After the procedure, ACOG recommends admission to the intensive care unit to closely monitor for signs of bleeding, hypoperfusion, and fluid overload from resuscitation.

In patients with unknown placenta accreta, there are typically two routes of management. First, if the accreta is discovered before hysterotomy, the procedure should be paused until the appropriate help has arrived, blood products have been ordered, and the anesthesia team has been made aware. In the second route, the accreta is discovered when the placenta does not deliver with typical maneuvers. In this scenario, the surgeon should proceed with hysterectomy, as outlined previously. If a hysterectomy is not possible at that facility, then a transfer should be considered. The surgeon will need to pack the abdomen and consider transfusion and tranexamic acid.

For those wishing to preserve future fertility, conservative management or expectant management can also be considered. In conservative management, the placenta or uteroplacental tissue is removed without the removal of the uterus. This route is more successful in patients with small defects, which can easily be surgically removed or over-sewn.

Expectant management is an area of investigation for women wishing to preserve fertility, but have an extensive accreta. This route involves leaving the placenta in situ, with or without adjunctive methotrexate use. In one study, 78 percent of patients were able to avoid hysterectomy.
