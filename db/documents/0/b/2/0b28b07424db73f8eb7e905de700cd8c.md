FHH is usually a benign disorder and patients with FHH, for the most part, do not develop complica­tions from their disorder. The calcium/PTH levels are usually stable over the years. Subtotal parathyroidectomy does not cure the disorder. Educating and reassuring the patient and affected family members about the benign nature of this condition is very important. This communication avoids unnecessary and expensive monitoring and unneces­sary parathyroid exploration in the patient and relatives. Rarely, in a patient with atypical features, such as pancreatitis, total parathyroidec­tomy may be indicated to reduce the risk of further attacks of pancreatitis. The CaSR rep­resents a potentially important therapeutic target for disorders in which the receptor is hypoactive, such as FHH. Calcimimetics and calcilytics (CaSR antagonists) can play a pharmacological role in improving defective calcium sensing in inherited or acquired disorders of the CaSR
