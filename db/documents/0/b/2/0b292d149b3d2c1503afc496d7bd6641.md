Patients on NMDA are usually in the intensive care unit.Â  Monitoring of patients on NMDA includes pulse oximetry for oxygen saturation, continuous end-tidal C02. The rise in the level of carbon dioxide might show the development of malignant hyperthermia.

The assessment of the depth of neuromuscular blockage utilizes the train of four. Typically, the ulnar, median, or facial nerves are stimulated to monitor the effect of neuromuscular blockade. Four electric impulses are delivered at a frequency of around 2 Hertz. The ratio of the fourth to first twitch is used to access the depth of neuromuscular blockade. The disappearance of the fourth twitch signifies about 75% blockage; 85% blockage occurs with the disappearance of the third twitch. If there is 90% blockage, the second twitch disappears, and if there is only the first twitch, this shows close to 100% neuromuscular blockade.

The bispectral index monitor (BIS) is quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) that is used to access the depth of sedation for patients on continuous infusion of NMBA using bi-spectrality and time domain.
