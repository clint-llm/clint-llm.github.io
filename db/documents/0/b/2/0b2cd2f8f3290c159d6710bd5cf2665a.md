PHH is an abnormal protrusion of the viscera through the abnormal opening between the left part of the right and the left crus of the diaphragm as compared to the hiatal hernia which is the abnormal protrusion of the viscera through the normal opening of the right crus.

PHH does not necessarilyÂ need an anti-reflux procedure as a part of repair unless there is a concomitant gastroesophageal reflux disease or a hiatal hernia.

A high index of suspicion is needed for the high-risk group patients, once life-threatening emergencies are excluded, the possibility of DH should be considered.
