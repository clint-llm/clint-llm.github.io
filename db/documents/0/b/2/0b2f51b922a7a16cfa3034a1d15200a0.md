With an average monthly cost of $30, it has also become one of the most widely used anticonvulsants, listed on the World Health Organizationâ€™s List of Essential Medicines. However, with its narrow therapeutic index and its pervasive daily use, considering potential phenytoin overdose or toxicity from chronic use is key to early management and prevention of further toxicity.
