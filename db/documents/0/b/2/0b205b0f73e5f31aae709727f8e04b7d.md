The superior oblique tendon has a transparent and avascular capsule, similar to the capsule, which envelops tendons of the other extraocular muscles. ParksÂ discovered the tendon and Tenon capsule has a sleeve arrangement, which permits movement of the superior oblique through the trochlea in a telescoping manner.

A bursa-like structure between the tendon's vascular sheath and the trochlear saddle was also revealed, and any excess fluid accumulation or deposition in this space can result in limitation of movement through the trochlear tunnel. Helveston et al. hypothesized that this was the cause of the "click" in acquired Brown syndrome.
