The coordination of an interprofessional team of health care providers is critical to ensure optimal health care outcomes for patients who receive therapy with topical permethrin for scabies or pediculosis. Patients with scabies or pediculosis may present to health careÂ providers in various fields, such as primary care, urgent care, emergency medicine, pediatrics, family medicine, internal medicine, or dermatology. School nurses and health professionals may identify a child with pediculosis capitis and facilitate communication with the child's caregivers to start timely treatment.

Treatment outcomes and safety depend on the proper use of topical permethrin.

Other treatment options should be options in areas with local resistance to permethrin.
