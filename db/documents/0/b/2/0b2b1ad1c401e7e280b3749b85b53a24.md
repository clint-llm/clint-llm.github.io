The organism is easy to grow from microbiologic cultures, but appropriate clinical suspicion and good coordination and communication between clinician and laboratory personnel are imperative. This is because of the close mimic of Rhodococcus with Tuberculosis, Nocardia, and some Corynebacteria and the relative ease for the laboratory to initially misdiagnose Rhodococcus as one of these. Suitable culture materials include blood, sputum, pleural fluid, abscess aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, peritoneal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, wounds, lymph nodes, and tissue culture from any suspected affected organ.

Since most patients are immunosuppressed, isolation of a gram-positive coccobacillus or acid-fast organisms from an immunocompromised patient with cavitary lung disease should raise the suspicion for R. equi infection. Blood cultures are positive in over 50% of immunocompromised hosts compared with only 10% of normal hosts.

Radiographic features of lung abscess could resemble those of Nocardia and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but cavitation in tuberculosis are less likely to have air-fluid levels compared to Rhodococcus (See Figure). Also, in patients with AIDS Â and tuberculosis, cavitation is less common.
