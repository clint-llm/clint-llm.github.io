The pre-exam estimated age of gestation should guide bedside ultrasound probe selection.  A low-frequency curvilinear probe for a transabdominal method is nearly as accurate as an endovaginal exam after 6 weeks and is preferred for gestational ages greater than 8 weeks. An endocavitary probe is best utilized at an estimated gestational age of fewer than 12 weeks. As there is some overlap from 8 to 12 weeks in the ability of the probe to detect the appropriate structures, either probe may be used during this time period, and it may be necessary to utilize both probes to adequately visualize the gestational sac yolk sac and embryonic pole.  In this scenario, it is recommended to start with a curvilinear probe and transabdominal exam.  If the operator cannot visualize necessary structures, switch to the endocavitary probe and endovaginal exam.
