The cuboid is one of seven tarsal bones of the foot. The cuboid is located laterally on the distal row of the tarsus and makes up the center of the lateral column of the foot. The bone is a cubical shape with prominence on the plantar surface, also known as the tuberosity of the cuboid. The cuboid provides a groove for the peroneus longus muscle tendon as it reaches to insert in the first metatarsal and medial cuneiform bones. The only muscle to attach to the cuboid is the tibialis posterior.
