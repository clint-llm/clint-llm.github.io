The clinical course of CTX is progressive and potentially debilitating when left untreated. Given the wide variety of clinical manifestations and age of onset, CTX is often under-recognized and, therefore, not diagnosed for several years after clinical symptoms have emerged. Educating the patient, family, and healthcare providers is necessary to improve clinical suspicion and implement the appropriate treatment early in the clinical course. The mode of inheritance is also an essential factor that must be explained to parents.Â An autosomal recessive mode of inheritance requires both parents to be carriers, yielding a 25% chance for the offspring to have two homozygous recessive alleles.
