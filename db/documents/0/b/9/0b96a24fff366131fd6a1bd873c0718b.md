The clearance of blood from vitreous occurs slowly, at the speed of 1% per day, especially in the formed vitreous.

- The diseases which do not cause recurrent bleeding like avulsion of a blood vessel due to posterior vitreous detachment or retina tear, usually have a good prognosis.

- In diabetic retinopathy cases with vitreous hemorrhage, the prognosis is worse. Various studies have been conducted to explore theÂ visual acuity improvement and worsening. In one such study, improvement in vision was noted in 30% cases, 28% remained unchanged, and it worsened in 42% cases.

- In retinal vein occlusions, central retinal vein occlusion has worst, branched retinal vein occlusion has best, and hemiretinal vein occlusion is somewhere in between in terms of prognosis.

- The proliferative sickle cell retinopathy cases have a better prognosis than diabetic retinopathy in terms of recurrent bleeding and vision loss, rarely causing permanent visual loss.

- In Terson syndrome patients, the visual acuity was found to be better than 20/50 in 75% cases at the end of 3 years.

- The prognosis in eyes with vitreous hemorrhage due to age-related macular degeneration is usually bad, with visual acuity rarely better than hand motions.

- The cases with retinal macroaneurysm usually have a good prognosis in terms of visual acuity and rebleed.
