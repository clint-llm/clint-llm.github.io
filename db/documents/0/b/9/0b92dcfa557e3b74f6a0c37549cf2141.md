The emergence of the femtosecond laser has revolutionized the field of laser refractive surgery. Since its creation in 2003, the femtosecond laser has been widely adopted in procedures such as laser in situ keratomileuses (LASIK) and has allowed for the creation of newer refractive surgeries such as femtosecond lenticule extraction (FLEx). FLEx, first performed in 2007, was unique in that it only required the use of a single platform, the femtosecond laser, rather than the two platforms as are necessary for LASIK.

Small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE), a newer laser refractive procedure, avoids flap creation and instead forms a small peripheral corneal incision through which the lenticule gets extracted. By avoiding corneal flap formation, SMILE was hypothesized to improve corneal biomechanical stability compared to LASIK or FLEX due to minimal disruption of the peripheral collagen networks in the anterior stroma that account for approximately 60% of the total corneal tensile strength.
