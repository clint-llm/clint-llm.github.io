The normal pericardium is 1 to 2 mm thick and is comprised of an outer fibrous layer and an inner serous layer (which further subdivides into a visceral layer, or epicardium, and a parietal layer). A potential space that contains approximately 15 to 35 ml of lubrication fluid separates the visceral and parietal layers. The pericardium is a rigid, avascular, fibrous sac and its primary function is minor anchoring, lubrication, preventing distention of cardiac chambers, and optimizing diastolic filling.

Often pericardial calcification is an incidental finding noted during chest or cardiac CT and as such remains asymptomatic. However, signs and symptoms associated with pericardial calcification usually develop secondary to constrictive physiology caused by the rigid pericardium. However, a significant point to keep in mind is that pericardial calcification may not be present in up to 20% of cases of constrictive pericarditis (CP), and it may be present in the absence of constrictive physiology. Interestingly, there have been recent reports of the development of CP after cardiac transplantation, an unusual presentation, as the transplanted heart is believed to be free of any pericardial tissue.
