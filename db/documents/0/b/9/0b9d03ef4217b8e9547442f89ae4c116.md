**Thalassemia**

Thalassemias are disorders caused by reductions or absence of globin chain synthesis. As the globin subunit synthesis is a critical portion of hemoglobin synthesis, the thalassemias are relevant and clinically significant hematologic disorders. Alpha-thalassemia occurs with decreased or absent production of alpha-globin subunits. Beta-thalassemia occurs with reduced or absent production of beta-globin subunits.

Alpha-thalassemia comprises four subtypes based on the severity of the disease. They are all caused by alpha-globin gene deletions that negatively impact alpha-globin subunit synthesis. The difference in a subtype is the number of alpha-globin gene deletions. One gene deletion results in alpha-thalassemia (also known as alpha-thalassemia minima or a silent carrier), which has no significant hematologic consequences. Two gene deletions result in alpha-thalassemia (also known as alpha-thalassemia minor), which causes mild microcytic, hypochromic anemias. Two deletions on the same chromosome 16 (cis deletion) are prevalent in Asian populations, whereas one deletion on each chromosome 16 (trans deletion) is prevalent in African American populations. Three gene deletions result in Hemoglobin H (HbH) disease, which causes moderate to severe microcytic, hypochromic anemia, causing accumulation of beta-globin subunits to combine and form beta tetramers (HbH). HbH is an unstable form of hemoglobin that precipitates and causes damage to erythrocytes as they age. Four gene deletions result in Hemoglobin Bart’s disease (Hb Bart’s), which is incompatible with life. The absence of alpha-globin subunits allows gamma-globin subunits in utero to combine and form gamma tetramers. Hb Bart’s has a high oxygen affinity and does not allow the release of oxygen to body tissues, leading to severe hypoxia of the infant and, ultimately, a lethal condition known as hydrops fetalis.

Beta-thalassemia comprises two major subtypes based on the severity of the disease. Beta-globin gene mutations that negatively impact beta-globin subunit synthesis cause both. Heterozygotes with only one gene mutation have beta-thalassemia minor, which causes diminished production of beta-globin subunits. Although some patients may develop mild microcytic anemia, most are asymptomatic. There is typically no evidence of hemolysis. Homozygotes with two gene mutations have beta-thalassemia major, which causes absent production of beta-globin subunits—the lack of beta-globin results in the accumulation of alpha-globin subunits and alpha tetramers which damage erythrocytes. Ultimately, ineffective erythropoiesis and extravascular hemolysis cause severe microcytic, hypochromic anemia. These patients require chronic blood transfusions.

**Porphyria**

The porphyrias are a group of hereditary or acquired disorders caused by defective heme synthesis. Ineffective enzymes in the heme synthesis pathway result in a buildup of potentially toxic heme precursors. There are nine different porphyrias. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common, and acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is second.

PCT is a chronic hepatic porphyria caused by deficient activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD). The result is the accumulation of porphyrinogens (such as uroporphyrinogen III) within hepatocytes. Clinically, cutaneous photosensitivity and hyperpigmentation are characteristic. The gradual formation of vesicles, bullae, blisters, and sores occurs in sun-exposed areas, especially the hands. Common associations with PCT include excessive alcohol consumption, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

AIP is an acute hepatic porphyria causing deficient activity of porphobilinogen deaminase. The result is the accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites, including ALA and porphobilinogen. Caloric deprivation, medications that induce cytochrome P-450, and hepatic ALA synthase precipitate this disease. Abdominal pain occurs in up to 90% of patients with AIP, making it the hallmark of an acute attack. Patients can also present with nausea, vomiting, constipation, fever, tachycardia, and hypertension. Neurotoxic effects of the metabolite buildup include autonomic instability, peripheral neuropathy, neuropathic pain, and psychological disturbances such as anxiety and hallucinations.

**Sickle Cell Trait and Disease**

The most common abnormal variant of hemoglobin is HbS (sickle cell hemoglobin). HbS results from a substitution of the sixth amino acid in the beta-globin subunits. The genetic mutation results in the replacement of glutamic acid with valine and occurs most frequently in African Americans. Heterozygous individuals have a mutation in only one of the two beta chains, resulting in sickle cell trait. Resistance to falciparum malaria infection and complications are benefits of a sickle cell trait. Homozygous individuals have mutations in both beta chains, resulting in sickle cell disease. When deoxygenated, HbS causes the deformation of erythrocytes from a biconcave disc to a crescent or “sickle” shape. This change in shape causes damage to erythrocyte membranes, premature destruction of erythrocytes, and chronic hemolytic anemia. Sickled erythrocytes can obstruct blood flow and cause tissue hypoxia, which can cause severe ischemic pain or even stroke.  These patients also have functional asplenia and are at risk for infections with encapsulated organisms.
