The annual incidence of hepatic adenomas in oral contraceptive pill users ranges from 30 to 40 cases per million compared to 1 to 1.3 cases per million among nonusers. This risk increases with more than 5 years of use. Thus, in one study, the relative risk for hepatic adenomas for women who used oral contraceptive pills for more than 109 months was calculated as 25 times that of women who used it for less than 12 months. The incidence increased with the advent of the use of oral contraceptive pills. Discontinuation of the pills can lead to spontaneous regression of these tumors, making the case stronger for association with sex hormones. Adenomas can also occur with pregnancy. The ratio of women to men who develop these tumors is 4 to 1. This ratio appears to be changing because of the widespread use of anabolic drugs in sports. Other populations that exhibit this condition include those with glycogen storage disease (GSD) types I and III, iron-overload associated with beta-thalassemia and hemochromatosis, and perhaps those with an endogenous imbalance of sex hormones such as Klinefelter and polycystic ovarian syndromes (PCOS). In these cases, except for PCOS, there is a male predominance, and the diagnosis is made during childhood.
