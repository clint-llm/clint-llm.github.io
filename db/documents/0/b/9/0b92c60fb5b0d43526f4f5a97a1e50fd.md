Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most common valvular abnormalities. Medical management, along with regular surveillance, is the typical recommendation for mild MR. Severe cases have traditionally been treated with invasive surgery. Recently, studies have shown increased utilization of a minimally invasive transcatheter approach for mitral regurgitation repair. The edge-to-edge leaflet repair device is a catheter-based therapy that uses a clip to bring together the leaflets, which lessens the regurgitation. This activity details primary and secondary mitral regurgitation, non-invasive catheter management options and their indications and contraindications, procedural techniques, and complications. This activity highlights the inter-professional team's role in caring for patients with mitral valve regurgitation.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of mitral regurgitation.
- Discuss the indications for percutaneous catheter-based management of mitral regurgitation.
- Describe the technique, echocardiographic guidance, and steps for FDA-approved catheter-based management of mitral regurgitation.
- Discuss the procedural complications from catheter-based management of mitral regurgitation.
