The prevalence data of ATTR-CM is limited and not well characterized.

wATTR-CM is the more common type of ATTR-CM. It is primarily seen in older patients and has a male predominance.

Lower prevalence of wATTR in females may partly be understood by the hypothesized cardioprotective effect of estrogen and possible underdiagnosis due to smaller heart size in females not meeting the screening threshold for ATTR-CM. Compared to wATTR, hATTR is more equally distributed among males and females. However, clinical expression is still more common in males.

TTR gene is present on chromosome 18. hATTR follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. However, disease penetrance is more complicated and less understood. The age of onset of clinical disease in hATTR-CM varies widely and depends on the type of mutation. More than 100 different TTR mutations have been identified. These mutations have varied geographical distribution. The most common mutation in the USA is Val122lle. It is seen in approximately 3 to 4% of African Americans, with 1.5 million carriers. The most common mutation in the rest of the world is Val30Met.
