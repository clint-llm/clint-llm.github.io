For the treatment of hypertensive emergencies, hydralazine should be administered at a dosage of 10 mg via slow IV infusion with a maximum initial dose of 20 mg. This can be repeated every 4-6 hours as needed. Due to its unpredictable response and prolonged duration of action, hydralazine is not a desirable first-line agent for acute treatment.

To treat essential hypertension, hydralazine should be initiated at a dosage of 10 mg orally four times daily for the first 2 to 4 days, then increased to 25 mg four times daily to complete 1 week of treatment. It can then be increased to 50 mg four times daily for maintenance therapy. The oral dosage maximum is 300 mg per day.

For the treatment of Stage C Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF), the recommended fixed initial dose combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate is 37.5 mg hydralazine/20 mg isosorbide dinitrate 3 times daily with a maximum dose of 75 mg hydralazine/40 mg isosorbide dinitrate 3 times daily.
