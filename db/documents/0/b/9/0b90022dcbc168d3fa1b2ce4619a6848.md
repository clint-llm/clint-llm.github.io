Although certain associations have been observed, there is no clearly defined etiology for sarcoidosis. Studies suggest that sarcoidosis may be more common in agricultural workers and firefighters, in those with occupational exposure to insecticides and microbial bioaerosols in mold, and following exposure to Chlamydia pneumoniae.

Cigarette smoking was found to be less commonly associated with sarcoidosis when compared to controls.

For cardiac sarcoidosis specifically, there have been reports of recurrence of cardiac sarcoid following heart-lung transplant and evidence of sarcoidosis in a non-sarcoid recipient of a heart transplant from a donor with sarcoidosis.
