While Ludwig angina is primarily diagnosed based on clinical evaluation, it can initially pose challenges in distinguishing it from other diseases. Imaging may be helpful in this situation to rule out other causes. Imaging evaluation should only be performed after securing the airway or in patients who can breathe comfortably and manage their secretions while in a supine position.
