First trimester bleeding is present in 20% to 25% of pregnancies, half of these women will go on to have a spontaneous abortion. An incomplete abortion is the incomplete expulsion of fetal products. Patients should not delay seeking medical care if they experience bleeding during pregnancy, as this can lead to increased morbidity and mortality.

The most common management is expectant, and women can expect to continue bleeding for 1-2 weeks.Â Obstetric follow-up is very important for a repeat ultrasound and serial beta-hCG levels to ensure all conception products have been expelled completely. It is also important to educate patients that uncomplicated abortions have no impact on future fertility, and ovulation can occur as soon as eight days after the expulsion of fetal tissues.
