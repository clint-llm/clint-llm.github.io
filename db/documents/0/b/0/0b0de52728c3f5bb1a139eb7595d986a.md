Ophthalmologists or optometrists are the first to diagnose conjunctival concretions. The diagnosis requires confirmation with slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The benign nature of the condition should be stressed. The healthcare team consisting of ophthalmologists, optometrist, nurse, and pharmacist should all be aware of the condition, how to diagnose, and the treatment options available for the condition. However, treatment should only be by a trained ophthalmologist.  Not all cases require treatment, just symptomatic cases. Histopathology is usually not necessary. The excellent prognosis should be discussed with the patient.
