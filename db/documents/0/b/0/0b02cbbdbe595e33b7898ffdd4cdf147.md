The collaborative expert consensus of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) and World Heart Federation (WHF) released the fourth universal definition of Myocardial Infarction (MI) in August 2018. Diagnosis of type I MI focuses on the detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac Troponin (cTn) with at least one value above the 99th percentile and with the presence of at least one of the following factors:

- Symptoms of acute MI

- New signs of ischemia on electrocardiogram (ECG)

- The occurrence of pathological Q waves

- New wall motion abnormality or loss of viable myocardium as evident on imaging

- Coronary thrombus identification on angiography

MI can further be classified based on presenting EKG findings and the location of ischemia. The left ventricular lateral wall is supplied by branches of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left circumflex artery (LCx). Lateral and posterior walls together form the left ventricular free wall which is a common site for free-wall rupture (FWR) post-MI. Isolated lateral wall involvement is sporadic and is usually seen as part of multi-territorial infarction such as anterolateral, posterolateral, and inferolateral MI. Occlusion of the obtuse marginal branch of the LCx or diagonal branch of LAD can cause isolated lateral myocardial infarction (LMI).
