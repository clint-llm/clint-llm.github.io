Ocular injuries with a positive Seidel test require multiple healthcare workers and specialties in an interprofessional team approach. Most ocular traumas present to the emergency department, where they will likely first come into contact with nursing staff that will initially evaluate the patient. They may notice the injury and begin to protect the eye by covering it. They may also obtain medications and equipment needed for further patient evaluation.Â  Usually, during triage, they also obtain a visual acuity that is one of the best prognostic indicators once there has been a definitive repair to the defect.

Once triage is complete, the patient will be evaluated and treated by a provider and possibly multiple providers, depending on if they have any other injuries. The entire staff coordinates care to assure the patients get a fast, accurate exam. Once found to have a positive Seidel test, an ophthalmologist will be contacted immediately for definitive repair and continue to follow the patient on an outpatient basis once repaired. A pharmacist will also be involved in care not only during the acute setting but also on an outpatient. Ocular injuries are real emergencies, and it takes a team to ensure the patient receives the best care possible. [Level 5]
