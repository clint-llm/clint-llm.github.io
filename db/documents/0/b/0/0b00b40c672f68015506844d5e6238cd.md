Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that involves the movement of stomach contents into the esophagus or mouth, causing discomfort or complications.

Typically, GERD is diagnosed clinically andÂ treated with a trial of proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Relief of heartburn and regurgitation after a 6 to 8 week trial of PPI therapy is a reliable indicator of GERD. This approach has a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 54%; hence a negative trial does not rule-out GERD.

Ambulatory esophageal pH testing is done with a wireless pH capsule or a traditional pH probe and is the gold standard test for GERD diagnosis.

A newer technique combining multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) testing with pH testing allows for the detailed characterization of the refluxate, including its physical and chemical properties.
