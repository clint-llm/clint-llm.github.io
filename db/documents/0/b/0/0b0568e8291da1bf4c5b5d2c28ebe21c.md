Healthcare workers should be familiar with abulia because it has a varied presentation that may lead to very high morbidity. Both the primary care provider and nurse practitioner should refer these patients to a mental health worker because the management is complex and long-term. The treatment generally depends on the cause, but not all treatments work. For treatments to work, the patient must also be compliant and have a mindset of improvement. Besides medications, cognitive behavior therapy has been used, but relapse rates are high. To date, there is no way to prevent abulia, and the disorder can affect any individual irrespective of age, race, gender, or ethnicity. Neuroscience and rehabilitation nurses work with occupational therapists and physicians to treat these patients. Pharmacists review prescribed medications and educate the patients and their families about side effects and compliance. The interprofessional team can improve outcomes. [Level 5]
