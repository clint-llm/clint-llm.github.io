Imaging in the setting of an acute ulnar collateral ligament injury is typically not helpful. However, plain films can be performed of the thumb to rule out fracture or bony abnormalities, in particular of the thumb base (proximal phalanx). The ulnar collateral ligament inserts along the medial (ulnar) aspect of the proximal phalanx of the thumb. Hence, an avulsion fracture may be present in the setting of ulnar collateral ligament injury.   In the vast majority of cases, however, plain x-ray imaging is normal or unrevealing in these patients.

In the hands of experienced ultrasound providers, this modality can be used at the bedside in real-time to assess laxity at the first metacarpophalangeal joint. Similar to the physical exam, ultrasound imaging can be done on both thumbs to compare one side to another and to establish a baseline on the unaffected side.

Magnetic resonance imaging is difficult to obtain acutely, but this technique has the highest sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of ulnar collateral ligament injury, including tears or ruptures.
