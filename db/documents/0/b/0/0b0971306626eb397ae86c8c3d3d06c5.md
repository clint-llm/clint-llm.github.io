The anterior belly of the digastric is more likely to have anatomical variations than the posterior belly; variations of the anterior belly of the digastric occur in up to 65.8% of the population. Of those reported, it is far more likely to have unilateral than bilateral variants. Many of these variants are accessory muscle bellies with varying origins and insertions. Reports also exist of variations of the nerve supply in which the anterior belly receives innervation from both the facial nerve and mylohyoid nerve.
