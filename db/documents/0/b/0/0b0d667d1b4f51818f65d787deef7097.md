Mildly elevated serum aminotransferases are the primary abnormality in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), although the liver enzymes are normal in the majority of patients. The ratio of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is less than 1. Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), when elevated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), can be a marker of increased mortality. With the progression of the disease hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, thrombocytopenia, and prolonged prothrombin time present due to hepatic synthetic dysfunction.

Ultrasound of the abdomen is routinely used to evaluate fatty liver, but a liver biopsy is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of NAFLD. A non-invasive clinical scoring system called NAFLD in metabolic syndrome (MS) score was developed to predict the development of NAFLD in patients with metabolic syndrome. The clinical predictors included are BMI greater than or equal to 25, AST/ALT greater than or equal to 1, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. The positive likelihood ratio of developing NAFLD is 2.32 (low when the score is less than 3), and the risk is 7.77 (high when the five or more).
