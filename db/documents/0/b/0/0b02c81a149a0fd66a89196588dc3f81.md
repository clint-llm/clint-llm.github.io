There is no known treatment for PPSM; therefore, primary prevention is imperative with medication avoidance or using the lowest effective dose if necessary. The sight-threatening sequelae of PPSM can be treated with common medications already used to address those conditions. For example, patients with cystoid macular edema have been successfully treated with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and anti-VEGF drugs, and patients with choroidal neovascular membranes have been treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF medications.
