Adenovirus infection is most common in the early spring or winter, but it can also occur throughout the year with no distinct seasonality. Susceptibility in children is most often from age 6 months to 2 years of age and can occur as well in 5 to 9-year-old children. Infection can also occur from exogenous sources (e.g., linens, pillows, lockers, guns), reactivation of the previous virus, and exposure to infected persons by inhalation of aerosolized droplets, conjunctival inoculation, fecal-oral spread.

Adenovirus infects military recruits in the United States and other countries as well. Types 3, 4, and 7 leads to pneumonia, acute respiratory diseases in these people.

The incubation period lasts from 2 to 14 days.

Though Adenovirus is resistant to many disinfectants, 95% ethanol solution has been shown to be an active disinfectant. Adenovirus is a widespread cause of upper respiratory tract infections and conjunctivitis. The genome of the Adenovirus within the capsid is highly associated with protein VII--a virus-encoded, histone-like protein. The core protein VII has been associated with the adenovirus genome during the acute phase of infection.
