Fistula-in-ano is not a life-threatening condition but can have a significant impact on a patientâ€™s quality of life. Treatment is focused on the destruction of the fistula tract with the preservation of the sphincter complex. Complications of treatment can be life-altering for a patient and include fecal incontinence, fistula recurrence, and anal stenosis. The risk of recurrence varies between 3% to 57% depending on the anatomic classification of the fistula and treatment modality.
