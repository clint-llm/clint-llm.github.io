Endoscopic surgery of pituitary tumors may require two surgeons or a four-handed technique. One surgeon holds the endoscope to provide an optimal view for the second surgeon to perform the bimanual dissection. An ideal team would include a skilled endoscopic sinus surgeon, who can provide fast and safe access to the sella, and a neurosurgeon who understands the complexities of operating in this region. Though modern-day neurosurgeons are capable of performing endonasal approaches independently, an otolaryngologist can greatly enhance the speed of surgery and provide access in cases with difficult anatomies, such as the deviated nasal septum, nasal polyps, or unpneumatized sella.

Usually, the otolaryngologist exposes the dura over the sella, and then the neurosurgeon opens the dura, followed by removing the tumor. Often, the assistance of a skilled endoscopic sinus surgeon can help tackle cases with extrasellar extensions, such as cavernous sinus and retrocarotid extension, as well as in postoperative management of complications such as nasal synechiae, atrophic rhinitis, etc. Hence, close coordination between the neurosurgeon and otolaryngologist is vital.
