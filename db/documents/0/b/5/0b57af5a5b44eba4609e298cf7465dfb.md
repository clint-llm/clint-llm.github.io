There are numerous physiological variants associated with the superior thoracic artery. The most common variant is when the artery branches off the second part of the axillary via the thoracoacromial artery. One case report of a willed-body donor in India reported a particularly unusual course. In this individual, the superior thoracic originated from the lateral aspect of the first branch of the axillary. It then passed between the two divisions of the lateral cord of the brachial plexus.
