The elbow joint develops in three phases, the homogenous interzone, three-layered interzones, and cavitation. Chondrogenic areas are termed homogenous interzone around six weeks, and cartilaginous development increase via appositional growth. Homogenous zones convert into three-layered interzones at seven weeks. Mesenchymal tissue will condense into a fibrous capsule, and vascular mesenchyme becomes incorporated into the joint as synovial mesenchyme. This synovialÂ mesenchyme will form the synovial tissue as well as the intracapsular ligaments. Cavitation, occurring at eight weeks, is when the articular cavity will form. Cavitation is initially independent of movement, but articular motion is necessary for full differentiation and development of the cavity.

There is a discrepancy when the collateral ligaments are first visible. Studies have demonstrated visualization of the collateral ligaments in as early as 56 days in a 31 mm fetus. Yet other studies mention requiring fetuses of 270mm or larger for visualization of the collateral ligaments. Merida-Velasco et al. found that during week 12, vascular canals became apparent in the humerus, trochlear notch of the ulna, and radial head. It was at this time that the lateral ligaments began to develop into small densities of the outer aspect of the articular capsule.
