Researchers hypothesize that reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome possibly results from transient dysregulation of cerebral vascular tone. However, there is still uncertainty regarding the pathophysiology of RCVS; a common entity found among patients with RCVS is a dysregulation in the control of cerebrovascular tone. In many cases, there is no identifiable cause.

The thinking is that there are sudden changes to vascular tone and diameter due to an evoked central vascular discharge. The cerebral vasculature receives heavy innervation from sensory fibers of both the trigeminal nerve and the dorsal root of C2. Researchers have observed a strong association with female sex hormones and fluctuations.
