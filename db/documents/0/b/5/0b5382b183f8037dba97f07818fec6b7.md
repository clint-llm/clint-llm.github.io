A fascial defect causing a ventral or umbilical hernia must be excluded in patients complaining of diastasis recti symptoms. Sometimes, a fascial defect can be ruled out by a physical exam alone. However, clinicians may choose to perform imaging of the abdomen to definitively rule out hernia if there is any question in the diagnosis. A hernia would have a different set of risks and a different treatment regimen than diastasis recti alone. It should be noted that diastasis recti and hernias can occur concurrently. It is important to identify patients with true abdominal wall hernias as they are at risk for bowel obstruction, ischemia, incarceration, and strangulation.

The overall health of each patient and the risks and benefits of each treatment and/or procedure should be discussed and individualized for each scenario. As surgical treatment of diastasis recti is typically considered an elective procedure, the patient's overall health should be optimized before the procedure.
