The etiology of the ectropion dictates the surgical approach chosen, and the repair is tailored to each specific patient based on preoperative examination. The essential steps for the following will be listed: cicatricial, involutional, medial, and lateral tarsal strip with a medial spindle for ectropion repair with punctal eversion.

**Cicatricial Ectropion Repair**

- Administration of topical anesthetic and local anesthetic

- Corneal shield placement

- Traction sutures placed in the gray or lash line of the eyelid

- Subciliary incision

- Dissection to release scarring until the posterior lamella returns to the normal anatomical position

- Perform tarsal strip for horizontal lid tightening

- Measure or draw a template of the area requiring graft

- Mark and transfer template to the donor site (often postauricular or upper eyelid skin is used)

- Closure of donor site skin incision

- Debridement of the dermis aspect of the graft of any extraneous subcutaneous tissue

- Suture graft into the wound bed

- Close the lateral canthal skin if horizontal lid tightening was performed

- Removal of corneal shield

- Frost suture, if required

**Involutional Ectropion Repair**

- Administration of topical anesthetic and local anesthetic

- Corneal shield placement

- Lateral canthal incision with canthotomy and inferior cantholysis

- Split the anterior and posterior lamella of the lateral lower lid

- Remove the skin, muscle, and conjunctiva to form a tarsal strip

- Retract the lid laterally to the rim to estimate the amount of tarsus required; excise the redundancy

- Anchor the strip to the periosteum of the lateral rim

- Excise any redundant anterior lamellar tissue

- Closure of skin incision

- Removal of corneal shield

**Medial Ectropion Repair**

- Administration of topical anesthetic and local anesthetic

- Corneal shield placement

- Evert the lid margin with traction suture or Bowman probe

- Excise an ellipse of the conjunctiva and lower lid retractor muscles

- Excise a portion of the lateral caruncle if performing caruncular recruitment

- Pass a double-armed suture through the lower lid retractors, then the apex near the punctum, and then the apex inferiorly, finally passing the suture out through the full thickness of the eyelid

- Pass a double-armed suture through the lower lid retractors followed by the medial tendon beneath the caruncle; the second arm is then passed through the apex near the punctum incorporating the tendon and caruncle.

- If performing caruncular recruitment, both suture arms are then passed through the full thickness of the eyelid

- Perform lateral tarsal strip if required

- Tie the sutures to invert the punctum appropriately

- Remove corneal shield

**Lateral Tarsal Strip with Medial Spindle**

- Infiltrate local anesthetic at the lateral canthus, lateral lower eyelid, internal aspect of the lateral orbital rim, and conjunctivae of the inferior medial fornix

- Lateral canthotomy

- Lateral inferior crus cantholysis

- Excise a diamond-shaped area of conjunctiva and lower eyelid retractors below the punctum

- Close the conjunctiva and lower lid retractors

- Determine the length of the strip

- Denude the epithelium

- Split the anterior and posterior lamellae

- Disinsert the lower eyelid retractors and conjunctiva from the strip

- Excise the anterior lamella from the strip to remove lash follicles

- Attach the strip to the periosteum of the inner aspect of the lateral orbital rim

- Reform the sharp angle of the lateral canthus

- Close the skin
