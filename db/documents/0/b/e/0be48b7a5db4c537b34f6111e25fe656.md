Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are administered orally. They should be taken three times a day with the first bite of each meal. The general recommendation is to always start with a lower dose, both to reduce the frequency of adverse effects and to achieve the desired dose for optimal glycemic control. Acarbose should be started at a dose of 25 mg three times daily, titrating thereafter every 4 to 8 weeks, with the maximum dose being 100 mg three times a day. For voglibose, the recommended initial dose is 0.2 mg three times daily, which can be increased up to 0.3 mg three times daily. For miglitol, the initial dose is 25 mg three times daily, and the maximum dose is 100 mg thrice a day.

The safety of AGIs has not been established in pediatric and pregnant patients, warranting caution if their use is indicated in these populations.

The effectiveness of AGIs is affected by the number of complex carbohydrates in the diet. A carbohydrate-rich diet also increases the severity of gastrointestinal side effects.
