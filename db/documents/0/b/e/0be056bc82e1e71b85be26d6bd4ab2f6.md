An ultrasound machine with a transducer is required. Ultrasound gel is required and acts as a medium between skin and transducer and facilitates the passage of ultrasound beam. Linear array or sector transducers of 7.5-MHz or higher frequency are used.

A 5-MHz transducer may be required in term or larger infants. Higher frequency transducers of 10 MHz or more are used to evaluate superficial structures such as the cerebral cortex, superior sagittal sinus, or extra-axial space. Color and spectral Doppler are used to evaluate vascular anatomy, patency of arterial and venous structures, congenital vascular anomalies (such as a vein of Galen), intracranial masses, and evaluation of superficial vessels in cases of enlarged extra-axial fluid spaces.
