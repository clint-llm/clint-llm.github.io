- Medial epicondylitis is often associated with repetitive activities in athletes (throwing, racquet sports, golf, rock climbing, or weight lifting) or occupation responsibilities (carpenters, utility workers, butchers, or caterers).

- Patients generally have pain at the medial elbow that is worse with wrist flexion and pronation.

- Concomitant ulnar nerve symptoms are common.

- Treatment is typically successful with conservative management including a combination of non-opiate medications, physical therapy, bracing, and injections.

- Education on adjustments to sporting or occupational equipment and modifications to technique is key to preventing recurrence of symptoms.
