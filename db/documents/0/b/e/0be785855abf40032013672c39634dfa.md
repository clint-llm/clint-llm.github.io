The differential diagnosis is broad because leukemia is a broad diagnosis with non-specific symptoms. One must rule out infection, drug effects, vitamin/micronutrient deficiencies, and other myelodysplastic disorders that can cause abnormalities in blood cell lines.

Consider the following when seeing abnormalities in the blood count:

- B12 and folate deficiencies

- Copper deficiencies

- Viral infections (e.g., HIV, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus)

- Drugs (chemotherapeutic agents, valproic acid, ganciclovir, mycophenolate mofetil)

- Autoimmune conditions (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus)
