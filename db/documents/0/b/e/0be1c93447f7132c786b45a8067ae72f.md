The decision to apply a wrist splint should involve evaluating the risks versus the benefits on a case by case basis. Some situations may arise that would warrant alternative management, ranging from withholding a splint entirely to immediate surgical fixation. A limited list of these situations may include: significant swelling of the extremity, burns overlying the fracture site that requires frequent dressing changes, underlying medical hardware that require frequent access (i.e., dialysis catheter, PICC line for medications), or open fracture.
