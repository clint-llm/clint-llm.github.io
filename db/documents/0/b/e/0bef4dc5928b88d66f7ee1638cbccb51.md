It is important to note that an obturator hernia is still a rare hernia. In the presence of absolute constipation in an elderly patient, it becomes important to try and elicit whether this could be a small or large bowel obstruction. Small bowel obstruction in this population is commonly due to hernias, adhesions, and tumors, whereas large bowel adhesions are likely due to tumors, hernia, and volvulus. The diagnosis will require a form of cross sectional imaging, commonly a CT scan, after ensuring the patient is appropriately resuscitated.
