The medulla oblongata or simply medulla is the part of the brainstem. The medulla is continuous with the pons rostrally at the pontomedullary junction and the spinal cord caudally at the C1 vertebrae. Medial medullary structures are the pyramid, medial lemniscus, hypoglossal nucleus, and medial longitudinal fasciculus. Medial medullary structures are supplied by the paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery, which is a branch of the vertebral artery. The vertebral artery is the subclavian artery branch. The medial medullary syndrome is also known as Dejerine syndrome, which is caused by an infraction of the medial medulla. In 1915, Joseph Jules Dejerine first described this syndrome.
