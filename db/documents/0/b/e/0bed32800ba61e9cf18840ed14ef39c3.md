The dentures move relative to the underlying bone during their functioning. Most principles of denture construction have been formulated to minimize the off-vertical forces transmitted to the supporting structure, as the toleration of vertical forces is better. The instability has the potential of being traumatic to the supporting tissues. Thus, with complete denture philosophies and techniques, maximum stability and retention appear to be the major objective throughout the clinical procedure. Stability is usually the distinguishing factor between success and failure. Modification on impression surface, occlusal surface, polished surface, and even on the compromised mandibular residual ridge have been devised to improve stability and retention in the mandibular denture.
