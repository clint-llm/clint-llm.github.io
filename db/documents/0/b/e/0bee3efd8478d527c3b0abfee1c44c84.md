Patients should be appropriately educated by the caring physician or the clinical pharmacist before starting long-term digoxin therapy. Such patients are at risk of accidental overdoses and drug-drug interactions. Patients should be instructed not to take a "make-up dose" in case of missing a dose if the next scheduled dose is to be within 12 hours.

Children and their parents should be made aware of the toxic nature of plants such as Nerium oleander and Lily of the Valley.
