Because of its autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, patients with LP should be asked about family members with similar symptoms and consanguinity. Synthesis of family history, clinical exam, and histopathologic findings often raise suspicion for LP, though definitive diagnosis can only be made upon identifying an ECM1 mutation.

An otolaryngologist should evaluate patients to assess airway involvement and identify any degree of obstruction. Similarly, patients with neurologic or neuropsychiatric symptoms merit evaluation and follow-up with a neurologist and psychiatrist. Neuroimaging may become necessary to identify involved brain regions.

Other evaluations will depend on disease manifestations but should include frequent dental, dermatologic, and ophthalmic evaluation.
