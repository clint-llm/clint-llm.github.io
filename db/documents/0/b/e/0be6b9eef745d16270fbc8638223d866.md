Surgical considerations should consider physiologic variants. Because of the variety of anatomic changes that may distort landmarks during hand imaging and surgery, it is important to consider anomalous muscles and nerves.

The creation of muscle flaps, utilizing the intrinsic hand muscles, have been described in the literature to treat carpal tunnel syndrome and other nerve palsies.

Tendon transfers for the treatment of median and ulnar nerve palsies leading to deficits in muscles of the intrinsic hand are a well-covered topic in the literature.
