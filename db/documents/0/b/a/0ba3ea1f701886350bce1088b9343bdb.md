Without an intact tubule for the guidance of neuronal regeneration, aberrant nerve growth into a neuroma is a possible outcome. Any foreign body used for suturing, conduit, or graft has the potential to elicit an immune response with resultant scarring, pain, and failure of nerve regeneration. Allografts are seldom used, but the patient is vulnerable to the dangers of immunosuppression when placed. Autografts may increase morbidity from injury to structures related to the extraction site.

The maximal neural deficit will occur within days following the injury. Should improved nerve function relapse or progressively decline, other atraumatic etiologies should be investigated, such as pseudoaneurysm and hematoma.
