Based on its size and location, the pectoralis significant merits the most frequent consideration of the pectoral muscles in surgical situations, most commonly used as a flap for reconstruction of other systems due to the extensive amount of vascularity leading to reduced incidences of necrosis following the formation of flaps. It has demonstrated effectiveness in maxillofacial defects, transected arteries, skull base defects, as well as pharyngoesophageal abnormalities.

The pectoralis minor is considered a target of interest recently in patients suffering from neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome due to nerve root compression of the brachial plexus running either through the neck or through the interscalene triangle. The symptoms of nerve compression in these patients can occur within the subcoracoid space underneath the pectoralis minor muscle, requiring a pectoralis minor tenotomy. This procedure entails the detachment of the pectoralis minor tendon to relieve the symptoms.

Some surgeons use strips of the serratus anterior muscle for the aesthetic and functional repair of the face.
