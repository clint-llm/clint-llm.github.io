Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disorder of lipid metabolism presenting at birth. It is characterized by very high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels causing premature coronary heart disease. The majority of cases are undiagnosed and suboptimally treated. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are important in preventing premature death. This activity examines when this condition should be considered on differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate for it. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in diagnosing and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiologic factors associated with the development of familial hypercholesterolemia.
- Summarize the evaluation for familial hypercholesterolemia.
- Describe the treatment considerations for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by familial hypercholesterolemia.
