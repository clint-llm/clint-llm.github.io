Most of the patients with emergency room visits for syncope do not have a diagnosis at discharge. Even hospitalized patients leave the hospital with unclear etiology for their syncope. The majority of times the cause is benign but patients need close outpatient follow-up to make sure there is a cause identified and does not recur. This needs close follow-up with a primary care physician and cardiology.
