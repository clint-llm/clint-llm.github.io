The most common and most clinically significant source of variation in the location of hip arteries is with the MFCA and its point of origin. According to Al-Talalwah, in 342 dissected hemipelvis specimens the MFCA arose from the common and deep femoral artery in 39.3% and 57% of cases, respectively. In 2.5% of cases, it originated from the superficial femoral artery and in 0.6% of cases it arose from the LFCA. Due to this variation, it is highly important that surgeons keep in mind all possibilities to avoid iatrogenicÂ injury of the MFCA that can lead to avascular necrosis of the femoral head.
