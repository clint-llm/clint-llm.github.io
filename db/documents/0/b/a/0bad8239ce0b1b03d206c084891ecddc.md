Management of a pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis patient often encounters diagnostic,treatment-related,Â and ethical dilemmas. Close interaction, communication, and coordination between various specialty teams help to deliver the best management to a given patient. Excellent communication skills are a must to appraise the patient, as well as the family, regarding the given complex scenario in a particular patient, which will help them in making decisions about further evaluation &management measures.

A patient who is already having a diagnosed and treated malignancy might present with lymphangitic carcinomatosis features where the attending pulmonologist may have to consider confirming the diagnosis histopathologically by doing a transbronchial lung biopsy. BAL positivity for malignancy may strongly suggest lymphangitic carcinomatosis in the right clinical and radiologic settings though the negative BAL for malignancy can not rule out lymphangitic carcinomatosis. Close coordination and discussions with the radiology team could help to reach a presumptive diagnosis where invasive diagnostic measures are likely to cause more harm in a given unstable patient with poor cardiorespiratory reserve.

Oncology inputs are invaluable in trying certain newer available therapies on a compassionate basis. Palliative care physicians need to be involved to re-ensure that the patients with histopathologically/cytologically proved pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis, and also the presumptively diagnosed patients due to an unstable and unsafe general condition to undergo invasive diagnostic procedures are provided appropriate comfort care. Psychologist or psychiatry help may be required for managing patients and families who are not able to cope with the negative emotional impact associated with the terminal diagnosis. The caregivers need to maintain close communication and empathy towards the patient and family in such a situation.
