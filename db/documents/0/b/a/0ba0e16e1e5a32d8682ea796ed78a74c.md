DifferentiatingÂ CML from other causes of granulocytic leukocytoses, such as infections or drugs, is necessary. Most causes of reactive leukocytosis have a white blood cell count less than 50 x 10/L and show toxic changes such as toxic granulation and Dohle bodies. There will also be an absence of basophilia.

Other myeloproliferative disorders such as chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) and polycythemia vera (PV) may present with leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. Both CNL and PV will lack the BCR- ABL1 fusion gene. CNL is rare and presents with mature segmented neutrophilia and lacks a bimodal leukocytosis with myelocytes.
