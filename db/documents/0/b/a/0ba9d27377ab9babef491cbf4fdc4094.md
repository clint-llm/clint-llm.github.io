**Techniques Helpful During Surgery**

**Soft Shell Technique**

In the soft shell technique, a dispersive viscoelastic is injected in the anterior chamber forming a small clump on the anterior lens surface. Next, a cohesive viscoelastic is injected below the dispersive on the posterior surface, which pushes the dispersive upwards on the back surface of the cornea, thus protecting the endothelial cells. This technique is helpful during phacoemulsification and irrigation aspiration as it protects the corneal endothelium from trauma due to ultrasound energy and excessive fluid turbulence irrigation. The softshell technique is beneficial in Fuch's endothelial dystrophy, congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy, extreme crocodile shagreen cases, and denser cataracts (Brown and Intumescent cataract).

**Ultimate Soft- Shell Technique**

In this technique, a viscoadaptive viscoelastic is first injected in the anterior chamber, and then balance salt solution (BSS) is filled beneath the viscoadaptive viscoelastic. The ultimate softshell technique was introduced to cut down the cost due to the soft shell technique since it employed two different viscoelastics. The viscoelastic in this technique plug the incisional wound, while BSS over the anterior lens surface helps to reduce the resistance while performing surgical maneuvers.

**Tri- Soft Shell Technique**

This technique first injects a dispersive viscoelastic in the anterior chamber above the lens surface. Then a viscoadaptive viscoelastic is injected below the dispersive to float the dispersive to coat and protect the endothelium.
