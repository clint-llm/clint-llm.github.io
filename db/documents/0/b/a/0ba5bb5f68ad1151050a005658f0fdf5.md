Initially, PSS was considered to be a benign disease. However, this disease can result in significant ocular complications. On the list of ocular complications is progression to GON, as discussed in the preceding section. Patients at risk of developing subsequent optic nerve damage, such as patients with a large cup to disc ratio and RNFL damage and focal thinning of NRR (neuroretinal rim), should be treated prophylactically with topical hypotensive and can proceed to filtration surgery if IOP remains uncontrolled with evidence of progressive optic nerve damage.

PSS can also cause non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) and optic atrophy.

Corneal complications can occur in PSS patients. Reduced endothelial cell count has been demonstrated in eyes with CMV-associated PSS.
