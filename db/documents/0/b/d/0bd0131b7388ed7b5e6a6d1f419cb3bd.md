The etiology of dyspareunia encompasses structural, inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, traumatic, hormonal, and psychosocial conditions. Anatomic causes include pelvis floor muscle dysfunction, uterine retroversion, hymenal remnants, and pelvic organ prolapse. Lack of lubrication is most common in reproductive years and is attributable to hormonal as well as sexual arousal disorders. For reproductive-aged females, contraceptives can cause inadequate lubrication. Whereas, the decreased estrogen levels noted in post-menopausal females can cause vaginal atrophy by thinning the vaginal mucosa that is responsible for promoting vaginal secretions. Endometriosis is a condition in which endometrial glands and stroma are present outside the uterus.

The etiology of endometriosis-associated deep dyspareunia could also be due to endometriosis-specific factors or indirect contributors like bladder/pelvic floor dysfunction. In women regardless of the staging of endometriosis, the severity of deep dyspareunia was strongly associated with bladder/pelvic floor tenderness and painful bladder syndrome, independent of endometriosis-specific factors, which suggests the role of myofascial or sensitization pain mechanisms in some women with deep dyspareunia.

Dermatologic diseases such as lichen planus, lichen sclerosis, and psoriasis can cause significant inflammation to the vaginal mucosa as well. Perivaginal and pelvic infections such as urethritis, vaginitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease can result from gonorrhea, chlamydia, candida, trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis, and virals pathogens such as herpes. Postpartum dyspareunia more commonly presents after perineal trauma from delivery than those with an uncomplicated vaginal delivery with intact perineum or unsutured tear.

Vaginismus is a more common condition in younger women and defined as an involuntary contraction of the pelvic floor muscles on attempted vaginal penetration and can be the result of a pelvic floor dysfunction or psychosocial issues such as a history of sexual abuse.
