A volvulus is a twist of the intestine around the axis of its blood supply. In the case of a sigmoid volvulus, the twist occurs in the sigmoid mesentery at its base. Sigmoid volvulus is the most common type of volvulus of the colon. Less common are caecal volvulus and volvulus of the transverse colon. It presents most commonly in patients who are less mobile, bed bound and institutionalized, usually with a background of chronic constipation.
