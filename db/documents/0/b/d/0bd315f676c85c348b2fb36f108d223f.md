Donovanosis, also known as granuloma inguinale, is a bacterial infection of the genital region caused by Klebsiella granulomatis. It is chronic and progressive and causes genital ulcers. The prognosis for uncomplicated donovanosis is good if appropriate treatment is started early, though there is a possibility of relapse. If left untreated, granuloma inguinale can cause significant scarring and tissue destruction. Malignant transformation is also possible. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of granuloma inguinale and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients with this disorder.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of granuloma inguinale.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with granuloma inguinale.
- List the treatment options for granuloma inguinale.
- Employ a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by granuloma inguinale.
