The prognosis of skull base fractures depends on:

- The associated dural tear and CSF leak

- Instability

- Associated injuries

- Initial severity of neurologic and vascular injuries

The majority of CSF leaks resolve spontaneously within 5-10 days but some can persist for months. Meningitis may occur in less than 5% of patients but the risk increases with the duration of the CSF leak.

Conductive hearing loss usually resolves within 7-21 days.
