Cataplexy, a physical feature of narcolepsy, is characterized by transient episodes of voluntary muscle weakness precipitated by intense emotion. Subjective descriptions of cataplexy can assist in the identification of narcolepsy, as this feature is almost unique to the disorder. While one-third of patients present with the classic narcolepsy tetrad (cataplexy, excessive daytime sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis), two-thirds of patients with narcolepsy patients are affected by cataplexy. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in improving care for patients with narcolepsy, by raising awareness of cataplexy.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of cataplexy.
- Summarize the evaluation of cataplexy.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for cataplexy.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by cataplexy.
