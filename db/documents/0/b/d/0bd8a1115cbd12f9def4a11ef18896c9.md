The main action plan to help prevent the occurrence and progression of cystitis cystica is to target, avoid and eradicate the predisposing factors whenever possible.

The most effective way of prevention is regular, long-term prophylaxis, especially in chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections. Renal calculi should be removed to eliminate a source of inflammation and recurrent infections. Bladder stones should be treated promptly to avoid long-standing mechanical irritation.

Patients should be counseled thoroughly to maintain proper compliance and good personal hygiene. Ensure that the patient adheres to the follow-up visits and evaluations to monitor the condition and detect any complications early.

Encourage patients to adhere to the general recommendations for preventing cystitis, such as maintaining good genital hygiene and increasing their daily water intake if it is insufficient.
