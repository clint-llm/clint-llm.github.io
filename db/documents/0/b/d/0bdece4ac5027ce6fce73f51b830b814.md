Depression is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder represented by severe anhedonia (a substantial incapacity to enjoy pleasurable activities), sad mood, feelings of guilt, suicidality, and cognitive impairment. One of the primary risk factors for the development of depressive disorders is chronic stress. The pathophysiology of constant stress results from overactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which results in glucocorticoid cortisol level increase.

Other symptoms of mood disturbances are decreased sleep and appetite. There could be increased (agitation) or decreased psychomotor activity. Increased agitation can be life-threatening as it can lead to muscle breakdown, followed by kidney failure (due to increased creatinine). In severe cases, the patient may develop psychotic symptoms of delusions and hallucinations. Neurocognitive changes with deficits in attention and concentration, recent and remote memory, and executive functions have been detected in cases of mood disorders. These signs and symptoms are due to an interplay of factors such as genetic vulnerability, positive family history, and social support systems.
