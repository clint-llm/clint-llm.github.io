The diagnosis of steatorrhea is usually delayed for months to years due to non-specific or minimal presenting symptoms during the early stages. An interprofessional team approach is often necessary for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. If steatorrhea is suspected clinically, the provider and nurse practitioner should refer the patient to a gastroenterologist for consultation. As numerous conditions could contribute to steatorrhea, a systematic evaluation is required to expedite the diagnosis and to prevent further complications. The team should also include specialty-trained nurses and pharmacists to assist with patient monitoring and education. The involvement of a skilled dietician is indispensable for enhancing the nutritional status and limiting further malnutrition-related adverse outcomes.[Level V]
