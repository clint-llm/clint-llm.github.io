The diagnosis and management of right ventricular infarction are complex and require an interprofessional team that includes a cardiologist, internist, nurse practitioner, radiologist, and intensivist. Most of these patients have risk factors for coronary artery disease, and healthcare workers must emphasize weight control, discontinuing smoking, regular exercise, medication compliance, and lowering blood cholesterol. The short-term prognosis for treated patients is good, but over the long term, the condition carries high morbidity and mortality.
