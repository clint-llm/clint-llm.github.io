The median age of menarche in the United States is 12.5 years. The average female will have around 450 menstrual cycles after that. As clinicians, it is essential to have an understanding of all phases of the menstrual cycle. It is especially important to use this knowledge to educate younger patients on the normal menstrual cycle range as well as the changes they can expect their bodies to go through at various stages of the cycle. By being able to differentiate between a normal and abnormal menstrual cycle early on, the clinician can diagnose and treat any unusual patterns in subsequent cycles such as dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, menorrhagia, infertility, and various others.
