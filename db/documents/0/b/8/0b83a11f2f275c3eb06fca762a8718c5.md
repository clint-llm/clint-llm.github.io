Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for invasive fungal sinusitis in patients who present with congestion, headache, dizziness, swelling of eyes, periorbital cellulitis, vertigo, personality/behavioral changes, as well as recurrent vomiting.

Saprophytic fungal sinusitis is often asymptomatic and could be hard to detect.
