There are reports of cases of acute hepatitis with the use of acarbose; hence, liver function tests (LFTs) require monitoring before and during treatment. If the concentrations of LFTs become abnormal during treatment, the clinician should reduce the dose or discontinue therapy. The monitoring of efficacy involves checking glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb1Ac) and 1- or 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose concentrations.
