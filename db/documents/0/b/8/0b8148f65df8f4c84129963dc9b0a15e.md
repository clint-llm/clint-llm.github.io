Labyrinthitis is an inflammation of the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear and typically presents with vertigo, nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, and/or hearing loss.

**Anatomy**

The inner ear consists of two structures: the bony labyrinth and the membranous labyrinth. The bony labyrinth is a collection of bony cavities within the skull's temporal bone. It has three main parts, the vestibule, cochlea, and three semicircular canals.

All three of these structures contain a substance known as perilymph.
