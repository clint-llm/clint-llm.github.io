Patients with paraproteinemic keratopathy are often asymptomatic; however, many experience photophobia and gradual worsening of vision due to corneal irregularity and opacification. These symptoms progress over several years and are usually bilateral, although they may also be asymmetric or monocular.

Ocular dysfunction may be among the first presenting symptoms of systemic gammopathy or may develop in patients ten or more years after diagnosis. Other findings suspicious of gammopathy include fever, night sweats, weight loss, bone pain, unexplained renal dysfunction, and hypercalcemia.
