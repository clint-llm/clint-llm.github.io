Cricoid pressure is indicated in patients identified as having an elevated risk of aspiration. Common indications for implementing cricoid pressure include patients who have recently eaten, gastroparesis, gravidity, nausea, recently vomited, hiatal hernia, or known incompetent esophageal sphincter(s), increased intraabdominal pressure, inebriation, impaired neurological, and/or upper respiratory reflexes. Cricoid pressure is commonly used in emergency settings as multiple attempts at intubation, emergent situations, and patients of elevated American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) status are more prone to aspiration events.

The most emphasized demographic for the use of cricoid pressure is obstetrical patients.
