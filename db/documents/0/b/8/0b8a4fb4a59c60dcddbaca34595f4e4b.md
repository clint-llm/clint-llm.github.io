In the developing embryo, the upper extremity derives from a collection of structures termed the limb bud that first appears 26 days after fertilization.

Within each of these zones, cartilage precursors accumulate centrally. The radius and ulna develop via endochondral ossification in a proximal to distal manner. Chondrification is first seen in these bones at 36 days of fertilization, with ossification starting from 6 to 8 embryonic weeks.
