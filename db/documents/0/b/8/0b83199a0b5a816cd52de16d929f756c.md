A thorough clinical evaluation of the patient begins in the interventional radiology clinic, but many times has to be performed emergently in the case of bleeding. A baseline laboratory evaluation, including liver function tests, renal function, and coagulation status, needs to be obtained. Underlying coagulation issues should be corrected. In cases of impaired renal function pre-hydration as well as the use of lower osmolality nonionic contrast agents should be used. Pre-procedure cross-sectional imaging is important to document patency of the portal and hepatic veins and  to exclude the presence of tumor along the parenchymal tract.  Large-volume ascites may be drained immediately before the procedure, especially if advanced techniques need to be utilized such as placement of a percutaneous guide wire into the portal vein. The MELD (model for end-stage liver disease) score should be calculated, as it is used as a predictor of post-TIPS mortality. It takes into consideration creatinine, bilirubin, and INR. A score above 18 predicts significantly higher mortality within 3 months of TIPS. Finally, all the risks and benefits of the procedure need to be carefully discussed with the patient, family, and referring physician.
