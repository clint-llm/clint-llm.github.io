Treatment of Alexander disease is centered upon supportive care and utilizing a multidisciplinary team.

- Controlling seizures with anti-seizure drugs

- Improving spasticity and hypertonia with physical therapy and baclofen

- Increasing mobility by utilizing properly fitted equipment such as ankle braces

- Treating obstructive hydrocephalus with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt

- Improving malnutrition with a feeding specialist

- Controlling reflux or vomiting with a proton pump inhibitor

- Treating urinary retention and incontinence with bladder training, catheterization, and various medications

Overall the treatment of Alexander disease remains supportive in nature. Nevertheless, decreasing the expression of the GFAP gene can represent an interesting future therapeutic perspective.
