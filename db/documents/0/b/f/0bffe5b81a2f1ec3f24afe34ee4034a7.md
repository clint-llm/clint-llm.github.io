Pacemakers are implanted in situations when the intrinsic electrical activity of the heart is either dyssynchronous and the patient is having symptomatic episodes resulting from the asynchronous electrical impulse stimulated from the SA node. Different pacemaker types and modes, as mentioned above, are available, and a deep and close monitoring and understanding of these modes and close-loop monitoring by the inter-professional team is of utmost importance in the management of patients with cardiac pacemakers.
