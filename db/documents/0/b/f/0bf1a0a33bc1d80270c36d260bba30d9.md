AV nodal blockers are some of the most commonly prescribed medications; therefore, the development of this adverse reaction must be acknowledged by all healthcare providers on the interprofessional healthcare team. Recognizing that the aging population that is often seen in the Emergency Department is at higher risk of renal failure and medication side effects is extremely important as it leads to clinicians having a higher index of suspicion for uncommon syndromes such as BRASH syndrome. In most cases, the nursing staff will administer the drugs in clinical and inpatient settings, and they must be aware of these limitations and alert the team if they deem anything to be potentially hazardous. Outpatient pharmacists have an important role in reviewing patients' outpatient medications and new prescriptions, avoiding duplicate therapy, and alerting patients to risks of polypharmacy. Early identification and diagnosis by the healthcare team members lead to the development of appropriate management plans that, in turn, affect outcomes.
