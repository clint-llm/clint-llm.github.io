Familial defective apo B is an autosomal dominant disorder that arises due to a mutation in apo B that prevents binding of the defective apo B to the LDL receptor. This condition results in a clinical phenotype similar to classical familial hypercholesterolemia due to mutations in the LDL receptor with increased LDL-cholesterol, xanthomas, and premature ASCVD, underscoring the importance of apoB in atherogenesis. The most frequent variant is apoB-3500, caused by a point mutation resulting in a substitution of glutamine for arginine at position 3500.
