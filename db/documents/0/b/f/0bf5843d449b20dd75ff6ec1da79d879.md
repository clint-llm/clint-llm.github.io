Diagnosis of CMV colitis requires serologic testing and endoscopic biopsies to confirm the diagnosis.

**Serologic Testing**

The CMV IgG test can verify prior exposure to CMV. However, for the diagnosis of CMV colitis, this test has no diagnostic value. CMV IgM testing can verify an acute systemic infection with CMV or an acute systemic reactivation of CMV but does not help diagnose CMV colitis. CMV antigenemia assay may aid in early diagnosis and the prediction of clinical outcomes for CMV colitis but has less sensitivity for such diagnosis.

**Endoscopic Evaluation**

One of the significant endoscopic findings in CMV colitis is the presence of ulcerations with a well-defined, punched-out appearance, which is usually a finding in 70% to 80% of patients.

**Real-time PCR CMV DNA Quantification**

This test may be combined with endoscopy findings to make the diagnosis. However, it was found positive in only 50% of patients with biopsy-proven CMV colitis/enteritis.

**CMV Culture**

This test has high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CMV colitis. It is non-invasive and readily available in clinical practice. However, it takes a long time to obtain the results, which delays the diagnosis and prevents timely treatment in vulnerable patients.
