**Musculoskeletal Variants**

FBM Insertion Variations

While the origin of the FBM is consistent, variations in its insertion exist:

- Type I: One single distal attachment exists, at the lateral aspect of the tuberosity on the base of the 5th metatarsal. This is the most common, with a prevalence of 70%.

- Type II: Two distal attachments exist, one with the main tendon, and one accessory band. The main tendon always inserts on the lateral aspect of the tuberosity on the base of the 5th metatarsal, with variation in the insertion of the accessory band.   

- Type IIa: The accessory band inserts onto the dorsal aspect of the base of the 5th metatarsal. This accessory band inserts onto the same location as the fibularis tertius tendon, but the two structures are separate. 
- Type IIb: The accessory band further splits into a medial and lateral band, with the medial band inserting onto the middle of the 5th metatarsal, and the lateral band inserting onto the dorsal surface of the base of the 5th metatarsal. 
- Type IIc: The accessory band further splits into a medial and lateral band, with the medial band fusing with the fibularis tertius tendon, and the lateral band inserting on the dorsal aspect of the base of the 5th metatarsal. This is the rarest type of FBT insertion variant.

Fibularis Digit Quanti (FDQ)

Originating as a small slip from the FBT, the FDQ is a small muscle with a wide range of reported prevalence, from 15.5% to 59.7%. The FDQ is innervated by the superficial fibular nerve. The FDQ has three different insertions, which are used to classify the muscle variant:

- Type I: the FDQ inserts on the base of the fifth digit proximal phalanx.

- Type II: the FDQ inserts on the extensor aponeurosis of the fifth digit.

- Type III: the FDQ inserts onto one of the extensor digitorum longus tendons.

Fibularis Quartus (FQ)

The FQ is a common accessory muscle in the ankle, with a prevalence of 4.3 to 21.7%. Possible origins of the FQ are the distal FBM (most common) and the distal fibula. The possible insertions of the FQ are the retrofibular trochlea of the calcaneus (most common), the base of the 5th metatarsal, and the cuboid bone. The FQ assists with supporting the lateral edge of the foot during eversion, as well as lateral foot and ankle stabilization. The presence of an FQ can increase a patient’s risk of FBT degeneration through stenosis of the lateral leg compartment, which may cause lateral ankle instability. On the contrary, the FQ can be used to reconstruct a ruptured superior fibular retinaculum. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to be aware of the presence of the FQ, as it may be a cause of chronic lateral ankle instability, as well as be used in surgical reconstruction.

Supernumerary Fibularis Muscle Bellies

Although a very rare occurrence, patients may also have the presence of double fibularis muscle bellies, each with their own tendon. The FLM can have its normal origin, then divide into one large superficial muscle belly, with its normal FLM and FLT structure and insertion. It can also have a smaller deep muscle belly, which became a tendon after 8.6cm, and inserted into the lateral calcaneus directly inferior to the lateral malleolus. The point where the FLM split into two muscle bellies was 22.1cm proximal to the lateral malleolus. Additionally, the FBM originated in its normal location, and split into two muscle bellies, with one being superficial and lateral, and one being deep and medial. The split occurred 8.2cm proximal to the lateral malleolus. The superficial and lateral muscle belly followed the normal anatomy of the FBM and FBL, while the deep and medial muscle belly had a tendinous insertion on the lateral calcaneus, 1.4cm inferior to the lateral malleolus. There was 1.4cm of space between the insertions of the deep muscles of the FLT and FBT on the calcaneus. In conclusion, supernumerary fibularis muscles are an anatomic variant that can be found, and it is important to be aware of their occurrence while performing reconstruction surgeries involving the lateral leg compartment.

**Neural Variants:**

It has been reported that the common fibular nerve may split into the superficial and deep fibular nerve within the popliteal fossa, not by the head of the fibula in the fibular tunnel. While their anatomical splitting is altered, the two branches maintain innervation to their usual structures.

The superficial fibular nerve may not be located in the lateral leg compartment in some patients, but rather, it may be found in the anterior leg compartment in approximately 28% of Indian patients.

The superficial fibular nerve may have variations in where it pierces through the dorsal (crural) fascia and variations in its splitting into the MDN and IDN. There are three variations which have been reported in the literature:

- Type 1: The superficial fibular nerve pierces through the dorsal (crural) fascia then splits into the MDN and IDN. This is the normal splitting pattern.

- Type 2: The superficial fibular nerve bifurcates into the MDN and IDN, and the MDN and IDN individually pierce through the dorsal (crural) fascia.

- Type 3: The superficial fibular nerve pierces through the dorsal (crural) fascia, and courses along the normal MDN pathway, never splitting to form the IDN.
