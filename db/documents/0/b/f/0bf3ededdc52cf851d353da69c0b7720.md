Bone is a specialized connective tissue consisting of cells and a mineralized extracellular matrix, that is continuously being remodeled through a dynamic process to maintain structural integrity and shape.

Bone is a very complex and changeable organ, capable of influencing other organic structures and vice versa, as well as the immune system and systemic metabolic balance; the bone is influenced by multiple stimulations, internal (pressure, hydration, metabolism) and external (hormones, growth factors, mechanical pressures). The osteoblast can secrete several molecules in paracrine mode. For example, osteoblast-derived VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) can improve bone repair or during the bone development process.
