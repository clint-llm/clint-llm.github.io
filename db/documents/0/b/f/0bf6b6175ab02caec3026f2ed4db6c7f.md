The nurses should monitor the patient carefully and frequently to assess pain and sedation levels every one to two hours for the first 24-48 hours because the patient is at the highest risk of hypoventilation and nocturnal hypoxemia during this time. Other routine opioid medications ordered for the patient should be avoided when the patient is using an opioid PCA. Nurses should assess for comfort using standard numeric or behavior scales and evaluate the number of demands the patient has made for medication. Based on the patient's requirements, the dose of the PCA can be adjusted.
