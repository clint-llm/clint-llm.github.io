The cardiac action potential comprises a depolarization, a plateau/refractory, and rapid repolarization phases. The repolarization phase is seen on the ECG as the QTc interval. It is associated with an increase in potassium permeability, which moves potassium out of the cardiac cell. This repolarizing potassium current, the delayed outward rectifier current, has a rapidly activating component and a slowly activating component.KCNQ1 and KCNE1 genes encode the alpha and beta subunits of the slowly activating components resulting in a slower movement of potassium outside the cell, which prolongs the QTc interval.
