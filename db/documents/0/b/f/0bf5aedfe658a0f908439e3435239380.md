Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the most important tools in the care of patients with epilepsy. EEG plays a significant role in the diagnostician of seizures and psychogenic non-epileptic spells. One of the most important aspects of interpreting EEGs is distinguishing between pathologic activity and similar-appearing normal physiologic findings. Various terminologies are used, such as: "normal variants," "benign variants," "pseudo-epileptiform patterns," or "epileptiform patterns without proven relation to seizures." This activity reviews the benign epileptiform variants in an electroencephalogram (EEG) and highlights the need for identifying these benign variants in the treatment of patients with episodes of altered awareness. The activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in recognizing this diagnosis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify benign sporadic sleep spikes (BSSS), wicket spikes or wicket rhythms, and 6 Hz spike and wave discharges ("phantom" spike-wave) and their characteristics.
- Review 14 and 6 Hz positive spikes and their characteristics.
- Describe rhythmic mid-temporal theta of drowsiness (RMTDs) and their characteristics.
- Outline the role of the interprofessional team in recognizing benign EEG variants.
