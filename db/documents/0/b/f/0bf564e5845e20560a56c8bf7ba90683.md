The diagnosis and management of insufficient sleep benefits from a multidisciplinary approach. Primary care clinicians may play an essential role in screening patients with insufficient sleep and providing these patients with adequate resources to follow sleep hygiene principles.

Since insufficient sleep may present symptoms such as fatigue and mood changes, psychiatrists and neurologists are integral to the multidisciplinary approach. They may help in screening and triaging these patients when indicated. Sleep medicine clinicians are pivotal in ensuring other underlying conditions are appropriately ruled out. Psychologists with expertise in behavioral sleep can educate these patients on the importance of adequate sleep and hygiene principles.

AN interprofessional healthcare team can also enhance the management of sleep insufficiency. Nursing can provide patient counsel, assist in performing exams, take an accurate patient history, and coordinate activities between various clinical participants. Pharmacists can provide valuable counsel if pharmaceutical agents may be affecting the patient's condition. All members of the interprofessional/multidisciplinary team must document their patient interventions and interactions in the patient's medical record so that all team members operate from the same accurate, up-to-date information base.
