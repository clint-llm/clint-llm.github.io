The evaluation of LDs begins with the exclusion of both organic and functional differential diagnoses. Once other disorders are ruled out, the health care provider is encouraged to follow diagnostic guidelines set out by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Evaluation should synthesize the developmental, medical, familial, and educational histories of the patient.

As per the DSM-5:

- LDs are a type of neurodevelopmental disorder that impedes normal ability to learn and perform academically

- Learning Disorders are specified into three major academic domains

- 1. Reading
- 2. Writing
- 3. Mathematics

- Criterion A: Difficulties processing instruction and applying skills as demonstrated by at least one of the following symptoms for at least 6 months

- disturbance of reading
- disturbance of comprehension
- disturbance of spelling
- disturbance of written expression
- disturbance of number sense
- disturbance of mathematical reasoning

- Criterion B: Academic skill is substantially lower than expected when compared to standard, resulting in significant dysfunction

- Criterion C: Difficulties onset during school-age years

- Criterion D: Aberrations are not better explained by any neurological, developmental, motor, or sensory (hearing or vision) disorder.

In addition, comprehensive neuropsychological testing can further guide the clinician towards the correct diagnosis. Commonly administered tests include: Woodcock-Johnson-III and Wide Range Achievement Test to evaluate academic achievement; the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale-II to assess adaptive behavior; the Conners Rating Scale, ADHD Rating Scale-IV (formerly DuPaul scale) and NICHQ Vanderbilt Parent and Teacher Assessment Scales to evaluate for attention and hyperactive disorders; the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children—Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) for evaluation of general cognition; the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) for assessment of general behavior; the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (4th Ed.)
