Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a rare disease characterized by an accumulation of a lipoproteinaceous material within the alveoli. It can be idiopathic or secondary. This activity highlights the pathophysiology, histopathology, and clinical presentation of alveolar proteinosis and outlines the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of alveolar proteinosis.
- Explain the microscopic features of alveolar proteinosis.
- Outline the diagnostic modalities available for alveolar proteinosis.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by alveolar proteinosis.
