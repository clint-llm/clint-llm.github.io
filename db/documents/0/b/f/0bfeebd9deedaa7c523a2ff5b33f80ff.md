The patients with BSS frequently suffer from bleeding complications due to the nature of the disease. Other complications include:

- Transmission of bloodborne pathogens - although the risk is minimal due to extensive screening of blood products. Still, bacterial transmission can occur due to platelets being stored at a higher temperature.

- Development of autoantibodies due to repeated blood transfusions.

- Iron deficiency anemia, especially in women who suffer from menorrhagia- results in constant fatigue and loss of work hours.

- Transmission of antibodies across the placentaÂ may lead to fetal/neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia.
