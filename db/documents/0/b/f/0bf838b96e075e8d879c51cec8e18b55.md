The evaluation and management of patients with a potential crotalid envenomation require an interprofessional team of at the very least nursing, emergency physician, and regional poison center. Depending on the severity of envenomation, this team may also include a hospitalist, intensivist, surgeon, and/or other medical or surgical subspecialties depending on the complications of each case. Nursing staff plays a vital role in communicating changes in the patients’ status with the treating physician. Patients suffering from envenomation require frequent reassessments and vital sign checks to monitor for disease progression. A pharmacist with board certification in applied toxicology can provide direction on antivenom dosing, preparation, and administration. They will also be the first to note any potential side effects from antivenom administration. Prompt communication with the regional poison control center, especially for patients with signs of significant envenomation, is crucial for optimal management. Proper communication between all members of the interprofessional treatment team is vital to ensure patients receive the best evidence-based management and obtain the best outcome possible. [Level 5]
