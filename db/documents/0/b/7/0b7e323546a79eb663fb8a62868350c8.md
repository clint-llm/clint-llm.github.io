Families should be educated on the etiology of urachal anomalies. If diagnosed in infancy, the potential for other urinary defects (like posterior urethral valves) and the need for further workup should be discussed. The families of infantsÂ brought in for evaluation of umbilical wetness should be reassured that this likely represents self-limiting umbilical granulation tissue. In children with a clear diagnosis of a patent urachus, previously infected urachal cyst, or symptomatic urachal polyp or diverticulum, surgical resection and the expected recovery should be thoroughly reviewed. In children with incidentally discovered urachal anomalies for whom conservative management is being considered, the rare potential for the future development of cancer should be made clear.
