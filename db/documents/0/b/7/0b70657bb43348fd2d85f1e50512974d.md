Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the vagina accounts for 90% of all patients with primary vaginal cancer, followed by adenocarcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, melanoma, sarcoma, and lymphoma of the vagina.

Invasive vaginal cancer shares many risk factors with cervical cancer, such as tobacco use, younger age at first intercourse, HPV infection, and multiple sexual partners.

The incidence of vaginal cancer arising primarily from the vagina increases with age, with approximately 50% of patients presenting over the age of 70 years and 20% over 80 years.

Vaginal melanomas most likely originate from mucosal melanocytes and most commonly present as vaginal bleeding in White women with a mean age of 60 years.

Verrucous carcinoma is a low-grade malignant variant of SCC and presents as a large warty-appearing mass. This variant can be aggressive locally but is rarely metastatic.

While other sarcomas can arise in the vagina, the most common is embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) or sarcoma botryoides, a rare subtype of ERMS. These occur in infants and young children, clinically appearing as soft nodular lesions.
