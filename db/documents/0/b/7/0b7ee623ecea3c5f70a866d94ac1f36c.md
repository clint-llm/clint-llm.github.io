The differential diagnosis for anagen effluvium includes other nonscarring alopecias such as telogen effluvium, trichotillomania, and androgenetic alopecia. These entities can be distinguished by history, hair pull test, and trichoscopy. A thorough review of systems should be completed to exclude other causes of hair loss such as nutritional deficiencies, metabolic and endocrine disorders, and infections.
