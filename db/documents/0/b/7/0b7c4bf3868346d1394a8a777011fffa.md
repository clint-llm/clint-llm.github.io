Histology of the pedunculated skin lesion will reveal the presence of mild hyperkeratotic epidermis, containing blood vessels of various sizes in the dermal stroma. Acrochordons are usually also identified by their flattened, acanthotic, presentation, or will have a 'flowery' pattern like epithelium. The dermal layer usually has loosely arranged collagen fibersÂ along with lymphatic vessels and dilated capillaries. Appendages are generally not seen in the classic lesion.
