Given the non-specific signs and symptoms, workup involves obtaining imaging, including computed tomography (CT) scan or ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis. These tumors often appear as bilateral ovarian masses and usually appear solid but can also be cystic. Pre-operative level for serum CA-125 can be elevated and decreases after tumor resection. These levels can be used for:

- Follow-up of patients after surgery to document complete resection as levels will decline

- Follow-up of patients is also necessary to diagnose metastatic spread to ovaries in patients with a history of other cancers (e.g., gastrointestinal, breast). The presence of a unilateral ovarian mass with an increased CA125 should alert one of a Krukenberg situation where there is a need to exclude colorectal cancer during the workup.

- To predict the prognosis of patients with Krukenburg tumors, one study showed that levels greater than 75 U/ml were associated with decreased 5-year survival than patients with lower levels.
