Causes of portal hypertension:

- Prehepatic: Portal vein obstruction (EHPVO) or massive splenomegaly with increased splenic vein blood flow

- Posthepatic: Severe right-sided heart failure, constrictive pericarditis, and hepatic vein obstruction (Budd-Chiari syndrome)

- Intrahepatic: Cirrhosis accounts for most cases of portal hypertension.

Less frequent causes are schistosomiasis, massive fatty change, diseases affecting portal microcirculation as nodular regenerative hyperplasia and diffuse fibrosing granulomatous disease as sarcoidosis.

Other rare causes of portal hypertension include:

- Wilson disease

- Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency

- Primary biliary cirrhosis

- Tuberculosis

- Constrictive pericarditis
