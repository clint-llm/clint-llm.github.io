Pentobarbital is not used widely in clinical medicine because of its poor safety, habituation, and lack of an antidote. All clinicians who prescribe should be aware of its toxicity and side effect profile.

Withdrawal from pentobarbital can be life-threatening. Managing pentobarbital withdrawal requires a well-trained interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including nurses, pharmacists, and several physicians from different specialties. Without proper management, the morbidity and mortality from unrecognized pentobarbital withdrawal are high. Properly treating pentobarbital withdrawal begins the moment a health care provider recognizes the patient is either susceptible to or suffering from withdrawal. The moment that withdrawal is suspected, the interprofessional team must coordinate the care for the patient, including:

- Obtaining a thorough history and physical

- Ordering drug levels in the blood and or urine, appropriate labs, imaging in the emergency department

- Monitor the patient for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression, cardiovascular collapse, central nervous system dysfunction, renal or hepatic toxicity

- Preparing to provide airway protection and vasopressor support if indicated

- Consult with the pharmacist about possible drug interactions if the patient is taking other medications

- Consult with a toxicologist

- Consult with the intensivist about ICU care and monitoring while in the hospital

- Consider long-term management with social work to provide outpatient follow-up.

To avoid the high potential for morbidity and mortality associated with pentobarbital, the pharmacist should recommend prescribing clinicians safer alternative agents. Nursing should monitor the patient at subsequent visits, verifying medication compliance and treatment effectiveness. With an interprofessional team approach, the morbidity of pentobarbital is reducible and clinical success optimized. [Level 5]
