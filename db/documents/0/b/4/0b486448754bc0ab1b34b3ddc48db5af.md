The name osteopetrosis is derived from the Greek language. ‘Osteo’ means bone, and ‘petrosis,’ meaning stone. Therefore, the disease is often referred to colloquially as “marble bone disease.” The disease was originally described by a radiologist in Germany, Dr. Albers-Schonberg, in 1904.

The name osteopetrosis encompasses a group of hereditary metabolic bone diseases, all of which detrimentally affect bone growth and remodeling leading to generalized osteosclerosis and the potential of pathologic fractures, pancytopenia, and even cranial neuropathies and hepatosplenomegaly in severe cases.

Four disease forms are known. The malignant autosomal recessive form, not named malignant due to any relation to oncology but rather due to the degree of condition severity, is very severe and often leads to mortality in early childhood.
