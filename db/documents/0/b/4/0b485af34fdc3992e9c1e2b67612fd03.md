In almost all case reports of amantadine keratopathy, the patient describes a sudden onset of painless, bilateral blurring of vision with progressive worsening in the following months. Many patients have a visual acuity of 20/200 or worse at the time of presentation to an ophthalmologist. This history in patients with no past ocular disease, and negative family history of ocular disease, should prompt an extensive workup of medical history and medication exposure. If a patient is taking amantadine, the duration and dosage of treatment should be determined to stratify the patient's risk of amantadine keratopathy. It is important to consider undiagnosed ocular pathologies that may be contributing to visual loss, as amantadine keratopathy is a very rare diagnosis with a nonspecific presentation.

In a patient with vision loss taking amantadine, possible comorbid ocular pathologies should be ruled out by extensive slit lamp examination of the anterior segment, retina, and optic nerve. Slit-lamp examination of the cornea shows diffuse stromal edema with Descemet's folds and absent guttae. Microcystic epithelial edema and loosened epithelia have also been described.
