In clinical practice, angiomyolipomas appear as either fat-rich, fat-poor, or fat-invisible masses.

CT scanning is generally used first, often for unrelated reasons, and may be sufficient. If not, an MRI will be more sensitive in identifying fat-poor angiomyolipomas.

The cornerstone for identifying renal angiomyolipoma is diagnostic imaging. A  biopsy is not generally required to diagnose an angiomyolipoma but might be needed to exclude malignancy in difficult or complex cases such as fat-invisible renal mass lesions. Several imaging modalities help diagnose this condition as described below:

**Ultrasonography:**Hyperechoic lesion associated with a posterior acoustic shadowing is the typical feature of a fat-rich angiomyolipoma.

The lesion's echogenicity directly correlates with the total fat content.

Unfortunately, about a third of renal cell carcinomas can demonstrate a similar appearance on ultrasound.

The combination of tumor size with ultrasonic image-based quantitative textural analysis improves the ability of ultrasonography to differentiate hyperechoic renal cell carcinomas from angiomyolipomas with a higher degree of accuracy.

A CT or MRI is suggested if the ultrasound shows significant growth (>2.5 mm/year) or a potentially serious change. (It is helpful to repeat the same imaging modality used to make the original diagnosis so the comparison can be more precise.) For these reasons, a baseline ultrasound is suggested for newly diagnosed angiomyolipomas if not already obtained. The combination of tumor size with ultrasound image-based quantitative textural analysis improves the ability of ultrasonography to differentiate hyperechoic renal cell carcinomas from angiomyolipomas with a higher degree of accuracy.

**Computed Tomography:**The presence of a region of interest on CT scanning that contains attenuations of –10 Hounsfield Units or less is considered a dependable and reliable sign of fatty tissue, which is easily seen in most fat-rich angiomyolipomas.

For this reason, proper placement of the region of interest (ROI) is essential to detect the fatty tissue component of suspicious renal masses. This is because the attenuation values will be higher if the ROI is placed on the muscular or vascular component than if placed on fatty tissue.

Fat-poor angiomyolipomas appear heterogeneously hyperattenuating or iso-attenuating. Fat-invisible angiomyolipomas appear homogenously hyperattenuating because there is insufficient adipose tissue to show any decreased density. In these cases, an MRI is usually the next recommended step. In selected cases, a contrast-enhanced CT scan may be indicated if there is a high suspicion of active bleeding, as it is necessary to find tortuous blood vessels prone to hemorrhage before a therapeutic embolization can be performed.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging:**There is little difference in accuracy between MRI and CT scans for detecting most renal angiomyolipoma although MRI is considered superior in fat-poor lesions.

In one study of 98 pathologically confirmed fat-poor angiomyolipomas, 23% were identifiable on MRI but not CT scan.

Fat-rich angiomyolipomas show T1-hypointensity (dark) with fat suppression and T1-hyperintensity (bright) without fat suppression. It is important to note that this T1-hyperintensity is also present in other conditions like renal cell carcinomas and hemorrhagic cysts so it is not a specific, definitive, diagnostic manifestation of angiomyolipomas.

The main difficulty is to diagnose the fat-invisible mass, which contains too little fat to manifest the hypointensity on the fat-suppressed images required for making the diagnosis.

The application of MRI artifacts had been proposed for improved evaluation of the fat content in renal tumors. One of these is the India ink artifact which makes a black line at the boundary between fat and water. Applying this type of artifact helps diagnose small tumors and fat-poor angiomyolipomas—phase versus opposed phase chemical shift MRI assists in differentiating fat-poor angiomyolipomas and renal cell carcinomas. T2-weighted images are also beneficial for diagnosing renal angiomyolipomas.

Fat-rich angiomyolipomas are usually hyperintense while fat-poor angiomyolipomas manifest as heterogeneous or homogeneously hypointense in comparison to renal tissues.

Gadolinium contrast is generally not needed for diagnosis but can help identify internal aneurysms and determine general vascularity. Overall sensitivity and specificity of MRI for diagnosing fat-poor angiomyolipomas have been reported as 83% and 90%, respectively.

**Percutaneous Biopsy:**Percutaneous renal biopsies are mainly indicated to differentiate malignant renal lesions from benign masses.

The purpose of a percutaneous renal biopsy is mainly to identify benign lesions that would not require aggressive treatment in those rare equivocal cases where imaging modalities alone are unable to make a definitive diagnosis.

**A percutaneous renal biopsy is typically only used to differentiate a renal cell carcinoma from a fat-invisible or low-fat angiomyolipoma if both MRI and CT scan images are inconclusive or indecisive.**

Although this imaging presentation is unusual for a renal cell carcinoma, both lesions may look identical.

A percutaneous renal biopsy may be necessary to differentiate between the papillary subtype of renal cell carcinoma and fat-invisible angiomyolipomas if the lesion is small (considered as less than 3 cm) and appears T2-hypointense on MRI without any evidence of fat inside the tumor.

The risk of significant bleeding following a percutaneous biopsy in fat-invisible angiomyolipomas is no greater than for other renal masses.

**Renal nuclear scanning**utilizing technetium-99m (Tc) mercaptoacetythiglycine (MAG3) renography is not generally used in the routine evaluation of angiomyolipomas and other renal masses. It evaluates relative renal function, which can be helpful before nephron-sparing surgery. It may also be useful in differentiating renal masses and pseudomasses in cases where other imaging modalities are ambiguous.

**Evaluation Summary:**

- Ultrasonography can be useful for the initial detection of a renal mass or for tracking but is not reliable enough for an initial diagnosis.

- CT scanning is generally used first in the initial evaluation of renal masses, usually for unrelated reasons, and is often sufficient for diagnosis.

- CT scans also have the advantages of wider availability, lower cost, easier access, and can be performed quickly.

- An MRI will be more sensitive in identifying fat-poor angiomyolipomas if the CT scan is inconclusive.

- For fat-invisible lesions, no imaging study will suffice, and a definitive diagnosis will require either a percutaneous biopsy or direct surgical intervention.

- If any of these means cannot determine a reliable diagnosis, the mass lesion should be treated as a renal malignancy.
