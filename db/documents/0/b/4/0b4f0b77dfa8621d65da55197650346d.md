The location of the venous thrombus in the mesenteric circulation and the existence of any collateral circulation are important factors in predicting bowel ischemia and intestinal infarction. Various underlying risk factors influence the location of the thrombus. Thrombosis can originate in different locations, such as the vena rectae or other major veins, and can arise from prothrombotic states, vessel wall injury, and venous stasis. Patients with mesenteric venous thrombosis that involve small, more distal venous branches tend to be at a higher risk for developing bowel infarction. Therefore, mesenteric venous thrombosis should be suspected when patients with previous thrombotic episodes or coagulopathy present with acute abdominal symptoms.

For unknown reasons, the superior mesenteric vein is more often involved than the inferior mesenteric vein. Inferior mesenteric thrombosis accounts for up to 11% of mesenteric venous thrombosis cases.
