The overall prevalence of SAS ranges from 21-59% in the general population and patients with cardiac disease, respectively.

In North America, the prevalence of OSA is between 15 and 30 percent in males and 10 to 15 percent in females.

The prevalence of OSA also appears to be increasing, which is thought to be related to a combination of increasing rates of obesity as well as increased diagnosis and detection. In a study by Peppard et al., it was estimated that the prevalence of OSA increased from 11 to 14 percent from 1990 to 2010 among adult American males.
