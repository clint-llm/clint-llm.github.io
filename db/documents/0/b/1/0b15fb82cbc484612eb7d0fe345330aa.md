Histological evaluation of mucormycosis is the mainstay of diagnosis. Diagnosis occurs through observing non-septate or minimally septated broad, ribbon-like hyphae (10 to 20 micrometers) invading blood vessels.Â The microscopic examination should evaluate morphology, width, branching angle, and septation. Even aspergillus can be potentially pathologic in these patients. Cultures should be sent from tissue biopsy specimens for completeness, but the slow-growing nature of such fungi in culture will often preclude these tests from being clinically useful, as the patient may expire from the infection long before the cultures have yielded answers.

As such, histopathology allows the differentiation of mucormycosis from aspergillosis. Biopsy techniques will vary depending on the anatomic location. The paranasal sinuses are the most common location, and biopsy can be performed directly or endoscopically. Other locations (lungs, gastrointestinal tract, etc.) may require more invasive endoscopic procedures to obtain tissue for histology, though interventional radiologic techniques can be helpful also. Notably, the absence of hyphae should not dissuade one from the diagnosis when the presence of risk factors and the clinical findings suggest this infection, and treatment may be guided by clinical parameters even if only yeast forms are observed on histology.
