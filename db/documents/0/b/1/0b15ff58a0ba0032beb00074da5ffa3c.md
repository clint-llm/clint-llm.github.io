In an experimental study evaluating mixed anaerobic infection, including Bacteroides and Fusobacterium species, acute inflammatory processes were noted in tissue samples occurring within hours postinfection. By 48 hours after infection, both acute and chronic inflammatory cells infiltrate the liver parenchyma. In 2 to 6 weeks after inoculation, Large intrahepatic abscesses were present.

Experimental anaerobic maxillary sinusitis was induced in rabbits by inoculatingÂ Bacteroides fragilis in the nasal ostium. Moderate or severe inflammation appeared in all infected sinuses. The characteristic features were ciliary damage, desquamation, hyperplasia, and metaplasia of the epithelium.
