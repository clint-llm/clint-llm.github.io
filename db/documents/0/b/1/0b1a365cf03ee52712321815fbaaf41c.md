Complete surgical resection is the factor that most correlates with thymoma prognosis.

Of germ cell tumors, teratomas carry the best prognosis, as most of them are benign. Seminomas and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors have a poorer prognosis and have 5-year survival rates of 86% and 48%, respectively.Â  Persistently elevated tumor-markers (AFP and beta-hCG) after chemotherapy is associated with worse outcomes.

Stage I and II Hodgkin disease patients have a favorable prognosis, with greater than 90% cure rates with standard treatment. Stage IIIA and IIIB have cure rates of 60% to 70%. Stage IV disease carries the worst prognosis, with a cure rate of 50% to 60%. [C] Poor prognostic factors for Hodgkin lymphoma include the following at diagnosis: male gender, age greater than 45 years, serum albumin less than 4 g/dL, hemoglobin less than 10.5 g/dL, and white blood cell count greater than or equal to 15000 cells/microliter, and lymphocyte count of less than 600 cells/microliter.
