Whipple disease is a progressively debilitating disease if it gets undiagnosed and untreated. Complications from untreated Whipple disease are mainly due to nutritional deficiencies as it interferes with the absorption process of the small intestine. Few disseminated cases of Whipple disease sepsis have also been reported. Irreversible brain damage and potential death can also occur.
