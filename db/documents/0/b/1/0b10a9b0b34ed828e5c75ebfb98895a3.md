Chlamydia trachomatis is part of the chlamydophila genus. These bacteria are gram-negative, anaerobic, intracellular obligates that replicate within eukaryotic cells. C. trachomatis differentiates into 18 serovars (serologically variant strains) based on monoclonal antibody-based typing assays. These serovars correlate with multiple medical conditions as follows

- **Serovars A, B, Ba, and C:**Trachoma is a serious ocular illness that is endemic in Africa and Asia. It is characterized by chronic conjunctivitis and has the potential to cause blindness

- **Serovars D-K:**Genital tract infections, neonatal infections

- **Serovars L1-L3:**Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), which correlates with genital ulcer disease in tropical countries.
