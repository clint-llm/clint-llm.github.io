An issue of concern that is to be noted about ERAS protocols is the increasing complexity. For example, for colorectal surgery, 16 elements comprise the ERAS guidelines. Having this many components in these pathways leads to difficulty implementing these protocols, and there is room for error as components may be missed or forgotten. In addition, it is also difficult to distinguish which component of ERAS protocol is producing a positive impact on the enhanced recovery of patients. For example, while having laparoscopic surgery may lead to quicker recovery times than open surgery, choosing minimally invasive surgery in addition to using lower amounts of volatile agents, thereby reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting synergistically, allows for a more quick recovery from surgery. This can be further proven by studies that have demonstrated that complying with the ERAS protocol has been shown to have better postoperative outcomes indicating that components of ERAS pathways are most successful when implemented together.
