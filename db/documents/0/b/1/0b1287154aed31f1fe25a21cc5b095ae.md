Patients with a history of chronic NSAID/analgesic use can be asymptomatic usually and are generally picked up on routine investigations. This situation can pose a challenge, as there are seldom any gross abnormal manifestations or symptoms. The first abnormality noted will be seen on urinalysis. Sterile pyuria, microscopic or gross hematuria, and proteinuria may be present. Deranged urine concentrating capacity, irregularities in acidifying the urine, and abnormal sodium conservation may be seen.

Some cases can have progression to chronic kidney disease and eventually end-stage renal disease, acknowledging no gross symptomatic aberration. Most patients are diagnosed when presented with unusual laboratory parameters on a routine check or when being investigated for some other associated co-morbidity. Patients with established changes of chronic kidney disease can have clinical symptoms of anemia, fatigue, hypertension, headaches, or gastrointestinal manifestations of chronic NSAIDs or analgesic use.

A small proportion of patients can present with renal colic and associated hematuria. Patients with analgesic nephropathy are at an increased risk of urinary bladder malignancies, such as transitional cell carcinoma of the uroepithelium. Women often present with an increased prevalence of urinary tract infections, which, if left untreated, can increase the possibility of deteriorating kidney function and end-stage renal disease.
