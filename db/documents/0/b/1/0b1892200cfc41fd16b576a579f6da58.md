Based on treatment, tracheal bronchus has good outcomes. There are no numerical figures available to compare the outcomes of a patient who underwent surgical treatment for tracheal bronchus. However, there was a case series of children that reported positive outcomes at 2 to 10 years, which was strictly observational. A pediatric case who underwent right upper lobectomy ended up on tracheostomy with a resultant decrease in frequency.

Only two cases of thoracoscopic upper lobe lobectomy/segmentectomy in adults have appeared in the literature for tracheal bronchus performed with the uneventful course.
