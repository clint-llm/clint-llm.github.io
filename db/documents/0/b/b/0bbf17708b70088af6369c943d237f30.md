An indication for splinting exists after evaluating a patient if there are findings suggestive of an underlying joint, ligamentous, or bony injury. These injuries consist of sprains, subluxations, dislocations, and fracture-dislocations, to name a few. The severity of the injury does play a role in determining whether or not to splint and by which manner; however, it is not the only determining factor. By splinting these individuals prior to transportation, it will hopefully prevent further movement into the joint barrier, which can cause worsening pain or further complications during transportation by EMS to the ED. One special population to keep in mind is individuals with multisystem trauma. By splinting early in the process after initial resuscitation, the team can ensure that these injuries are stabilized, assist in pain management, and may aid in avoiding overlooking these injuries once the patient arrives at the ED. The decision to splint should be made early on after the initial history and examination are completed.
