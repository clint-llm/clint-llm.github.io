Amaurosis fugax is a result of an occlusion or stenosis of the internal carotid artery circulation. Thromboembolism originating from the carotid circulation, as well as hypoperfusion caused by the stenosis of this circulation, are the underlying mechanisms. The ocular ischemic syndrome results from chronic hypoperfusion due to unilateral or bilateral carotid artery occlusion.
