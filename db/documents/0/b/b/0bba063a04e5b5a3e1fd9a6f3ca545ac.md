Patients with auricular hematomas can generally be managed as outpatients. Consultation and/or referral to otolaryngology or plastic surgery is recommended. Patients are instructed to take antibiotics if prescribed, pain medications as prescribed and follow-up as directed. The patient should limit physical activity for 10 to 14 days and avoid contact sports for 1 to 2 weeks. If a splint is used, this will need to be removed in 5 to 7 days. Antibiotics can be given while the splint is in place.
