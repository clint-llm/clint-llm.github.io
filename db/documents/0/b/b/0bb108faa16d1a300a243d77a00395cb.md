Toxic megacolon is a medical emergency that demands urgent attention. Failure to recognize the disorder is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Thus, optimal disorder management is best by an interprofessional team. Assistance from a radiologist is vital to make the diagnosis. These patients need ICU care with close monitoring. Nurses should be aware of the potential complications of the disorder and communicate with the surgeon if the patient has signs of peritonitis. Aggressive hydration, replacement of electrolytes, and antibiotics are essential. The pharmacist should check the patient's medication record to ensure that they are on no medications that cause ileus and is on appropriate antibiotics. While most patients do recover with medical therapy, some may require surgery.

The surgical group should be involved early in the process in case initial therapy fails and surgery is unavoidable. High risk of colon perforation and abdominal compartment syndrome are situations where surgery is necessary to avoid further complications.
