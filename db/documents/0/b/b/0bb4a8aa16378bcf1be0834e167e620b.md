Once the five samples are collected, they are then centrifuged to separate the samples with PV being the top layer and the RCV being at the base. Two separate 1 mL samples of plasma are then taken from each of the five samples and placed into the machine. This report is based on the proprietary machine that uses the indicator dilution technique to calculate the plasma volume. Then the hematocrit is used to estimate the red cell volume and the total blood volume.

Over the next 20Â to 40 minutes, the machine will calculate and then display the counts for the baseline, standard, and duplicated plasma samples as well as replicated hematocrit measurements.
