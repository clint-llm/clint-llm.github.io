The treatment regimen for neonatal sepsis varies based on various risk factors and conditions. The typical antibiotics used are discussed above. The duration of therapy can vary based on the isolated organisms, type of the infection, the presence of any neonatal complications. Neonates with positive blood cultures typically respond to treatment within 24 to 48 hours, and repeat cultures and studies are usually negative by 72 hours

The treatment for suspect EOS with negative cultures is also variable. Cultures can be negative for various reasons, including maternal antibiotic use, initiation of antibiotics prior to obtaining cultures, or false-negative tests. Determining adequate antibiotic therapy without any positive cultures can make the determining duration of therapy difficult. Most neonates with highly suspected clinical sepsis with negative culture will receive 7-10 days of antimicrobial therapy
