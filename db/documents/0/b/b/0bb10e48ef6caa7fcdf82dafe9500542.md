Patients and their families should be offered counseling, education, support, and guidance since the moment of diagnosis. As part of the holistic approach to the management of patients diagnosed with BWS, providers must facilitate contact information for BWS support groups and resources, including the entries on Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome at the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), the Beckwith-Wiedemann Children’s Foundation International (BWCFI), among others.
