It is also recommended to obtain ultrasound and MRI with contrast imaging to exclude other underlying causes such as lipoma, fibrosarcoma, or cyst. Ultrasound can show the depth and size of nodules. Nodules will appear isoechoic on ultrasound with a heterogeneous appearance. Hyperechoic septa may also be present. No flow is present when Doppler is used with ultrasound. MRI can also be obtained for surgical planning for excision of the plantar fibromas and can also identify the extent of the plantar contractures. Nodules appear well defined on MRI with signal intensity low on T1 images and low to moderate on T2 images.
