Otitis externa is a clinical diagnosis; therefore, a complete history and physical examination are required. Physical examination should include evaluation of the auricle, assessment of surrounding skin and lymph nodes, and pneumatic otoscopy. Otoscopy will reveal an erythematous and edematous ear canal with associated debris (yellow, white, or gray). In some cases, the tympanic membrane is erythematous or partially visualized due to edema of the external auditory canal. Concomitant otitis media is suspected when there is evidence of an air-fluid level along the tympanic membrane (middle ear effusion).

Its clinical presentation may vary depending on the stage or severity of the disease. Initially, patients with OE will complain of pruritus and ear pain that is usually worse with manipulation of the tragus, pinna, or both. Ear pain is often disproportionate to physical exam findings, and it is due to irritation of the highly sensitive periosteum underneath the thin dermis of the bony ear canal. It can also present with otorrhea, fullness sensation, and hearing loss.

Systemic symptoms such as fever greater than 101 F (38.3 C) and malaise suggest extension beyond the external ear canal.

Otitis externa can be classified by severity as follows:

- Mild: pruritus, mild discomfort, and ear canal edema

- Moderate: ear canal is partially occluded

- Severe: The external ear canal is completely occluded from edema. There is usually intense pain, lymphadenopathy, and fever.
