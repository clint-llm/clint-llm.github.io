The teres major comprises the inferior border of the quadrangular space. Within this space are the axillary nerve and posterior humeral circumflex artery.

Although teres major is not one of the four rotator cuff muscles, it is often used in musculotendinous transfer for rotator cuff deficits. This procedure can place the radial nerve, the axillary nerve, and their branches at risk.

Isolated teres major tears are rare; they sometimes occur during sports with overhead activities like baseball, swimming, water-skiing, and tennis.
