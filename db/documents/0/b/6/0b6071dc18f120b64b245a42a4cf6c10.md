Suprascapular nerve injury has recently gained popularity as a leading cause of shoulder pain and weakness. The course of the nerve through narrow osseoligamentous structures renders it susceptible to compressional and traction injuries at the suprascapular and spinoglenoid notches. Knowledge of the anatomy of the nerve is necessary to diagnose and provide the best clinical outcomes in cases of suprascapular nerve injury.
