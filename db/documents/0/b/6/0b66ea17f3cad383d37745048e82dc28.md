Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is one of the most common fatty acid ÃŸ-oxidation disorders. It is an autosomal recessive disorder that has a good prognosis if management is started early. If not managed correctly, a metabolic crisis may result. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of MCAD deficiency and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency.
- Identify common presenting symptoms of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency.
- Outline the management of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency.
- Summarize the importance of communication and coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients with medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency.
