There are not specific characterized stages of benign breast disease used as a standard method of diagnosis; however, fibrocystic type breast disease can be proliferative or non-proliferative types.

Non-proliferative types are not associated with unexpected cell growth. Common non-proliferative lesions would include:-

- Periductal fibrosis

- Nonsclerosing adenosis

- Cysts

- Epithelial-related calcifications

- Mild epithelial hyperplasia

- Papillary apocrine changes.

Non-proliferative lesions are the most common finding in breast cancer screening biopsies, seen in 70% of all cases.

Proliferative changes include factors such as Intraductal hyperplasia, sclerosing adenosis, radial scars, and papillomas.
