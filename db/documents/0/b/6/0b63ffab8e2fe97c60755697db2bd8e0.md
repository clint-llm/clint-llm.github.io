In 2016, the American Association of Poison Control Centers reported over 6300 exposures to chlorine, making it the most common inhalational irritant in the United States. About 35% of exposures to chlorine gas were attributed to the mixing of household acid with hypochlorite.

In addition to household exposure, there have been multiple episodes of incidents involving chlorine gas release. One of the worst was a 2007 collision of a railroad tanker carrying chlorine with another train causing rupture of the tank and release of 90 tons of chlorine gas into the surrounding area. Exposure to chlorine gas at the site of the accident resulted in 9 fatalities and 520 visits to local emergency departments in Graniteville, South Carolina.

Chlorine gas is also the most frequent cause of major toxic release incidents internationally. Because of its widespread industrial use, chlorine gas has substantial potential for accidental release.

Besides household and industrial accidental exposures, chlorine gas has also been used as an agent of war. Germany used chlorine gas in World War I as a chemical weapon. More recently, in 2007, insurgents in Iraq executed multiple attacks by outfitting chlorine tankers with explosives and detonating them in multiple locations, causing hundreds of civilian casualties.
