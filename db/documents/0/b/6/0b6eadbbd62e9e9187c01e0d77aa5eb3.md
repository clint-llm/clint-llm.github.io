**Newborn Screening**

Within the United States, there exists a list of disorders that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommends that states screen each newborn for, titled the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP). Most of these tests are diagnosed using filter paper and a few drops of blood from the newborn's heel. The optimal time to screen for these disorders is between 36 and 72 hours of life.
