Chronic pain affects more than 100 million people in the United States, with an economic burden of over $600 billion. Opioids are commonly used in the treatment of chronic pain. The United States is currently in the midst of an opioid epidemic with increased opioid use over the last two decades. This activity reviews the role of interprofessional care in managing patients with chronic pain while outlining alternative non-opioid pain treatment options. Such treatments include medications, physical therapy, exercise, injections, and neuromodulation. A biopsychosocial model has been discussed for designing an individualized multimodal treatment plan.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the burden of chronic pain and the ongoing opioid epidemic.
- Summarize the biopsychosocial model for the management of chronic pain.
- Explain the alternative non-opioid treatment options for pain.
- Review of literature for discussed non-opioid pain treatment modalities.
