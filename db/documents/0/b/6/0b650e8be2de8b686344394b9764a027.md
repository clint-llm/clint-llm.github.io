ASC-US is not a clinical diagnosis. A woman receiving an ASC-US report from Pap test is most often asymptomatic and is most likely identified through a population-based screening. Alternatively, she may present with bloody, offensive, and or watery vaginal discharge, lower backache, or signs of urinary tract infection and be diagnosed opportunistically.

Considering that a late diagnosis or advanced invasive cervical cancer has no remedy, it is important to consider the risk factors that predispose women to develop this cancer and use that as a guide to determine the screening status of women in their care.
