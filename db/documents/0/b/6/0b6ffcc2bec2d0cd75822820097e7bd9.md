Complications are attributable to the pathology itself and the treatment administered.Â Some of them are as follows:

- Infection

- Pyocele

- Haematocele

- Atrophy of testes

- Infertility (resulting from the spermatogenesis halt due to increased pressure on the blood supply on the testis from edema)

- Rupture

- Hernia of hydrocele (rare)
