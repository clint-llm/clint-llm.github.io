# Introduction

The sphenopalatine artery (SPA) is a well-known vessel to otolaryngologists, deemed the artery of epistaxis. Epistaxis is among the most common ear, nose, and throat related emergency, and roughly 60% of the population will experience epistaxis sometime during their life.

# Structure and Function

The sphenopalatine artery is a terminal branch of the internal maxillary artery originating from the external carotid artery system.

The SPA branches into two major vessels, the septal artery and posterior lateral nasal artery, before exiting the sphenopalatine foramen.

The sphenopalatine artery and its branches form an anastomotic region within the nasal cavity. Kiesselbach's plexus (Little's area) is the arterial anastomosis found in the anterior nasal septum formed by terminal branches of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the external carotid artery (ECA). The Kiesselbach's plexus is formed by the anterior and posterior ethmoidal artery (branches of the ICA) and ECA branches such as the superior labial artery, greater palatine artery, and the posterior septal branch of the SPA.

# Embryology

During developmental weeks four and five, the aortic sac gives rise to the aortic (pharyngeal) arches. The maxillary artery develops from the mesoderm of the first aortic arch and subsequently gives rise to the sphenopalatine artery.

# Nerves

The maxillary nerve (CN V2) is the second branch of the trigeminal nerve and runs close to the maxillary artery. It courses from the middle cranial fossa into the pterygopalatine fossa via the foramen rotundum.

The pterygopalatine ganglion is located deep within the pterygopalatine fossa near the sphenopalatine foramen.

# Physiologic Variants

The sphenopalatine artery anatomy has been studied extensively by numerous researchers. Ninety-seven percent of these cadaveric studies have demonstrated at least two arterial branches at the plane of the sphenopalatine foramen.

The individual arrangement of the arterial branches is highly variable with distributions superior or inferior to the ethmoidal spine, crisscrossing upon exiting the foramen, and demonstrating asymmetry between nasal cavities within the same cadaver. However, the ethmoidal crest serves as a consistent landmark that can help navigate within the nasal cavity, regardless of any variation seen in the SPA or its branches.

# Surgical Considerations

**Sphenopalatine Artery Ligation**

Surgical management of epistaxis is typically only for those patients whose bleeding is refractory to more conservative therapies. Knowledge of the vascular anatomy and surrounding landmarks is necessary to avoid surgical failure and lower the risk of postoperative bleeding.

**Nasoseptal Flap**

A nasoseptal flap is a surgical technique used in skull base reconstruction following anterior skull base tumor removal, transsphenoidal approaches for pituitary adenoma resections, and repairing sella and clival cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leaks.

# Clinical Significance

**Posterior Epistaxis**

The sphenopalatine artery carries the most significant volume of blood to the nose and is the source of most posteriorly based nose bleeds.

**Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma**

Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is an uncommon benign tumor that originates in the lateral wall close to the sphenopalatine foramen. This tumor predominantly affects adolescent males and is locally aggressive, often invading the surrounding structures and tissues. JNA commonly presents with painless, progressive unilateral nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and rhinorrhea. JNA has a rich vascular supply primarily from the sphenopalatine artery. Macroscopically the tumor appears as a rounded circumscribed non-encapsulated mucosa covered mass. Microscopically the tumor shows haphazardly arranged collagen with an irregular vascular pattern. Because of the rich vascular supply, the embolization of the sphenopalatine artery and surgical resection of the tumor provides a good prognosis if JNA is diagnosed early enough.
