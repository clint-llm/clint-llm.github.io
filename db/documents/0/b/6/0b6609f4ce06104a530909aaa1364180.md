Female breast development in the fetus begins in the fourth week of gestation. By 16 weeks, the smooth muscle of the nipple and areola are present, and the epithelial cells develop into mammary buds. These will branch out into alveoli and ducts, which will create the mammary system. The mammary gland continues to develop throughout childhood until puberty, when there isÂ a rapid proliferation of ducts and alveoli. The hormones that influence each menstrual cycle also increase the proliferation and growth of the mammary tissue.
