There is potential for increased morbidity and mortality in patients with ventilator-induced lung injury. The multiorgan failure secondary to biotrauma might be a major contributor to mortality,Â though higher tidal volumes per se are also proved to increase the mortality. There is a theoretical potential for long term respiratory disability, recurrent pulmonary infections, and cor-pulmonale in the survivors with extensively injured lungs.
