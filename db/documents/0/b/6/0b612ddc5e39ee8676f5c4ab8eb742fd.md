Translation

Protein synthesis is initiated by GTP, which causes ribosomal units to assemble and begin the elongation process, which turns the primary transcript into the amino acid sequence forming the fundamental structure of a protein. Eukaryotic ribosomal subunits are the 40s and 60s, whereas prokaryotic ribosomal subunits are 30s and 50s. The eukaryotic ribosomal subunit is the 80s. The prokaryotic ribosomal subunit is the 70s. The s does not represent the size of the subunits, so, therefore, one must not assume that the total for a subunit complex is the sum of the two individual subunits. The ”s” represents the sedimentation coefficient at which each protein exhibits when subjected to centrifugation. The process of elongation is how the primary structure of a protein is made, which is also known as translocation. A tRNA binds to a specific position termed the site. The TRNA then translocates to the pea site, where it delivers the amino acid to the end of a growing polypeptide chain. Finally, the tRNA moves to the e-site, where it will exit.
