**Antenatal Management**

Once the diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia is confirmed, it is recommended to have close monitoring to check fetal well-being. In cases of moderate to severe CDH, selective centers in the U.S. are offering fetal therapy for eligible patients. In this therapy, the fetal trachea is occluded by an inflated balloon under endoscopic visualization around 26 to 30 weeks gestation. This results in the accumulation of the lung fluid and subsequent stretch and growth of the lung. Tracheal occlusion has been shown to affect surfactant production by decreasing the number of type 2 pneumocytes. Hence, the balloon is retrieved around 33 to 34 weeks gestation to allow for some surfactant production. There is an increased risk of preterm delivery associated with this therapy, but studies have shown a better survival rate in the fetal surgery group compared to the control group.

**Postnatal Management**

The delivery of infants with CDH is not recommended before the completion of 37 weeks gestation. In a study by Hutcheon et al., it was noted that the mortality of infants with CDH delivered at 40 weeks was significantly lesser than those delivered at 37 weeks.

**Delivery Room Management**

In cases of prenatally diagnosed CDH, it is recommended to place a nasogastric tube soon after delivery for decompression of the stomach and intestines. If the infant has respiratory distress, avoidance of bag-mask ventilation, and prompt intubation should be performed. The rest of the delivery room management should be in accordance with the current neonatal resuscitation program (NRP) guidelines. An emerging area of research is the delivery room management of these infants with an intact umbilical cord, assuming that this will allow the better cardiopulmonary transition. Small pilot studies have shown that resuscitation in CDH infants with an intact cord is safe and feasible.

**Ventilator Management**

Avoidance of ventilator-induced lung injury with gentle ventilation strategies is the cornerstone of respiratory management in infants with CDH. Maintaining the preductal saturations in the 85%-95% range with a peak inspiratory pressure < 25 cm H2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 3-5 cm H2O, and targeting PCO2 in the 45-60 mmHg range is a reasonable strategy to mitigate lung injury. High-frequency ventilation should be considered if adequate ventilation/oxygenation cannot be achieved using a conventional ventilator. In a multicenter randomized trial (VICI trial) comparing conventional mechanical ventilation to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation as the initial mode in infants with CDH, it was shown that the infants in the conventional mechanical ventilation group had shorter ventilation time and lesser need for ECMO. Still, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of BPD/death between the groups.

**Management of PH**

The abnormal remodeled pulmonary vasculature in infants with CDH contributes to the development of PH. PH is suspected based on clinical findings of hypoxemia, cyanosis, differential cyanosis with preductal oxygen saturations higher than postductal saturations if there is right to left shunting across the PDA. It is recommended to obtain an echocardiogram on suspicion of PH or within 48 hours to assess the pulmonary vascular pressures. Typical findings on echocardiogram in PH include right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonic and tricuspid valve regurgitation, and bidirectional or right-to-left ductal shunting. Management of PH includes optimization of ventilatory settings to target adequate ventilation and oxygenation, maintaining systemic arterial blood pressures in the normal range with the use of vasopressors if needed, and the use of pulmonary vasodilators to increase pulmonary blood flow as needed.

Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), which is a selective pulmonary vasodilator, is the first line of choice in the medical management of PH in infants > 34 weeks gestation. Despite the NINOS trial not demonstrating a reduced need for ECMO/Death with the use of iNO in infants with CDH, iNO continues to be used in the management of PH in CDH.

**Surgical Treatment**

CDH was treated for many years as an emergent surgical diagnosis, but mortality rates were high secondary to PH.

The surgical approach to CDH has historically been through a subcostal abdominal incision. Minimally invasive surgery has become increasingly popular over time, and many CDH repairs in stable children are now done thoracoscopically.
