Acute porphyrias are a group of rare disorders characterized by an enzymatic defect in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Patients present with acute, debilitating, and at times life-threatening symptoms that may be precipitated by medications, hormonal changes, starvation, or other factors. This activity covers the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of acute porphyria and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for the patient with the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe how a patient with an acute porphyria might present.
- Explain how to evaluate a patient with a suspected acute porphyria.
- Identify a simple, qualitative bedside test that can be used to identify porphobilinogen.
- Explain why an interprofessional team that provides an integrated approach to the care of a patient with acute porphyria can help to achieve the best possible outcomes.
