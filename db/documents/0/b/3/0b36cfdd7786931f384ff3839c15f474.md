Lobectomy complications incidence depends on etiology, patient diagnosis, and resected lobe.

The main postoperative lobectomy complications are prolonged air leak (15% to 18%), subcutaneous emphysema, pneumonia/mucus plugging/atelectasis (6%), pleural empyema (1% to 3%), persistent space (9.5%) atrial fibrillation (33%), right middle lobe torsion (0.09 to 0.4%), hemorrhage (2.9%), chylothorax (0.7% to 2%), phrenic nerve injury and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, wound infection, tumor embolization (less than 1%) and very rarely bronchopleural fistula.
