Patients should be educated on treatment for an acute groin strain. This includes adequate protection, rest, ice, compression, and elevation known as PRICE therapy. Patients should be advised to avoid physical activity and sport that may be harmful and delay recovery.

Physical therapy should be directed at strength, the range of motion, and stretching of the affected muscle group. Return to play and activity should be guided by symptom recovery as well as clinician and therapist guidance. Returning players to activity too soon can result in recurrent or chronic injuries and be detrimental to their future careers.
