Lip implants represent a lasting, low-risk option for augmenting the lips with high satisfaction rates; however, the patient undergoing lip implantation should be aware of the potential associated risks, which include

- Malposition (7 to 10%): The most common complication of lip implantation is malposition, which is likely due to uneven tunneling in the submucosal plane or asymmetry in placement.

- Extrusion (less than 1%): extrusion of an implant may occur if severe asymmetry and wound breakdown occur. This extrusion is avoidable by using the correct size implant, maintaining proper dissection planes, maintaining a small/narrow submucosal pocket, and using sound suture technique to close the commissure incisions. Instructing the patient to avoid heavy manipulation of the implanted area (e.g., talking, chewing, massaging) for the first several days after implantation may also help prevent malposition/extrusion.

- Need for revision/size adjustment (1 to 10%)

- Capsular Contracture (1%): expanded polytetrafluoroethylene implants, in particular, have been shown to shrink and contract with time, leading to an irregular and often asymmetric contour. As a result, their use has gone mostly out of favor.

- Infection (less than 1%): Infection is rare, but it may result from any type of implant.; this can typically be treated with systemic antibiotics, though it may require implant removal if the infection is severe.

- Dissatisfaction (1%)

- Dissatisfaction requiring removal (4%)

- Prolonged edema and ecchymosis (majority resolves between 1 to 2 weeks)
