The most common serious adverse effect of bleomycin is pulmonary toxicity, often referred to as bleomycin pulmonary toxicity or BPT. This adverse effect sometimes leads to pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic and irreversible disease with a poor prognosis. In observingÂ the development of pulmonary fibrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration into pulmonary endothelial cells is seen after one week of exposure to bleomycin, and fibrotic changes with elevated collagen content are seen after three weeks of exposure to bleomycin. Other changes include increased expression of fibrogenic mediators such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, connective tissue growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor (PGDF)-C in endothelial cells exposed to bleomycin. Additionally, thapsigargin-induced prostaglandin I2 and nitric oxide, which are both vasodilatory agents, are seen to decrease in endothelial pneumocytes exposed to bleomycin. The administration of bleomycin is thus seen to induce functional changes in endothelial cells of the lung leading to respiratory damage, although the exact mechanism of these changes is not entirely understood. Other adverse reactions include fever, chills, faintness, chest pain, and shortness of breath. Less serious reactions include skin pigmentation changes, itching, hypogeusia, rash, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Some of these symptoms appear to correlate with a hypersensitivity-type reaction.
