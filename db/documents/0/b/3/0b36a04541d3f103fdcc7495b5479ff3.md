Orthostatic hypotension is one of the most frequently identified causes of syncope in the general population. Effective treatment depends on determining the underlying etiology and instituting appropriate interventions to reduce the risk of harm to the patient.  If the history suggests neurogenic orthostatic hypotension as a cause of syncope, a definitive diagnosis may require a complete autonomic workup and coordination of care between the primary care provider, cardiologist, and neurologist.
