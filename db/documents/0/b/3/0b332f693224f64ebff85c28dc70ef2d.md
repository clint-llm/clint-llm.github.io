A multidisciplinary approach to vulvar cancer should commence upon diagnosis with input from gynecologic oncology, medical oncology, and radiation oncology teams. An emphasis should be placed on early diagnosis and treatment, with close post-treatment surveillance. Patients should be encouraged to receive the HPV vaccine early in life to reduce their overall risk of contracting the HPV virus and thus reduce their risk of contracting HPV dependent vulvar cancer. The HPV vaccine may also have a therapeutic role in early VIN. However, more studies are needed to investigate the potential therapeutic impact for vulvar carcinoma.
