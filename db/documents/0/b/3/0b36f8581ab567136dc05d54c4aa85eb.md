Prognosis is variable and based on the degree of skin and organ involvement. There are no significant sequelae secondary to skin manifestations. However, the severity of eye and CNS abnormalities pose the highest morbidity and mortality. In addition, patients with seizures and structural CNS abnormalities have the greatest developmental delay and impairment risk. Patients without significant ophthalmic or neurological impairment have a good prognosis and a normal life expectancy.
