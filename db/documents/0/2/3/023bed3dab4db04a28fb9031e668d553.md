Over time, there have been various modifications to the original design of the shunts for Peritoneovenous shunting, notably the Hyde shunt, Laveen shunt, and most popularly, the Denver shunt. The shunt comprises of two Silastic tubes connected via a compressible pump. The shunt catheter is available in two sizes, 11.5 French (F) and 15.5F. The compressible pump is either single-valved or double-valved, which opens upon a pressure difference of more than 3 cm of water across the two ends of the shunt.

The flow rate depends upon the size of the shunt and compression pump valve. Compared to the double-valved shunt, the single-valve shunt has a higher flow rate for both the shunt catheter sizes. The 15.5F double-valve shunt, however, is most widely used as it is least likely to get occluded or cause reflux.
