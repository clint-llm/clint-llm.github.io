Indications of skin grafting include deep second or third-degree burns, traumas, and non-healing or large wounds that will not close via primary or secondary intention. Patients who may benefit from skin grafts include burn patients, patients with non-healing wounds, such as diabetic foot wounds, or patients who have had to undergo extensive excision, such as in the case of necrotizing fasciitis.
