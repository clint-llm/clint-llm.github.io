The patient must be fasting for at least six hours before the procedure. Antiarrhythmic therapy must be withheld for at least four half-lives. Hypoglycemic therapy must be appropriately adjusted. Anticoagulation therapy is usually interrupted before the procedure for 3 to 4 days for warfarin and 1 to 2 for novel anticoagulant regiments. "Bridging therapy" with low molecular weight heparin is generally not indicated.

Upon arrival in the electrophysiology laboratory, the patient is connected to a 12-lead surface ECG (usually obtained through the EPS recording system), a pulse oximeter, a non-invasive blood pressure measurement cuff, and external defibrillation pads.

Of note, the administration of intravenous sedation should be generally avoided since it can impede the induction of arrhythmias. Nevertheless, light sedation with the combination of benzodiazepines, opiates, and antiemetics is given in the great majority of patients to relieve pain from the initial puncture and anxiety.
