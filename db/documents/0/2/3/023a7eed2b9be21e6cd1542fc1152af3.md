Research into the secondary regulation of the electron transport chain (such as reversible phosphorylation of complexes), and the relationship of mitochondrial function to neuroplasticity has been underexplored. Through the exploration of such topics, the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and neurological pathology could be elucidated. By solidifying understanding of secondary mechanisms of regulation, the pathogenesis and clinical therapy of many diseases may be better understood.
