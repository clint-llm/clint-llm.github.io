The effect of trauma on the median nerve depends on the injury site and may involve the palm, forearm, arm, or axilla. The damage to the nerve can lead to motor, sensory, and vasomotor loss. Most injuries to the median nerve occur at the wrist. Although carpal tunnel syndrome represents the main clinical picture, several injuries can affect the nerve. These lesions are addressable in a distal to proximal manner, from the wrist to the axilla and at the brachial plexus.

**Wrist Lesions**

Traumatic injuries to the median nerve at the wrist level are much more frequent, especially during wrist fractures. Nerve damage can range from simple compression by fracture stumps, to nerve contusion, to rare nerve tears. Moreover, on the wrist, the median nerve is very exposed to cutting injuries and penetrating objects that can cause its complete or partial section. Lesion of the palmar sensory branch of the median nerve, traumatic or accidental iatrogenic damages during surgery on the wrist can result in painful amputation neuromas.

**Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**

Anatomically the carpal tunnel is formed from the flexor retinaculum superiorly and the carpal bones inferiorly; within the carpal tunnel lies the median nerve and nine flexor tendons. Symptoms can localize to the wrist or the entire hand as well as radiate into the forearm. In particular, the signs and symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include thenar weakness, numbness in the radial three and one-half fingers, and paresthesias. Other symptoms include burning like pain in the distribution of the median nerve. Symptoms can mimic the effects of an injury to the C6, C7 nerve roots.

A flick sign occurs when a patient is awoken from sleep with symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome and needs to flick their hands to relieve the symptoms. The test is 93% sensitive and 96% specific for carpal tunnel syndrome.

Other specialized tests to be considered on the physical exams for carpal tunnel syndrome include the Phalen maneuver, Tinel sign, and median nerve compression test. The Phalen maneuver is when a patient flexes their wrist 90 degrees with their elbows in full extension. Recreation of symptoms of the carpal tunnel within 60 seconds is a positive test. A Tinel test is positive when rapid, repeated tapping over the volar surface of a patient's wrist in the area of the carpal tunnel recreates symptoms of carpal tunnel. Furthermore, a positive median nerve compression test is positive when applying direct pressure over the transverse carpal ligament recreates symptoms of the carpal tunnel within 30 seconds.

The severity index of carpal tunnel syndrome is either mild, moderate, and severe:

- Mild carpal tunnel syndrome is numbness and tingling in the median nerve distribution without motor or sensory losses. The patient's sleep does not suffer disruption, and there are no changes to the activities of daily living.

- Moderate carpal tunnel syndrome includes symptoms of mild carpal tunnel syndrome and sensory loss in the median nerve distribution and sleep becomes disrupted; there can also be some changes to hand function.

- Severe carpal tunnel syndrome includes symptoms of mild and moderate carpal tunnel syndrome, weakness in the median nerve distribution, and changes to the activities of daily living.

**Pronator Syndrome**

Pronator syndrome, or pronator teres syndrome, occurs when the pronator teres compresses the median nerve. This condition can look remarkably similar to carpal tunnel syndrome. In pronator syndrome, patients often complain of discomfort in their forearm with activity. An extended elbow and repetitive pronation can often reproduce the symptoms of pronator syndrome, numbness and tingling of the thumb, and the first two digits. The sensation is often intact to the forearm and digits pronator syndrome; however, there is often the loss of sensation over the thenar eminence. This presentation is another way of distinguishing pronator syndrome from carpal tunnel syndrome. The Phalen maneuver and the Tinel sign are also often negative in pronator syndrome. In pronator teres syndrome, the median nerve becomes entrapped as the nerve passes through the pronator teres; this is a syndrome typically seen in professional cyclists. The most common distribution of sensation loss is the lateral palm, but as mentioned above, also sensory loss over the thenar eminence.

**Anterior Interosseous Neuropathy**

Anterior interosseous neuropathy is another form of median nerve injury. The anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve located at the elbow then moves into the anterior forearm. The anterior interosseous nerve innervates the flexor pollicis longus, pronator quadratus, and the deep flexors of digits two and three. There is no cutaneous branch; thus, the neuropathy presents with muscle weakness, no sensory deficits.On physical exam, this can appear by the patient being unable to approximate the thumb and index finger. Patients are unable to pinch objects or make an "OK" sign with their index finger and thumb. An injury to the anterior interosseous nerve most commonly occurs with complex trauma, whereas an isolated injury is rare.

**Elbow Lesions**

The median nerve can be involved during fractures-dislocations of the elbow, both directly by the fracture stumps that, in case of particularly violent traumas, can tear the median nerve, or indirectly through the stretching of the nerve or acute compression by perineural hematomas. Again, the nerve can have involvement during the reparative fibrous processes that can incorporate and constrict it. In case of the reduction of the dislocation or in an attempt to realign the fracture fragments, the median nerve can remain trapped or imprisoned between the fracture stumps themselves or between the articular heads after a dislocation. Compressions of the median nerve at the elbow can occur both at the level of the fibrous laceration and the round pronator muscle. The former condition can cause painful neuropathic symptomatology with muscle weakness. Furthermore, a median nerve lesion can occur during normal elbow surgery such as elbow arthroscopy, rigid elbow correction, prosthesis, or fractures (iatrogenic damages).

**Arm, Axillary, or Upper Lesions**

Traumatic injury of the arm, such as humerus fractures, can rarely cause paralysis of the median nerve, whereas an acute traumatic injury from a deep wound is more frequent. Stab wounds, stab wounds, gunshot wounds, high energy injuries such as road accidents, or more complex brachial plexus injuries can induce nerve lesion at the axilla or upper. Damage at this level causes paralysis of all the innervated musculature of the median nerve and sensory impairment.
