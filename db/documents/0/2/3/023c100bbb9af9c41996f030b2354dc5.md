Opisthotonus is defined as a dramatic abnormal posture due to spastic contraction of the extensor muscles of the neck, trunk, and lower extremities that produces a severe backward arching from neck to heel. In most cases, the trunk is elevated off the ground by a few inches. It is usually sudden in onset and can be sustained or repetitive. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of opisthotonus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating patients presenting this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of opisthotonus and the medical conditions associated with it.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of patients presenting with opisthotonus.
- Review the management options available for opisthotonus.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in patients with opisthotonus and improve outcomes.
