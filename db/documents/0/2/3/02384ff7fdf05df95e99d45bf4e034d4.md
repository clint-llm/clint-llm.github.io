To promote better outcomes for patients with histrionic personality disorder, it is vital for patients to receive an accurate diagnosis. All providers would benefit from having a greater understanding of this disorder so that patients may receive the care they need. Psychiatric disturbances can affect anyone; however, if the physician or nurse provider is not considering histrionic personality disorder as a differential diagnosis, the patient will not receive the treatment they need.

Histrionic personality disorder management requires the efforts of an interprofessional team that includes physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nursing staff, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplinary lines to drive outcomes positively. [Level V]
