**Parkinson Disease**

Patients with PD usually complain of sleep abnormalities, reduced facial expressions, increased clumsiness on one side of the body, and a feeling of being persistently tired.

PD usually demonstrates the presence of asymmetric rigidity and bradykinesia and resting tremors.

1) Rigidity: It is manifested as an increase in resistance when performing a passive movement. It is usually asymmetric. PD can have cogwheel rigidity, in which there is a ratchet-like movement at the beginning and end when a limb moves in a full range of motion.

2) Bradykinesia: Described as slowness of movement. Individuals may often complain of difficulty when carrying out simple, everyday tasks.

3) Tremor: The tremor seen in PD is characteristically the "pill-rolling tremor." It usually occurs when the individual is not involved in any activity, manifested at rest. The frequency of the resting tremor usually ranges between 4 to 5.3 Hz.

4) Postural Instability: An unstable posture results in an increased risk of falls due to the inability to balance. Walking is slow with a tendency to shuffle and decreased stride length.

**Normal-pressure Hydrocephalus**

The Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is commonly used as a scale to rate PD.

**Vascular Parkinsonism**

Patients with VP characteristically have early instability of gait and posture. A 'parkinsonian-ataxic' type of gait presents in VP in which there is a presence of wide-based stance. Sometimes there may be a presence of shuffling gait and truncal ataxia. Pseudobulbar palsy also presents in VP which manifests as dysarthria and dysphagia. Upper motor neuronal signs include brisk tendon reflexes and extensor plantar reflexes. Hypertonia is a feature in VP.

**Drug-induced Parkinsonism**

This condition includes symptoms similar to that seen in PD such as tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. The clues for the potential effect of medication apart from the temporal relation, to the onset of the offending drug, is the symmetry and generalization of motoric symptoms.

**Toxin-induced Parkinsonism**

The various manifestations include an increased tone causing cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, and risk of falling when trying to walk backward.

**Brain Tumor**

In a study conducted by Krauss, he reported that out of the total number of patients with supratentorial tumors, 0.3% had features of parkinsonism with a resting tremor. Most of these patients initially had symptoms of parkinsonism as compared to other symptoms of an intracranial mass, which lead to late diagnosis.

**Juvenile Parkinsonism**

Typical features of parkinsonism such as bradykinesia and rigidity present. The age of onset under 40 to 45 years generally makes for the suspicion of this unusual cause of parkinsonism, once other etiologies have been ruled out.
