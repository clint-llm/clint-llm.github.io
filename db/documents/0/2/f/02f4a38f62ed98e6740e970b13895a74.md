The prevalence is between 0 and 2% worldwide. Specific subpopulations have higher prevalence rates, including people who are homeless, older individuals living alone or in isolation, and psychiatric inpatients. Interestingly, prevalence is not connected to alcohol consumption per capita. For example, in France, a country that is well known for its consumption of wine, the prevalence is approximately 0.4%, while Australia has a prevalence of approximately 3%.
