The most common cause of ventricular septal rupture is full-thickness (transmural) myocardial infarction in one of the following coronary arteries:

- Left anterior descending coronary artery; supplies most of the anterior portion of the interventricular septum. It can lead to apical VSR.

- Dominant right coronary artery; supplies the most inferiorÂ portion of the interventricular septum. This can lead to a basal VSR.

- The dominant left circumflex artery; supplies the posterior portion of the posterior descending artery and arises from the circumflex branch.

Partial-thickness infarcts such as non-ST elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina can also increase the risk of ventricular septal rupture.
