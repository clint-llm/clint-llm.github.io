For early and classic forms of hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, the treatment is with oral vitamin K (2mg dose) repeated at 2-4 weeks and at 6-8 weeks.

For the late form of the disease, oral vitamin K is not as efficacious as parenteral, and hence currently, 0.5-1 mg single IM dose is administered to infants.

For infants weighing less than 1500 gm, 0.5 mg IM single dose is given.

For infants weighing more than 1500 gm, 1 mg IM single dose is given.

All breastfed babies with diarrhea and malabsorption require an additional post-natal dose of vitamin K to prevent late vitamin K deficiency bleeding.

In the case of life-threatening hemorrhages, 10-20 ml/kg of fresh frozen plasma should also be administered.

More than 20% of blood lossÂ and features of shock require immediate blood transfusions.
