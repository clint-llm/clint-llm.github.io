Tracheobronchial tears are uncommon injuries or lacerations or puncture occurring anywhere in the tracheobronchial tree resulting from penetrating or blunt trauma to the neck or chest, or due to iatrogenic interventions. They are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A high index of suspicion among medical professionals, early detection and optimal early management strategies ensures the best outcome. This activity reviews the etiology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, evaluation, and management for a patient with tracheobronchial tear and also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of tracheobronchial tears.
- Outline the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of tracheobronchial tear.
- Summarize the management options available for tracheobronchial tear.
- Summarize the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance and improve outcomes in tracheobronchial tears.
