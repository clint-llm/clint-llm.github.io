Several future directions may help improve survival in patients with carcinomatous meningitis. This includes early diagnosis by analyzing circulating tumor DNA in CSF (CSF-ctDNA). These are shed from the cancer cells as a result of apoptosis and necrosis. Identification can help avoid subjecting the patient to high-risk surgeries or biopsies. The amount of CSF-ct DNA can provide information about tumor burden, recurrence, and treatment response. The identification of novel mutations in CSF-ctDNA can also provide newer therapeutic targets. There is a need for discovery of non-invasive methods like ultrasonography or CT scan guided drug delivery. Novel biological agents and immunomodulatory drugs may help in achieving better survival and improved quality of life.

The multidisciplinary team comprising of neurologists, neurosurgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, psychiatrists, and nurses must manage the biological, psychological, and social aspects of this disease.
