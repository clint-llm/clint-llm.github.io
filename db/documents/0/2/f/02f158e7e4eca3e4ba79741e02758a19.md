Mandibular third molars can be surgically challenging to remove. Their proximity to essential structures, such as the inferior dental and the lingual nerve, is paramount when surgically planning for extraction. It is, therefore, important to consider alternative treatment modalities, such as coronectomy, where indicated. Careful clinical and radiographic assessment is crucial to successful patient outcomes when extracting mandibular third molars. Dental assistants and/or hygienists must take the appropriate radiographic views for the dentist to correctly identify the condition and the appropriate way forward.
