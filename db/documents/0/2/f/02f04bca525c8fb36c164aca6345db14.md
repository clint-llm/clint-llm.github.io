The most toxic effect of amiloride is hyperkalemia. A rapid increase in the extracellular potassium leads to an increase in cardiac conduction velocity, which lowers the threshold for rapid phase Na-dependent depolarization. Furthermore, after the initial increase in cardiac conduction velocity, there will be a prolongation of phase-4 diastolic depolarization and shortening of the action potential, which leads to a delay in the conduction in the atrioventricular node and His-Purkinje system. On ECG, it manifests as a peaked "tented" T wave. As the condition worsens, the QRS complex will widen, resulting in the so-called ''sine-wave''. Therefore hyperkalemia can lead to increased cardiac excitability or a decrease in cardiac excitability. Increased cardiac excitation can lead to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, while a decrease in cardiac depression leads to various degrees of heart block and asystole.

The initial step in managing amiloride toxicity is to stop all drugs that increase potassium concentrations (including amiloride). The next step is to treat hyperkalemia with 10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate IV over 5 minutes. Because the effect is temporary, another dose might be necessary after 15 minutes. Additionally, treating hyperkalemia includes administering rapid-acting insulin, glucose, potassium-binding resins, salbutamol, and sodium bicarbonate.
