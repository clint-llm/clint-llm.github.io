New technological advances have improved the rate of correctly diagnosing TA prenatally to greater than 90%. However, TA may be misdiagnosed as tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) with pulmonary atresia if structures cannot be identified correctly on prenatal echocardiography. Postnatally, the two may be differentiated clinically by the presence of a murmur in TA but no murmur in ToF as well as the greater degree of cyanosis in ToF. Some lesions that may cause a similar degree of mild cyanosis include tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, critical pulmonary stenosis, tricuspid atresia, total anomalous pulmonary venous return/circulation, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Postnatally, the differential diagnosis for cardiac lesions causing hemodynamic shock also includes hypoplastic left heart syndrome and critical coarctation of the aorta.
