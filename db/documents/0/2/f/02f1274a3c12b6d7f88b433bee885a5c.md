All the large blood vessels depend on other tiny vessels called vasa vasorum for their blood perfusion as other organs of the body. They may arise directly from the central lumen of the artery, from its branches of the given artery, or from the nearby vessels. After their origin, they undergo further branching and supply the outer portion of tunica media and the adventitial layer. In contrast, the arteriole takes advantage of its smaller diameter. A short distance between the wall and inner luminal blood provides an opportunity for the direct diffusion of oxygen and nutrition to happen. Thus, arterioles do not have to depend on the vasa vasorum.
