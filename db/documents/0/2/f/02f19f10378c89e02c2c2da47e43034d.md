The management of sleep apnea is with an interprofessional team because of the diverse symptoms and complex treatment. Patients with sleep apnea should be evaluated by a neurologist, cardiologist, bariatric surgeon, ENT surgeon, dietitian, pulmonologist and an oral surgeon. The treatment of these patients is initially non-pharmacological with emphasis on diet, weight loss and use of CPAP. The use of CPAP is associated with very low compliance rates and the next step is to recommend an oral appliance. The key is to educate the patient on lifestyle changes and reducing body weight. Until body weight is reduced, no treatment works consistently or reliably. At the same time, patients should be encouraged to reduce their risk of heart disease by discontinuing smoking, eating healthy and exercising. Unfortunately, patient compliance rates remain low and inadequately treated sleep apnea carries very high morbidity and mortality.
