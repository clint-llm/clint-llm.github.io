Evaluation of the patient initially involves approaching the patient in a non-judgmental manner. The provider's diction should concentrate on recovery and goal setting. How well the first interview is conducted sets the tone for establishing a good rapport between the provider and patient. The provider should always complete the history and physical for assessment. Additionally, the healthcare provider should obtain a full set of labs to help the health provider assess the patient’s health. The lab tests that are recommended include:

- Blood Alcohol Level and Urine Drug Screen to screen for acute substance use. It is usually done in the Emergency Room if the patient exhibits agitation, sedation, or cognitive impairment. Urine pregnancy tests should also be obtained when appropriate.

- Complete Blood Count (CBC) may show anemia and infection, while Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) will show any abnormal electrolyte imbalance regarding substance use and any other co-morbidity.

- Liver Function Test and Hepatitis Panel can help show any negative effects on the liver from chronic alcohol use or other substances; it can also show any hepatitis B & C infections from IV drug use. HIV antibody test should also be added to rule out any infection from IV drug use.

- Pancreatic Enzyme's serum level can show any issues with the pancreas from alcohol binge drinking or heavy nicotine use.

For establishing a diagnosis based on substance use, the DSM-5 is used. Per DSM-5, the individual must meet at least two criteria out of 11 criteria, over a 12-month period, to have substance use disorder established for that substance. Overall, the criteria are similar among the substances. PCP Use Disorder does not have a withdrawal criterion established, so there are only 10 criteria for that disorder. Some stimulants, opioids, sedatives, anxiolytics, and hypnotics can be used under a physician’s supervision, so tolerance is omitted for individuals taking them for treatment purposes. The 11 problems include:

- The substance use amount is taken more than what was intended and taken longer than what was intended.

- There is the intention and failed attempts to decrease use.

- Extra time and effort are used to obtain and use the substance or recover after taking them.

- Having a strong craving for the substance.

- The use of the substance leads to the individual unable to fulfill his or her responsibility.

- Continued use of the substance despite having social and occupational impairment due to the substance use.

- Other activities are reduced or given up due to continued substance use.

- Using the substance in a high-risk setting, such as when operating a motor vehicle or operating heavy machinery

- Continued use of the substance with the knowledge of the psychological and physical harmful effects caused by the substance.

- Tolerance development either from taking more amount of the substance to reach the same effect from last time or from having decreased effect from using the same amount of the substance.

- Withdrawal symptoms are manifested after the substance use is discontinued, and the withdrawal symptoms are relieved with the continuation of substance use.

The number of criteria the patient meets determines the severity level of the disorder; 2-3 sets the severity level as mild, 4-5 sets the severity level as moderate, and 6 or more sets the severity level as severe. A patient can relapse after reaching remission. For the patient to be in remission, the patient must meet at least 2 criteria, which are listed above, over a 12-months period, and be abstinent from substance use for at least 3 months. The period of time from 3-12 months where symptoms are in remission is referred to as early full remission; after 12 months, the condition is classified as sustained remission.
