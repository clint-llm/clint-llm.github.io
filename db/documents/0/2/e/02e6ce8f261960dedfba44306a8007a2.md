The patient with vulvovaginitis may present with intense itching and irritation in the vagina and vulva, a burning sensation with urination which can be mistaken for urinary tract infection, vaginal soreness, or pain, a dry erythematous rash, and a thick white cottage cheese-like discharge.

Candida also presents as an oral infection called thrush, which is a white or yellow non-scrapable rash on the tongue and mucous membranes of the mouth, or redness and soreness with cracking at the corners of the mouth. It causes pain with swallowing when it extends into the oral pharynx. It is common in infants, the elderly, and patients with a compromised immune system. Systemic candidemia causes fever, chills, hypotension, and confusion.

Laryngeal Candida infection is a rare condition. It predominantly presents in females. They usually complain of dysphonia. It largely correlates with gastroesophageal reflux or a history of usage of inhaled corticosteroids. Glottis may be affected by the presence of leukoplastic lesions.
