The equipment used in PVB surgery involves many of the same surgical tools as other procedures. However, there are some unique instruments worth mentioning.

- Tunneler: Used to tunnel bypass conduits through deep tissue

- DeBakey Clamps: Used to clamp large vessels temporarily

- Bulldog Clamps: Used to clamp medium-sized vessels temporarily

- Vessel loops: Rubber loops are used to easily identify vessels and to temporarily occlude them if needed

- Doppler: Ultrasound probe that identifies audio waveforms of blood flow

- Castro-Viejo: Precision needle driver for passing suture

- Prolene Suture: This is the favored suture material for vascular anastomoses. It is a permanent monofilament suture

- Heparin: Anticoagulation. Given systemically or locally to prevent clotting during vascular clamping
