The liver produces very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), metabolized to IDL by lipoprotein lipase (LPL). IDL is converted to LDL by hepatic triglyceride lipase (HTGL). LDL and a portion of IDL particles are cleared from the circulation via the LDL receptors (LDL-Rc) expressed in the liver and other cells.

The LDL receptor consists of a single-chain glycoprotein and is 839 amino acids long. It comprises a 320 residue N-terminal exoplasmic domain that contains the LDL-binding site and consists of disulfide-bonded cysteine residues, a C-terminal cytosolic domain that traps the LDL receptor in clathrin-coated pits, and a sequence of 22 hydrophobic amino acids within the plasma membrane in the form of an alpha helix.
