The recurrent laryngeal nerve arises from the tenth cranial nerve (CN X) (Vagus) and has a long course throughout the neck and thorax. The nerve loops under the arch of the aorta on the left and the subclavian artery on the right before returning to the larynx. There can be significant variation in anatomy, with a small proportion of the population having a non-recurrent laryngeal nerve.
