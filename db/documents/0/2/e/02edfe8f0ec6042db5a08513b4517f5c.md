The term Kernicterus denotes yellow staining of deeper brain nuclei seen on autopsy specimens on infants with severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The histopathologic features seen on these autopsies include nuclei that have undergone pyknosis, the presence of vacuolation in the cytoplasm, and fading of the Nissl substance.

A liver biopsy is often needed for making a definitive diagnosis of cholestasis. It may help differentiate Biliary atresia from idiopathic neonatal hepatitis. Histopathological features of BA  include the expansion of the hepatic portal tracts with edema, fibro-dysplasia, bile ductular proliferation, and bile plugs in the ductal lumen. Multinucleate giant cells and hemopoiesis are other features often seen on histopathologic exams of cholestatic liver samples.

Among familial causes of cholestasis, canalicular cholestasis with a marked absence of ductular proliferation and isolated periportal biliary metaplasia of the hepatocytes is commonly seen in PFIC1 patients. In PFIC2 patients, the histopathology is similar except that altered liver architecture and extensive lobular and portal fibrosis with inflammation are more common.
