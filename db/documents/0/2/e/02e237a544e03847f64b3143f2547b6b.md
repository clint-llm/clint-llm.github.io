Most Schatzki rings do not cause symptoms, but the main symptom that does occur is dysphagia and can result in acute dysphagia as a result of food impaction. Symptoms are commonly associated with not very well-chewed meat and are sometimes described as food sticking in the chest, which has been referred to as “Steakhouse syndrome." Symptoms are less commonly associated with globus, which is the sensation of a “lump” or “blockage” between the cricoid and sternal notch. In the case of food impaction, patients can present with odynophagia.

Key questions to ask pertaining to the location of discomfort in swallowing, which would be expected to be subxiphoid (lower chest/upper abdominal area), and whether symptoms are worse with solids or liquids or both. The extent of symptoms depends on the diameter of the ring, and the largest diameter with symptoms would be less than 25 mm according to the “Schatzki rule.”
