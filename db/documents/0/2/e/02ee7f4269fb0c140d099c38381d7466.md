HBO2 does have undesirable side effects which include enhancement of cataracts; ear barotrauma; pneumothorax formation with pressure changes during the treatment, which can become life-threatening; hypoglycemia in diabetic patients, especially if taking insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agents; and oxygen associated seizures. Because the patient is being treated in an environment with 100% oxygen under pressure, there is always the risk of fire and failure of the chamber. The risk of hyperbaric oxygen treatment is relatively low, and the benefit of the therapy generally outweighs the risk. It is important that safety precautions are followed and strongly recommended that the facility considered for treatment have appropriate certification.
