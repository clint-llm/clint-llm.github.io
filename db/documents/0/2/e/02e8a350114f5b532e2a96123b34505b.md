Pancreatic cysts are often detected in patients undergoing imaging with either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for unrelated reasons. Pancreatic cysts are identified in 2 to 20 percent of patients undergoing CT or MRI; however, these rates may be lower in patients without a history of pancreatitis and may be higher by nearly one-third in high-risk patients with a family history of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cysts can be either neoplastic or non-neoplastic. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of pancreatic cysts and reviews the role of interprofessional team members in managing those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of pancreatic cysts.
- Describe the evaluation of pancreatic cysts.
- Explain the management of pancreatic cysts.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by pancreatic cysts.
