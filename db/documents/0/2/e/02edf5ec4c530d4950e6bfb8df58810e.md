Microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a rare neoplasm most commonly seen in the fourth to sixth decade of life and occurs in near-equal distribution between sexes. However, a slight female preponderance has been noted in the literature.

Although it is most frequently reported in Caucasian patients, a few cases have also been reported in Japanese, Indian, and African-American patients.
