The disease histopathology shows the fibrous hamartoma consisting of fibrous tissue in the pseudoarthrosis area, which is continuous with the abnormally thickened periosteum. This fibrous hamartoma is composed of fibrous tissue with fibroblasts cells mostly and some quantity of hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage and a few areas with enchondral calcification.

The pseudoarthrosis-bone junction is characterized by the presence of giant osteoclasts. The bone adjacent to the pseudoarthrosis has an hourglass appearance with atrophy of the bone ends. All these changes signify bone remodeling defects.

In mixed-type CPT, cystic intracortical lesions resulting from excess bone resorption, deformity of the bone, and sclerosis are present.
