Two types of muscles make up the muscles of the hand: extrinsic and intrinsic. Extrinsic muscles have muscle bellies that originate within the forearm and tendons that enter the wrist and function to enhance wrist stability by keeping the hand placed into the concave radial surface during co-contraction. Intrinsic muscles originate within the hand itself and also contribute to wrist stability by balancing flexor and extensor forces through their attachment to metacarpal bases.

Some carpal bones serve as sites of origin or as sites of insertion for the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the hand. The flexor carpi ulnaris is the only extrinsic muscle that inserts onto carpal bones, specifically the pisiform and hook of the hamate, and the base of the fifth metacarpal bone, which allows it to flex and adduct the wrist joint. All the intrinsic muscles have their origin sites on the carpal bones. The thenar muscles, which include the opponens pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis, and flexor pollicis brevis, have origin sites that involve the prominent tubercles of the scaphoid and trapezium. The adductor pollicis takes its origin from the capitate and the second and third metacarpal bones. Last, the hypothenar muscles such as the abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi brevis, and opponens digiti minimi, originateÂ from the pisiform and hook of the hamate.
