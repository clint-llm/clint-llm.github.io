Venomous snakes inflict considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide, although specific data on the total number of venomous snakebites globally are lacking. In the United States, approximately 7,000 to 8,000 venomous snakebites occur each year, with about 5 to 10 deaths per year. Worldwide, the morbidity and mortality of snake bites are far greater. Despite this, very limited time is spent in traditional medical curricula on the diagnosis and treatment of snake bites. This CME activity seeks to fill that gap and review the role of the interprofessional team in this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for snakebite and snake toxicity.
- Identify initial evaluation in the pre-hospital setting of snake bites.
- Describe various treatments available for snakebites, including antivenom.
- Outline prevention measures necessary to decrease snakebites.
