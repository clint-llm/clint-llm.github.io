Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative disorders that usually cause lymph node enlargement or proliferation of other secondary lymphoid tissues. However, lymphoma can arise from any tissue or organ. Lymphomas derive from the cells or precursors of the immune system. Lymphoma is broadly classified into two major groups, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). NHL is the most common and comprises more than 80% of the cases.

Hodgkin lymphoma is further divided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant lymphoma. Classical HL is divided into four subtypes, nodular sclerosis, lymphocyte predominance, mixed cellularity, and lymphocyte depletion. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is subdivided into aggressive and indolent lymphomas. Amongst aggressive NHL, diffuse large B cell lymphoma is the most common. Mantle cell lymphoma is a less common aggressive NHL. Follicular, marginal zone, and small-cell lymphocytic lymphomas are the indolent NHL types.

Per 2017 WHO classification, lymphoma is divided into three main categories: NK T-cell lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma, and HL.
