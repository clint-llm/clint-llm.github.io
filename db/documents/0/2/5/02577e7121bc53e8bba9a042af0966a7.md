Although Marfan syndrome (MFS) has an autosomal dominant inheritance, rare case reports have described recessive fibrillin 1 gene (FBN1) mutations.(FBN1) encoding the connective tissue protein fibrillin-1.FBN1 is a large gene (65 exons) located at chromosome 15q-21.1. Fibrillin-1 is a matrix glycoprotein that is the main constituent of elastic fibers.FBN1 is identifiable, likely due to complete allele deletion or altered regulation of the FBN1 gene. In patients with atypical presentations reminiscent of MFS, a mutation in a gene encoding for transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TGFBR) may be the cause. Some individuals with TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 mutations have clinical features consistent with MFS, while others have features of one of two other syndromes: Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) or familial thoracic aortic aneurysm (FTAA) syndrome.
