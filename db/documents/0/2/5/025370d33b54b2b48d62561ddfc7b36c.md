The most common symptom of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is abdominal pain, followed by diarrhea and heartburn. The patients can present initially with long periods of persistent symptoms due to unopposed gastrin secretion from a gastrinoma. Malabsorption leads to hypersecretion of acid, and patients can present with weight loss and chronic diarrhea. Helicobacter pylori testing is negative; despite taking PPIs, many patients will continue to have symptoms.
