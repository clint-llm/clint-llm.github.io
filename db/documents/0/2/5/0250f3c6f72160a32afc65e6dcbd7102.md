Despite their intent to educate, drug prescription ads are inherently complicated by financial incentives, which is a topic of great controversy. There are ethical concerns that such advertising strategies are predatory and cause harm to patients. Pharmaceutical companies devote large amounts of resources to the research and development of medications and therefore have reason to strive for greater exposure of their products to recoup their investment.

In the case of advertising targeted at clinicians, it has been well studied that drug promotion to medical providers impacts prescribing habits and behaviors. A systematic review of fifty-eight studies showed a negative influence of medication selection by providers with greater exposure to information provided by pharmaceutical companies.

A similar influence is seen in DTCA. Conversations initiated by patients for drugs because of DTCA are common, and numerous studies have shown that such DTCA-prompted requests can influence prescriber behavior.

Research also suggests that while DTCA prompts consumers to seek more information, drug ads are insufficient for patients to make informed decisions.

More recently, there have been concerns that FDA oversight of DTCA has weakened. A recent study looking at DTC advertisements from 2015 and 2016 showed that few broadcast DTC advertisements fully complied with FDA guidelines, promoting off-label use and providing low-quality information.
