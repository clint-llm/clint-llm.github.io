Cervical cancer screening in women between the age of 21 and 65 years is supported by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Cancer Society (ACS), U.S Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Triage testing involves cytology with Pap test or LBC, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) plus colposcopy, HPV DNA, or any combination as recommended in the setting where one works.

Initially, a bimanual and speculum vaginal examination is done. Either Pap test is done alone or together with hrHPV DNA assay, or VIA is done alone or in combination with hrHPV DNA, or hrHPV DNA is done alone (primary HPV testing).

Visual inspection with acetic acid involves the application of 3% to 5% dilutes acetic acid for one minute on the ectocervix.
