In recent days, antenatal checkups and screening have been increasing. History of antenatal ultrasonography revealing oligohydramnios, renal agenesis, hydronephrosis, and other renal abnormalities may be conspicuous. Urine output monitoring in neonates supports the clinical diagnosis. Paucity or absence of urine in neonate within 48 hrs of life is highly suspicious of renal agenesis and obstructive uropathy. Neonates suffering from dyspnea, tachypnea, or apnea is an indication of respiratory distress from pulmonary hypoplasia. The presence of associated posterior valves decreases the urinary stream force. Positive family history is present in around 35% of cases with bilateral renal agenesis.

On physical examination, infants have characteristics facies, defects in lower extremities, and genital tracts.

Color changes, nose flaring, grunting, chest retractions, and wheezing is the usual findings of respiratory distress syndrome. Associated features of Eagle-Barret (prune belly) syndrome with apparent abdominal wall defect, dilated renal pelvis and ureters, undescended testis, especially in a male child, may be present. Ophthalmic malformations likely cataract, hemorrhage, lens displacement, angiomatosis of the optic disc may be present in a few cases. In rare cases, ventricular septal defects, tetralogy of Fallot, patent ductus arteriosus may be evident.
