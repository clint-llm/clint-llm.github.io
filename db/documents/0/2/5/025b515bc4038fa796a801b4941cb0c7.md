Fibular head somatic dysfunction can cause knee and ankle pain. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of fibular head somatic dysfunction. It also describes the muscle energy technique and high-velocity low-amplitude technique for treating fibular head somatic dysfunction.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomy of the fibula and its motion.
- Summarize how to evaluate fibular head motion. 
- Describe how to treat fibular head somatic dysfunction with muscle energy or high-velocity low-amplitude OMT.
- Review some contraindications to treating fibular head somatic dysfunction with muscle energy or high-velocity low-amplitude OMT.
