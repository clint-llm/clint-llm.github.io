Endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) is primarily a disease of infants and children, but can rarely present in adulthood as well. In 1943, the endocardial fibroelastosis term was coined by Weinberg et al. in children who presented with unexplained heart failure previously known as 'fetal endocarditis'. Rare diseases are studied in a limited capacity and lack sufficient data for evidence-based medical practice. This activity outlines the updates in clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of endocardial fibroelastosis and also reviews the role of the interprofessional teams in improving the management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of endocardial fibroelastosis.
- Review the clinical symptomology in the presentation of endocardial fibroelastosis.
- Identify the indications for medical therapies and surgical interventions for endocardial fibroelastosis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with endocardial fibroelastosis.
