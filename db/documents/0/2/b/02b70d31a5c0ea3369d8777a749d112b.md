Cannabis is composed of a variety of constituents, which include over one hundred different cannabinoids. Within the family of cannabinoids, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) can be decarboxylated via heat to produce delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD).

Cannabinoids exert their effect through their interaction with cannabinoid receptors, namely cannabinoid 1 (CB1) and cannabinoid 2 (CB2). CB1 receptors are predominately found within the central nervous system, though they are ever-present throughout the human body. Of note, it is the activation of CB1 receptors by THC that leads to the well-known psychoactive effects associated with cannabis use.

THC binds with these cannabinoid receptors acting as a weak partial agonist, whereas CBD has a low affinity for either receptor.**.**
