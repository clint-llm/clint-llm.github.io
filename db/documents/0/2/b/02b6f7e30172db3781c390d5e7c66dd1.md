The medical care of women with POI is a multi-specialty undertaking. Medical care often begins with establishing care with a family medicine physician (PCP) for routine health maintenance and monitoring of comorbidities. Primary care can also be provided by obstetricians/gynecologists (OB/GYNs) who focus on womenâ€™s health maintenance and wellness. Oftentimes, general OBGYNs can guide the initial evaluation, treatment, and management of women with POI. Further specialized care can be provided by Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility (REI) specialists. General OBGYNs as well as REIs can perform a more thorough investigation as to the etiology of POI, however, REIs may be able to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the results and the implications of such testing. REIs would be able to help women with POI better understand how this disease process affects fertility and the available options for fertility management and conception.
