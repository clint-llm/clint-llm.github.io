Due to the ubiquity and relative inexpensiveness of ultrasonography, any patient presenting with testicular swelling, hydrocele, or scrotal signs or symptoms of unclear etiology should receive a scrotal ultrasound. Unexplained infertility, precocious puberty, or gynecomastia should also prompt scrotal ultrasonography as well as elevated serum androgens or estrogens on labwork without an identifiable source.

If a Leydig cell tumor is present, it will be identified on scrotal ultrasound as an intratesticular mass and sonographically indistinguishable from a more commonly malignant germ cell tumor. An intratesticular mass should be considered cancer unless proven otherwise. When malignancy is likely, tumor markers should be drawn, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), quantitative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). At this point, staging and further work-up may be necessary after a radical inguinal orchiectomy.
