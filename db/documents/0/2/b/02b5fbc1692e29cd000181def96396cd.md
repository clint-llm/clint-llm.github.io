A well-structured physical examination can yield clues to the systemic cause. Subcutaneous nodules in the upper and lower limbs, positive rheumatoid factor, and serum autoantibodies characterize rheumatoid arthritis, which is a common systemic cause of PUK. The presence of a saddle nose appearance and auricular pinnae deformity suggest relapsing polychondritis. This is a recurrent inflammatory disease of unknown etiology resulting in selective destructive inflammatory lesions of the cartilaginous structures.

Features of SLE include oral cavity mucosal ulcers, a malar facial rash, facial and scalp hypo/hyperpigmentation, and alopecia. A temporal headache with jaw claudication would be seen in giant cell arteritis. Raynaud phenomena can be present in SLE, Sjogren syndrome, and progressive systemic sclerosis. GPA usually presents in the fourth or fifth decade, with a male preponderance of 3 to 2. The characteristic triad of necrotizing, granulomatous, and vasculitic lesions occurs in the respiratory tract and kidneys (causing focal segmental glomerulonephritis).
