In the presence of significant optic nerve involvement, high-dose steroid therapy can be initiated with appropriate antimicrobial cover.

Bacteria

The organisms are isolated from swabs, tissue culture, blood or urine culture, and sensitivity to various antibiotics is deduced to initiate the appropriate systemic antibiotics.

Fungi

Mucor is usually treated by intravenous infusion of liposomal amphotericin B, a broad-spectrum anti-fungal agent, and aspergillus is usually treated with intravenous voriconazole.

Virus

Combined antiviral and steroid therapy is required for patients with OAS following herpes zoster ophthalmics. Intravenous acyclovir is the drug of choice for orbital apex syndrome following herpes zoster ophthalmicus.

Parasite

Cysticercosis is treated with anti-helminthic agents along with steroids to avoid adverse reactions due to intense inflammation caused by the death of the cestode. Surgical treatment is required in patients unresponsive to anti-helminthic therapy or with compressive symptoms.

OAS secondary to various systemic autoimmune disorders is usually managed by systemic steroid therapy. Patients with recurrences while tapering steroids and steroid dependant patients may need immunosuppressive. Methotrexate and azathioprine have been used successfully in the management of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome.
