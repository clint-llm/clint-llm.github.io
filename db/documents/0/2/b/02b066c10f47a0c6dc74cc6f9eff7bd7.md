TBM is a great mimic, and the list of differential diagnoses is vast.

Tuberculoma shares its clinical features and radiological appearance with neurocysticercosis, cryptococcoma, CNS lymphoma, and primary or metastatic brain tumor. Occasionally focal encephalitis, such as herpes simplex, and parameningeal infection, such as brain abscess, may behave similarly to tuberculoma. CNS toxoplasmosis requires careful consideration in cases of HIV infection.

Spinal arachnoiditis needs to be differentiated into an intradural spinal tuberculoma, extradural compressive myelopathy due to tuberculous spondylitis with paravertebral cold abscess, a non-compressive acute transverse myelitis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Cytomegalovirus polyradiculopathy can confuse the picture in HIV-infected patients.
