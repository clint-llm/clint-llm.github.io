Branchial cleft anomalies are congenital malformations, and currently, there are no preventative measures toÂ reduce the likelihood of presentation. Patients and physicians should be educated on the symptomatology and physical exam findings that could lead to the early diagnosis of these lesions. This could reduce the cost of care for the patient, which would otherwise consist of future physician visits, multiple courses of antibiotics, and diagnostic imaging.
