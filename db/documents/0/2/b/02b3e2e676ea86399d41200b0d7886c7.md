Histological appearance of a mucosal herpetic infection includes degeneration of stratified squamous epithelial cells, acantholysis, and formation of an inflammatory infiltrate around the capillaries of the dermis. The characteristic intranuclear inclusion bodies known as Cowdry type A are found on light microscopy showing arrays of viral capsids and electron-dense glycoproteins.
