Atherosclerosis is characterized by the formation of fibrofatty plaques consisting of cholesterol-laden macrophages, calcium, fibrous tissue, tissue matrix, and cellular debris deposits in the intima of blood vessels.

Angioplasty aims to compress the plaque with a balloon or stent and open the stenosed artery to relieve distal ischemia. One of the major complications of stent placement is the risk of thrombosis of the stent, which is overcome by dual antiplatelet therapy administration. Another complication of stent placement is the possibility of neointimal hyperplasia and stent restenosis, which is overcome by a coating of the stent with antiproliferative drugs like sirolimus, tacrolimus, or everolimus, which lead to the evolution of DES. Late stent placement complications occur due to the presence of metallic structure in the strut of the stent, which leads to restenosis and late stent thrombosis. This is overcome by biodegradable polymer stents, which have less risk of long-term in-stent restenosis and thrombosis, but the reduced vascular recoil limits their utility. Therefore, the choice of the stent is highly specific to each artery and type of plaque and local expertise in accurate stent placement.
