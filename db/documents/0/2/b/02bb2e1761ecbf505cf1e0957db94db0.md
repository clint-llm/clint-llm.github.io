Explicit contraindications to using 2-octyl cyanoacrylate include gangrenous, actively infected, or decubitus injuries. Use on patients with a known hypersensitivity to cyanoacrylate or formaldehyde is also an absolute contraindication. Several conditions that were not studied for the initial FDA approval and are inappropriate for 2-octyl cyanoacrylate include wounds in high moisture or friction areas such as the axilla or other intertriginous areas, animal or human bites, stab or puncture wounds, vermillion surface wounds, and patients with burst stellate lacerations. 2-octyl cyanoacrylate is also not recommended in patients with peripheral vascular disease, clotting disorders, insulin-dependent diabetes, or a personal or family history of keloid formation or hypertrophy.
