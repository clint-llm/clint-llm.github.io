All ultrasound therapies utilize electrical current through a probe to exert force through thermal energy and cavitation to produce the desired effect. The probe is typically a handheld device with piezoelectric crystals that produce the ultrasound waves. Hypoallergenic contact gel is applied to the patient’s skin and helps translate the ultrasound waves into the body’s tissues. HIFU procedures rely on curved probe heads, which focus the ultrasound waves a distance deep to the surface on which they rest and get further enhanced with an imaging modality.

Imaging modalities like ultrasound and MRI can increase the safety, accuracy, and effectiveness of therapeutic ultrasound when used in tandem.
