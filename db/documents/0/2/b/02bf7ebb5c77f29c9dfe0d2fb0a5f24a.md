Cholinergic toxicity may result from insecticides, nerve agents, medications, and mushrooms. The most common cause of cholinergic toxicity worldwide is exposure to organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. Exposure to these insecticides may be through inhalation of vapors, ingestion, or direct contact of the chemical with the skin or mucous membrane.

Sarin gas is a nerve gas typically seen in chemical warfare. Sarin gas was made originally in Germany in 1938 as a pesticide. It is well known for being involved in terrorist attacks in Japan in 1994 and 1995.

Cholinergic drugs may cause a cholinergic crisis during clinical use or after an overdose. These drugs include drugs used to treat myasthenia gravis such as edrophonium and neostigmine, pilocarpine used for glaucoma, and Alzheimer drugs such as rivastigmine and donepezil. Essentially, any agent that creates an abundance of acetylcholine at the synapse may cause cholinergic toxicity. These drugs may cause weakness, but a cholinergic crisis is very rare with drugs taken at therapeutic doses.
