In patients with chronic interstitial nephritis in agricultural communities, older patients are more susceptible to complications. Delays in diagnosis and treatment worsen the condition. Renal insufficiency is a common manifestation that ultimately progresses to end-stage renal disease. The inflammatory interstitium is completely replaced by fibrosis, and severe degeneration of tubular epithelial cells induces irreversible renal impairment necessitating early renal dialysis and renal transplantation. Some complications are neurologic (reflex alterations in the early stage), auditive (hypoacusis), and vascular lesions in the lower limbs.
