The lower leg divides into three fascial compartments:

- Anterior

- Lateral

- Posterior

These compartments are formed and separated via divisions by the anterior and posterior intermuscular septa, and the interosseous membrane.

- The anterior compartment musculature functions to primarily dorsiflex the foot and ankle

- The lateral compartment musculature functions to plantar flex and evert the foot

- The posterior compartment musculature functions to plantarflex and invert the foot

The posterior compartment of the leg (often referred to as the "calf") further divides into distinct superficial and deep compartments by the transverse intermuscular septum.  The larger, superficial compartment of the lower leg contains the gastrocnemius, soleus (GS) and plantaris muscles.

The deep layer of the leg's posterior compartment contains the popliteus, flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus, and tibialis posterior muscles. The various muscles of the posterior compartment primarily originate at the two bones of the leg, the tibia, and the fibula. The tibia is a large weight-bearing bone, often referred to as the "shin bone," and articulates with the femoral condyles superiorly and the talus inferiorly.
