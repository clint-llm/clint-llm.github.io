All healthcare workers who start peripheral or central lines should be familiar with the use of ultrasound. This non-invasive technology can be useful in patients with difficult intravenous access. While not as common, ultrasound can also be utilized for arterial access and cannulation. Once mastered, the procedure is simple, effective, safe, and presents little to no increased risk or contraindications. Limitations to the use of US for IV access include the availability of US machines and training required.

Anytime a procedure is considered, the alternatives should be considered as well. The primary alternatives to US-guided IV access are anatomic landmark-guided placement (traditional), intraosseous access, or not obtaining IV or IO access (using intramuscular and oral routes).Â Other alternative adjuncts to aid in IV access include devices made for trans-illumination.

Today, there are several types of portable US probes that can be sterilized for use on almost any part of the body. However, healthcare workers do need to acquire the skill to use US.
