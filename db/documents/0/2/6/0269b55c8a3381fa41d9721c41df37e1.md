Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers work at the site of nicotinic neuromuscular junction by acting on the synapse. A synapse is a specialized area where the prejunctional nerve ending interacts with a highly folded postjunctional part of the skeletal membrane. Both of these pre and post-junctional sites have a higher concentration of acetylcholine (Ach) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchR), respectively. Normally when an electrical impulse reaches the prejunctional nerve terminal, calcium influx causes a release of Ach ligands, which then interacts at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors located at the postjunctional membrane to cause changes in the electrical permeability of the membrane, specifically sodium and potassium. This rapid movement of ions causes a decrease in the transmembrane potential to reach threshold potential leading to the generation of an action potential that travels across the muscle membrane and causes muscularÂ contraction.
