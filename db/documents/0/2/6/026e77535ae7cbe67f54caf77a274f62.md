The vast majority of studies report that core targeted biopsies (TB) have high sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value with a comparatively low (but still more than 50%) negative predictive value

- mean sensitivity more than 95% (95%, confidence interval (CI) 78 to 100),

- mean specificity more than 95% (95% CI 75 to 100), and

- mean positive-predictive value (PPV) more than 99% (95% CI 97 to 100).

RCC histologic subtyping (e.g., clear cell, papillary, or chromophobic subtypes) is about 95% accurate

TB limitations include:

- The non-diagnostic rate of first TB is approximately greater than or equal to 10%

- A small (probably around less than 5%) subset of patients with benign oncocytoma have concurrent RCC that could be missed with TB

- TB has a low negative predictive value (NPV) for malignant tumors, with a percentage likely no higher than in the low 60s

- Fuhrman histologic grading based on core biopsy is only somewhere between 50% to 75% accurate

Non-targeted biopsy (NTB) was shown in a prospective study of 80 patients to change the pre-biopsy clinical diagnosis in 44% of cases and to change therapy in 31% of cases

Thus, TBs and NTBs provide a role in confirming or changing management decisions, but many patients will not derive any benefit.
