Laboratory values and biomarkers for AMI are nonspecific and do not have diagnostic power. Elevated D(-)-lactate and lactate dehydrogenase are seen in late-stage AMI. CT angiography is the preferred method for imaging all types of AMI. Sensitivities for CT range from 96% to 100% and 89% to 94% for specificities. Catheter-directed angiography has fallen out of favor during the initial stages of AMI diagnosis because the added surgical stress is a burden on an already critically ill patient when used in conjunction with endovascular interventions to treat AMI. Plain abdominal radiography, duplex ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance angiography have narrow indications in diagnosing AMI.
