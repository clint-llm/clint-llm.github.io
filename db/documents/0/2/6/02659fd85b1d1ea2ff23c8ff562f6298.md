Tibial neuropathy can be caused by any condition that results in a lesion of the tibial nerve in the lower extremity. Trauma to the ankle is a major risk factor for the development of tibial neuropathy.

Ankle sprains and ankle fractures may result in scar tissue, bony fragments, or bone spurs which can place pressure on the tibial nerve. Similarly, trauma to the knee may cause damage to the tibial nerve, such as a posterior knee dislocation. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is compression of the tibial nerve as it travels under the transverse tarsal ligament. Other causes include lipomas, tumors, Bakerâ€™s cysts, and other space-occupying masses.

Some surgical procedures such as calcaneal osteotomy, performed for foot deformities, have been shown to have higher complication rates of tarsal tunnel syndrome.
