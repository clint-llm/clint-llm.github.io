Tropicamide is a safe drug for pupillary dilation before a comprehensive eye exam or ocular procedure. Pupillary dilation is also necessary for specific intraocular procedures such as cataract surgery to reduce intraoperative complications and for better exposure to the cataract during surgery. Pupillary dilation is also essential for retinal surgery and investigations of the posterior segment. The use of mydriatic agents such as tropicamide has, therefore, become ubiquitous in optical settings. This activity will review drug indications, mechanisms of action, side effects, and how an interprofessional approach can improve patient management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for tropicamide
- Summarize the mechanism through which tropicamide acts in each indication 
- Review the adverse effects of tropicamide, including at-risk patients for which prescribers require extra caution.
- Explain some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance tropicamide where it is indicated and improve patient outcomes.
