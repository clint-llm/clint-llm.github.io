All healthcare workers, including nurses, should be familiar with pulse oximetry.  Pulse oximetry is an accurate measurement of the patient's overall oxygen saturation. While few studies have demonstrated a decrease in mortality from the use of pulse oximetry, it is apparent that it provides more benefit than harm. Clinicians should be aware of the limitations and errors associated with pulse oximetry. They should use their best clinical judgment when deciding whether further workup is needed. In the case of hypoxemia, a physician should always consider whether an arterial blood sample would provide a more accurate measure of oxygen saturation than pulse oximetry.
