Clinicians should educate the caregivers that children with impetigo should maintain good personal hygiene and avoid other children during the active outbreak. It is important to wash hands, linens, clothes and affected areas that may have come into contact with infected fluids. Sores can be covered with a bandage to help prevent spread by contact. If impetigo is recurrent, evaluation for the carriage of the causative bacteria should be performed.  The nose is a common reservoir and carriers can be treated with mupirocin (Bactroban Nasal) applied in the nostrils.
