The diagnosis of anetoderma can be made clinically. However, if the diagnosis is not straightforward, a skin biopsy can be performed, preferably with a punch biopsy, in order to include the mid-dermis. The subtype of anetoderma should also be determined once diagnosed as anetoderma, aided by the patientâ€™s history.

In addition to the histopathology on electron microscopy, elastophagocytosis and small fragmented elastic fibrils can be visualized in lesional skin.

Patients with primary anetoderma may require an additional workup to look for associated underlying diseases. The testing selected should be selected with suspicion for particular disorders based on the history and physical exam. Primary anetoderma has an association with antiphospholipid antibodies. Therefore they should always be tested for in patients diagnosed with primary anetoderma, even if history is negative for thrombotic disease or spontaneous abortions.
