No special preparations are required for a standard transthoracic echocardiogram. Ideally, chest hairs should be removed in male patients for good probe contact and proper image acquisition.

For transesophageal echocardiogram, patients are required to be in a fasting state for at least six hours. Intravenous access is required for the administration of drugs or contrast media. Cardiac monitoring is done throughout the procedure. Light sedation is generally helpful.
