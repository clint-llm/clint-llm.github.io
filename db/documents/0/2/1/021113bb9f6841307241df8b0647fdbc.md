Femoral vascular closure devices have become powerful tools for interventional cardiologists and other proceduralists to achieve hemostasis at the catheterization entry site. There are multiple ways to achieve hemostasis, which fall into two broad categories; passive and active. This activity reviews femoral vascular closure devices and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo cardiac catheterization and require femoral vascular closure devices.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the two different types of femoral vascular closure devices (passive and active), and understand the indications of both.
- Review contraindications to the use of femoral vascular closure devices, and understand when mechanical compression could be used as a safe alternative.
- Summarize the methods, preparation, and basic technique that all femoral vascular closure device placements follow.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes and complications resulting from the placement of femoral vascular closure devices.
