Contraindications for Fogging include:

Poor Visual Acuity; Patients with very poor visual acuity may be difficult to fog as they may be unable to differentiate between the pre and post-fogging vision states, i.e., low vision patients.

Aphakia; aphakia refers to an absence of the crystalline lens in the eye. This can be due to surgical interventions (pseudophakia) or congenital or acquired conditions. In the absence of the crystalline lens, there is no fogging effect during the Subjective refraction.

Cycloplegia; refers to the use of chemical agents to paralyze the ciliary body by blocking the acetylcholine receptors. This, in turn, renders the eye unable to accommodate. Cycloplegia is a common procedure used in the examination process for the pediatric population. Since this state of rest has been achieved chemically by cycloplegia, it is improbable that fogging will affect the ocular accommodative system.

Varying monocular endpoints; one requirement for the binocular balancing step of the refraction process is that both eyes must have similar visual acuity endpoints after monocular subjective refraction. A situation where the visual acuity is significantly different (by one or more full lines) is a contraindication for the fogging procedure and the entire binocular balancing process.
