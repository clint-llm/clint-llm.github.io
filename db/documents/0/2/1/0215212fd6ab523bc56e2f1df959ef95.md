If a constricting band of the foreskin is allowed to remain retracted behind the glans penis for a prolonged period, it can lead to impairment of distal venous and lymphatic drainage as well as decreased arterial blood flow to the glans. Arterial blood flow can become affected over the course of hours to days. This change can ultimately lead to marked ischemia and potential necrosis of the glans.
