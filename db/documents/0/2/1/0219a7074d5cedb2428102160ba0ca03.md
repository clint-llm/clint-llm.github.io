- Adverse effects of pralidoxime iodide in healthy volunteers included blurred vision, diplopia, dizziness, impaired accommodation, headache, and nausea.

- If pralidoxime iodide is used instead of pralidoxime chloride, large doses require careful administration as excess iodine can lead to thyroid toxicity.

- The loading dose of oxime should be given slowly as a bolus because a rapid infusion can cause tachycardia, diastolic hypertension, vomiting, and aspiration.

- Administering pralidoxime in a patient with myasthenia gravis may precipitate a myasthenic crisis. Vigilance is necessary.
