Autologous fat grafting is a multi-stage process that includes evaluating recipient and donor areas and fat harvesting, processing, and reinjection. Oversights, errors, or omissions during any of these steps may adversely affect the outcome. Because each patient and procedure are unique, the physician must communicate specific equipment needs, such as cannulae and instrumentation for harvesting, processing, and transfer, to the operative team before the procedure. Nurses and other team members should be able to effectively communicate expectations for the procedure and possible complications with the patient. Any misconceptions or confusion on the part of the patient must be resolved prior to the procedure.

Imaging, if obtained, should be discussed with a radiologist to clarify any anatomical anomalies. This collaboration is essential for patients with histories of facial trauma or other pathology. When fat grafting is a part ofÂ complex surgery like facial reconstruction, cooperation with maxillofacial surgeons, orthopedic surgeons, orthodontists, and interventional radiologists may be necessary.
