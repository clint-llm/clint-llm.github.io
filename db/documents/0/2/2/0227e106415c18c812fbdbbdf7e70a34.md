Differentiating renal lymphoma from other renal masses is crucial as well as challenging, especially in cases of unilateral lesions that mimic renal carcinomas both radiologically as well as pathologically. The standard management of a renal mass is radial or partial nephrectomy. However, a patient with renal lymphoma is treated with systemic chemotherapy.

Surgery or systemic chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy, is a widely-used treatment for primary renal lymphoma. The prognosis of patients affected by primary renal lymphoma is grave, despite the absence of disseminated disease. For bilateral renal lymphoma, systemic chemotherapy using a CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) regimen is the treatment of choice; this preserves the organ function, but the subsequent prognosis is poor because although chemotherapy usually improves the renal function. The few cases reported in the literature show increased mortality because of rapid relapse or infections occurring from neutropenia. Alternatively, bilateral nephrectomy invariably leads to the permanent need for hemodialysis. Overall survival rate and long-term disease-free interval are relatively better when surgery and chemotherapy are combined.
