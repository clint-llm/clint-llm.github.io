Thumb-sucking has been considered as an activity that serves as an adaptive function by providing stimulation or self-soothing. As children grow older, they tend to stop this habit, with most cases ceasing spontaneously between 2 and 4 years of age. Referral to a pediatric dentist to evaluate dental complications of thumb sucking can be considered when the habit persists beyond four years of age despite appropriate behavioral interventions.

An interprofessional team constituted by pediatricians, dentists, and psychologists provides an integrated approach to persistent thumb sucking and communication to achieve the best possible outcomes.
