Eye trauma has been estimated to have an annual incidence of nearly 7 per 1000 populations in the United States, with the most common trauma being orbital fractures. Intraocular pressure elevation after repair of open-globe injuries is not uncommon, with one case series showing 23.3% of patients developed raised IOP (defined as â‰¥22 mm Hg at >1 visit). 6.2% of patients in the same study went on to develop glaucoma.

A 3.4% incidence of glaucoma following blunt globe trauma has been demonstrated at six months follow-up post-injury, but at ten years post-trauma, it is as high as 10%, highlighting the need for regular follow-up in this patient group.
