Mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms (MCPN) are rare tumors of the pancreas, which mostly occur in middle-aged females. The survival rate for this disease is far better than pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. The tumors frequently are confused with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms differ from mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms because ovarian stroma is observed in the latter. This activity reviews the cause, the pathophysiology of mucinous pancreatic cancer, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of mucinous melanoma.
- Review the presentation of mucinous melanoma.
- Summarize the treatment options for mucinous melanoma.
-  Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by mucinous melanoma.
