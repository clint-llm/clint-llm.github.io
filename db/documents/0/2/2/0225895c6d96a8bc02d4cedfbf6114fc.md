One of the most common questions encountered by forensic scientists is the determination of a person firing the weapon. Identification of gunshot residue that is characteristic or consistent should take into account both the chemical composition as well as the morphology of the particles examined. The gold standard for gunshot residue analysis is an examination using a scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM-EDX). The examination confirms the presence of the primer mixture, which is labeled 'characteristic gunshot residue' if all three heavy metal compounds: those of lead - lead azide or styphnate, antimony - antimony trisulfide, and barium - barium nitrate. The presence of one or more compounds, but not all three, is labeled 'consistent with gunshot residue.'

Recent advances in the field of gunshot residue analysis have led to the development of a synthesized reference sample that can help determine the prevalence, persistence, transfer, and contamination. This analysis becomes further complicated by the presence of modern primer compounds, including titanium, aluminum, calcium silicide, etc., modern oxidizers, including zinc peroxide, potassium nitrate, etc.

The composition of gunshot residue had also been effective in defining 'signature elements' for determining the manufacturer. This residue was useful for creating a 'signature' for police ammunition - titanium and zinc were used to differentiate 9 mm ammunition of the German, Dutch and Belgian police forces. This practice has, however, seen adoption worldwide to produce heavy metals-free ammunition. At present, police ammunition is characteristic, with the presence of gallium or gadolinium as a signature. Gunshot residue from non-police ammunition is less characteristic and therefore requires the analysis of residue collected from the weapon to develop a definite conclusion.

In addition to identifying gunshot residue, advances in analytical techniques allow for differentiation of periods of fire of fewer than 5 hours from those longer than 1 to 2 days.
