Clindamycin is a widely prescribed drug by many healthcare professionals, including the nurse practitioner, primary care provider, internist, infectious disease consultant, and emergency department physician. All healthcare workers who prescribe this agent should monitor the patient for changes in bowel frequency, colitis, and resolution of symptoms. Clindamycin is well known to cause Clostridium colitis, which extends hospital stays and increases healthcare costs. If diarrhea develops, it is essential to manage fluid and electrolyte replacement in this patient population adequately. Healthcare workers should limit the duration of clindamycin therapy and abstain from the empirical prescribing of this agent.

Management of clindamycin therapy will benefit from the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team that includes the prescribing/order clinician (including mid-level practitioners), nursing staff, and pharmacists, all coordinating activity and engaging in open communication about the case and monitoring of the drug to optimize patient outcomes.
