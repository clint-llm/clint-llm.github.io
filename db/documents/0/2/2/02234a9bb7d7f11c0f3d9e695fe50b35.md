Interprofessional communication can lead to better patient management. The patient will most often present to the primary clinician, and these professionals should be aware of the condition as it is treatable.

Prompt referral to an ophthalmologist is necessary. These patients can then be followed by their primary clinicians, and they should ensure compliance with treatment. The nursing staff will be the first in the department to come in contact with patients on follow-up.Â They can assess treatment progress, evaluate compliance with medication and lifestyle measures, and report any issues to the primary care clinician. This collaborative, interprofessional approach to care can ensure optimal patient outcomes.
