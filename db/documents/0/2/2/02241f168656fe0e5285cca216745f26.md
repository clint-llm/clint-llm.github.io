The prognosis for pulsatile tinnitus varies considerably based on the etiology. Pulsatile tinnitus due to extensive cardiovascular disease may have a detrimental impact on patient morbidity and mortality. However, other causes may have no serious long-term effects on the patient. It is also possible that patients will have a resolution of their symptoms following treatment of the underlying cause. Early detection and treatment are the optimal means to improve patient outcomes.
