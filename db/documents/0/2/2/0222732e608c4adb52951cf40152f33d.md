The sinoatrial node (SA) is crescent in shape and is located subepicardially. It is 13.5 millimeters in length and is innervated by the vagus and sympathetic nerves in an average adult. The sinoatrial nodal artery supplies blood to the sinoatrial node, it branches off the right coronary artery in 60% of cases, whereas in 40% of cases, it comes from the left circumflex coronary artery. The SA node is a crucial component of the heart's conduction system and is its default pacemaker.

Sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia is a rare form of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia that has the following electrocardiogram features:

- Heart rate usually between 100 to 150 beats per minute (bpm)

- Similar P wave morphology to sinus tachycardia

- A frequent premature atrial complex at the initiation or termination of the tachycardia

- Abrupt onset and termination

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on clinical practice guidelines and the heart rhythm society has defined sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia as a focal atrial tachycardia from micro-reentry arising from the sinus node.
