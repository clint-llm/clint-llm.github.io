All dural venous sinuses are valveless; thus, they can promote a forward or backflow of blood to other associated structures, allowing pathogens and neoplastic cells to travel to different parts of the brain. The dangerous triangle of the face is a triangular area bounded by the medial angle of the eyes, sides of the nose and the upper lip as its boundaries. This anatomy is important because it serves as the passageway of pathogens from the face into the brain via the cavernous sinuses. Infection coming from the superficial and deep layers of the face can easily travel into the cavernous sinuses leading to the development of a thrombus, a condition termed as cavernous sinus thrombosis. This condition may result in the swelling of the affected sinuses and pertinent damage to the associated cranial nerves. Patients may develop internal strabismus caused by the lesion in the cranial nerve VI, which is usually the first cranial nerve affected, which is then followed by damage to further movement and sensation of the eyes and skin of the face as well as the scalp, respectively. Ophthalmoplegia or paralysis of the eye muscles can also be manifestations of other damaged cranial nerves. Pulsatile proptosis characterized by a combination of pulsation and protrusion of the eyeball can also present in patients with affected venous sinuses.
