Asterixis is a clinical sign that describes the inability to maintain sustained posture with subsequent brief, shock-like, involuntary movements. This motor disorder is myoclonus characterized by muscular inhibition (whereas muscle contractions produce positive myoclonus).

Asterixis can be elicited on physical examination by having the patient extend their arms, dorsiflex the wrists, and spreading the fingers (similar to pushing against a wall) with their eyes closed. This is used to test for the “flap” at the wrist and is the most common method of assessment. One can also elicit asterixis at the hip joint by keeping the patient in the dorsal recumbent position (supine with their knees bent up in an outward position while the feet are flat) and allowing the knees to fall to the sides.
