The pathophysiology of TIA depends on the subtype as follows. The common issue is the transient interruption of arterial blood flow to an area of the brain supplied by that particular artery.

- Large artery atherothrombosis. This may be intracranial or extracranial atherothrombosis. The mechanism may be a lack of blood flow distal to the site of arterial stenosis or an artery to artery embolism which is actually the more common mechanism.

- Small vessel ischemic diseases. The underlying pathology is either lipohyalinosis or small vessel arteriolosclerosis. The commonest risk factor is hypertension followed by diabetes and age.

- Cardiac embolism. A clot in the cardiac chamber most commonly in the left atrium secondary to atrial fibrillation.

- Cryptogenic. This is usually a cortical pattern of ischemia without any identifiable large artery atherothrombosis or cardiac source of emboli. More recently it is often referred to as ESUS (embolic stroke of unknown source).

- Other uncommon causes such as arterial dissection or hypercoagulable states.
