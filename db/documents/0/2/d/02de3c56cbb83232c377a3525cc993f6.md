The evaluation of the persons abusing or using sympathomimetics is usually based on the history and physical. When the person is using multiple drugs, which is usually the case in patients that abuse sympathomimetics, the reliance on a physical exam alone might be misleading. The fastest way to ascertain the use of sympathomimetics, which is specific and sensitive, is a urine drug test. Cocaine use in the last 1 to 3 days will typically be positive. Other stimulants are not sensitive or specific due to the new compounds being synthesized on a regular basis.
