Many patients undergoing major noncardiac as well as vascular surgery are at risk for a major adverse cardiac event (MACE). In the United States, 27 million patients undergo non-cardiac surgery annually, 50,000 of which suffer a postoperative myocardial infarction (MI).Â It's estimated that cardiovascular complications are responsible for roughly one-half of all the mortality experienced by patients undergoing noncardiac surgery and occur in 1% to 5% of patients undergoing vascular surgery.
