Associations with the following disease entities have been reported:

Although medullary sponge kidney is generally described as a benign condition, as many as 10% of patients will develop renal insufficiency or failure throughout their lives.

Since medullary sponge kidney is associated with hypercalciuria, especially the renal calcium leak type, those with the disease are at risk of developing osteopenia, osteoporosis and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

While there is no specific treatment for medullary sponge kidney, those with renal stones and hypercalciuria or UTIs should be treated appropriately for these conditions.
