The main clinical manifestation of AAT deficiency is related to the involvement of three separate organs: the lung, the liver, and, rarely, the skin.

Clinical presentation of lung diseases, namely emphysema due to AAT deficiency, has many features in common with usual COPD. Dyspnea is the most common presenting symptom, and many patients have a cough, sputum production, and wheezing, either chronically or with upper respiratory tract infections. Spontaneous secondary pneumothorax may be the presenting manifestation of AAT deficiency, or it may be a complication of the known disease. Bronchiectasis has also been associated with a severe deficiency of AAT.

Clinical presentation of extrapulmonary diseaseÂ in patients with at-risk alleles (e.g., Z, S[iiyama], and M[malton]) may develop adult-onset chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma.

Other extrapulmonary manifestations of AAT deficiency include necrotizing panniculitis, hot, painful, erythematous nodules, or plaques on the thigh or buttocks that are the major dermatologic manifestation of AAT deficiency. Others are systemic vasculitis, psoriasis, urticaria, angioedema, and possibly inflammatory bowel disease, intracranial and intra-abdominal aneurysms, fibromuscular dysplasia, and glomerulonephritis.
