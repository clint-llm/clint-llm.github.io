Patients with CTX often initially present with nonspecific findings. The symptoms typically appear in infancy, including intractable diarrhea, neonatal jaundice, or cholestasis. Some patients may develop chronic diarrhea through adulthood. In the first decade of life, patients with CTX may also report visual difficulty that is often attributed to juvenile-onset bilateral cataracts.

Neurologic symptoms and signs typically manifest in the third decade of life and progressively worsen. The neurologic complications may vary; more predominant symptoms include extrapyramidal symptoms (dystonia and oromandibular dyskinesia), extensor plantar responses, spasticity, hyperreflexia, cerebellar signs (e.g., ataxia, nystagmus, and dysarthria), and peripheral neuropathy.
