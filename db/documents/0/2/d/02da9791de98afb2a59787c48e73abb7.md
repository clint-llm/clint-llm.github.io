**Ovarian structure:**

To understand the structure of the corpus albicans, one must first understand the general structure of the ovary itself.Â  The structure of the ovary is made up of three different regions: the cortex, medulla, and hilum. The cortex of the ovary contains two major types of cells, follicular cells, and stromal cells. The cortex also contains the corpora lutea as well as the remnant corpora albicans. The medulla is made up of blood vessels and nerves, and the hilum contains major blood vessels to the ovary.

**Corpus luteum structure:**

When the formation of the corpus albicans begins, there is a tissue reorganization process that develops. The corpus albicans comes from a precursor endocrine organ called the corpus luteum. As the corpus luteum degenerates, there is an influx of matrix metalloproteinases, fibroblasts, and macrophages that take over the process of both organizations of dense connective tissue of the newly forming corpus albicans, as well as cellular cleanup needed after extensive apoptosis.
