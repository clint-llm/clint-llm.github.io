The PENG block is a new and alternative regional analgesic technique for hip surgery that can be used in combination with other regional anesthesia techniques to effectively target the anterior hip capsule by blocking the articular branches of the femoral nerve and accessory obturator nerve and also used as an alternative to femoral nerve block or lumbar plexus block to prevent quadriceps weakness and thus allow early postoperative revalidation.

It is currently well described that the use of multimodal analgesia combined with regional analgesia, including nerve blocks and periarticular infiltration techniques, is associated with the decreased postoperative use of opioids and improved by reducing morbidity and length of hospital stay.

To evaluate the efficacy of PENG block for hip surgery, a review was carried out using the Joanna Briggs Institute framework; adult and pediatric studies were included, database searches identified 345 articles, but the author concluded that current evidence of using PENG block for hip surgery or hip pain is limited to case reports and case series only. Regarding analgesic efficacy and adverse effects, double-blind, randomized controlled trials are required to better understand the PENG block.

In a retrospective review that compares the analgesic benefit of adding PENG block to Local infiltration anesthetic after primary total Hip arthroplasty, the authors (Kiran Mysore MD et al.) identified 123 patients who met the inclusion criteria; 47 received and 76 did not receive PENG block. They find that the PENG block was associated with a reduction in 24-hour hydromorphone consumption.

Following Girón et al.'s publication, which was the first author to discover this block, Ueshima and Otake documented their clinical experience using the PENG technique in four patients for the management of perioperative pain after reduction of hip dislocation and hip replacement; they concluded that in their successful experience, the PENG block technique could cover both the femoral and obturator nerves and could be used as an effective analgesic method for hip surgery.
