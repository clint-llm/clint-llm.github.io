SARS-CoV-2 and its variants continue to wreak havoc worldwide and, in the process, have overwhelmed many healthcare systems and economies of many countries. Four vaccines have been authorized for use in the US by the FDA, two (**BNT162b2**and**mRNA-1273**)****of which have been approved, and two(**Ad26.COV2.S**and**NVX-CoV2373**)have been authorized for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).

Until most of the world's population gets completely vaccinated (including booster shots) against this illness, COVID-19 will continue to remain a threat to global public health with the emergence of potentially treatment-resistant variants.

Prevention and management of this highly transmissible respiratory viral illness require a holistic and interprofessional approach that includes physicians' expertise across specialties, nurses, pharmacists, public health experts, and governmental authorities. There should be closed-loop communication between the clinical providers, pharmacists, and nursing staff while managing patients with COVID-19.

Clinical providers managing COVID-19 patients on the frontlines should keep themselves periodically updated with the latest clinical guidelines about diagnostic and therapeutic options available in managing COVID-19, especially considering the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality.

Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in patients from a high-risk exposure area or recent travel to a high-exposure area who present with extrapulmonary manifestations in the absence of pulmonary symptoms. These patients should be appropriately triaged and tested for SARS-CoV-2.

Resources for contact tracing and testing must be enhanced to limit the spread of this virus. Patients must be educated and encouraged to adhere to social distancing guidelines, travel guidelines, and the use of facemasks as per CDC guidelines and COVID-19 protocols of state and local authorities.

Clinical pharmacists must also keep themselves updated about the emergence of novel therapeutics that have been approved or granted emergency use authorization to manage COVID-19.

Hospitals and communities should have in place a plan to triage moderate and high-risk patients for additional therapy, such as monoclonal antibodies, on an outpatient basis.

A strong focus must be made to educate the public about the importance of receiving the vaccination, including the recommended booster dose against COVID-19, and consideration must be made to establish mass vaccination sites.

Continued viral surveillance of new variants must be performed at regular intervals with viral genomic sequencing given the possibility that more highly transmissible, more virulent variants and treatment-resistant variants could emerge that can have a more catastrophic effect on global health in addition to the current scenario.

Such a multi-pronged approach enhances improved patient care and outcomes. It also reduces the burden of hospitalizations that could lead to the exhaustion of healthcare resources.

Such measures could immensely change the dynamic of healthcare infrastructure and go a long way in eradicating or eliminating this virus and limiting its devastating effect on socioeconomic and healthcare situations across the entire world.
