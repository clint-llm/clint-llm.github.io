Pharyngeal pouches emerge during the segmental phase of pharyngeal arch development, forming partitions between each pharyngeal arch.

Pharyngeal pouch development is hypothetically independent of neural crest migration towards the endoderm.

The first pharyngeal pouch lies between arches one and two. The second pharyngeal pouch sits between the second and third pharyngeal arches. In the same fashion, the third pouch is in between the third and fourth arches. Finally, the fourth pharyngeal pouch lies between the fourth arch and the terminal, sixth, arch. The fifth pharyngeal arch disappears during embryonal development.
