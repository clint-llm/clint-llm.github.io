The skull is a compact structure that covers and protects the brain and facial organs.

While radiography has been the principal imaging modality of skull lesions until recent years, today it is largely replaced by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thanks to its high spatial resolution, CT is excellent at precisely localizing the skull lesion and defining its extensions. And owing to its high contrast resolution, MRI is the preferred method for the assessment of diploic involvement and lesion texture.
