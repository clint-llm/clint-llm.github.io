Foreign body aspiration remains a significant cause of death in children for anatomic as well as developmental reasons. Choking is typically defined as an aerodigestive foreign body causing varying amounts of obstruction to the airway. The obstruction can lead to difficulties with ventilation and oxygenation thus resulting in significant morbidity or mortality. Items that are most commonly implicated in children include food, coins, toys, and balloons. The main cause of death has been attributed to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and less commonly, pulmonary hemorrhage. This activity reviews the evaluation of a patient suspected of having aspirated a foreign body and the role of the interprofessional team in caring for this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the frequency of morbidity and mortality associated with foreign body aspiration.
- Explain the airway difficulties expected with foreign body aspiration.
- Review the most common foreign bodies aspirated.
- Outline the evaluation of a patient suspected of having aspirated a foreign body and the role of the interprofessional team in caring for this life-threatening condition.
