Healthcare systems must continuously evolve, often allocating significant resources to create new clinical spaces that support changes in healthcare delivery. Opening these new spaces to the demands of medical practice is wrought with a diverse spectrum of challenges ranging from simple space configurations to complex multimodal, multidisciplinary processes. Training interprofessional teams using established hospital processes while incorporating new workflows in new clinical environments is extraordinarily complicated. Despite extensive planning for these spaces, weaknesses, inefficiencies, and even safety issues will likely remain - and potentially only reveal themselves after the first patients arrive. In-situ simulation training has been shown to identify latent safety threats and provide a solution to develop, test, and refine new processes, workflows, and spaces before full operation.

Healthcare simulation continues to rapidly evolve its methods to achieve valuable healthcare goals, including efficiency, quality, and safety. Moving from basic skill acquisition to more complex realms including knowledge translation, complex decision-making under stress, interprofessional team performance, workflow, and failure-point analysis, healthcare simulation is being applied to virtually every facet of care delivery. The use of fully immersive, high-fidelity, in-situ simulation to evaluate new clinical spaces reflects a natural progression and impactful application for these techniques and has shown to increase organizational learning.
