Etomidate is an agent for IV anesthesia induction, and it offers several advantages:

-  Simple dose regimen

-  Fast onset of action

-  The short duration of effect

-  Rapid metabolism

-  Low risk of histamine release

-  Hemodynamic stability on bolus injection

The dose for induction of anesthesia in adult and pediatric patients above the age of 10 varies between 0.2 and 0.6 mg/kg of body weight. Use is not recommended in patients below ten years old because there is insufficient data to support dosage recommendations for induction of anesthesia. Geriatric patients may require reduced doses of etomidate due to the natural progression of declining renal function. Clinical studies suggest that etomidate may induce cardiac depression in elderly patients with hypertension. A common induction dose of etomidate at 0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg, injected over 30 to 60 seconds, produces rapid onset of anesthesia, usually in less than one minute. Narcotics and other neuroactive drugs utilized during anesthesia may decrease the required etomidate dosage. The duration of action is directly correlated to the dose, with each 0.1 mg/kg providing about 100 seconds of unconsciousness.

Recovery depends on redistribution to inactive tissue sites. Like most intravenous anesthetics, etomidate is highly protein-bound (77%). Thus, it can achieve a higher concentration in the brain in low albumin states since it will be less bound to albumin, and more free-drug would be available in the brain. In addition, larger doses and repeated boluses can safely be administered because of their minimal effects on hemodynamics and short context-sensitive half-time.

**Special Population**

Hepatic Impairment: No dosage adjustments are provided in the manufacturer's labeling.

Renal Impairment: Etomidate is primarily excreted by the kidney; hence the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, clinicians should take care of dose selection and monitor renal function.

Pregnancy Considerations: According to the package insert, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies on pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, fetal deaths and reduced pup survival were noted after intravenous etomidate administration to pregnant rats at doses 0.17 times the human induction dose of 0.3 mg/kg. In addition, there are inadequate data to support intravenous etomidate in obstetrics, including Caesarean section deliveries. Therefore, such use is not recommended.

Breastfeeding Considerations: Amounts of etomidate in milk are small and decrease rapidly. Current literature indicates that no waiting period is required before resuming breastfeeding after etomidate anesthesia. Mother can resume breastfeeding as soon as she has recovered from general anesthesia. However, caution should be exercised when administering etomidate to a nursing mother.
