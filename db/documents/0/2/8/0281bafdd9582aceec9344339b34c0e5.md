Venlafaxine oral tablet is prescribed for long-term treatment, and it comes with serious risks if not taken as prescribed or stop it abruptly. Abrupt cessation of venlafaxine can lead to serious adverse effects such as irritability, tiredness, restlessness, anxiety,  insomnia, trouble sleeping, nightmares, headache, sweating, dizziness, tingling, or "pins and needles" feeling, shaking, confusion, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  Symptoms of an overdose of venlafaxine can include: tachycardia, unusual sleepiness, dilated pupils, seizures, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, muscle aches or pains, or dizziness.

Severe toxicity of venlafaxine, especially when combined with other antidepressants such as SSRI, SNRI, or MAOI, can lead to serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is a possibly life-threatening condition associated with increased serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. Serotonin syndrome may present with a spectrum of clinical findings, including autonomic hyperactivity, mental status changes, and neuromuscular abnormalities. Serotonin syndrome characteristically presents with myoclonus, agitation, abdominal cramping, hyperpyrexia, hypertension, and potentially death. No laboratory tests exist to confirm the diagnosis as serotonin concentrations do not correlate clinically with symptoms. Hunter Toxicity Criteria Decision Rules can be used to form the diagnosis.

- An inducible clonus must be present, plus agitation or diaphoresis

- The presence of ocular clonus plus agitation or diaphoresis

- Tremor with hyperreflexia

- Hypertonia with a temperature above 38 degrees C plus ocular clonus or inducible clonus

Management of serotonin syndrome involves prompt discontinuation of all serotonergic agents with supportive care aimed at normalizing hemodynamics. Patient sedation with benzodiazepines and serotonin antagonists may also be an option.
