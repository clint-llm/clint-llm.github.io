Lipoid proteinosis is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by hyaline-like deposits in the skin, mucous membranes, and other parts of the body. It is caused by a mutation in the extracellular matrix 1 (ECM1) gene. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of lipoid proteinosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of lipoid proteinosis. 
- Describe the most common physical exam findings in patients with lipoid proteinosis.
- Outline the epidemiology of lipoid proteinosis.
- Review some interprofessional team strategies that the healthcare team can use to improve outcomes in patients with lipoid proteinosis.
