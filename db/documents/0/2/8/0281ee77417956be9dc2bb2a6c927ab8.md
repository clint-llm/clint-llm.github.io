Although pathergy testing has decreased in its sensitivity over the past few decades, it remains an invaluable test in the diagnosis of BD. Despite the loss in sensitivity, the test has demonstrated improvements in its diagnostic odds ratio, positive predictive value, and positive likelihood ratio.

Despite the presence of pathergy clinically in other conditions, BD is the only disease that includes a positive pathergy test as part of its diagnostic criteria. Nevertheless, the knowledge of pathergy reaction in neutrophilic dermatoses such as PG and other disease entities is important because it may influence the diagnoses and assessment of these conditions. It would be of great interest to systematically study and perform pathergy tests in patients with these diseases because it may provide invaluable insight into their pathophysiology and possibly guide their management.
