There are a significant number of potential causes of obstructive uropathy, and these vary widely. However, the most frequently diagnosed cause is benign prostatic hypertrophy or hyperplasia.Â  Although not particularly common, other potential causes include constipation, urethral strictures, phimosis or paraphimosis, prostatic adenocarcinoma, retroperitoneal adenopathy, colonic endometriosis, ureterocele, urolithiasis, and neuropathic bladder dysfunction, parasitic obstructions, bladder endometriosis, and urate nephrolithiasis.
