Somatosensory information gets relayed within the spinal cord via two mainÂ pathways: the dorsal column-lemniscal system and the spinothalamic system.

The pathway, from the periphery to the cerebral cortex, that a sensory stimulus takes through the dorsal column-lemniscal system is as follows: detection of the stimulus occurs via peripheral nerve terminals in the skin, joints, etc. These terminals are part of primary afferent nerves which travel from the periphery, through the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and project to second-order neurons within the dorsal column nuclei in the brainstem.

Typically SEPs are recorded from an upper or lower extremity nerve, pending surgical location. Electrodes are placed at multiple sites along the sensory pathway and correspond with different aspects of that pathway (see description above)

When reviewing SEP recordings, it is crucial to understand how they get reported and to have a knowledge of the anatomic origin of commonly used recordings. A SEP waveform reports as N or P followed by a number; N or P corresponds to "negative" or "positive" (the wave polarity) and the number represents the expected latency of the wave in milliseconds, determined from a healthy population.

Following are summaries of commonly used nerves/pathways for SEP monitoring, along with their specific points of monitoring, corresponding waveform values, and what portion of the sensory pathway they reflect

- Median nerve SEPs: Erb's point (N9, peripheral nerves-brachial plexus), cervical spine (N13, the post-synaptic dorsal horn of the cervical spinal cord), scalp/parietal and frontal cortices (P14, cervico-medullary junction, and N20, primary somatosensory cortex)

- Tibial nerve SEPs: popliteal fossa (N8, peripheral nerves-tibial nerve, sciatic nerve), lumbar spine (N22, the post-synaptic dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord), scalp/cortex (P39, somatosensory cortex)
