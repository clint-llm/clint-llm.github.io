Tumors classified as MIA and AIS have been shown to have nearly 100% disease-free survival once completely resected. (100% 10-year disease-free survival for AIS and 97.3% to 100% for MIA.)

Tumors identified as bronchioloalveolar carcinoma or adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth rarely follow the traditional progression through nodal or vascular involvement. Multifocal disease within lung parenchyma has been seen and attributed to synchronous disease or aerogenous spread. Given their intrathoracic spread, even lung transplantation has been performed in cases of multifocal BACs but has often exhibited recurrence in the donor's lung as late as 48 months post-transplantation.

Considering all forms of adenocarcinoma, the solid component (contrary to ground glass) and mucinous pattern are widely considered to be predictors of metastatic potential.
