Canavan disease is a rare lethal neurological disorder which is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, internist, geneticist, social worker, nurse, physical therapist, ophthalmologist, and a gastroenterologist. These patients tend to have many physical limitations including an inability to eat, speak or even walk. The prognosis for most patients is poor, even those with mild disease have a poor quality of life.
