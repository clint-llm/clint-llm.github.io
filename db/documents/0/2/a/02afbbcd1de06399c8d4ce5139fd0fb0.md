In most instances of dacryostenosis, epiphora is the most common presenting symptom. However, other causes of epiphora should also be excluded.

Children with congenital dacryostenosis have a history of chronic or intermittent tearing and debris on the eyelashes. Usually, there is no conjunctival erythema, although some degree of irritation can result from overflow tearing and chronic rubbing of the eyes. Palpation of the lateral wall of the nose may cause watery reflux or mucopurulent discharge onto the eye. In adults, the most common complaint is epiphora (excessive tearing). Patients may also experience vision abnormalities. It has been demonstrated that these symptoms ultimately affect the quality of life.

In the case of bacterial infection of the content of the lacrimal sac, acute dacryocystitis can occur. Redness, pain, pulsation, epiphora, and tightness in the medial lid angle, along with a severe headache, will cause the patient to seek medical advice.

The lumen of the duct may decrease continuously, sometimes even up to a complete closure that results in dilation of the lacrimal sac. Clinically, a bulge of the medial canthus due to the enlarged lacrimal sac is the typical sign of a chronic dacryostenosis. Mucous secretions are frequently visible coming out from the lacrimal puncta after slight pressure of the medial canthal swelling.
