For patients with acute stress disorder (ASD), first-line management would be of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy, as oral therapies have been found to be of limited benefit. Most of the studies on pharmacological treatment have focused on secondary prevention for PTSD rather than focusing on ASD.

**Adult Pharmacotherapy**

**Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) -**SSRIs such as sertraline, paroxetine, and fluoxetine have been used to treat PTSD. FDA has only approved sertraline and paroxetine.

Two examples of SSRI pharmacotherapy are provided below:

- Fluoxetine: Start with 20 mg/day, PO. If no clinical improvement in a month, gradually increase the initial dose by 5 mg every two to four weeks. The average dose in clinical trials is 40 mg/day. The maximum dose is 80 mg/day PO. Possible to divide the daily dose into two (one in the morning and one in the noon). The highest therapeutic dose tolerable to the patient can be tried for at least six weeks before deciding its efficacy.

- Paroxetine: Start with 20 mg/day PO. If no clinical improvement in a month, gradually increase the initial dose of 10 mg every two to four weeks. The maximum dose is 60 mg/day. The highest therapeutic dose tolerable to the patient can be tried for at least six weeks before deciding its efficacy.

**Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) -**Venlafaxine (Effexor) extended-release has shown to be effective in PTSD treatment.

**Second-Generation Antipsychotics (SGAs) -**Two antipsychotics with the most clinical evidence are listed below:

- Quetiapine monotherapy in an RCT started at 25 mg/day and increased to up to 800 mg/day, PO with an average dose of 258 mg/day. The results showed the clinician-administered PTSD scale (CAPS) as well as re-experiencing and hyperarousal scores in military and non-military cases. The final adjusted dose was 50-800 mg/day, with a patient count of 41. No patient dropouts in the treatment arm were due to inefficacy.

- Risperidone adjunctive therapy, in another RCT, did not show significant results in CAPS scores but showed a small reduction in hyperarousal and re-experiencing scores with a dose of up to 4 mg/day in military cases.

**Alpha-1 Selective Adrenergic Blockers -**Prazosin is an antihypertensive medication and works by blocking specific receptors on the vascular smooth muscle. It is thought that prazosin and its metabolites can reduce the overactivation of the sympathetic system in ASD and PTSD. Prazosin can be used as monotherapy or augmentation with an SRI to minimize sleep disturbances mainly.

- Prazosin: start at 1 mg, PO at night with monitoring for hypotension (before and after the administration of prazosin). Gradually increase the dose for a final dose of 2 to 6 mg/night.
