An interprofessional team for bronchoscopy includes bronchoscopy operators (pulmonologists, intensivists, otolaryngologists), anesthesiologists, nurse anesthetists, nurses, operating room technicians, and pharmacists. An interprofessional team approach that emphasizes good communication will offer the best patient outcomes. It is paramount that all healthcare providers know the patientâ€™s medical history and potential complications of the bronchoscopy procedure. Complications can arise at any time during the procedure, and swift interventions need to be undertaken for optimal results. It takes a whole team and excellent communication to provide quality care.

During postoperative care, potential bronchoscopy complications need to be addressed, and proper communication is important. The provider in the recovery unit should be aware of any oxygen desaturation, level of consciousness alterations, chest pain, shortness of breath, voice changes, hoarseness, dysphagia, hematoma, and bleeding. Open communication is the key to ensure good outcomes. Rapid physical examination, laboratory, and imaging are imperative to stop the further progression of a complication. [Level 5]
