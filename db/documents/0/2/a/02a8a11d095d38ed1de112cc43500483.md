Insufficient sleep occurs due to an inadequate opportunity for sleep and is defined as a shorter sleep duration than required to maintain daytime wakefulness. It is prevalent in the US population, with up to one-third of the population reporting poor sleep. It has been associated with cardiovascular disease, obesity, and reduced daytime performance. A thorough clinical evaluation helps diagnose insufficient sleep. Management involves extending total sleep time to a duration expected for age. This activity reviews the assessment and treatment of insufficient sleep and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
-  Describe the epidemiology of insufficient sleep.
- Review the pathophysiology resulting from insufficient sleep.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with insufficient sleep.
- Explain the management considerations for patients with insufficient sleep.
