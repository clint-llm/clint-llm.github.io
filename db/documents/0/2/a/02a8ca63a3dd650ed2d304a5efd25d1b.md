The female external genitalia includes the mons pubis, labia minora and majora, clitoris, perineal body, and vaginal vestibule. The perineal body is the region between the anus and the vestibular fossa. It contains the superficial and deep muscles of the perineal membrane and is the most common site of laceration during childbirth.

Perineal lacerations are classified into four basic categories.

First Degree: superficial injury to the vaginal mucosa that may involve the perineal skin.

Second Degree: first-degree laceration involving the vaginal mucosa and perineal body.

Third Degree: second-degree laceration with the involvement of the anal sphincter. This is further classified into three sub-categories:

- A: Less than 50% of the anal sphincter is torn.

- B: Greater than 50% of the anal sphincter is torn.

- C: External and internal anal sphincters are torn.

Fourth Degree: third-degree laceration involving the rectal mucosa.

Severe perineal lacerations, which include third- and fourth-degree lacerations, are referred to as obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIS).
