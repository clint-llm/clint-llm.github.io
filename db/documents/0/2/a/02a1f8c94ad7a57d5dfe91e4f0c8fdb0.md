Hyperammonemia is a metabolic abnormality that can occur in multiple disorders and can result in serious complications that need to be recognized and treated early. More than 90% of the patients develop hyperammonemia as a result of liver dysfunction, but various other diseases, that can lead to life-threatening complications fairly early in the disease course, need to be kept in mind. Health-care providers need to be well aware of the causes, pathophysiology, clinical signs and symptoms, and treatment strategies for managing hyperammonemia and the underlying defect contributing to the condition. An approach with effective interprofessional communication is required to ensure patient care. The interprofessional team includes internists, gastroenterologists, pediatricians, neonatologists, neurologists, general surgeons, urologists, hematologists, nurses, and pharmacists. Consultations with nephrologists for hemodialysis, dieticians, and geneticists for genetic counseling are needed in most cases. Emphasis should be placed on enhancing patient-centered care and safety, and all efforts should be targeted towards enhancing patient outcomes.
