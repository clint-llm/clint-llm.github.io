A thorough and detailed history and physical examination of the injured hand should be performed as part of the initial clinical assessment. Evaluation should be completed prior to administration of local anesthesia or sedation to accurately detect any potential neurological or vascular injury. Collecting a patient's history should include age, handedness, occupation, mechanism of injury (including how the hand was positioned during insult), time of injury, previous attempts at treatment, history of tobacco use, and tetanus vaccine/booster dose status.

Physical examination should characterize and document the location and depth of any/all wounds, evaluate the hand's resting position, assess the arterial supply to the digit, utilize a handheld Doppler probe when unable to obtain palpable pulses, and carefully perform neurological testing. Learning the finger position at the time of injury may provide insight into the position of the distal tendon stump. If the finger was in flexion during injury, the level of the tendinous insult would be distal to the associated skin laceration, while a finger injured in the extended position will reveal a tendon stump close to the overlying skin violation.
