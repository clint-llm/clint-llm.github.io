In a study assessing mortality outcomes in a multicity cohort performed by Galeas et al., the median time from diagnosis to mortality was 21.1 months which was about 50% of that for patients with polycythemia vera. Along with this, the study also reported a 5% incidence of thrombotic episodes in patients with secondary erythrocytosis. However, the prognosis has been closely associated with the underlying etiology and the development of complications.
