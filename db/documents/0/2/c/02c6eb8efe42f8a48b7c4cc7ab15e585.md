Prostaglandin E2 administration should only take place in a specialized care setting under clinician supervision.

**Suppository**

Patients should be monitored for adverse effects, especially pyrexia, and the drug should be stopped if any severe adverse reactions occur. Abortion via prostaglandin E2 suppository may be incomplete, which may require further measures such as dilation and curettage.

**Gel/Insert**

Uterine activity, fetal status, and progression of cervical dilation all require monitoring. Â In particular, the healthcare team should look for any signs of uterine hyperstimulation, sustained uterine contractions, and fetal distress. If these or any other adverse effects present, the insert should be removed and drug administration stopped. Prostaglandin E2 should also be discontinued before amniotomy and before the administration of oxytocin.
