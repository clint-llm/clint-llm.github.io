Proper patient education on dosage and use of the prescription EPA-only icosapent ethyl and DHA/EPA formulations are necessary to ensure that the patient achieves the therapeutic benefits. The responsibility of the interprofessional healthcare team, including physicians, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, etc. is to ensure the patient is aware of the possible adverse effects, especially for individuals on polypharmacy with multiple comorbidities, like those with hepatic and pancreatic impairment, those taking anticoagulants, and individuals with a possible fish sensitivity. Proper physician education on considerations when prescribing, monitoring, and stopping treatment is also necessary.

Current FDA guidelines approve DHA and EPA for use in patients with very high triglycerides in conjunction with proper diet and exercise. The patient should be encouraged to eat a balanced diet (low in cholesterol) and regular exercise. Routine monitoring should occur when prescribing icosapent ethyl (EPA only) and DHA/EPA formulation to patients with hypertriglyceridemia to check the level of triglycerides and AST and ALT for hepatic function. Care is also necessary when prescribing EPA and DHA to pregnant and nursing patients because of unknown toxicity to the fetus and infant. Additionally, pharmacists and physicians should inform the patient that better absorption of EPA and DHA occurs when co-administered with food.

The healthcare team should remain knowledgeable of other potential indications for DHA and EPA use. It is also available over the counter, and patients may take it even if it isÂ not recommended. Physicians and pharmacists could help patients taking over-the-counter EPA and DHA supplements by informing them of foods that they could incorporate into their diet if they wanted to stop using the supplements. Furthermore, physicians should inquire about patients' diets to ensure proper DHA and EPA levels are achieved and fish high in methyl mercury are avoided.
