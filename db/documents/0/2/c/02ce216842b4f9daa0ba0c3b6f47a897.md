Seizure activity manifests when the brain's electrical impulses discharge abnormally, resulting in disrupting or dysregulation of normal neuronal communication. Seizures, whether isolated or recurrent, originate from the brain's cerebral cortex or hippocampus region.

The 2017 International League Against Epilepsy classification of seizures makes a point of the onset/origin of the seizure in the brain.

The international classification also divides partial seizures into two categories based on their respective etiologies: idiopathic partial seizures in which the cause is suggested to have a genetic component, and cryptogenic/symptomatic partial seizures in which the cause is acquired.

The diagnosis of epilepsy may negatively impact psychosocial behavior and cognitive function. Therefore, patients consequently develop comorbid conditions or manifest side effects of neuro-modulating medication. Thus, there is an increasingly evident demand for concurrentÂ interprofessional approaches to optimize the treatment of epilepsy in an effort to ensure a better quality of life.
