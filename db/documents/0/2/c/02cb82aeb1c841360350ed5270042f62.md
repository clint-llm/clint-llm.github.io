The optic stalk is apparent during the fourth gestational week and ultimately becomes the optic nerve. The lumen of the optic stalk is continuous with the diencephalon of the forebrain proximally, and the optic vesicle distally. The lateral walls of the optic vesicle invaginate forming the optic cup, which develops into the retina. Invagination also occurs on the inferior surface of the optic stalk and vesicle, forming the choroidal fissure. Located within this fissure are the hyaloid artery and vein, which ultimately become the central retinal artery and vein after fusion of the fissure.

The optic nerve is a CNS structure arising from the diencephalon. As a CNS structure, the optic nerve is myelinated by oligodendrocytes and is ensheathed in the three meningeal layers. The myelination process begins centrally, and as discussed earlier, terminates at the lamina cribrosa. During or shortly following birth, nearly all optic nerve fibers will have been myelinated. The three meningeal layers surrounding the optic nerve are continuous with the three meningeal layers of the brain. As a result, increased intracranial pressure may propagate from the intracranial subarachnoid space to the perineural subarachnoid space, producing papilledema seen on fundoscopy.
