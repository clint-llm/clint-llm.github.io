The exact reason why NBS develops is not fully understood, but hyperalgesia is seen in about 6% of patients who are taking opioids chronically. The syndrome can profoundly affect the quality of life and often necessitate multiple visits to the emergency room and hospital admissions. NBS is managed by gradually withdrawing the opioid, and at the same time, preventing the withdrawal symptoms and pain with the use of antidepressants, clonidine, and benzodiazepines. In addition, many patients require laxatives and newer peripheral opioid antagonists to treat constipation. All patients benefit from psychosocial therapy at the same time to prevent relapse.

Narcotic bowel syndrome can easily be confused with several other disorders of the gastrointestinal tract.

Some of the key features about NBS is the difficulty in making the diagnosis, the real possibility of treating the pain inappropriately and its impact on the quality of life. Inappropriate therapy may include increasing the dose of the opioid for pain relief, referring the patient for invasive diagnostic procedures or consulting with a surgeon to rule out mesenteric ischemia. However, the majority of these patients are inappropriately treated with proton pump inhibitors, laxatives, and dietary manipulations.
