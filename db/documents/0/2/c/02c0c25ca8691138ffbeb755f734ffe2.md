Actinic prurigo is a chronic disease process and can reoccur with repeated sun exposure. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents like thalidomide and cyclosporine A has been shown to be effective at long-term suppression of symptoms. Some adolescents may have spontaneous resolution of symptoms and may not demonstrate disease progression into adulthood.
