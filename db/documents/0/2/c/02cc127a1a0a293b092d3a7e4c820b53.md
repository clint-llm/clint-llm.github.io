Cicatricial pemphigoid is a serious disorder that is progressive and can lead to dysfunction of many organs, including blindness. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes nurses and pharmacists. Most patients require high dose steroids and other biological agents to prevent symptoms. These drugs themselves have a number of adverse effects that also need to be monitored. The quality of life of patients with cicatricial pemphigoid is poor and anecdotal data indicate that premature death from complications is common.
