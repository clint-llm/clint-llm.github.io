Overall the patient prognosis depends on intracranial involvement. The prognoses of common temporal bone fracture complications are as follows:

- Facial nerve paralysis: Partial and/or delayed facial paralysis has an overall favorable prognosis with conservative treatment only. Complete paralysis carries a much more guarded prognosis, with ~50% of such patients regaining near-normal facial nerve function.

- CSF leak: The majority of CSF leaks will resolve within two weeks with only conservative measures. Surgical repair of the leak is possible in refractory cases.

- Hearing loss: Hearing loss is most commonly conductive in nature, and due to hemotympanum. Complete recovery is expected. If ossicular chain disruption is present this can be surgically repaired with excellent results. Recovery of sensorineural hearing loss is much more variable, and treatment can include amplification or cochlear implant, depending on the severity.

- Vertigo: Vertigo may improve within several months post-injury, participation in physiotherapy or a more formal neuro-rehabilitation program can improve long-term outcomes.

- Meningitis: Generally resolves with appropriate antibiotic treatment.
