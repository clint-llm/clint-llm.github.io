The complex anatomical structure, intricate interrelationships, and higher functional requirements of the elbow and its key stabilizers have made managing terrible triad injuries more difficult, with well-documented postoperative complications. Although the literature reveals differences in surgical techniques and approaches to involved structures, across time, surgery has been deemed the optimal option for achieving quality functional outcomes.

Management of these injuries requires an interprofessional healthcare team that includes family clinicians, orthopedic specialists, orthopedic/surgical nurses, and physical therapists, utilizing open communication channels and accurate, updated record-keeping.

As surgical techniques have evolved, open reduction internal fixation of the coronoid process, radial head fixation or arthroplasty, and repair of the lateral collateral ligament complex are still associated with complications.

This activity provides the tools necessary to appropriately examine, evaluate, diagnose, and treat terrible triad injuries operatively while encouraging close postoperative monitoring and adherence to therapy regimens to optimize surgical outcomes and decrease the risk of complications.
