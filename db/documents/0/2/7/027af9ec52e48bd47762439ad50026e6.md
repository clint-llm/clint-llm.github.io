Updated standards and guidelines covering the indications, technical procedures, proper handling of radiotracers, and interpretation of PSMA PET/CT scans for prostate cancer are available for multiple PSMA radioligands.

Initiating a new radioligand therapy center requires the interest, diligence, and cooperation of an interprofessional team, including all the involved clinical services and administrative input and support. An organizational plan that clearly delineates the responsibilities of each clinical team member in covering all of the required tasks is essential. Scheduling services, reimbursement, care coordination, patient education, counseling, safety considerations, and financial support are also necessary for establishing a first-class center.

- Every patient diagnosed with prostate cancer faces unique difficulties, concerns, and worries related to understanding the diagnosis, staging, prognosis, and treatment of their disease.

- Patients and their families receive abundant information about prostate cancer from multiple sources, some of which may be conflicting or outdated. They may find much of this information confusing and challenging to understand fully.

- Patients and families who require extra time or help with communication, teaching, or understanding should receive appropriate, comprehensive, and knowledgeable counseling.

- Several imaging techniques can be used to figure out the stage and progression of the disease. To get the best results, each team member must interact with patients effectively and consistently about the available imaging options.

- Because a thorough and consistent approach is necessary, an informed multidisciplinary team is critical when discussing all aspects of disease management, prognosis, and imaging modalities with patients.

- Every staff member plays an essential role in communicating, educating, and caring for these patients, who are often quite physically and emotionally fragile, to achieve optimal outcomes.
