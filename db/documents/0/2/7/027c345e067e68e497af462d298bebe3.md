The pathophysiology of pain rests in the nociceptive pathway, leading to the perception of noxious stimuli in the body. This pathway acts as a protective mechanism in healthy individuals, pointing towards pathologies causing pain and aiding in removing the noxious stimuli or seeking treatment. At the end of life, the activation of this nociceptive pathway leads to pain, distress, and suffering in patients. Most of the interventions are aimed at blocking the nociceptive pathway at various levels.

Pain perception begins at the level of nerve endings that are unsheathed portions of the nerve. There are two major types of nociceptive nerve fibers, the A-delta fibers, and the C fibers. The A-delta fibers are myelinated and allow for fast transmission of signals, leading to pain's initial perception. The C Fibers are unmyelinated and relay pain intensity. The A-delta fibers release glutamate onto the second-order neurons, while C fibers release neuropeptide neurotransmitters. Both of these fibers end in the dorsal root ganglion. They are associated with the first-order neurons of the nucleus posterior marginalis of the relaxedÂ layer I and substantia gelatinosa of the Rexed layer II. These first-order neurons form the 3 major ascending pain pathways, the neospinothalamic, paleospinothalamic, and archispinothalamic tracts. The body has an innate defense mechanism from pain generated by these pathways in the form of the descending pain suppression pathway.
