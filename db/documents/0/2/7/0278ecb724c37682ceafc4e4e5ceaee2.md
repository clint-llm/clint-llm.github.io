The semilunar sensory ganglion (also known as the trigeminal ganglion or Gasserian ganglion) is a thin, crescent-shaped structure situated in Meckelâ€™s cave within the middle cranial fossa.

The ganglion contains the cell bodies of the sensory roots of the three major divisions of the trigeminal nerve (CN V); the ophthalmic nerve (V1 sensory), maxillary nerve (V2 sensory), and mandibular nerve (V3 motor and sensory). Trigeminal neuralgia, when refractory to medical treatment, can be effectively treated by percutaneous interventions at the semilunar ganglion by accessing the foramen ovale through the oral cavity and ablating the ganglion by radiofrequency, balloon compression, or chemical means.
