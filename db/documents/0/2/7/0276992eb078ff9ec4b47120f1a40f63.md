Tissue/organ donation is a complex and multidisciplinary process that begins with the meticulous procedure of determining death. This is followed by a specific set of inclusion/exclusion criteria that determine if organs can/cannot be procured from the donor. Ultimately, this leads to a multi-specialty surgery of procurement and transplantation. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of the donation process and highlights the role of the healthcare team in managing patients post-transplant.

**Objectives:**
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance organ donation and improve outcomes.
- Summarize the barriers to tissue and organ donation.
- Review the role of the healthcare team in tissue and organ donation.
