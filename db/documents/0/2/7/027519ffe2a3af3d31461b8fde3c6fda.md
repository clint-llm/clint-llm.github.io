When visual loss is mainly secondary to cataract formation, the maximal benefit is obtained with cataract surgery. The postoperative outcome depends upon several factors, including the diagnosis, proper perioperative management, and meticulous surgery. Diseases that only involve the anterior segment generally have a better prognosis than those that affect the posterior segment. The visual potential of the eye should be carefully determined before planning cataract surgery, as this will directly impact the visual outcome. Investigations are performed to identify the coexisting ocular pathologies that may contribute to surgical challenges or warrant combined or staged procedures.

**Laboratory Investigations**

- ****Blood and routine investigations:
- Complete hemogram
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
- C- reactive protein
- Blood sugar

- Other tests (based on history and clinical examination)

- Sputum test for acid-fast bacilli (to rule out tuberculosis)
- NCCT scan chest for tuberculosis, sarcoidosis
- Serum calcium,  serum ACE enzyme for sarcoidosis
- VDRL for syphilis
- TORCH profile
- RA factor for rheumatoid arthritis
- Serum ANA, p-anca, c-anca for other autoimmune conditions

**Ocular Investigations**

- Gonioscopy- To look for anterior chamber angle status.

- Laser flare meter - To measure flare in the anterior chamber and can also be used to guide therapy.

- Ultrasound B scan- To look for the status of the retina in case of total opacification of the lens, to rule out choroidal effusion, and identify any intraocular tumors.

- Ultrasound biomicroscopy- Should be done in the eyes with hypotony to look for the status of the ciliary body and its processes, zonular status, status of the posterior capsule, and cyclitic membranes.

- Optical coherence tomography of the macula- To assess the thickness of the macula, presence of any neovascular membrane, epiretinal membrane.

- Fundus fluorescein angiography- To look for retinal ischemia, edema, leakages.

- Perimetry- If any optic nerve pathology is suspected.

- Ultrasound Biometry- For calculation of optical parameters such as axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and lens thickness (LT) which are required for intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation.

- Potential acuity meter and laser interferometer- To assess the visual potential.
