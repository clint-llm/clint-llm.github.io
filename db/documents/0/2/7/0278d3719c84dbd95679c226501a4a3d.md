Conventional coagulation testing (CCT) can be performed in the laboratory setting to measure PT/INR. However, given the higher CCT turnaround time including collection, transportation, and processing of blood samples, Point-of-care coagulation test (POCT) also known as “bedside testing” or “near-patient testing" has been developed. It can be performed at or near the patients with the advantage of shorter turnaround time and improved clinical outcome. POC devices are used in practitioner offices, long-term care facilities, pharmacies, or for patient self-testing or self-management. Potential advantages of POC devices include improved convenience to patients, better treatment adherence, frequent measurement and fewer thromboembolic and bleeding complications.
