- Gastrointestinal abnormalities (34% to 61%) are transient and usually mild to moderate.

- Bradycardia occurs in 25% of patients with acromegaly, conduction abnormalities (10%), and arrhythmias (9%).

- Hypoglycemia (3%) and hyperglycemia (16%) occur due to alteration in glucose metabolism, usually mild in severity.

- Hypothyroidism: In patients with acromegaly, subclinical hypothyroidism occurred in 12%, and goiter occurred in 6% during treatment with octreotide acetate. In patients without acromegaly, isolated cases of hypothyroidism have been reported. However, there was no incidence of goiter in this subset of patients.
