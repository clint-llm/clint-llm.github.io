Ketone bodies are prominent fuel sources for all evolutionary domains of life. The body can use ketones as a source of energy in the absence of a carbohydrate source. Ketones make up 5% to 20% of the human body's total energy expenditure. The liver converts fatty acids into ketone bodies that travel to other organs via blood. This process is especially important when an individual's blood glucose has decreased, and they must maintain an energy source for organs such as the brain. Ketone metabolism consists of the oxidation and utilization of ketone bodies by mitochondria, especially in organs with high energy demand. This process produces NADH and FADH2 for the electron transport chain and delivers acetyl CoA for gluconeogenesis. Prolonged fasting or vigorous exercise may lead to an excess of ketones and cause ketosis. One of the most feared complications in the setting of ketosis is in diabetic patients. When diabetic patients do not receive enough insulin physiologically or from supplementation, they will inappropriately enter ketosis, leading to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
