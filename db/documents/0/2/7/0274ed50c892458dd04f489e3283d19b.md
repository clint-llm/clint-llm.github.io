Aplastic anemia is a condition in which the body is unable to make blood cells that perform vital functions including infection control, oxygen transport, and tissue repair following injury. While there are many causes for this disease, many patients never find the underlying issue. Recovery is excellent for patients with identifiable causes or disease that resolves spontaneously. Patients can opt for bone marrow transplant and additional medications to provide blood products to the body. Monitor for disease complications such as bleeding, cancers or infections, and notify physicians of any changes.
