In a patient who has a winged scapula, the medial (or in some cases, lateral) aspect of the scapula appears to be protruding from the back. As the name of the condition implies, it can create a winged appearance. This abnormal position of the scapula can lead to many physical functional disabilities such as pain, decreased strength, and range of motion disruptions. The ranges of motion that are most commonly affected are abduction and flexion of the affected upper extremity. This activity reviews the causes and presentation of winging of the scapula and stresses the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the causes of winging of the scapula.
- Review the presentation of a patient with winging of the scapula.
- Outline the treatment options for winging of the scapula.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to provide effective treatment to patients with winging of the scapula.
