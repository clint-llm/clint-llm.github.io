While there are no absolute contraindications to bariatric surgery, relative contraindications do exist. These include severe heart failure, unstable coronary artery disease, end-stage lung disease, active cancer treatment, portal hypertension, drug/alcohol dependency, and impaired intellectual capacity. In the case of LRYGB, Crohn’s disease is a relative contraindication. Furthermore, since these procedures are performed under general anesthesia, any contraindication to receiving general anesthesia would also be a contraindication for these surgeries.
