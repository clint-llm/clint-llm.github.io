Automated perimetry, particularly the Humphrey 24-2 visual field, is the most common algorithm for monitoring glaucoma, including NTG. Alternatively, 10-2 fields (especially in advanced disease) and wide-field exams (30-2 and Estermann) can be employed.

Stereoscopic fundus photos of the optic nerve head at presentation provide a baseline comparison for future fundus examination. Photos can be repeated to document change.

OCT technology has revolutionized the monitoring of glaucoma. A variety of methods are in common use but have variations between imaging platforms. All compare measurements of ganglion cell neuron layers against a normative database calibrated for the device. OCT helps determineÂ a healthy optic nerve structure or to document structural progression on serial scans.

Corneal pachymetry is used to measure the central corneal thickness (CCT). Reduced CCT is associated with progression risk. Thinner corneas are associated with the underestimation of intraocular pressure using applanation tonometry.

Larger than normal diurnal variations in IOP are seen in POAG and NTG, with the highest pressures typically in the early morning.
