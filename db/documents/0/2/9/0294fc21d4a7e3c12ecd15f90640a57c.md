Clonidine is rapidly absorbed, with 100% bioavailability, when given by mouth. Its peak concentration in the blood occurs 2 to 4 hours post-ingestion, and its half-life is between 5 and 13 hours. Half the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Toxic exposure via clonidine transdermal patches, while less common, is more likely to produce significant symptoms in those exposed. Patches can contain up to 9 mg of clonidine and, if ingested, may have a prolonged release in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
