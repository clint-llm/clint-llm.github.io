Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is a technique that is used when rapid control of the airway is needed as a precaution for patients that may have risks of pulmonary aspiration. This method is utilized by clinicians across multiple medical specialties, including critical care physicians, anesthesiologists, and emergency medical personnel.

RSI is indicated for a patient in acute respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation, and for airway protection in a patient with an altered mental status.

A systematic approach to RSI is important to ensure the success of the procedure. The clinician should assess the risk before the intervention and place the patient in an optimal position with an understanding of the anatomy involved. All necessary supplies must be available at the bedside, including alternative options to secure the airway in case of failure.
