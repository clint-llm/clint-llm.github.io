Most patients should have pulse oximetry performed if possible. Mass casualty exposures may require triage of resources to those with more obvious symptoms. Acutely exposed patients with significant symptoms frequently will require a chest radiograph to determine the degree of lower respiratory tract involvement. Those with pronounced systemic symptoms (vomiting, altered mental status, acidosis, among others) will require laboratory evaluation which may include serum electrolytes, BUN and creatinine levels, arterial blood gas analysis, and electrocardiography.  After stabilization, pulmonary function testing, ventilation-perfusion testing, and laryngoscopy/bronchoscopy are occasionally used to determine the extent of the injury.
