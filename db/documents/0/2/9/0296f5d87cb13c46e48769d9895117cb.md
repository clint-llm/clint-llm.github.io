The main muscular structures that are part of the mitral apparatus are the papillary muscles and the left ventricular wall. The papillary muscles derive their names from their relationship with the mitral commissures. They originate from the apical portion of the left ventricle, and there are two, the anterolateral papillary muscle and the posteromedial papillary muscle.

The papillary muscles system coordinates with the mitral annulus, so in every contraction during systole, this system prevents leaflet prolapse.
