An interprofessional team is needed to care for patients on ECMO. Once the patient has undergone cannulation with the initiation of ECMO, a multi-facet team must step in. There are many moving parts to running VA or VV ECMO. The perfusion team monitors all the ECMO circuit parameters and makes small changes to better oxygenate and remove CO2 on the ECMO circuit. Surgical or medical intensivists monitor the progression of the patient on ECMO and also monitor the ventilator.

The intensivists must decide along with other team members when the patient is ready for weaning trials or if they need more time to heal their damaged organs. ICU nurses and ECMO technicians are crucial in their role with the management of the patient as they are at the bedside every day. Rehab specialists, along with PT and OT, can work with the patients to help them regain their strength and potential for weaning from ECMO. Weaning patients from ECMO is not an easy task. Every member of the team is crucial to the success of weaning the patients from the ECMO circuit. Interprofessional interventions and communication are vital to the success and outcome of the patient.
