The diagnosis of glossopharyngeal neuralgia is mainly clinical and should meet all criteria as mentioned in ICHD-3. A detailed history and physical examination of the patient is therefore mandatory. A thorough ENT examination is necessary, including a throat exam and neck palpation. All the patients should have basic laboratory evaluations, including complete blood count, basic metabolic panel and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and anti-nuclear antibodies to rule out any underlying infection, inflammation, malignancy, or temporal arteritis.

Persistent symptoms are infrequent and warrant further investigation. Complications, including syncope, should have a cardiology evaluation with an echocardiogram and Holter monitoring.

The primary role of imaging is to identify potential causes of nerve compression at the base of the skull.

**Computed Tomography (CT)**

CT scans do not show the nerve directly but can identify an elongated and ossified styloid process in the axial images.

**X-Ray**

An elongated and heavily calcified styloid process can be present on the cervical spine plain radiograph on the lateral view.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**

Neurovascular compression of the glossopharyngeal nerve is most visible on MRI. Thin section T2 weighted images are ideal for seeing pathology. An MRI with contrast should be performed to see any abnormal enhancement of the nerve, vessels, or surrounding structures. The most common vascular source of nerve compression is the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). The vertebral artery and anterior inferior cerebellar artery are the second and third most common culprit vessels. The MRI can also show demyelinating brain lesions, tumors in the posterior fossa, or any malformations.

**Magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA)**

MRA should also be done to evaluate for a vascular loop compressing on the nerve root entry zone.
