Taste may be affected in many clinical conditions due to inflammation and damage of specific neural pathways involved in taste sensation; this may be due to infection, drugs, radiation, etc. Chemical stimulus appreciation may be affected by mineral deficiencies, e.g., zinc. Impairment of smell due to any reason can also negatively impact taste perception, as mentioned above.
