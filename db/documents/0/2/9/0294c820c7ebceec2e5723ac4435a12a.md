The beta 1 receptor is vital for the normal physiological function of the sympathetic nervous system. Through various cellular signaling mechanisms, hormones and medications activate the beta-1 receptor. Targeted activation of the beta-1 receptor increases heart rate, renin release, and lipolysis. From day-to-day maintenance of blood pressure to manipulation of the receptor by recreational substances like cocaine and pharmacologic therapy including agonists like isoproterenol and antagonists like propranolol, the beta-1 receptor is essential to everyday clinical medicine.
