Women should monitor themselves during exercise even if they have a history of performing intense exercises before pregnancy. Maintaining hydration, preventing exposure to heat or humidity, and avoiding hypoglycemia is important during this process. Warning signs or symptoms of a potential problem include regular painful contractions, vaginal bleeding, dyspnea on exertion, dizziness, headache, chest pain, or calf pain.  If these symptoms should occur, the pregnant patient should stop exercising and consult with her physician immediately. Overexertion and strenuous aerobic exercise are not recommended and could compromise the infant's well-being due to the diversion of blood flow to the vital maternal organs away from the fetal-placental unit. Heavy weightlifting and long-distance running are also discouraged for the same reasons. The pregnant patient needs to avoid the supine position since this will put pressure on the vena cava and compromise blood return to the heart, thus potentially compromising the blood flow to the fetus.

Absolute contraindications to exercise include diagnosis of placenta previa, incompetent cervix, second or third trimester bleeding, preterm premature rupture of membranes, preterm labor, significant heart or lung disease, preeclampsia, or severe anemia. Patients with such high-risk diagnoses are encouraged to ambulate rather than exercise to minimize their risk of thromboembolism.
