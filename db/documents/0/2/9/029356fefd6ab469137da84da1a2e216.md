Failure to diagnose and treat MSUD in a time-sensitive manner can result in serious consequences. Patients undergoing a treatment plan can develop an acute illness resulting in a sudden increase in levels of branched-chain amino acids. This metabolic crisis is usually indicated by the development of clinical symptoms such as extreme fatigue, irritability, vomiting, and loss of alertness. If the patient remains undiagnosed or untreated, the following complications can arise:

- Seizures

- Metabolic acidosis

- Cerebral edema

- Cerebrovascular ischemia

- Intellectual disabilities

- Blindness

- Muscle spasticity

- Irreversible neurological damage

- Osteoporosis

- Acute pancreatitis

- Recurrent esophageal candidiasis due to T-cell suppression from elevated plasma leucine.

- Essential amino acid deficiency presenting as anemia, hair loss, growth failure, and acrodermatitis
