Histopathological evaluation can elucidate in which category does the tumor fall. On histopathological grounds, Nasopharyngeal carcinoma can be categorized into three main sub-groups as per WHO classification:

- Keratinizing type (20% to 25%)

- Non-keratinizing: this type is mainly associated with EBV.  It is subdivided to 2 subgroups:

- Non-keratinizing undifferentiated type (60% to 65%)

- Non-keratinizing differentiated type (10% to 15%)
