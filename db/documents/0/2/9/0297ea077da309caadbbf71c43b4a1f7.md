When the hand is at rest, there is an equilibrium in the forces between the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the hand, especially from lumbricals and the interossei.

Ulnar clawing and Pope’s hand of benediction present similar but arise from different nerve lesions. Ulnar clawing results from a distal ulnar nerve lesion, at the level of the wrist, yielding paralysis of the interossei in the presence of functioning extrinsic muscles. Recalling that the ulnar nerve innervates all the interossei and the third and fourth lumbricals, if the equilibrium is lost, the opposing forces exaggerate MCP flexion and PIP and DIP extension, which impacts a patient’s ability to cup their hand around objects.

Klumpke palsy, or total hand claw, is a neuropathy involving the lower trunk of the brachial plexus (C8 to T1). Deficits to the lower brachial plexus lead to loss of all intrinsic hand muscles. Loss of lumbricals and interossei result in an extension of MCP joints and flexion of DIP and PIP joints. Loss of thenar and hypothenar muscles result in palmar atrophy and weakness in thumb and pinky finger abduction, flexion and opposition. The most common mechanism of injury is hyper-abduction of the upper extremities. Two populations in which this occurs is: in the neonate with upward traction of the arms during delivery, and in adults with traumatic upward traction of the arms.
