Neomycin is a medication used to treat and manage hepatic coma and perioperative prophylaxis. Neomycin belongs to a group of antibiotics known as aminoglycosides, which works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis leading to its bactericidal effect on gram-negative bacteria. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse drug reactions, and other key elements (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) of neomycin therapy in the clinical setting related to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients with hepatic coma, perioperative prophylaxis, constipation dominant inflammatory bowl syndrome, related conditions, and sequelae.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of neomycin.
- Identify the most common adverse events associated with neomycin therapy.
- Review the toxicology associated with neomycin therapy.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance treatment with neomycin and improve outcomes.
