Dysplastic nevi tend to be larger than the ordinary nevi, measuring approximately greater than 5 mm in diameter. They often contain more than one color within them, including light brown, dark brown, and pink. They often appear as a “fried-egg” with a darker papular central lesion and surrounding macular lighter shade. This clinical appearance is atypical, and they often follow the ABCDE guidelines for melanoma, including asymmetry, border irregularity, color variation, diameter (greater than 6 mm), and evolving lesion. Most of these atypically-appearing nevi are biopsied as they are a cause of concern for atypical moles or melanoma.

Dysplastic nevus syndrome involves patients with 50 or more dysplastic nevi. These patients develop atypical nevi in adolescence and adulthood. A patient is said to have dysplastic nevus syndrome if they have five or more atypical melanocytic nevi.

There is a variant of dysplastic nevus described in the early 1990s known as the lentiginous dysplastic nevus of the elderly. This is regarded by some to be nevoid lentigo maligna or evolving or early melanoma in situ of the elderly. These nevi appear in elderly individuals older than 60 years and tend to arise on the back in males and the legs in females.

Rarely, dysplastic nevi can present in an eruptive form, which is primarily seen in immunosuppressed patients.
