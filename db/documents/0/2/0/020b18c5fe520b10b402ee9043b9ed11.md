Thymectomy is a complex surgery that requires input from an interprofessional team of healthcare individuals in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases. Because of the numerous etiologies requiring thymectomy, this procedure requires several specialties, from internal medicine to neurology, to cardiothoracic surgery. Strong communication between specialties can help to properly stage patients and provide preoperative evaluation and risk stratification for impending surgery. Intraoperatively, there must be effective communication between the anesthesiology staff and the surgeon to effectively manage patients with myasthenia gravis and monitor cardiovascular function during these large procedures. Postoperatively, these patients are managed on the thoracic surgery service and require coordination from the intensive care team, including intensivists, nurses, and respiratory, physical, and occupational therapists. By coordinating among these groups with strong communication, thymectomy can be a safe and effective procedure for treating a myriad of disease processes. [Level 1]
