Jod-Basedow syndrome, also known as iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, is a rare cause of thyrotoxicosis typically seen after administering exogenous iodine. This syndrome is often associated with iodinated contrast media (ICM) used in conjunction with computed tomography (CT) scans, angiography, and various other imaging studies. The problem is very frequently missed, and better awareness of it needs to be raised among physicians in primary care as well as in different specialties. It has been described in all ages and although it is expected to be completely resolved, case reports describe occasional remnant thyroid dysfunction.
