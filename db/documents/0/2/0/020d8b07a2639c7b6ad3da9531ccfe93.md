Based on the rarity of cone snail envenomation and the lack of data, it is uncertain whether death is the result of respiratory toxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, or a combination of the two. The effects of envenomation vary based on the specific peptides within the venom and as a result, the effects are largely unpredictable. These toxins have a variety of neuromuscular effects through glutamate, adrenergic (chi conotoxin), serotonin, and cholinergic pathways.
