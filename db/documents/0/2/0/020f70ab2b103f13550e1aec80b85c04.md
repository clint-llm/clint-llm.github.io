Intestinal or bowel ultrasound is a non-invasive sonographic exam of the gastrointestinal tract. It acts as a complementary examination to the standard abdominal ultrasound exam and offers clinical data that could be beneficial in patients unable to obtain CT or MRI examinations for various reasons.

As a hollow organ, the gastrointestinal system contains air and fluid. While fluid is considered a good acoustic medium, the air is a poor acoustic medium that typically impairs ultrasound imaging. Thus patient preparation often improves the diagnostic quality of ultrasound evaluation of the small and large bowel. Bowel ultrasound can be used in the detection, diagnosis, and follow-up of various gastrointestinal illnesses. Ultrasound does not involve radiation and is, therefore, safe for pregnant women and children and for patients that require repeated radiological examination. Operator technique and time allocation serve as potential limitations to this exam.
