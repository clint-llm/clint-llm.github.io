It is essential that patients understand adenomyosis can be a challenging condition to diagnose and treat. The drivers of treatment options are the burden of disease (correlates to a depth of invasion) and preferences regarding future fertility. Additionally, adenomyosis often co-exists with other gynecologic conditions which further complicates treatment planning. While certain minimally invasive therapies exist and data shows promising results, these procedures (ultra-high frequency ultrasound, uterine artery embolization, etc.) are not validated using well-powered randomly controlled trials with unknown long-term outcomes.
