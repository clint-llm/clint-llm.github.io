Unlike most food poisoning, scombroid poisoning is not secondary to ingestion of a virus or bacterium, but the source of symptoms is chemical. Histidine exists in multiple different types of fish, especially dark meat fish, and at air temperatures above 4 C (40 F), it is converted to histamine via the enzyme histidine decarboxylase. Enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Vibrio, Proteus, Klebsiella, Clostridium, Salmonella, and Shigella are responsible for this conversion. Normal cooking temperatures do not destroy histamine. Histamine is then ingested and leads to an allergic-like reaction by degranulation of mast cells. This degranulation mechanism is similar to that seen in allergy-mediated histamine response.
