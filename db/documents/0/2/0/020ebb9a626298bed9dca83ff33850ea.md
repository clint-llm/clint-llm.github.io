- Dancers and running athletes are at increased risk

- Coordinate care between primary care physician, physical therapist, primary care sports medicine physician, and in refractory cases, orthopedic surgery.

- Home exercise programs are an effective treatment modality along with other conservative treatment options, including NSAIDs.

- For refractory cases, ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection can be useful in diagnosing iliopsoas syndrome and directing therapeutic interventions for pain relief.

- If both conservative management and an ultrasound-guided injection fail to provide long-term relief and symptoms return, it warrants referral to orthopedic surgery.

- Postoperative pain following total hip arthroscopy associated with iliopsoas tendonitis (syndrome) is relatively common.
