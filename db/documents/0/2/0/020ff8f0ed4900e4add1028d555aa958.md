In countries like Denmark, where incidence is low requires a high degree of suspicion to diagnose.

Diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenopathy is provided by histopathology along with a smear of acid-fast bacilli and culture of lymph nodes. Fine needle aspiration and excisional biopsy are the gold standard for diagnosing peripheral lymphadenopathy, including tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis.

**Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA)**

FNA is the diagnostic choice with low morbidity, relatively safe and inexpensive, rapid, and simple.

**Mycobacterial Culture**

Definitive diagnosis depends upon the isolation and identification of bacteria from specimens. Specimens inoculated in the egg or agar-based medium (Lowenstein-Jensen) incubated at 37-degree Celcius. Culture is positive in 70% to 80% of cases.

**Excisional Biopsy**

It is the traditional technique with higher morbidity than FNA and causes a delay in diagnosis.

**Nucleic Acid Amplification (NAA) Testing**

NAA is performed where histology and acid-fast bacilli do not provide sufficient information for diagnosis.

**Imaging**

Neck imaging is achieved by ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography scan. Imaging would show tracheal deviation if present, calcifications of lymph nodes, a cold abscess formed after coalesce of multiple necrotic lymph nodes.

**Interferon-gamma Release Assay (IGRA)**

IGRA has high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis.

**Mantoux Test**

Positive Mantoux test (skin injection of tuberculin with induration formation) shows a previous infection or latent TB.
