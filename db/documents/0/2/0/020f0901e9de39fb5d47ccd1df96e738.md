Multiple virulence factors are responsible for clinical manifestations of the S. pyogenes. Bacterial capsule consisted of hyaluronic acid provides protection against phagocytosis. M protein, lipoteichoic acid, and protein F are responsible for the attachment of the bacteria to host cells. M protein is also responsible for inhibiting opsonization by binding to complement regulators and to fibrinogen. M protein is the most important virulence factor for S. pyogenes since experiments have shown that M mutants cannot survive in phagocyte-containing human blood.S. pyogenes also produce exotoxins, like a pyrogenic (erythrogenic) toxin, which is responsible for the rash of scarlet fever and toxic shock syndrome. Other virulent factors include streptokinase, streptodornase, hyaluronidase, and streptolysins, which help in the invasion of tissues.
