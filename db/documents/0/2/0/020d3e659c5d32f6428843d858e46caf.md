The contraindications for transcutaneous blepharoplasty are similar to those for any purely elective or aesthetic surgery. Most are relative contraindications and can include:

**Absolute Contraindications**

- Patients with unrealistic goals of surgery

- Only-seeing eye

- Active blepharitis or hordeolum

- Uncontrolled glaucoma

- Active myasthenia gravis

**Relative Contraindications**

- Significant medical comorbidities rendering surgery unsafe (uncontrolled hypertension, heart failure, pulmonary disease, bleeding dyscrasias, and many others)

- History of hypertrophic scarring or keloid formation

- History of pemphigus vulgaris or Stevens-Johnson syndrome

- Anticoagulant therapy: Should be stopped 1 to 2 weeks prior to surgery

- Pseudoproptosis or proptosis: The conditions such as thyroid orbitopathy can also present with fat prolapse with or without proptosis because of increased orbital volume. These patients may have lid retraction, lid lag, and muscle restriction, causing diplopia. These patients may require orbital decompression instead of blepharoplasty.
