Patients with superficial thrombophlebitis should have compressive ultrasonography of both the affected and contralateral limb to evaluate for concomitant venous thromboembolic disease.

Anticoagulation with fondaparinux 2.5 mg/day should be considered in patients with superficial thrombophlebitis in the lower extremity that is at least 5 cm in length; SVT proximal to the knee, especially within 10 cm of the saphenofemoral junction; the presence of severe symptoms; greater saphenous vein involvement; previous SVT/venous thromboembolic disease; active malignancy; or recent surgery.

Experts do not routinely recommend investigation for thrombophilia and underlying malignancy.

In patients with migratory thrombophlebitis, further investigations for visceral malignancy should ensue.
