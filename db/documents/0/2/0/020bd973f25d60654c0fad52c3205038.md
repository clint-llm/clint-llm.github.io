Various forms of cardiac dysfunction can cause cardiogenic shock.

The most common causes of cardiogenic shock include:

- Acute myocardial ischemia

- Mechanical defect: acute mitral regurgitation (papillary muscle rupture), ventricular wall rupture (septal or free wall), cardiac tamponade, left ventricular outflow obstruction (hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [HOCM], aortic stenosis [AS]), Left ventricular inflow obstruction (MS, atrial myxoma)

- Contractility defect: ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, septic shock with myocardial depression, myocarditis

- Pulmonary embolus (right ventricular with or without left ventricular failure)

- Right ventricular failure

- Aortic dissection

- Other causes include cardiotoxic drugs (doxorubicin), medication overdose (beta/calcium channel blockers), metabolic derangements (acidosis), electrolyte abnormalities (calcium or phosphate)

Risk of Cardiogenic shock after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI):

- Age more than 70 years

- Systolic blood pressure less than 120 mmHg

- Sinus tachycardia or bradycardia

- A long duration of symptoms before treatment
