MNTI is a rare tumor. According to the recent systematic reviews, there are only around 500 cases reported worldwide, with the highest reports from the United States, followed by India, Germany, and Brazil. Only 32 countries in the world reported MNTI cases. The prevalence of MNTI is slightly higher in males than females (1.3 to 1). Most reported cases are located in the head and neck region of infants with a mean age of 6.5 months. The maxilla (62%) is the most common site for this neoplasm, followed by the skull (15%) and the mandible (8%). However, in rare cases, it could arise in different locations other than the head and neck, such as ovaries, testis, femur, and others.

The metastasis rate for this neoplasm is approximately 3%. This neoplasm is a fast-growing tumor, leading to an aggressive compression of adjacent structures. As such, the excision of the tumor is the most common modality of treatment, and local recurrence was 20%.
