Several types of spinocerebellar ataxia are associated with anticipation, in which there is a tendency of gradual expansion of CAG repeats in a consecutive generation. CAG repeat expansion occurs in SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, and 17.  Similarly, SCA 10 is caused by the expansion of ATTCT (pentanucleotide), SCA 31, 36, 37 involve amplification of TGGAA (pentanucleotide),  GGCCTG (hexanucleotide), and ATTTT (pentanucleotide) respectively. Other SCA subtypes are rarer and involve other repeat expansions or single nucleotide variants.
