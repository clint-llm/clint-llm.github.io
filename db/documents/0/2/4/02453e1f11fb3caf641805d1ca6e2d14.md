No muscles attach directly to the femoral head, but many muscles cross the hip joint to allow flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, internal rotation, and external rotation of the thigh. The psoas major, iliacus, sartorius (also aids in abduction and internal rotation), rectus femoris, and pectineus allow for flexion. The gluteus maximus and hamstring muscles (semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and biceps femoris) allow for extension. The gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fascia latae allow for abduction and external rotation. The adductors (adductor longus/brevis/magnus) gracilis, and pectineus allow for adduction. The obturator muscles, gemellus, quadratus femoris, gluteus maximus, and piriformis allow for internal rotation.
