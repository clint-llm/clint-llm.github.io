The use of MRIs allows non-invasive imaging of the human brain; however, neuroanatomy is quite complex. Many studies to understand pathological processes and the effects of medication are performed using mice or other animals. The mouse brain is similar to that of a human. However, mice may show different physiologic responses in a study. Mice may not experience certain side effects of a medication that a human would and vice versa.
