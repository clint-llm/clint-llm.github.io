- The diagnosis of YNS requires two of the following: yellow nails, lymphedema, and pulmonary disease.

- YNS is often misdiagnosed as onychomycosis; however, histopathological analysis of nail samples is negative for fungus. Similarly, examination under Wood's lamp is typically negative.

- YNS can mimic heart failure, a far more common condition, as it also can present with dyspnea on exertion, pleural effusion, and lower extremity edema.

- Treatment for YNS is generally supportive and focused on treating symptoms. Oftentimes, symptoms improve regardless of intervention but usually recur.

- Lymphoscintigraphy is a method used to assess lymphatic function. Testing is typically abnormal in patients with YNS but is less severe than those with primary lymphedema.

- The exact mechanism of YNS is unknown, but it is thought to be due to functional impairment in the lymphatic system that leads to changes in capillary permeability.
