Neonatal myasthenia gravis (MG) is a temporary form of MG. Babies born to mothers with MG are susceptible to it. This is due to the motherâ€™s antibodies cross over to the baby. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of neonatal MG and highlights the role of the healthcare team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of neonatal myasthenia gravis.
- Review the pathophysiology of neonatal myasthenia gravis.

- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with neonatal myasthenia gravis.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate management for neonatal myasthenia gravis to enhance management during the neonatal period.
