Cardiac rhabdomyoma is a rare tumor. It arises from the striated muscles. It is a type of hamartoma seen in the pediatric age group. Although mostly asymptomatic, symptoms of congestive heart failure can develop. Arrhythmia is also seen if the conduction pathways are affected. Pharmacotherapy and surgical resection are indicated in cases of hemodynamic compromise and the progression of the disease. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of cardiac rhabdomyoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of cardiac rhabdomyoma and its complications.
- Review the steps necessary in the evaluation of cardiac rhabdomyoma.
- Outline the treatment options available for cardiac rhabdomyoma.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance cardiac rhabdomyoma and improve outcomes.
