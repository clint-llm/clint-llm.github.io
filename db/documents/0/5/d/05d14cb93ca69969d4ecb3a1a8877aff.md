Diagnostic basis revolves around history, clinical presentation, and laboratory results, which should include a blood smear, reticulocyte count, complete blood count, bilirubin level, and red cell osmotic fragility tests. Diagnosis is considered positive in patients who present Coombs-negative hemolysis with increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), positive history for hereditary spherocytosis and spherocytes on microscopy, or by a positive result in a specialized test such as osmotic fragility, eosin-5-maleimide (EMA), or acidified glycerol lysis test (AGLT).

Hereditary spherocytosis has a broad severity spectrum, and patients will have different clinical courses. The degree of anemia categorizes as severe for patients with hemoglobin lower than 8 g/dL, moderate for 8 to 10 g/dL, or mild with hemoglobin 10 to 11.5 g/dL in females, or 10 to 13.5 g/dL in males.
