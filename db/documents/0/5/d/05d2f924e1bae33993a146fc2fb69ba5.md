Acute hypertonicity most often affects children and the elderly more than other ages. Patients commonly develop fever, nausea, and vomiting. In children, symptoms can range from irritability, restlessness, muscular twitching, hyperreflexia, and seizures. In the elderly, seizures are rarely present, but patients can present with lethargy, delirium, and become comatose. On the other hand, chronic hypertonicity may manifest with subtle neurological changes because it has more time to adapt to the medium, even when severe hypertonicity is severe.

Conditions causing hypernatremia due to inadequate water intake are associated with:

- Lack of water sources

- A central nervous system disorder compromising neural pathways of thirst

- Tracheal intubation

- Sedation

- Dementia

- Delirium

- Paranoia

- Severe depression

- Degenerative processes like Parkinson's disease

- Diabetes insipidus

It can also result from excessive water loss, such as in:

- Gastrointestinal losses

- Excessive sweating

- Mechanical ventilation

- Glucosuria

- Diabetes insipidus

- Genetic mutation of V2 receptor gene or aquaporin 2 gene

- Medication-induced diuresis

Glucose is an osmotically active substance that causes the movement of water out of the cells and subsequently reduces serum sodium levels by dilution. Therefore it is crucial to correct serum sodium for hyperglycemia, calculated by adding to measured [Na] 1.6 mmol/L for every 100 mg/dL (5.55 mmol/L) increment of serum glucose above normal.
