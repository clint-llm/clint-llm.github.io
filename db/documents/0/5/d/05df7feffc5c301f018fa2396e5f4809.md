Patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures are at increased risk of psychiatric disorders, cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, cardiovascular disease, bone disease, physical injuries, and even premature mortality. The most significant risk factor for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is frequent generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The etiology of SUDEP is unknown; however, different pathophysiologic factors have been postulated to be involved, including cardiac arrhythmia, seizure-induced apnea, and pulmonary dysfunction, and neurogenic cardiorespiratory depression. Although there are no definitive strategies to reduce the risk of SUDEP, better seizure control, and nocturnal supervision can be useful.
