Dry cupping is a one-step technique. Traditional wet cupping is a two-step technique: superficial skin scarification followed by cupping. Al-hijamah is a three-step wet cupping technique: cupping, superficial scarification, cupping.

In Islamic medicine, it is recommended to perform Al-hijamah in the third quarter of the lunar month, particularly the 17th, 19th, and 21st days.

Researchers recommend that cups should be on the skin for no more than 5-10 minutes.

**Suctioning**

To create the necessary negative pressure in the cups, there is manual pumping, automatic pumping, and the fire method. For dry cupping, using fire to create a suction is the most popular choice and the primary method used in China.

In Al-hijamah wet cupping, honey is used to fix the cups and for the scarification, which aids in healing.
