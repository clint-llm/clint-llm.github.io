The lingual nerve is one of the two nerves most commonly injured during oral surgery with the other being the inferior alveolar nerve

The lingual nerve may also suffer an injury during suspension laryngoscopy, a procedure commonly done in otorhinolaryngology. The risk of damage to the nerve increases during this procedure when there is difficulty during the surgery and longer operating times

An increase in the number of second molar implants has also increased the risk of injury to the nerve

Injury to the lingual nerve most often results in temporary symptoms, including hyperaesthesia (increased sensitivity), anesthesia (complete loss of feeling),  hypoaesthesia (diminished sensitivity), and dysaesthesia (painful sensation) in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue

The lingual nerve can also be the target for a nerve block during certain pathological conditions and procedures. Specifically, a lingual nerve block has been found to be useful for procedures and conditions occurring within the soft tissues of the tongue, including minor infections, traumatic lacerations, and pathological lesions
