Sea snake bites occur far less frequently than terrestrial snake bites and most commonly occur when fishermen attempt to remove them from fishing nets. The true incidence of sea snake bites is not known as many bites likely occur at sea and in small fishing villages where reporting bites may be difficult. Although sea snake bites occur less frequently than terrestrial snake bites, the potent neurotoxin leads to a high rate of morbidity and, potentially, mortality if not treated rapidly.
