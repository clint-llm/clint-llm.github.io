Risk factor reduction and aggressive management of comorbid conditions in patients with high-risk HF is key to preventing the associated morbidity and mortality of this disease. In addition to appropriate medical therapy, patients need guidance on self-monitoring of symptoms/signs of heart failure and adopting healthy lifestyle habits such as weight loss, smoking cessation, regular exercise, and alcohol cessation. These strategies can help prevent the development of HF in patients at high risk for the disease and slow the progression in those who are already diagnosed with it. Recent data suggests that in high-risk patients with diabetes mellitus type 2, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of heart failure in patients with coronary artery disease. It also noted a decrease in hospitalizations and other adverse cardiovascular events with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in this group of patients.

The ACC/AHA and ESC recommend patient education to facilitate self-care and compliance. Close supervision, including surveillance by the patient and family, home-based visits, telephone support, and/or remote monitoring, is recommended by both of these associations to prevent adverse outcomes and progression of the disease. Dietary sodium restriction to 2-3 g/day and fluid restriction to 2 L/day are recommended if patients have hyponatremia and evidence of volume overload despite medical therapy. Patients require frequent in-depth education and re-evaluation to ensure they can adhere to the recommendations to have optimal outcomes.
