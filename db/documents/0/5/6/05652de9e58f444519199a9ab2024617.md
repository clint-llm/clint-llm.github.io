- The majority of patients with laryngomalacia will outgrow this condition without any surgical intervention.

- Diagnosis of laryngomalacia is optimal with awake fiberoptic flexible laryngoscopy.

- Severe symptoms of laryngomalacia including recurrent cyanosis or respiratory distress, apnea, and failure to thrive require further workup with direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy to rule out other synchronous airway abnormalities.

- Surgery is generally only an indication in patients with severe laryngomalacia with significant breathing difficulties or failure to thrive.

- Supraglottoplasty is the surgical method of choice and is generally well tolerated.

- Patients with neurologic comorbidities, cardiac comorbidities, and those less than 2 months of age are more likely to require revision surgery for relief of upper airway obstruction.
