Digital subtraction angiography is the gold standard for diagnosis and initial therapy of CCF. However, CT, CT angiography, and MRI may be used toÂ confirm the diagnosis if in doubt and to rule out other potential etiologies (tumor, posterior communicating artery aneurysm, infection, etc.). A detailed history should be obtained, and a physical examination should be performed on the day of the procedure to assess the necessity of intervention.
