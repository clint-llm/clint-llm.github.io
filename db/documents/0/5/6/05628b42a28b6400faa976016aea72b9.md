Acute ankle sprains are commonly seen in both primary care practices and emergency departments and can result in significant short-term morbidity, recurrent injuries, and functional instability. Appropriate initial evaluation and treatment can decrease the likelihood of these complications. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of ankle sprains and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the most commonly injured ankle ligament and the associated mechanism of injury. 
- Describe the evaluation of a patient presenting with an ankle injury.
- Explain how to use the Ottawa ankle rules to evaluate and manage a patient with an ankle injury. 
- Explain the value of a well-integrated, team approach to provide optimal care for patients with ankle sprains.
