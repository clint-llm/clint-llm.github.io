As a first-generation antipsychotic, prochlorperazine can cause a variety of adverse effects.

Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, cholestatic jaundice, and fatty liver are other possible but rare side effects. A rare but very severe condition that can result from any antipsychotic use is neuroleptic syndrome. Symptoms occur over 24 to 72 hours and present with elevated vitals, agitation, confusion, severe muscle rigidity, increased white blood cell count, increased creatinine phosphokinase concentrations, abnormal liver function tests, myoglobinuria, and acute renal failure.

Prochlorperazine may also exert negative effects on melanocytes. In one in-vitro study, the presence of the drug correlated with decreased cell viability as well as reduced melanin content and tyrosinase activity.

Prochlorperazine may have significant adverse effects on children. One study from 2009, examining treatment modalities for pediatric nausea and vomiting, noted that side effects of prochlorperazine are high in children; therefore, patients under two years of age should not use it, and patients over two years old should consider alternatives such as ondansetron (5-HT3 receptor antagonist).
