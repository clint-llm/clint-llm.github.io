Corynebacterium diphtheria is essentially a ubiquitous organism present universally in soil, plants, and animals, including human beings.Â However, C. diphtheria is present almost exclusively in humans, though other animals, including cats, dogs, horses, and other domesticated animals, might also be potential carriers of this organism.

The mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets or contact transmission from an infected host or their carrier. It can also be transmitted by direct contact with the objects or secretions previously in touch with the infected person and or its carrier. After gaining access to the host, the bacteria usually colonize in the upper respiratory tract. They typically do not invade tissue to cause disseminated bacteremia.

Still, the toxigenic strains of these bacteria do produce toxins that are then released into the circulation resulting wide range of clinical manifestations. Exotoxin is released by endosomes, causes a localized inflammatory reaction followed by necrosis and tissue destruction. The toxin is made of two joined proteins. The B fragment binds to a receptor on the surface of susceptible host cells, which cleaves the membrane lipid layer enabling segment A to enter.
