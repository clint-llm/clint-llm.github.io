Although autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease is considered benign, most cases will ultimately develop end-stage renal disease. To improve the prognosis, the treatment should focus on slowing the progression to ESRD. The mean age at which the ESRD develops is variable, and it depends on the form of the disease; it could be at a younger age, as in the teens or later in adulthood. Lifelong treatment could control the symptoms associated with chronic kidney disease, but it will not treat the underlying cause. It was documented that renal transplantation may have an excellent prognosis, especially if the kidney is the only organ affected.
