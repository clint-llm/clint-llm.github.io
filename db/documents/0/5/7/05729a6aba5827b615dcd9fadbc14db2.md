What happens to osteoclasts in space? (e.g., the bones of astronauts)

In the presence of microgravity (μG), there is a monthly bone loss of about 1 to 2%.

The genomic activity of osteoclasts is high, involving maturation, differentiation, and metabolic stimulation processes. In particular, according to more recent literature, we can find increases in:

- c-fos

- DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4)

- jun B proto-oncogene

- TRAIL

- DCSTAMP

- Syncytin-A

Pre-osteoclastic cells with μG show increases in other molecules, such as:

- Metalloproteinase type 9

- Cathepsin K

- TRAP

- RANK

- LC3

- Atg5
