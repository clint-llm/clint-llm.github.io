Ischemic and reperfusion injuries cause damage to the spinal cord by the activation of microglia and astrocytes, blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) disruption, tissue edema, and neutrophil influx.

On the other hand, mechanical trauma to the spinal cord results in injury during two separate phases. The initial direct trauma causes acute compression and disruption of axons and vasculature. In the second phase, a cascade of events of histology gets triggered as a result of the injury, including hemorrhage, edema, inflammation, demyelination, pathologic changes in the neurons and oligodendroglia, as well as microglial and astrocyte activation in an early stage. A later stage consists of scar formation, Wallerian degeneration, development of cysts and syrinx, and schwannosis.
