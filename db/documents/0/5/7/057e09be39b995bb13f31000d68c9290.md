Overall, facet joint interventions are considered to be moderate to low risk procedures.

Complications from image-guided facet joint injections are rare. These include septic arthritis, hematoma, excessive bleeding, nerve root irritation, vasovagal reactions, facet capsule rupture, psoas abscess, dural puncture**,**vertebral artery damage (reported in cervical injections), intrathecal injection, epidural abscess, meningitis, pneumothorax, and phrenic nerve palsy (reported in cervical injections).

Issues such as swelling and pain at the needle insertion site typically resolve spontaneously and only last a short period. Local anesthetics rarely cause severe reactions, and steroid injections may cause local reactions that resolve within 48 hours.
