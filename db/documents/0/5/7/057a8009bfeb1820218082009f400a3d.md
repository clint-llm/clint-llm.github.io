**Prognosis**

Acidosis and comorbidities in COPD patients are poor prognostic indicators. At low pH, intubation and mortality rates are higher. Comorbidities,Â especially renal failure in COPD, have a worse prognosis as the kidneys fail to compensate effectively, resulting in severe acidosis in these patients and a lesser increase in bicarbonate level.

**Prevention of Hypercarbia-Related Complications in COPD Patients**

- Careful monitoring and proper management of COPD

- Smoking cessation

- A healthy lifestyle and regular exercise help prevent diseases that can worsen respiration.
