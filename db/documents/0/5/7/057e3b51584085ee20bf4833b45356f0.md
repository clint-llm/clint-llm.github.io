**Clinical Evaluation**

Establishing the diagnosis of HAP remains controversial, and there is no superior method. In the guidelines for the management of HAP and VAP by Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society 2016, diagnosis is based upon a presence of new lung infiltrate and clinical evidence that the infiltrate is of an infectious cause (new onset of fever, purulent sputum, leukocytosis, and a decline in oxygenation). Clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS), which includes clinical and radiological criteria, is suggested to increase the likelihood of the presence of pneumonia, but some investigators suggest that the CPIS while being sensitive, lacks specificity and leads to unnecessary antimicrobial treatment****

**Bacteriologic Evaluation**

For patients with VAP sampling the lower airways to get quantitative cultures can be done by:

- Blind tracheobronchial aspiration (TBAS), which is a noninvasive technique done by inserting a flexible catheter into the distal trachea via the endotracheal tube. This technique is relatively noninvasive. However, this blind technique prevents direct sampling of the lung segments which have an infiltrate on the radiograph, and this may lead to increasing the false-negative rate. Also, contamination of the suction catheter as it traverses the endotracheal tube and more proximal airways may increase the false-positive rate.

- Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) allows the sampling of the lung segments which are suspected to be affected by pneumonia decreasing the false-negative rate. But, the technique is operator dependent, and contamination of the bronchoscope can affect the results. Also, bronchoscopy can worsen hypoxemia that may not be tolerated by some patients.

- Protected specimen brush (PSB) which can be advanced through a bronchoscope and has the advantage of avoiding contamination with upper airway secretions, as it is not advanced until positioned in the distal airway.

For patients with HAP (non-VAP), noninvasive methods for sampling the lower airways include spontaneous expectoration, sputum induction, nasotracheal suctioning in a patient who cannot cooperate to produce a sputum sample.

All respiratory tract samples should be sent for microscopic analysis and culture.

**Microscopic Analysis**

The microscopic analysis includes the analysis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and a gram stain. The microscopy can be helpful in determining a possible pathogen and the antibiotic selection until the results of the culture are available. The presence of abundant neutrophils and the bacterial morphology may suggest a likely pathogen.

**Quantitative Cultures**

Diagnostic thresholds include:

- Endotracheal aspirates 1,000,000 colony forming units (CFU)/mL

- Bronchoscopic- or mini-BAL 10,000 CFU/mL

- PSB 1000 CFU/mL

**New Molecular Diagnostic Tests**

New molecular diagnostic tests like multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay, which detects an array of respiratory bacterial pathogens and many antibiotic resistance genes, offer the advantage of rapid identification of pathogens and resistance patterns for rapid choosing the antibiotic regimens.
