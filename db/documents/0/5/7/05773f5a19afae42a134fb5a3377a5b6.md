Comprehensive eye examinations are necessary to prevent, detect, treat, and manage the ocular conditions that can lead to blindness. Eye exams should include ocular health exams and not just vision and sight checks for glasses or contact lens prescription.

Many international, national, and local organizations are working to bring more awareness about vision and eye health, provide access to health care, and fight blindness. Research is being done worldwide to study the etiologies of many eye conditions causing permanent vision loss, and to develop a proper treatment to control or cure these conditions. The World Health Organization (WHO) is the leader in working to monitor trends, raise awareness, and coordinate efforts to fight blindness.

Low vision rehabilitation services are available to help patients maximize their remaining vision, maintain their independence and imrove their quality of life.
