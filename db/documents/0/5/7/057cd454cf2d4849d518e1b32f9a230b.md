The complete nail structure is called the perionychium. It is composed of the nail fold, the paronychium (the dorsal skin of the fingertip), the hyponychium (the keratinized distal end of the nail bed which is in contact with the skin of the fingertip), nail bed (composed of the germinal and sterile matrices) and nail. The germinal matrix is located on the ventral floor of the proximal nail fold and produces 90% of the nail cells. It extends to the lunula, the crescent-shaped lighter portion of the nail. The sterile matrix is highly vascularized and located on the ventral floor of the distal nail bed and adds layers of cells responsible for attaching the nail to the nail bed.
