The management of cyanide toxicity is with an interprofessional team that includes ICU nurses, a toxicologist, an HBO specialist, an emergency department physician, and an intensivist. It is important to remember that cyanide poisoning may occur in association with carbon monoxide toxicity, especially in house fires. Stable patients should be sent to the hyperbaric chamber.

The outcomes depend on the age of the patient, severity of neurological injury at the time of presentation, GCS, and other comorbidities.
