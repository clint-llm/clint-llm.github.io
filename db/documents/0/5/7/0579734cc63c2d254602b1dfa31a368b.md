CDC recommendations in the United States currently target 17 vaccine-preventable diseases throughout their lifetime. Ten vaccines covering 14 infectious diseases are targeted for children up to 10 years. They include diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), varicella vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, inactivated poliovirus vaccine, rotavirus vaccine, hepatitis A vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, and inactivated influenza vaccine. Four vaccines covering six infectious diseases are targeted for adolescents. They include Tetanus, Diphtheria acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, meningococcal conjugate vaccine, Human Papillomavirus vaccine, and the influenza vaccine.

**DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, acellular Pertussis) Vaccine**

- The minimum age for the DTaP vaccine is six weeks.

- As per CDC guidelines, five dose series is necessary for DTaP at 2, 4, 6, 15-18 months, and 4 -6 years.
