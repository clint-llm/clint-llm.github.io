The determination of the nerve to be stimulated corresponds with the area where the pain relief is required. Any focal area of pain in the body can be managed by stimulation of the peripheral nerve supplying that particular dermatome. Nerve stimulation is broadly divided into electrical nerve stimulation and magnetic nerve stimulation.

**Electrical Nerve Stimulation**

The mechanism of electrical nerve stimulation is not fully understood, but the idea originates from the "gate control theory."

**Magnetic Nerve Stimulation**

A magnetic stimulator is not an implantable device and works by a different mechanism compared to an electrical nerve stimulator. The transcranial magnetic stimulator is a commonly used application of this technology. It consists of a capacitor that may be able to discharge current through a hand-held wire coil, which then produces a magnetic field lasting 100 to 200 microseconds. When held against the skull, this magnetic field can produce depolarization of cortical neurons. The following mechanisms have been proposed for the therapeutic effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation.

- Changes in brain monoamines

- Changes in cerebral blood flow

- Reduction of oxidative stress to neurons

For the purpose of this article, we will be describing implantable electric peripheral nerve stimulators in detail in the upcoming sections.
