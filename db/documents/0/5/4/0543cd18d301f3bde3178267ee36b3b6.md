**Monitoring for Misuse:**Due to the abuse potential of barbiturates, restricted access started with the passage of the Federal Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act of 1970. Barbiturates are classified as Schedule II-IV based on their abuse potential.

**Evaluation and monitoring for anesthesia:**Preanesthetic evaluation is required when barbiturates are used for general anesthesia. RCRI (Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk) can estimate theÂ risk of cardiac complications after noncardiac surgery.

**Development of Tolerance and Dependence:**Tolerance is a gradual loss of effectiveness such that the dose has to be increased to maintain the same effect.
