The diagnosis and management of NSTEMI are best managed with an interprofessional team that consists of a cardiologist, internist, nurse practitioner, and a pharmacist.

In patients where NSTEMI has been definitively diagnosed or is highly likely, anticoagulation should be initiated. Protocols will vary by institution, so cardiology consultation should be obtained if readily available. This is especially true when there is the possibility of percutaneous intervention, as this may change anticoagulation strategies.

When NSTEMI has been diagnosed, patients should be admitted to cardiac care units for further management. Beta-blocker therapy should be started within 24 hours after the presentation in patients who do not have a contraindication. Unless otherwise contraindicated, ACE Inhibitors should be initiated in patients with an ejection fraction of less than 40%, hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease. High-dose statins should be initiated for cholesterol management. Invasive and non-invasive testing strategies are employed. Both early intervention strategies with diagnostic angiography and intervention are applied as indicated, and conservative medical management strategies are employed.

The outcomes of patients with NSTEMI depend on the severity of the myocardial injury, compliance with treatment and other comorbidities. Patients who do not change their risk factors for the coronary disease have a poor outcome.
