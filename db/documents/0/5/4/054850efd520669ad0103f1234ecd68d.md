- Echolalia is the most common of the echo phenomena.

- Echolalia is a normal part of speech and language development. It improves over the first two years of life. Pathological echolalia persists beyond the age of 3 years.

- Echolalia is a salient speech disturbance characteristically described in children with autism.

- Apart from autism, echolalia has also been described in aphasia, autoimmune disorders, closed head injury, congenital blindness, cortico-basal degeneration, delirium, dementia, encephalitis, postepileptic status, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, intellectual disability, language delay, latah reaction/phenomenon, Pickâ€™s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, schizophrenia, and stroke.

- Echolalia can be immediate or delayed, communicative or semi-communicative, mitigated or non-mitigated, person-directed or non-person directed.

- Applied behavior analytic interventions and speech therapy are primarily used for the management of echolalia related to ASD.

- More studies are needed to enhance the management of echolalia and improve functional communication.
