The glabellar complex consists of the medial brow depressors: corrugator supercilii, depressor supercilii, procerus, and the medial fibers of orbicularis oculi muscles; In some cases, nasalis fibers contribute to form the glabellar complex.

Paired corrugator supercilii, known as brow depressor, pulls the brow medially and inferiorly to produce the vertical glabellar lines.

The procerus is a small thin pyramidal muscle. It originates from the junction of the inferior portion of the nasal bone and upper lateral cartilage. Procerus ascends superiorly to insert into the glabella. Procerus becomesÂ confluent with the frontalis along the medial canthus. This brow depressor is implicated in the formation of horizontal nasal root creases.

The depressor supercilii appears in between the orbicularis oculi and corrugators. It originates at the medial orbital rim near the lacrimal bone and inserts onto the medial portion of the orbit into the dermis of the medial eyebrow, just inferior to the insertion of the corrugator.
