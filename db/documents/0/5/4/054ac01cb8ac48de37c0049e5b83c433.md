Glottic stenosis describes a narrowing of the portion of the larynx containing the vocal cords and glottic opening, otherwise known as the glottis. Glottic stenosis is a form of laryngeal stenosis and can be congenital or acquired. Patients with this condition most commonly present with stridor, although they may also have apnea, dyspnea, and tachypnoea. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of glottic stenosis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of glottic stenosis.
- Outline the use of flexible fiberoptic endoscopy in the initial evaluation of glottic stenosis.
- Review the Cohen staging of congenital glottic webs.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by glottic stenosis.
