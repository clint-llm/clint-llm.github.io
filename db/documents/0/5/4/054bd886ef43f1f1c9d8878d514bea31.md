The intracranial veins are generally less clinically relevant than their arterial counterparts. However, since severe diseases, such as cavernous sinus syndrome, can involve the veins, surgical solutions are necessary. The cavernous sinus itself is challenging to access, and multiple surgical routes are necessary depending on which structure the surgeon is trying to access. Examples are the transsphenoidal-transnasal route, the superior routes (involving a frontotemporal craniotomy), the lateral routes beneath the temporal lobe, and the transorbital route. As for the deep cerebral veins, surgical sacrifice has been shown to cause devastating complications, with one patient suffering extensive venous infarction of the cerebellum after sacrificing the superior petrosal vein. However, a 2013 review showed that careful and selective venous sacrifice is possible and safe in one or more veins.
