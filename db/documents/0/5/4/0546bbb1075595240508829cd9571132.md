Given that iatrogenic pneumothorax is a patient safety indicator (PSI) that is directly related to invasive procedures, most of the pertinent studies and ongoing trials focus on quality improvement and incidence reduction. Central venous catheter insertion is the main cause of iatrogenic pneumothoraces; so,Â patient factors (underlying condition, anatomy, restlessness, previous procedures), procedure decision-making (site, catheter type), and clinical factors are given particular consideration for improvement of outcomes.
