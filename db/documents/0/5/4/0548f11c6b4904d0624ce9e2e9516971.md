The midgut-derived small intestine extends from the duodenum just distal to the major duodenal papilla, the entrance of the common bile and major pancreatic ducts, and the ampulla of Vater and continues for the remainder of the small intestine. These small-bowel segments serve as the chief sites for digestion and nutrient absorption. Contributions from the stomach, like chyme, enzymes from the pancreas, and bile from the liver, all meet in the duodenum for continued digestion and solubilization. Glands found in the submucosa of the duodenum, known as Brunner's glands, are a diagnostic feature of the duodenum and function to secrete alkaline secretions that neutralize acidic chyme from the stomach. The small intestine increases its surface area with microvilli, which sit atop absorptive cells or enterocytes. It is here in the glycocalyx of the microvilli where enzymes like disaccharidases and dipeptidases exist. A genetic deficiency in the disaccharidase lactase leads to lactose intolerance, which can present in a patient with abdominal bloating, diarrhea, and flatulence symptoms.

The small intestine also contains gland-like structures known as crypts of Lieberkuhn. These structures form by invaginations of the mucosal surface of the intestine between adjacent microvilli and house, a necessary cell type known as Paneth cells.

The structures of the large intestine that derive from the midgut are the cecum, ascending colon, and the proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon. The large bowel functions to reabsorb water and electrolytes and to store and dispose of undigested food products. The cellular makeup of the midgut-derived large bowel is like that of the small intestine and includes crypts of Lieberkuhn, goblet cells, and enterocytes but lacks the microvilli present in the small bowel. The large bowel contains muscle bands that run longitudinally on its outer surface, known as teniae coli. When these bands of muscle contract, saclike dilations of the colon, referred to as haustra, form.

The vermiform appendix attaches to the cecum at the connection of the small and large intestines. The appendix contains the same layers as the large intestine, including the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa or muscularis propria, and serosa. The appendix also has a large number of lymphatic nodules and has implications as an essential component of the immune interaction with bacteria found in the intestines.
