Paraneoplastic syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion, and all possible etiologies should be ruled out.

When suspected, a patient should be evaluated with a complete panel of laboratory, imaging, electrodiagnostic studies, and biopsy of specific tissues.

- Complete blood count with differential

- Comprehensive metabolic panel

- Urinalysis

- Tumor markers

- Ectopic hormones level like PTHrP, ACTH, ADH

- Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (CSF)

- Protein electrophoresis of serum and CSF

- Assay of paraneoplastic antibodies in the blood and CSF

- Skin biopsy

- Muscle biopsy is recommended in patients with suspected tumor-related dermatomyositis. Pathological findings include CD4+ T cells and perimysial inflammation.

An international neurologist panel developed criteria for paraneoplastic syndrome affecting the nervous system into definite and possible categories based on the classical neurological syndrome, presence of paraneoplastic antibodies, and timing of diagnosis of the occult malignancy.

- Definite Paraneoplastic Syndrome**:**a classical neurological syndrome with confirmed paraneoplastic syndrome antibodies where malignancy, if undiagnosed, is expected to be diagnosed within five years of the diagnosis of paraneoplastic syndrome.

- Possible Paraneoplastic Syndrome: a classical neurological syndrome without paraneoplastic antibodies or cancer but at high risk for an underlying malignancy, a classical or nonclassical neurologic syndrome with partially characterized antibody but no cancer, a nonclassical syndrome without paraneoplastic antibodies but diagnosed with cancer within two years of developing the neurological syndrome.
