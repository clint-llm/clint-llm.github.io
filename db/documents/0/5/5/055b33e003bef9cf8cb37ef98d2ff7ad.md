Patients with suspected pustular psoriasis require careful evaluation, as the von Zumbusch subtype can be life-threatening. Laboratory investigations should include a complete blood count (CBC) to evaluate for leukocytosis, an electrolyte panel to assess for hypocalcemia, and a liver panel to assess for transaminitis. A pregnancy test should be ordered in all women of childbearing age. A punch biopsy can be performed in equivocal cases. Cultures of weeping lesions may be useful to exclude primary or secondary infections.
