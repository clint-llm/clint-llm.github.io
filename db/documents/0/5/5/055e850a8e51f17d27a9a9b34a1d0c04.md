Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is a type of osteonecrosis due to disruption of blood supply to the proximal femur. There are approximately 10000 to 20000 new cases reported each year in the United States alone.

The majority of the blood supply to the head of the femur comes from the medial and lateral circumflex branches of the profunda femoris, which itself is a branch of the femoral artery (the profunda femoris is the deep penetrating branch of the upper thigh). The medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries anastomose to form a ring around the neck of the femur, from which many small arteries branch off to perfuse the femoral head. Another direct source of blood supply is from the foveal artery, aka the artery of the ligamentum teres. The ligamentum teres is the ligament connecting the head of the femur to the acetabulum. The foveal artery runs within the ligament, though its contribution is only significant in pediatric populations.
