There are many causes ofÂ left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO). Thus the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a pediatrician, cardiologist, cardiac sonographer, cardiac surgeon, internist, and cardiac nurses. Most cases of LVOTO in newborns and children are congenital, whereas, in adults, the cause may be a bicuspid aortic valve or degenerative aortic stenosis. In almost all cases, symptomatic patients need surgery because the obstruction is mechanical. The outcome depends on the patient's age, comorbid condition, and severity of the heart disease.

The entire healthcare team must communicate openly with all team members to address any concerns that arise promptly. This includes meticulous record keeping, ensuring that anyone on the interprofessional team who examines the patient record has the most updated and accurate information on which to base clinical decisions. Nurses will also be crucial in monitoring the patient cond coordinating with the appropriate specialists, particularly if the patient's condition deteriorates. This interprofessional approach will be the best method to achieve optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
