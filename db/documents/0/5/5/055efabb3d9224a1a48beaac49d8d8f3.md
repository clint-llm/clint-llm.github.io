**Pre-Procedure Evaluation**

The patient should be evaluated clinically and through history, including any allergies should be assessed especially to metals such as nickel. The patient should undergo a transesophageal echocardiogram to evaluate the type of ASD and its suitability for repair, such as assessing the rims of tissue around the ASD. The defect size should be measured to size the device. The patient should also undergo a right heart catheterization to assess the pulmonary pressures and the shunt fraction. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or cardiac CT angiography is recommended to assess the defect and anomalous pulmonary vein connections if this cannot be assessed during the transesophageal echocardiogram.

Once eligibility is determined, the patient should be counseled about the risks and benefits of undergoing the procedure, and consent should be obtained. On the day of the procedure, the patient should be evaluated for any active ongoing infections and determine suitability for anesthesia.
