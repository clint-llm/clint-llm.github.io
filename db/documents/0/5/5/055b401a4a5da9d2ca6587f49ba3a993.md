Treatment in viral arthritis is generallyÂ symptomatic. NSAIDs and acetaminophen should be used for pain and inflammation. The use of corticosteroids is usually discouraged and not recommended. In some cases, as in arthritis-related to Hepatitis B/C or HIV, anti-viral treatment alone can lead to the resolution of the joint symptoms.
