Patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia require long term periodic follow up due to the associated complications, as mentioned above. Patients and their parents should be educated about the need for a regular follow up not only with the pediatrician for the preventive health care visits but also with subspecialists to limit the disability resulting from the complications. A detailed list of recommendations for follow-up needed for these infants is summarized in a guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics.
