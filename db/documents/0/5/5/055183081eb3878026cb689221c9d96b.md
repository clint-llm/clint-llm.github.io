During embryological development, spinal nerves develop from neural crest tissue allowing for the formation of dermatomal, myotomal, and scleratomal patterns. The spinal cord begins development during the third week of the embryonic period with the formation of the neural plate and the elevation of the neural folds. Early in the fourth week of development, the neural folds begin to fuse. Late in the fourth week, neuroblasts form and move into the intermediate zone of the early neural tube, and this process continues throughout embryological development. During the sixth week, spinal nerves begin to form and progressively travel from dorsal to ventral.
