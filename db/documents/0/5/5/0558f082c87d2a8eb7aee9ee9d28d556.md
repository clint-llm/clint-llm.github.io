Pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) is characterized by the dispersion of iris pigments from the iris pigment epithelium and their deposition at the back of the corneal endothelium and in the anterior segment.

Early diagnosis and meticulous management are critical components in managing patients with PDS and preventing vision loss due to misdiagnosis. The diagnosis is clinical with classical signs such as Kruckenberg spindles, pigments in the anterior chamber, trabecular meshwork,  concave iris configuration, diffuse iris transillumination defects, pigments on the anterior lens surface with Scheie stripe and Zentmayer ring of pigments.

The diagnosis is made by basic glaucoma investigations like intraocular pressure measurement, gonioscopy, visual field assessment, anterior and posterior segment OCT. The treatment can be medical management with antiglaucoma drugs, laser therapy, and filtration surgery.

The most common clinical feature was trabecular meshwork pigmentation in approximately 85% of patients, followed by refractive error and iris transillumination defects. Ultimately, 66% of PDS patients responded well to medical therapy, and nonresponders required filtration surgery.
