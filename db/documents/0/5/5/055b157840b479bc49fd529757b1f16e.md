MGD is a widespread disorder prevalent worldwide. A meta-analysis by Hassanzadeh et al. found the estimated pooled global prevalence of MGD 35.8%.

TheÂ researchers also found that whites had more frequent eyelid vascularity abnormalities (31% versus 1%, p-value <0.0005). There were no significant inter-racial differences noted in regards to meibum quality. Badian et al., in their study from the United States, studied subjective dry eye patients and found MGD prevalence as high as 93.8% among these patients. Further, they did not report significant differences based on age (p-value 0.302) or gender (p-value 0.079).
