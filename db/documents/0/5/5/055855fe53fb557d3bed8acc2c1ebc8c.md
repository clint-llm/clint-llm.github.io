WHO staging system classifies the disease into four stages based on the number of lesions, the involvement of Lymph nodes and distant metastases

- Stage I when the disease is restricted to one lesion without any Lymph Node Involvement

- Stage II when a solitary skin lesion involves the adjacent Lymph Nodes.

- Stage III when lesions are multiple or a large lesion invades deep into the skin with or without the involvement of Lymph Nodes.

- Stage IV when mast cell tumor has metastasized. Usually metastasizes to Spleen, Liver or Bone Marrow.
