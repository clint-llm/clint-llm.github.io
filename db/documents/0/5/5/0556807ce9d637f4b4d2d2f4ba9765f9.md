The following represents the typical presentation of Pellegrini Stieda Disease in a clinical setting: A thirty-year-old male presents to your clinic with a history of knee-to-knee collision to the medial right knee about three weeks ago during a recreational soccer game with acute pain that resolved after rest and ice. He now presents with new onset right medial knee pain and decreased range-of-motion of the right knee joint.
