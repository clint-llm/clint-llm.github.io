If a patient is having a surgical intervention for the treatment of mitral valve disease, it is critically important to measure the TV annulus with echocardiography to assess their need for TV surgical intervention in the case of concomitant TV regurgitation.

**Indications for Repair**

- Severe tricuspid stenosis with associated symptoms (gradient > 5cm or surface area <1 cm)

- Severe primary or secondary tricuspid regurgitation with symptoms

- When the patient is undergoing left-sided valve surgery with moderate to severe primary tricuspid regurgitation or tricuspid stenosis (symptomatic or asymptomatic) or mild to moderate progressive functional (secondary) tricuspid regurgitation with a dilated annulus (>40 mm or >21 mm/m2)

- The endocarditis of the tricuspid valve

- Progressive right ventricular dilatation and/or dysfunction in the setting of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic primary tricuspid regurgitation

- Carcinoid involvement of the tricuspid valve

- Congenital malformations of the tricuspid valve

- Traumatic or iatrogenic injuries to the valve due to pacemaker wires or due to taking biopsies of the heart or lungs

- Undergoing other cardiac procedures with tricuspid disease
