Phytonadione (vitamin K1) is FDA approved for anticoagulant-induced hypoprothrombinemia deficiency caused by coumarin or indanedione derivatives, hypoprothrombinemia due to antibacterial therapy, hypoprothrombinemia secondary to factors limiting absorption or synthesis of vitamin K, and other drug-induced hypoprothrombinemia due to interactions with vitamin K metabolism. Phytonadione is also FDA-approved for prophylaxis and treatment of vitamin K-deficiency bleeding in neonates.

Phytonadione is used off-label for intracranial hemorrhage associated with vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants.

It bears mention that there are two naturally occurring vitamin K vitamers: vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) and vitamin K2 (menaquinone), and they have different physiological roles. Only vitamin K1 will be covered here.
