While magnesium toxicity is rare in the general population, there is a subset of patients at risk of developing this pathology. Magnesium is excreted in the kidneys, and so those with chronic kidney disease are particularly at risk. However, magnesium excretion is only impaired when the creatinine clearance falls below 30 ml/minute. Patients on dialysis can also experience a quick rise in magnesium levels if their treatments are missed. Additionally, the magnesium concentration in cells is much higher than that in plasma. Therefore, patients undergoing cancer treatment, who have high rates of cellular hemolysis, are also at risk. Lastly, women receiving preeclampsia treatment are also at risk for magnesium toxicity due to the high dosage needed to prevent seizures. Identifying the causes of magnesium toxicity, whether through over-absorption or under-secretion, is vital to identify patients at risk for magnesium toxicity and prevent future toxicities.
