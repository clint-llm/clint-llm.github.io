A basic understanding of the external ear and an intimate knowledge of the tympanic membrane and surrounding structures are needed to perform tympanostomy tube insertion safely.

The external ear is comprised of the auricle or pinna, which is a funnel-shaped cartilaginous structure that is continuous with the acoustic meatus and external auditory canal (EAC). The EAC is approximately 2.5 cm in length in adults and has both a lateral cartilaginous and medial bony portion. The tympanic membrane (TM) is located at the medial aspect of the EAC, which also makes up a large portion of the lateral wall of the middle ear space. The TM is a three-layered, concave membrane with a middle fibrous layer (made up of an outer radial layer and a deeper circular layer), giving support to EAC skin laterally and middle ear mucosa medially. The fibrous layers integrate laterally to form the annulus. Attached to the medial aspect of the TM is the manubrium of the malleus, with the tip of the malleus forming a small depression in the TM called the umbo.   The TM has a thinner area superiorly known as the pars flaccida (roughly the upper-posterior quadrant of the TM) and a thicker inferior area known as the pars tensa (the remainder of the TM). The TM is approximately 8.5 to 10 mm vertically and 8 to 9 mm in its horizontal axis in adults, with a mean total surface area of ~85 mm, with only approximately 55 mm of the TM being mobile.
