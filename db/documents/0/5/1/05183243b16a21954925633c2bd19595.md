Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is the name given to describe any deviation from the normal menstrual cycle. The average cycle lasts 29 days with a range of 23-39 days with bleeding episodes lasting 2-7 days. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and the American Congress of Obstetricians-Gynecologist have endorsed the PALM-COEIN classification system that divides AUB into structural and non-structural causes.

This activity will discuss the aspects of acute AUB in non-pregnant reproductive-age women when it is of sufficient quantity to require prompt intervention to prevent further blood loss.
