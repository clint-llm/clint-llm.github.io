Radiotherapy causes DNA break and subsequent cell death. This affects the cancer cells more severely than the normal cells. However, with the growing number of patients receiving chemotherapy, providers come across patients who develop side effects of radiotherapy. Early recognition and prompt management of the acute side effects can prevent the persistence of these effects in the long term. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of radiation toxicity in different cancers and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology and common side effects of radiation therapy.
- Outline strategies for the treatment of radiotherapy side effects.
- Describe the importance of careful patient selection and tailored radiotherapy regimens to minimize complications.
- Explain the importance of monitoring the development of late side effects in long-term radiotherapy survivors.
