Although there are no mandatory requirements for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) with risperidone, monitoring plasma concentrations for this medication is strongly recommended by European guidelines because of data showing interdependent variability. Therapeutic monitoring can benefit assessing compliance and identifying low drug concentrations that may be low, resulting in therapeutic failure. Also, monitoring the drug level can aid in evaluating potential drug interactions and side effects.

Specific parameters should be monitored while the patient is on antipsychotics, especially in children who are more sensitive to adverse effects. When using risperidone, the clinician may derive patient benefit by monitoring serum prolactin level, hepatic functioning, metabolic functioning, thyroid functioning, weight/BMI, height, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, fasting lipid profile, and QTc.
