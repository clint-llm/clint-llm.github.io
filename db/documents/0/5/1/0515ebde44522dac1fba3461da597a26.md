Protein S deficiency can be congenital or acquired. Mutations in the PROS1 gene cause congenital protein S deficiency.PROSÂ mutations are point mutations, such as transversion mutations, that produce a premature stop codon and thus result in a truncated protein S molecule.PROS mutations have been described and may result in three different forms of protein S deficiency:

- Type 1: quantitative defect presenting with low levels of total protein S (TPS) and free protein S (FPS), with reduced levels of protein S activity

- Type 2 (also known as type 2b): Decreased protein S activity, with normal levels of TPS and FPS antigens

- Type 3 (also known as Type 2a): quantitative defect presenting with normal levels of TPS, but reduced levels of FPS and protein S activity

Protein S deficiency is an autosomal dominant pathology. Mutations in a single copy in heterozygous individuals cause mild protein S deficiency, whereas individuals with homozygous mutations present with severe protein S deficiency.

Causes of acquired fluctuations in protein S levels may include:

- Vitamin K-antagonist therapy

- Chronic infections

- Severe hepatic disease

- Systemic lupus erythematosus

- Myeloproliferative disorders

- Nephritic syndrome

- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

- The risk of VTE is also increased in patients using oral contraceptives and pregnancy
