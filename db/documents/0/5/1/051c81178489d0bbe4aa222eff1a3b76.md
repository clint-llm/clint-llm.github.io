The most common cause of large bowel obstruction is an underlying colorectal malignancy. Approximately 40% of colorectal cancers present as emergencies and large bowel obstruction is the most common presentation.

Benign causes of large bowel obstruction are strictures secondary to diverticular disease or inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as volvulus, most commonly of the sigmoid colon. Occasionally the sigmoid colon can get obstructed in a left inguinal hernia sac.

External compression occurs most likely in the pelvis, secondary to gynecological malignancies.
