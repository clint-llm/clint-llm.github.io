The motor function of the rhomboid muscles is controlled by the dorsal scapular nerve (DSN). The dorsal scapular nerve originates from the ventral ramus of the spinal nerve root C5 and courses posterior inferiorly through the middle scalene muscles and between the posterior scalene, levator scapulae (to which it also provides innervation), and the serratus posterior superior. It continues deep to the brachial plexus to innervate both the rhomboid minor and major muscles at their anterior border.
