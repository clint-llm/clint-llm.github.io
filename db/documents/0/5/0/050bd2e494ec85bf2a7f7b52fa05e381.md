Voclosporin is a novel calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) that was developed and approved for treating lupus nephritis (LN). Voclosporin is a cyclosporine A analog with a modification of the functional group on the amino acid 1 residue.

Voclosporin was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA on January 22, 2021, specifically for the treatment of adults with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis (LN) class III, IV, or V (class V alone or in combination with class III or IV). It is intended to be utilized in conjunction with background immunosuppressive therapy as part of the treatment regimen for LN.

In Europe, voclosporin was approved by European Medicines Agency (EMA) on September 15, 2022. It is recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism and European Renal Association (EULAR/ERA) as an addition to a background regimen of mycophenolate mofetil and low-dose glucocorticoids in patients with LN.
