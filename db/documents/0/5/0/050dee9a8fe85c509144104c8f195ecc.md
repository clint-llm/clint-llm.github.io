Incomplete abortions occur in women that are <20 weeks pregnant. They occur more frequently in women with advanced maternal age and women with lower socioeconomic status or those who engage in risky behaviors. The risk factors and patient population most commonly affected mimic those of spontaneous abortion. Women in third-world countries or those who live in areas with poor access to healthcare are also at increased risk of incomplete abortions after a medically or surgically induced abortion.

Women who have been diagnosed with hydatidiform moles, typically aged 15Â to 20 years old, have a 13% chance of incomplete abortion.
