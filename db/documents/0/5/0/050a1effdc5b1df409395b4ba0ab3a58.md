**Preprocedural Imaging, Laboratory Analysis, and Consent**

Patients should only be deemed appropriate candidates following the evaluation of their specific case either via multidisciplinary tumor board or in conjunction with surgical and oncology services, as resection still represents the best curative option for good surgical candidates with appropriate hepatic reserve. Patients that are deemed appropriate for RF require an imaging workup prior to the procedure. This typically includes a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and/or gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for both tumor staging and planning of RFA needle trajectory.

Laboratory evaluation is performed on all patients. Tests typically include coagulation studies, liver function studies, and tumor marker levels. A histological tissue sample confirming the diagnosis (or pathognomonic image findings with high levels of concordant tumor markers) is required for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

Finally, patients deemed candidates for percutaneous hepatic RFA must meet with the physician, typically an interventional radiologist, who will be performing the procedure to discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure. Patient questions are answered at that time.

**Anesthesia**

Percutaneous RFA is typically performed under general anesthesia, although the use of local anesthesia and mild/deep sedation have been described in the literature. The type of anesthesia will play a role in determining if the procedure is performed as an outpatient, same day, or overnight stay. General anesthesia is usually preferred by most interventionalists as it allows patients to better tolerate any discomfort associated with the procedure. Interestingly, at least one study demonstrated a reduction in tumor recurrence in patients who underwent percutaneous RFA for small hepatocellular carcinomas under general anesthesia.

**Positioning**

Positioning depends entirely on the imaging modality utilized for the procedure, the location of the tumor(s), the type of anesthesia, and physician/patient preferences. The goal is to avoid compromising the ability of the interventionalist to see and treat the tumor satisfactorily.
