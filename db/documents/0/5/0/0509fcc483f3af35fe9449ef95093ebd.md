The management of Kohler disease is best by an interprofessional team. While the primary care provider may initially see the disorder, the definitive management is by an orthopedic surgeon. The team may include a radiologist, physiatrist, and an orthopedic nurse. In most cases, the disorder is treated conservatively with close follow up. The outlook for patients with Kohler disease is excellent with no long term radiological or clinical manifestations reported in the literature. [Level 5]
