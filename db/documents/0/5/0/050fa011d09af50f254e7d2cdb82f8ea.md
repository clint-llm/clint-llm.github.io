Plague is caused by Yersinia pestis, perhaps one of the most important bacterial pathogens in human history. It occurs in epidemics and pandemics with extremely high mortality when untreated. Prevention and rapid treatment are essential to avoid large outbreaks and the death of those infected with this pathogen. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of the plague and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of the plague. 
- Describe the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of the plague.
- Review the treatment and management options available for the plague.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance and improve outcomes in the plague.
