No significant toxicity has been found with the topical use of the hydroquinone cream.

Some studies report malignancies in animals treated for an extended period with large oral doses.

**Hydroquinone in the Environment**

In the environment, hydroquinone is a chemical and can be toxic in human and industrial activities by promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species, oxidative stress, and hence the potential for DNA damage. It is a major benzene metabolite and is known to be hepatotoxic and carcinogenic in these settings. Some studies suggest it can promote tumor cell growth and suppress the immune response. It is used in photography and is present in dyes, paints, varnishes oils, and motor fuels. In its oxidized form, it is more toxic and less degradable. It demonstrates high toxicity to aquatic organisms and rodents and may induce leukemia, renal tubular cell tumor, and liver cancer. It has also been found to influence immune cell responses and causes an increase in an allergic reaction by increasing interleukin-4 production and immunoglobulin E levels.
