The simplest prophylactic intervention that can be employed to reduce the rates of traumatic facial paralysis is the routine wear of helmets when performing activities that place the head at risk of receiving a forceful blow, such as driving motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles, operating heavy machinery, and playing contact sports; doing so has been shown to reduce rates of skull fractures.

The use of a facial nerve monitor has long been considered standard practice in otological surgery; however, which limits injuries to the mastoid and tympanic segments of the facial nerve.

Understanding the course of the major extratemporal facial nerve branches as they relate to surface anatomy can mean the difference between a weak face and a happy facelift patient, particularly with respect to the frontal and marginal mandibular branches, which are the most commonly injured during rhytidectomy.

The midfacial and cervical branches are less commonly injured, although both can cause weakness in the smile. Injuries to the cervical branch may be confused with injuries to the marginal mandibular branch because both provide innervation to depressors of the lower lip, the depressor labii inferioris/depressor anguli oris, and the platysma, respectively. The cervical branch can be found 1 cm inferior to the halfway point of a line between the mentum and the mastoid tip.
