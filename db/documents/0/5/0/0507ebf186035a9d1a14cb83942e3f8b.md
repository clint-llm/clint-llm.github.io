Leriche Syndrome (LS), also commonly referred to as aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD), is a product of atherosclerosis affecting the distal abdominal aorta, iliac arteries, and femoropopliteal vessels.Â ****LS was first described in 1914 by Robert Grahman, but it was not until later that the trio of symptoms was documented as a syndrome. This was done by Henri Leriche, a French surgeon, and physiologist, now known as the father of LS. The extent and localization of atherosclerotic occlusions relative to these arteries determine the classification of the disease. AIOD is classified as Type I (confined to the distal abdominal aorta and common iliac arteries), Type II (predominately distal abdominal aorta with disease extension into common iliac and external iliac arteries), and Type III (affecting the aortoiliac segment and femoropopliteal vessels).
