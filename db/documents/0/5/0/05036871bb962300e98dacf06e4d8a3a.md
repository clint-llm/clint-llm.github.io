Simulation-based education is a widely utilized tool for experiential learning. Simulation techniques can employ a range of fidelity to incorporate realism; moulage is one such technique. Moulage was once the art of wax model making to depict certain conditions for medical education. As medical training has evolved, moulage has transformed into the art of special effects makeup to replicate various disease processes and injuries. Some simulation centers have the advantage of having an experienced moulage artist on staff; however, with some brief training, other individuals can learn this technique.
