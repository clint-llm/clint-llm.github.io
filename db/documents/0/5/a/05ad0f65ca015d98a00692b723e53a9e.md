Atracurium is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug of the benzylisoquinolinium class. It is a competitive antagonist of the alpha subunit of the postsynaptic nicotinic receptor at the neuromuscular junction. It competes with acetylcholine for binding sites. The binding of the postsynaptic nicotinic receptor by atracurium prevents depolarization of the motor endplate and subsequent skeletal muscle contraction. Unlike binding of depolarizing agents, binding of atracurium or other non-depolarizing agents does not induce a receptor conformational change.
