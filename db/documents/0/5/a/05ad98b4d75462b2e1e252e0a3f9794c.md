Whether surgical or medical, pannus treatment requires an interprofessional team involving a specialty-trained nurse and specialist surgeon. The primary care clinicians, as well as the nurse, should educate the patient about the procedure and encourage the patient to stop smoking. Since the surgery is elective, the patient should try and attain the desired body weight prior to surgery and must maintain this weight for a defined time period. All medical health problems should be assessed and minimized, and the patient's psychological health and overall expectations must also be maximized. Formal psychiatric evaluation is frequently recommended. The patient should be encouraged to remain physically active and to have completed and planned childbearing.

Patients require vigilant monitoring for extended periods, which entails close follow-up by both the clinician and nurse, with constant supervision and ongoing patient education. There should be close communication between the team members if one wants to achieve good outcomes. [Level 5]
