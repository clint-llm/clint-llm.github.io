Parents should be cautioned about the risks of toys with small movable parts that can break off and use caution with regards to coins, balloons, and cylindrical objects

Adults who have their food prepared by other family members or by caregivers should be given the most permissive and safe diets, which may mean smaller cut pieces or pureed foods. Aspiration risk may be reduced by altering food consistency. If patients experience coughing or choking while eating, drinking or swallowing medications a formal dysphagia screen may be indicated.

Pearls

- At risk are those between ages 0 and 3 and over age 60.

- Leading cause of death among children 1 to 3 years, and the fourth leading cause of unintentional death overall.

- The most common foreign body objects are coins and balloons.

- The most common foreign body foods are hot dogs, grapes, and steak.

- Do not perform the Heimlich maneuver on children less than 1 year.

- Prevention includes parental diligence regarding risky toys, cutting circular foods in half, and pureeing foods or cutting smaller pieces for elderly persons.
