Peripheral vascular diseases are a significant cause of morbidity and limb loss in the United States. Early identification and risk factor modification are essential to improve the outcomes in patients with peripheral vascular disease. This activity outlines the principles of evaluation and management of peripheral vascular disease and explores the surgical and non-surgical treatment alternatives and highlights the importance of the interprofessional team in the evaluation of this pathology. Peripheral vascular disease has been associated with multiple risk factors, including smoking, diabetes, prior coronary artery disease, and a sedentary lifestyle. This activity highlights the risk factors for peripheral vascular disease and the role of risk factor modification in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. The cornerstone for the diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease is a thorough history and physical exam, including the ankle-brachial index. This activity describes the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and diagnostic workup of the patient with suspected peripheral vascular disease. It provides a guideline for the interpretation of ankle-brachial-index readings. The treatment of peripheral vascular disease includes risk factor modification, antiplatelet therapy, and exercise as the cornerstone of care in these patients. Appropriate patients with severe disease or lifestyle limiting symptoms are frequently managed with endovascular, surgical, or combined interventional approaches. This activity highlights the importance of the interprofessional team in the management of patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease and the selection of the appropriate intervention.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology for the development of peripheral vascular disease.
- Summarize the appropriate evaluation for the diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease.
- Describe the management options available for peripheral vascular disease.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and improve outcomes in patients with peripheral vascular disease.
