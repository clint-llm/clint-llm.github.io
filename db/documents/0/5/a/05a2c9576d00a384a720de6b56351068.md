Depending on the investigator's area of interest, various procedures can be used to visualize the retina.

- **Haematoxylin-eosin staining**- to better visualize cell nuclei and neuron components

- **Golgi staining**- to label cells based on their pH

- **Fluorescent-labeled immunochemistry**- to selectively target a specific protein using antibodies.

Fluorescent-labeled immunochemistry has played a significant role in retina histology as well as other fields for its ability to target a certain cell population. The following are proteins isolated in certain retinal cells that can be targetted via antibodies

- **Blue-sensitive opsin (N-terminal peptide)**- cones

- **Na-K-Cl-Cotransporter (NKCC1) -**outer segments of photoreceptors (rods and cones) and horizontal cells

- **Calbindin and Parvalbumin (calcium-binding proteins)**- horizontal cells

- **Syntaxin-4**- outer plexiform layer
