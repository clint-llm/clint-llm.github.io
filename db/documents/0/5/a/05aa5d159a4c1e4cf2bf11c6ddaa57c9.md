The exact incidence of dysarthria is not known, and incidence varies based on the underlying cause. About 90% of patients with PD develop dysarthria during the illness. In ALS patients, dysarthria may predate limb weakness by about 3 to 5 years; dysarthria affects about 70% of patients with limb weakness.

In one study evaluating stroke patients, 28% had both aphasia and dysarthria, and 24% had dysarthria only. In a study of children with neuromuscular diseases, the prevalence of dysarthria was 31.5%.
