Soccer, hockey, football, basketball, tennis, baseball, figure skating, baseball, and softball are all sports with a high incidence of hip adductor muscle strains. This is especially true in men’s collegiate soccer, where 46.5% of all hip and groin injuries are adductor muscle strains.

When patients present with atrophy of the gracilis muscle and atrophy of the adductor longus and adductor brevis, the inclusion of possible injury to the anterior branch of the obturator nerve should be included in the differential diagnosis; etiologies may include nerve impingement caused by a ganglionic cyst that emerges from the transverse acetabular ligament, neoplasm, hematoma, or iatrogenic nerve injury caused by hip surgeries such as total hip replacement.

When patients have pain along the distal portion of their gracilis tendon, where it becomes the pes anserinus, there should be a high suspicion of pes anserinus bursitis, especially if there is edema present. Pes anserinus bursitis is commonly seen in patients with obesity or osteoarthritis or who are female.
