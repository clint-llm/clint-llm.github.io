A recent randomized control trial (RCT), published in the New England Journal of Medicine, was conducted at 18 centers in which patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis were randomly assigned to either goal-directed aggressive or moderate fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution. The aggressive fluid resuscitation was done with a bolus of 20ml/kg of body weight, followed by maintenance fluid of 3ml/kg/hour. The moderate fluid resuscitation group consisted of a 10 ml/kg of body weight bolus in patients with hypovolemia or no bolus if normovolemia, followed by 1.5 ml/kg/hour as maintenance fluid. The patient's assessment was done at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours with an adjustment of fluid resuscitation according to the patient's clinical status.

The trial's primary outcome was the development of moderately severe or severe acute pancreatitis in hospitalized patients. The primary safety outcome among these patients was fluid overload. The interim analysis included a total of 249 patients, and the trial was halted due to between-group differences in the safety outcomes. The incidence of fluid overload was 20.05% in patients who received aggressive fluid resuscitation and 3% in the moderate resuscitation group(adjusted relative risk, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.36 to 5.94, P = 0.004). The trial concluded with the development of a higher incidence of fluid overload in patients who received aggressive fluid resuscitation without improvement in clinical outcomes.
