If a patient has a known hypersensitivity to the drug, then physicians should not prescribe it. These hypersensitivities include severe allergic reactions that can cause hemodynamic instability or loss of a patent airway. Use caution when treating patients with ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, or hypokalemia, as bronchodilators have demonstrated worsening of the effects of these conditions.
