Caries can be acute or chronic, brown-yellow, and soft or black and hard cavities. Pulp exposure may be seen. Incipient caries is more challenging to identify, and they represent the first clinical manifestation of caries. They are white and opaque irregular spots that may appear on any tooth surface.

Patients with reversible pulpitis can present with a severe toothache induced by stimuli, like hot or cold drinks or food.

On the other hand, irreversible pulpitis presents as unprovoked tooth pain that usually exacerbates overnight.

Patients with gingivitis and periodontitis will often present with a history of halitosis, bleeding after brushing teeth, and gum pain in some cases.

In gingivitis, the gums are swollen, erythematous, with a shiny surface, and they usually bleed on probing, but there are no periodontal pockets. Periodontitis involves the migration of the junctional epithelium and the development of periodontal pockets. Clinical findings of periodontitis may include gingival recession, dental papilla detachment, loss of alveolar bone, tooth mobility, or fremitus, according to the degree of destruction

A periapical abscess may present as a palpable swelling. A dental abscess can be originated from the pulp, periodontal structures, or both.

More serious complaints such as fever, facial edema, trismus, dysphagia, or dysphonia can be symptoms of a more serious dental infection that has extended into deep neck spaces.Â Patients may be in respiratory distress or hemodynamically unstable with sepsis
