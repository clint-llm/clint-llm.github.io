In both peripheral and central nervous systems, myelin plays a crucial role in the protection and conduction of many neurons. Myelin sheath acts as an insulator allowing for protection of the integrity of the nerve impulse as well as protecting the axon from foreign electrical impulses. Myelin also yields the formation of the nodes of Ranvier which allow for saltatory conduction and faster propagation of action potentials to occur.
