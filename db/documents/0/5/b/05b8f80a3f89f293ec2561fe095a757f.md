Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in the central nervous system (CNS) may manifest as meningitis, tuberculoma, and spinal arachnoiditis. Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is caused by the seeding of the meninges with the bacilli of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and is characterized by inflammation of the membranes (meninges) around the brain or spinal cord. Approximately one-third of the world’s population is presumed to be infected with MTB. The number of persons infected with tuberculosis continues to increase despite advances in treatment and worldwide efforts to provide accessibility to medications and universal standard protocoled treatment programs.
