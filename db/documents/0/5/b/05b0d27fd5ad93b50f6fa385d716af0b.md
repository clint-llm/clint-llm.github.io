PSGN has an excellent prognosis especially in children with complete recovery usually occurring within 6 to 8 weeks. In adults, around 50% of the patients continue to have reduced renal function, hypertension, or persistent proteinuria.

Death in adults is often secondary to heart failure and renal dysfunction. Studies show that in the long term some patients may continue to have abnormalities in urine, proteinuria, and hypertension.

Mortality during the acute phase of glomerulonephritis has been estimated at around 2 and 12 percent. It has been assumed that the renal changes found in the majority of patients who survived the initial acute attack would be qualitatively similar to those noted in the fatal cases, although little direct evidence existed to support this view.
