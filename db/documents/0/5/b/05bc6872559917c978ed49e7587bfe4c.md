Historically, before antibiotics, tonsillitis and pharyngitis were the most frequent causes of deep neck space infections. Tonsillitis remains the most common cause of deep neck space infection in children, but in adults, an odontogenic origin is the most common. Other causes include oral surgical procedures, salivary gland infection or obstruction, trauma to the oral cavity or pharynx, instrumentation, foreign body aspiration, intravenous drug use, cervical lymphadenitis/suppuration of malignant lymph node or mass, branchial cleft anomalies, thyroglossal duct cyst, and others. There may be no clear source for 20% to 50% of deep neck infections. It is important to consider a suppressed immune system due to HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, or immunosuppressant medications in these infections.
