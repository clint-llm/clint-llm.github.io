On histological examination, cavernomas are seen as abnormally dilated and hyalinized capillaries (caverns) without intervening brain tissue. Gliosis and hemosiderin deposits are seen along the margins. Gross pathological appearance is often described as a "mulberry." Light microscopy shows an absence of a smooth muscle wall layer and electron microscopy shows abnormalities in endothelial gap junctions.
