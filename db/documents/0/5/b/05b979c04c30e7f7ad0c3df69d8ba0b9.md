Rothmund-Thomson syndrome and epidermolysis bullosa simplex with mottled pigmentation have similar poikiloderma. Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis, as well as Naegeli-Franceschetti-Jadassohn syndrome, may have similar reticulate hyperpigmentation. Fanconi anemia has a similar presentation to DKC but is due to chromosomal rearrangement and breakage. Patients with graft-versus-host disease have poikiloderma, and mucosal changes are lichen planus-like.

There are also a few variants of DKC that have findings of DKC with a few other specific characteristics. Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome is like DKC but also has cerebellar hypoplasia and intrauterine growth restriction.
