Chikungunya virus is an alphavirus that is arthropod-borne and transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. This virus causes a rash, an acute febrile illness, and arthralgia known as chikungunya fever which can develop into potentially chronic and debilitating arthritis that may last for months or years. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of chikungunya fever and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mosquito vectors in the etiology of chikungunya fever.
- Outline the epidemiology of chikungunya fever.
- Describe the patient history associated with chikungunya fever.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance preventive measures and improve outcomes for chikungunya fever.
