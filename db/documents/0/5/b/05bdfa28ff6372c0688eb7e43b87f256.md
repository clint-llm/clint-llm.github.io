Colloid osmotic pressure can be calculated using the Van’t Hoff factor equation. The usefulness of this calculation, though, becomes complicated in abnormal physiologic conditions due to several factors including the lack of proportional changes in protein and salts, heterogeneity in the proteins involved, and interaction between the protein. This difficulty warrants measuring the colloid osmotic pressure directly in certain situations.

One method of direct measurement of interstitial colloid osmotic pressure is the wick method,

Another method of measurement called the crossover method involves priming the wicks in several different solutions of various concentrations. COP in the fluid within the wick increases during implantation only in wicks primed with fluid with lower protein concentration than the ISF. By plotting the COP of the priming fluid against the COP of wick fluid after implantation, a linear plot can be constructed with the crossing point of the two representing the true COP of the interstitium.
