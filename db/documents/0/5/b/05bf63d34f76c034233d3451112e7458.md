Typically cases of zinc deficiency respond to zinc supplementation and correction of any dietary factors that might lead to the condition.Â With treatment, there is often a rapid improvement of symptoms. Diarrhea may resolve within 24 hours, and skin lesions often heal within 1 to 2 weeks. Patients with inherited deficiencies should have zinc levels, and alkaline phosphatase should be monitored 3 to 6 months after initiation of replacement therapy and the dose adjusted accordingly.
