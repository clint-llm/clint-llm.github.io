Vascular medicine is the branch of medicine specializing in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of arteries, veins, and lymphatics. Healthcare providers in vascular medicine have obligations to deliver quality in the care they provide to patients. Quality control management is either not a part of the curriculum for health care professionals in vascular medicine in the United States or is of a limited extent. The prevalence of vascular disease in the United States remains relatively high in men and certain ethnic groups compared to the prevalence in other countries. Data indicate that, on a collective basis, American patients receiving care for vascular diseases suffer numerous injuries and deaths due to deficiencies in health care safety. This article highlights concepts that the interprofessional team can use to provide higher quality and safer care.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the role of healthcare providers in why the United States lags behind other countries in vascular health care quality metrics.
- Review the role of healthcare administrators and policy-makers in why the United States lags behind other countries in vascular health care quality metrics. 
- Explain how quality improvement tools and approaches can be used in vascular medicine.
