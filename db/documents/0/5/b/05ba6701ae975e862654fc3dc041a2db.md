While life-threatening causes of headaches in the postpartum period are less common than benign causes, the social and medicolegal consequences of missed or delayed diagnosis are significant.Â  Abnormality in vital signs should trigger a search for a secondary cause of a headache. Any neurologic abnormalities, including subtle findings such as ptosis or nystagmus, should lead to advanced imaging with CT or MRI. Communication of return precautions and red flag symptoms to patients is essential as many of these diagnoses are missed on initial examination.
