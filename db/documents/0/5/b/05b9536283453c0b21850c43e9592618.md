Neurofibromas are the most common tumor of the peripheral nerve sheath, affecting men and women equally, without racial or ethnic predilection. Age of onset is highly variable; however, localized lesions most commonly occur in adults aged 20 to 40 years. The diffuse and plexiform types occur more frequently in children, with the plexiform type rarely occurring after age 5.
