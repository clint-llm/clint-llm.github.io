Headaches are a frequent presenting complaint that disproportionally affects women of childbearing age. The incidence of headaches increases in the puerperium, and these headaches are triggered by the sharp chemical and social changes surrounding the postpartum period. Data and research on postpartum headaches are skewed towards severe headaches as many patients self-medicate with analgesics in the setting of mild or moderate headaches and never seek medical care. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and complications of postpartum headaches and underscores the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the common causes of postpartum headaches.
- Describe the evaluation of postpartum headaches.
- Describe treatment considerations for patients with postpartum headaches.
- Explain a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by postpartum headaches.
