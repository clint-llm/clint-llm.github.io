In cases with no intraocular complications, the routine postoperative cataract topical drug regimen should be followed using steroids and antibiotics. Topical prednisolone 1% or dexamethasone 0.1% or steroid and antibiotics combination like 0.3% moxifloxacin with 1% prednisolone or 0.3% gatifloxacin with 0.1% dexamethasone should be started 6/5/4/3/2/1 one week each in tapering doses.

In cases with plain steroids formulation, a separate antibiotic can be prescribed in the form of 0.3% ofloxacin, 0.3% moxifloxacin, or 0.3% gatifloxacin four times per day for 20 days to safeguard the patient from secondary bacterial infection. Some ophthalmologists also prescribe 5% homatropine two times per day for 15 days to reduce postoperative iritis. In cases landing up with intraoperative posterior capsular rent and vitreous prolapse, besides routine postoperative drugs as mentioned above, oral antibiotic tablet ciprofloxacin 750 mg two times per day, oral anti-inflammatory tablet 50 mg diclofenac and 10 mg serratiopeptidase two times per day, and oral antacid tablet pantoprazole 40 mg 2 times per day for five days must be prescribed to prevent the risk of endophthalmitis.

A vitreoretinal surgeon should evaluate cases with an intraoperative nucleus, or cortical matter drop postoperatively to decide whether a secondary surgical procedure is necessary or conservative management is warranted. PPC cases with intraoperative aphakia should be planned for secondary IOL implantation, whether scleral fixated or sulcus fixated based on the capsular support. The ideal time of implantation is 1 to 2 months postoperatively when the inflammation has been controlled. The patients should be meticulously followed up and counseled for an excellent postoperative outcome.
