Severe adverse effects documented in the methocarbamol package insert include seizure, leukopenia, and cholestatic jaundice. The incidence of these severe effects is unknown, and no case reports appear on a literature review. According to the LiverTox resource governed by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), methocarbamol has not been linked to liver or kidney injury.

According to drug monographs, there have been reports of seizures in individuals with a history of epilepsy after IV administration and cases of polysubstance toxicity; however, no published cases were available for review.

Drug monographs report neurologic adverse effects as more common, including sedation, followed by dizziness and headache. Other reported neurologic adverse effects include confusion, amnesia, falls, syncope, and diplopia.

Gastrointestinal side effects include dyspepsia, nausea, emesis, metallic taste, and cholestatic jaundice.

Methocarbamol may cause urine discoloration, which is not clinically significant; however, it may interfere with urine screening of  5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (5-HIAA) and vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA).

IV administration has been associated with phlebitis and injection site pain related to the extravasation of hypertonic solution.
