Clinicians should be aware of a range of pathologies that can cause a painful, inflamed external ear. When examining children, it is especially important to perform otoscopy to rule out complicated otitis media, as they will not be able to communicate their symptoms as effectively as adults.

Differential diagnoses that should be considered include:

- Pinna cellulitis

- Otitis externa

- Otitis media

- Dermatological conditions affecting the ear, i.e., eczema or psoriasis.

- Malignant otitis media

- Relapsing polychondritis
