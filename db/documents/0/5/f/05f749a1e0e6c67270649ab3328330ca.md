Although vaginitis is not a dangerous disease, itÂ can be disabling and upsetting to patients. It is important to address social issues and sexual dysfunction in addition to the infection itself.

It is also important to maintain a broad differential diagnosis. Trauma, abuse, foreign body, malignancy, immune diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and sexually transmitted infections can all present with vaginal discomfort. The provider should always perform a careful and complete physical exam, appropriate ancillary testing as described above, and further testing if treatment failure occurs.
