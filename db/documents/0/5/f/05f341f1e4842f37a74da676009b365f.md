The totality of antepartum care is an intricate balance of maternal and fetal management aimed to prevent significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality and provide support throughout the prenatal course. Close follow-up with timely review of new complaints or issues, significant physical exam, sonography, and laboratory findings facilitate the necessary interventions. These may include escalation of care to more frequent antepartum care visits, close follow-up by maternal-fetal medicine specialists, or potential early delivery depending on the gestational age, clinical picture, and potential improvement of outcomes.

While all of these interventions can be implemented with relative ease, major obstacles do exist to achieving this. The main concern for practitioners is patient compliance with visits, specifically in low socioeconomic or minority populations. Obstacles, such as access to prenatal facilities, transportation, or proper understanding of risk factors, all play a role in delayed intervention. Because of this, it is essential for the antepartum care team to identify these obstacles early in the prenatal course so as to preemptively find solutions to potential obstacles.
