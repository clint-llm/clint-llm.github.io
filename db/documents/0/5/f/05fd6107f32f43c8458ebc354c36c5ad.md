The presentation of Bouveret syndrome is typically non-specific and often with waxing and waning symptoms of nausea and vomiting (present in 85% of patients), abdominal distension, and pain (present in 70% of patients) due to the varying locations of the gallstone. The patient may also exhibit epigastric and right hypochondrium pain and signs of dehydration and weight loss. Less frequently, Bouveret syndrome may present with hematemesis secondary to duodenal and celiac artery erosions or the expulsion of stones in the vomitus. Usually, the symptoms begin 5 to 7 days before patients seek medical consultation. Notably, the intensity of the pain often does not correlate with the underlying anatomic alteration.

A physical exam is also non-specific, although one may appreciate dry mucous membranes, abdominal distension, abdominal tenderness, high-pitched bowel sounds, and obstructive jaundice.
