**Medical Management:**

Medical treatment is primarily aimed to halt the progress or to prevent disease progression. There is no medical therapy that is curative for otosclerosis. Though sodium fluoride is prescribed to slow the progression of the otosclerosis, the efficacy is still controversial.

Bisphosphonates exert antiresorptive action, by inducing osteoclastic apoptosis. Bisphosphonates, in particular, newer generation bisphosphonates are commonly used to treat otosclerosis with promising results.

Bilateral hearing aids are also used in many patients, either alone or in combination with other treatments.

**Surgical Management:**

The treatment of choice is stapedotomy or stapedectomy, along with placement of a prosthesis. Surgical treatment for otosclerosis has shown good results, irrespective of the surgical approaches. Revision surgery, if indicated for otosclerosis, is met with mixed success and maybe needed with facial nerve damage, persistent vertigo, or failure to improve the hearing. Though surgery is beneficial to restore hearing, in a few of the patients, there may be a need to use hearing aids after surgical treatment.
