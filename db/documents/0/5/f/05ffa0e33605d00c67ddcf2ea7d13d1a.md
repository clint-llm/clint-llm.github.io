Initial laboratory findings in patients with GSD I will show hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hyperuricemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Besides these, patients with GSD Ib will have neutropenia ranging from mild to complete agranulocytosis.

In a patient suspected with GSD I, glucagon stimulation test should be avoided. It increases the risk of acute acidosis and decompensation by causing a significant increase in blood lactate with little or no increase in blood glucose concentration.

Instead of the invasive liver biopsy, noninvasive molecular genetic testing that includes full gene sequencing of G6PC (GSD Ia) and SLC37A4 (GSD Ib) genes is preferred for confirming the diagnosis. Sequence analysis has a detection rate of up to 100% but may miss certain mutations of both G6PC and SLC37A4 genes. For such cases techniques such as quantitative PCR, long-range PCR, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, targeted array, or comparative genomic hybridization analysis is employed.

The first choice to confirm the clinical suspicion of GSD I is a mutation analysis. After excluding patients with neutropenia, complete G6PC sequencing is performed. During the availability of liver biopsy tissue, G6Pase enzyme activity is analyzed to confirm the diagnosis.
