A rise in opioid-related adverse effects and death has led to a surge in utilizing alternative methods to treat pain. The increasing adoption of ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia for acute pain management parallels the rapid rise in the availability of ultrasound machines. The abdominal wall is a common source of pain after surgical interventions involving the abdomen. Utilizing ultrasound, transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks can provide reliable relief of somatic incisional pain. TAP blocks are a great adjunct to a multimodal analgesic regimen.  However, the lack of reliable visceral pain relief with TAP blocks may necessitate additional modes of analgesia.
