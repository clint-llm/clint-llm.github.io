Proper hygiene with frequent washing and drying off the prepuce is an essential preventive measure although excessive genital washing with soap may aggravate the condition.

Topical antifungals usually for one to three weeks is the treatment of choice for most patients with balanoposthitis. Imidazoles such as clotrimazole 1% twice daily (bid), and miconazole 1% bid are the first line therapy choice. Nystatin cream is an alternative in patients allergic to imidazoles.

In cases of more severe inflammation, the addition of fluconazole 150 mg stat orally or the combination of a topical imidazole and a low potency topical steroids such as hydrocortisone 0.5% bid often lead to the resolution.

Treatment with a first-generation cephalosporin is appropriate if there is a concern for concomitant cellulitis.

Experts recommend circumcision for recurrent and intractable episodes especially in immunocompromised and diabetic patients, consult urology. Data from meta-analyses showed that circumcised males have a 68% lower prevalence of balanitis than uncircumcised males and that balanitis is accompanied by a 3.8-fold increase in the risk of penile cancer.

Female sexual partners of men with balanitis should be offered testing for candida or empiric treatment to reduce the reservoir of infection in the couple.
