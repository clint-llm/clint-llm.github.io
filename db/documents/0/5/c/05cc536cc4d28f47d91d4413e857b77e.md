A central venous line (CVL) is a large-bore central venous catheter placed using a sterile technique (unless an urgent clinical scenario prevents sterile technique placement) in specific clinical procedures.

Over the past decade, there has been tremendous improvement and reduced complications associated with central line placement procedures. With ultrasound guidance, standardized techniques, new catheter designs, and central line care bundle, this procedure has become ubiquitous in the intensive care unit. This article will detail the anatomy of the site placement, indications and contraindications, equipment and personnel involved, technique, preparation, and associated complications.
