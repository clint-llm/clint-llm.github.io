Although acid-reducing surgery has become an operation with few indications, it is still an important tool for a surgeon. Vagotomy is generally indicated for intractability or a complication of peptic ulcer disease in a stable patient who has failed maximum medical therapy. The different techniques and post-operative consequences of acid-reducing surgeries must be thoroughly understood to perform these operations. Truncal vagotomy remains one of the more popular acid-reducing operations employed today due to its relative technical ease compared to the highly selective vagotomy. Most surgeons would agree that a drainage procedure must be concomitantly performed at the time of truncal vagotomy and is not without consequences.
