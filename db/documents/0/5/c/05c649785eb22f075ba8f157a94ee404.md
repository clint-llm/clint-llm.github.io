If SMA is clinically suspected, but genetic testing fails to identify pathological biallelic versions/absence of SMN1, there are a plethora of extremely rare conditions of varying etiology (usually secondary to a genetic disorder) that can present similarly to SMA but often with distinguishing features not seen in SMA. These are sometimes referred to as non-5q13-associated-SMAs.

A thorough history, examination as well as CK, EMG, nerve conduction studies, muscle biopsy, MRI, as well as referral to a geneticist can all be key to determining the correct diagnosis.

Congenital - <6months: Pompe disease, Prader-Willi syndrome, Myotonic dystrophy type 1, Sellweger spectrum disorder, Congenital myasthenic syndromes, X-linked infantile spinal muscular atrophy. It is essential to consider congenital myopathies, disorders of metabolism, and disorders of mitochondria.

Childhood: Botulism, hexosaminidase A deficiency, Guillain-BarrÃ©, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Fazio-Londe syndrome, Hirayama disease

Adulthood: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal, and bulbar muscular atrophy
