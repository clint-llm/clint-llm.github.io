The severity of traction alopecia is assessed by using the Marginal Traction Alopecia Severity Score (M-TAS). This is a validated photographic scale used to ascertain the severity of marginal TA. Anterior and posterior hairlines are localized using anatomic landmarks and are graded on a scale of 0 to 9. The scale has been used in clinical studies to correlate disease severity with potential risk factors for TA. Potentially, the M-TAS may be a useful tool used to monitor response to treatment. Dermoscopy can be a useful aid in the diagnosis of TA. The presence of hair casts is typical of traction alopecia. In patients with a patchy and marginal type of alopecia secondary to traction, a reduction in the density of hair follicles, the absence of follicular openings and the presence of a large number of freely mobile hair casts at the periphery of the patch is seen on dermoscopy. In the patient with a diffuse type of alopecia secondary to traction, dermoscopy reveals a normal density of hair with numerous hair casts. The hair casts due to traction alopecia are nonadherent, white or brown in color, cylindrical in shape and tend to encircle the proximal hair shaft.
