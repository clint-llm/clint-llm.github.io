The emotional toll of having a child with hydranencephaly can be profound. There is no prevention of this disease except for those cases with exposure to toxins such as cocaine, smoking, and sodium valproate. Avoidance of these toxins should be encouraged. Counseling and support are necessary for the parents, especially to educate them about the diagnosis and prognosis. Psychologist and psychiatrist interactions may be needed.
