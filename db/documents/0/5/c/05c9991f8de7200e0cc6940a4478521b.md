Some contraindications for performing the Gordon reflex include the presence of an open wound on the calf or in the area, a recent deep vein thrombosis, or very swollen and painful calves, which can be seen with a variety of different conditions, including congestive heart failure exacerbation. Caution should also be taken if patients have a very low platelet count as the reflex test involves the tight squeezing of the calf muscles, potentially leading to injury and bleeding in the muscle.
