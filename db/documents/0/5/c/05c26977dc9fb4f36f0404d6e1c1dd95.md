For patients with limited subcutaneous emphysema, education can help provide significant relief. Instructing patients that the air may cause discomfort and abnormal sounds with touch, is a benign process that will quickly resolve. In cases of palpebral closure, educating that this is a reversible cause of vision loss due to eyelid swelling may alleviate concerns. For cases of massive subcutaneous emphysema, discussing decompression techniques and the possible sequelae will enable the patient to make informed decisions about their care. Furthermore, when consenting patients for general anesthesia, communicating the risk of subcutaneous emphysema will increase awareness of expected management ifÂ subcutaneous emphysema does develop.
