The most common adverse effects are related to the drug's antimuscarinic properties, including xerostomia, blurred vision, photophobia, tachycardia, flushing, and hot skin. Constipation, difficulty with urination, and anhidrosis can occur, especially in at-risk populations (most notably, the elderly). In rare cases, delirium or coma may occur. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur and are usually limited to a skin rash that could progress to exfoliation.

Atropine decreases the rate of mexiletine absorption that can be prevented by combined IV delivery of metoclopramide with atropine before anesthesia.
