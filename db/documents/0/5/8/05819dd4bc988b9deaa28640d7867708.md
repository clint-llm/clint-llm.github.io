Administration of general anesthesia, use of muscle relaxants, obesity, pregnancy, inadequate pain control, and thoracic or cardiopulmonary procedures increase the risk of developing atelectasis in the perioperative period.

The incidence of atelectasis in patient's undergoing general anesthesia is 90%.

Obese patients have an increased incidence of atelectasis due toÂ decreased FRC (functional residual capacity) and compliance. Atelectasis development in pregnant patients is by this same mechanism.

Inadequate pain control can contribute to the development of atelectasis by inducing shallow breathing ("splinting") and/or inhibiting coughing.
