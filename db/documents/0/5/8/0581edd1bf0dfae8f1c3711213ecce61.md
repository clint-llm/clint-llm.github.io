Fat grafting is a technique in which harvested adipose tissue is injected underneath the skin for the reconstruction of traumatic, oncologic, or congenital defects. The technique may also be used for cosmetic purposes, particularly facial rejuvenation. The term "autologous fat grafting" refers to the same procedure when the fat is harvested from the person who will also receive it, which is the most common clinical scenario. Autologous fat is considered by many to be the ideal filler material for facial rejuvenation, as it is 100% biocompatible, produces a soft and natural result, and is theoretically a permanent intervention. This article focuses on the utility of this procedure for facial rejuvenation.
