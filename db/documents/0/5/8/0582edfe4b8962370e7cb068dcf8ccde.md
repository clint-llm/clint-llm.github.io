The mandibular nerve is the only branch of the trigeminal nerve with a motor component (V3). This branch supplies motor innervation to the facial muscles involved inÂ mastication, which include the masseter, temporalis muscle, and lateral and medial pterygoids. Additionally, V3 gives off branches that innervate the tensor veli palatini, the mylohyoid, the tensor tympani, and the anterior portion of the digastric muscle.
