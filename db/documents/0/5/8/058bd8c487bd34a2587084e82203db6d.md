The precentral gyrus is part of the cerebral cortex, which forms from the telencephalon. By day 32 of development, the cerebral hemispheres emerge as two bubble-like structures on the telencephalon.Â The cerebral cortices eventually form from the thinner roof and lateral aspects of the cerebral hemispheres. Initially, the cerebral hemispheres are smooth, but from six to nine months of development, the cerebral cortex forms its gyri and sulci.
