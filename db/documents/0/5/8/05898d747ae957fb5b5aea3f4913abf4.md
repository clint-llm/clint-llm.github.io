Like other similar immunodeficiencies, IgA deficiency appears to be a common destination to many pathogenic routes.

Most cases of IgA deficiency appear to be sporadic.  Those cases of primary IgA deficiency that appear familial in nature have no common Mendelian pattern.  Secondary IgA deficiency can result from a myriad of factors.  Many drugs are causative agents for IgA deficiency, including, for example, cyclosporine, gold, penicillamine, and antiepileptics.

No matter the causative agent, the target remains the same; it is either B-cell proliferation, B-cell maturation (IgA switching), or Plasma cell production of IgA.
