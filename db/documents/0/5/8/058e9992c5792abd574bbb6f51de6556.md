The IDET mechanism of pain relief continues in controversial and debate regarding its effectiveness. The IDET mechanism of action presumably changes in disc biomechanics, decreased intradiscal pressure, annular denervation, and sealing annular tears.

There is no consistent evidence regarding the effectiveness of IDET, actually positive outcomes to placebo and sham procedures are well recognized, and there may exist an association between the magnitude of sham response and the invasiveness of the procedure.

The future directions should provide appropriate outcome and cost-effectiveness studies, taking into consideration technique and appropriate selection.
