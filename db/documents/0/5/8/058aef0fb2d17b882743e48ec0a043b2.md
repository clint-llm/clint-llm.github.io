The basis of diagnosis is on finding the pathognomonic skin lesions on physical exam and can be supported histopathologically. There are no lab abnormalities or serum markers specific for atrophic papulosis identification. However, many patients present with defects in blood coagulation.

If organ symptomatology is suspected, the evaluation focuses on the organ involved. For instance, gastrointestinal involvement may require a fecal occult blood test, colonoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, or laparoscopy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging with contrast, heart ultrasonography, thorax computed tomography with contrast, ocular fundus examination, and kidney function tests are recommendations for the central nervous system, cardiac, respiratory, ocular, or renal involvement, respectively.
