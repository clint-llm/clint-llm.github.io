A behavior modification plan can be started and implemented with an individual or by a team of individuals that includes the mental health nurse, psychologist, social workers, primary care provider, parent, teacher, or childcare provider. Often, the behavior plan can be implemented in multiple settings, like at school and home (rewards for turning in homework assignments to the teacher, and rewards for cleaning your room by the parent). The broader the settings for the behavior plan, the better. Interprofessional involvement has been shown to improve health care quality and outcomes for patients, clients, families, and caregivers.

Behavior therapy achieves goals in therapy that medication alone may not be able to accomplish. It has long-lasting effects on the individual even after the behavior plan is no longer in place because the new behavior is already established. Behavior can change the way a person thinks and feels about themselves which in psychiatry is an ultimate goal.
