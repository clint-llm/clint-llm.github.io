**Muscles of the Dorsal Foot**

The intrinsic muscles of the dorsal foot are mainly supplied by the dorsalis pedis artery and include the extensor digitorum brevis, the dorsal interossei, and the extensor hallucis brevis.

**Muscles of the Plantar Foot**

The intrinsic muscles of the plantar aspect of the foot primarily receive vascular supply via the medial and lateral plantar arteries, the plantar arch, and the plantar metatarsal arteries.
