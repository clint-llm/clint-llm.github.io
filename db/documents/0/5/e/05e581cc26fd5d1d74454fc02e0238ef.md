Roseola infantum is managed by an interprofessional team that includes pediatric nurses. The condition is benign and resolves spontaneously. However, a few children may develop febrile seizures. Rarely in immunocompromised children, the infection may recur.

Most children have no residual sequelae and have an excellent prognosis.
