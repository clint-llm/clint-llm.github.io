Cancers of the anal canal are rare, comprising approximately 10% of malignancies in the anorectal region, although its incidence has been increasing over the past several decades. While the traditional approach to treatment was with abdominoperineal resection (APR), this has evolved in the modern era to concurrent chemoradiation as organ-preserving treatment. This activity reviews the role of radiation therapy for anal cancer and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of anal cancer.
- Review the workup of a patient suspected of having anal cancer.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for anal cancer.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with anal cancer.
