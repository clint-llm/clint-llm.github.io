Vasa vasorum, the microscopic vessel networks supplying large blood vessels, are rarely found in the brain and, when present, are usually related to intracranial cardiovascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis. Rather than through vasa vasorum, intracranial vessels likely get their blood supplied by simple diffusion with the CSF.

The brain does not have a lymphatic system as peripheral tissues do; instead, it has a similar system by which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) enters the brain parenchyma, known as the glymphatic system. CSF initially travels through the pial arteries into the perivascular Virchow-Robin space, where it enters brain cells via aquaporin channels found on astrocytes. Eventually, it exits into lymphatics running along the spinal and cranial nerves, as well as through the arachnoid granulations.
