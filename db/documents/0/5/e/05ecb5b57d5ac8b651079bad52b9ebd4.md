The etiologies of mesenteric adenitis include several causes of inflammatory response within mesenteric lymph nodes. These include viral infections, bacterial infections, inflammatory bowel disease, or lymphoma. Two common gram-negative bacteria that are known to cause mesenteric adenitis include Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica.

Other known culprits include salmonella, E coli, and streptococci. The etiology can further classify as primary versus secondary. Primary etiology occurs when the lymphadenopathy is the result of an unidentifiable inflammatory process. Secondary mesenteric adenitis occurs secondary to an intra-abdominal inflammatory process with a known source or etiology.
