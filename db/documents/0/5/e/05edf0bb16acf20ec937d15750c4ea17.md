Using estrogen to treat postmenopausal symptoms and as a component of the oral contraceptive pill to prevent pregnancy remains widely available as FDA-approved therapy regardless of the known risk and benefits on women's health. For any patient of postmenopausal age, clinicians must ask patients about any history of estrogen hormone replacement therapy or use of estrogen oral contraceptive pills be included in the patient's medical history and physical exam. When clinicians first initiate estrogen therapies to patients, providers should evaluate patients for family history of breast cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, history of cancer, and risk of newly developed malignancies sensitive to estrogen.

Physicians and pharmacists should educate patients about the potential side effects and box warnings of estrogen use. Routine women wellness exams should also focus on the possible development of any malignancies or adverse effects of hormone replacement therapy given a positive history. The role of the pharmacist when counseling patients new to prescribed estrogen therapies should include educating and assessing the patient for proper use of estrogen medication therapies as they may be prescribed in many various preparations of oral, transdermal, vaginal insert, and topic vaginal creams for positive patient compliance and adherence to treatment. Nursing can also serve as a point of contact for medication-related questions, counseling regarding adverse effects, and coordinating activity among other interprofessional healthcare team members. This interprofessional approach will maximize therapeutic effectiveness and minimize possible adverse effects when using estrogen therapy. [Level 5]
