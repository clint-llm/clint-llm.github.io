Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is a urate-lowering medication that is FDA approved for managing gout, preventing tumor lysis syndrome, and preventing recurrent calcium nephrolithiasis in patients with hyperuricosuria. Other non-FDA-approved indications include Lesch-Nyhan syndrome-associated hyperuricemia and the prevention of recurrent uric acid nephrolithiasis. It is important to note that asymptomatic hyperuricemia is not an indication of allopurinol or any urate-lowering therapy. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism, pharmacology, contraindications, and adverse events associated with allopurinol drug therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the various indications, both approved and off-label, for allopurinol therapy.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of allopurinol.
- Summarize the mechanism of action of allopurinol.
- Review the importance of coordinating and collaborating among various disciplines in an interprofessional health team to coordinate care and management to enhance outcomes for patients receiving allopurinol therapy.
