Lung transplant rejection is a common complication after a single or doubleÂ lung transplant, and it can progress rapidly or subtly. Early diagnosis and management are essential to decrease morbidity and mortality. It is best managed by an interprofessional team approach. Communication and coordination between the patient, the primary clinician, the pulmonologist, and the transplant surgeon in regard to posttransplant testing and follow-up are essential for prevention.
