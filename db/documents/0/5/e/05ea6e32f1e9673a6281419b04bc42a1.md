**Evidence-Based Outcomes**

Disease progression in progressive supranuclear palsy usually occurs fairly rapidly and relentlessly.

**An Interprofessional Approach**

Given the rapid progression of the disease and rapidly deteriorating quality of life, the education of the patient and family is critical. The home care nurse should closely monitor the patient with particular attention to daily living activities. The pharmacist should pay particular attention to the potential side effects of any medications. Only an integrated systemic care plan can help improve the quality of life and reduce the morbidity of the disease.

At each clinic visit, the nurse should focus on educating the family and ensuring that all concerns are answered. Today there are support groups for patients with progressive supranuclear palsy that help provide motivation and the latest information.

It is highly recommended that physical therapy and an occupational therapist be involved early in the disease process in helping maximize function, ambulation and facilitate the use of an ambulatory device.

Without a cure, the majority of patients are dead within seven years, but with an interprofessional approach, health care workers can make a significant difference in the quality of life.
