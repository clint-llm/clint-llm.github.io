Trichinosis occurs from a nematode from the genus Trichinella. The parasites alternate between skeletal muscle stages and enteric stages during their life cycle within their host. The life cycle begins with the enteral phase when the host eats the infected meat. Digestive enzymes in the stomach dissolve the capsule releasing the larvae into the small intestine where they invade columnar epithelium. Larvae then pass into the tissue and enter the lymphatics eventually being released into general circulation via the thoracic duct. When they enter the muscle fibers from the capillaries, they encyst and become infective within 15 days. They can remain from months to years to the entire life of the host.Â There are eleven known species within the genus Trichinella. These eleven species subdivide into those that invade host muscle cells and encapsulate (surrounded by a collagen capsule) and those that do not encapsulate. Trichinella Spiralis belongs to the encapsulated group and causes most human infections and deaths from trichinosis.
