Thoracic trauma accounts for up to 35 percent of trauma-related deaths in the United States and encompasses a broad range of injuries that can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Prompt evaluation during the primary trauma survey is key to identifying injuries that are immediately life-threatening and require rapid intervention. Once these conditions are managed or ruled out, less urgent thoracic injuries are often diagnosed during the secondary trauma survey and successfully managed by applying the fundamental principles of advanced trauma life support (ATLS). This activity reviews the evaluation and management of thoracic trauma and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the causes of thoracic trauma.
- Review the evaluation components for thoracic trauma.
- Outline treatment options for thoracic trauma.
- Explain the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of thoracic trauma.
