Stress fractures are divided into high and low-risk fractures. General principles of management include relative rest/non-weight bearing for a period of 2 to 6 weeks, and then gradual reintroduction of activity.

A low-risk stress fracture can be seen in the posterior tibia, 2nd to 4th metatarsals, femur, inferior and superior pubic rami, sacrum, and fibula.

High-risk stress fractures are seen in areas with challenging blood supply,Â frequently occurring in areas of maximal tensile load, and are at high risk for non-union.

Patients may also benefit from calcium and vitamin D supplementation, though studies do not demonstrate a clear benefit or quicker healing. In one study of female U.S. Navy recruits, given 2000 milligrams of calcium along with 800 international units of vitamin D had a 20% reduction in stress fractures during training.

Spondylolysis is a unique stress fracture. Few large clinical trials looking at treatment exist, so recovery and return to play can be challenging to manage.
