Peroxisomes are single membrane-bounded organelles with a matrix, containing over 50 enzymes for fatty acid metabolism. All human cells except erythrocytes contain peroxisomes. The liver and kidney have peroxisomes in abundance in comparison to other organs. Peroxins are necessary for proper assembly of peroxisomes, and mutations in the peroxin gene (PEX) results in a defect in peroxisomal formation, which is associated with lower or undetectable levels of key internal enzymes. The peroxisomes are involved in beta-oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA), alpha oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids, catabolism of amino acids, and ethanol, biosynthesis of bile acids, steroid hormones, gluconeogenesis and plasmalogen formation which are important constituents of the cell membrane and myelin. It is also involved in the degradation of cytotoxic hydrogen peroxide.

Zellweger syndrome is thus characterized by increased accumulation of VLCFA, increased C26, and C22 fatty acids in plasma, fibroblasts, and amniocytes.

Major abnormalities are present in the kidney (cortical cysts), liver (fibrotic), and brain (demyelination, centrosylvian polymicrogyria) - hence the name cerebrohepatorenal syndrome.
