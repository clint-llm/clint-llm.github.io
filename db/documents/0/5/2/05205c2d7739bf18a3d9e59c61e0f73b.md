ATT is generally well tolerated; however, close follow-up is needed to monitor any adverse drug reactions (ADRs). ADR occurrence in the context of ATT is expected as multiple drugs are combined for a prolonged duration.

Besides gastrointestinal intolerance and fatigue, all the drugs have specific side effects. Factors such as confection with HIV, drug-resistant TB, and steroid prescription raise the complexity further. INH, RMP, and PZA are all hepatotoxic. In addition, INH can cause peripheral neuropathy, which can be prevented by supplementing pyridoxine. Very rarely, INH can cause lupus-like syndrome, pellagra, and psychosis. RMP discolors the urine and may cause rash, influenza-like syndrome, and thrombocytopenia.

ETB causes dose-dependent optic neuritis and peripheral neuropathy. PZA causes various cutaneous reactions, asymptomatic hyperuricemia, and occasionally gouty arthritis. SM is associated with ototoxicity, vertigo, and pain at the injection site. The novel drug BDQ is associated with QT prolongation in electrocardiograms. All patients on ATT should have liver monitoring during the initial eight weeks of treatment. An asymptomatic rise in hepatic transaminases is expected at the beginning of treatment. In the event of transaminase levels exceeding 3 to 5 times the upper limit of normal or serum bilirubin of >2.5 mg/L, ATT needs to be modified to replace hepatotoxic drugs with second or third-line drugs.
