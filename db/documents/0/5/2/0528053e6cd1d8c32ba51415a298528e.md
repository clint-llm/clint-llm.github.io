Patients with combined immunodeficiency disorder (T and B lymphocyte deficiency) present with recurrent infections usually early in life. These patients are susceptible to infection by many organisms. Immunotherapy sometimes is not available to treat these recurrent infections. Severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) is the most severe expression among the combined immunodeficiency disorders. The onset of the clinical manifestations occurs by 6 months of age or before, with bacterial, viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Also, these infections may lead to early death in severe combined immunodeficiency disease, differentiating this condition from other forms or combined immunodeficiency.

Both T and B cell functions are disturbed or absent entirely in severe combined immunodeficiency disease. Autosomal, sporadic, or the X-linked form may affect the neonate, and without treatment, patients rarely survive beyond one year of age before succumbing to opportunistic infections.
