Liposarcoma is a complex tumor, and its pathophysiology can be best explained by dividing it into three subtypes (according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification from 2002). These include well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS/DDLPS), myxoid and round cell liposarcoma (MLS and RCL), and pleomorphic liposarcoma (PLS).Â  WDLPS/DDLPS will have a diagnostic giant marker and ring chromosome, which affects uncontrolled cell proliferation.
