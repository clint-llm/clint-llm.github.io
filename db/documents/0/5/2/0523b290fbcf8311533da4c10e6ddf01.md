Morphea is usually a clinical diagnosis and can be confirmed by physical examination. However, some patients need a skin biopsy, including subcutaneous fat, to confirm the diagnosis of morphea. In deeper skin lesions, an incisional biopsy is required to get an appropriate tissue sample for histopathology.

There are no morphea specific antibodies; however, positive ANA, anti-histone Ab, and SS DNA Ab are reported in some patients. In one case-control study, 30% of morphea patients had a positive ANA compared to 11% in the control population. Other laboratory findings like peripheral eosinophilia on complete blood count (CBC) and elevated inflammation markers may help in the diagnosis. However, in morphea patients with positive ANA and Raynaudâ€™s symptoms, it may be warranted to screen for systemic sclerosis.

In patients with severe lesions, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging is useful to understand the depth of the lesions and look for findings like thickening of the fascia, tenosynovitis, or myositis, which can cause serious deformities. Ultrasound is also good alternative imaging to use in regular disease monitoring.
