Since most developmental delays resolve spontaneously, the prognosis is generally good. However, developmental delay is a significant and powerful risk for progression to a neurodevelopmental disorder or syndrome.  As a result, it is critical that each developmental delay is carefully followed until it resolves or evolves into a developmental disorder.  There are many factors associated with both poor and better developmental outcome. Some of the prognostic factors associated with poor behavioral outcomes or serious delay in the development of children ranging from 18 to 30 months are lack of parental education, anemia during pregnancy, malnutrition, premature babies, male gender, low birth weight (LBW), prenatal and postnatal depression, intimate partner violence (IPV), use of drugs, tobacco or alcohol in pregnancy, and poverty.

Moreover, some other alarming features (if not effectively addressed, may result in significant developmental deficit) are hearing and/or vision loss at any age, loss of previously learned developmental skills, persistent hypotonia or hypertonia, asymmetrical movements, no communicative speech at 16 months, and disproportionate head circumference (either > 99.6 percentile or <0.4 percentile).
