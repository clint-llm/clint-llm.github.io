R. equi infection, although rare, is recognized as an important cause of cavitary lung infections, especially in the HIV population where mortality could be as high as 50%.

Proven links with horses are not always present, and a few reports and case series have not identified any such associations. It is possible that in these scenarios, other animals (non-horses) could have been implicated, and with suppression of cellular immunity in the host, infection becomes unmasked.

Relapse of Rhodococcus infection after a complete course of therapy has been reported and may occur even on suppressive therapy. Relapse may occur at the same site of the initial infection or a distant site. Linezolid has been used successfully to treat relapse.

In summary, R. equi is a rare cause of subacute, necrotizing infection, mostly cavitary pneumonia and lung abscess, especially in the immunocompromised host. Prompt diagnosis and directed therapy using two or more agents are often necessary for these patient subsets to achieve a favorable outcome.
