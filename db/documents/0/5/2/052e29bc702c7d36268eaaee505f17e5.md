The classic microscopic description of HPV infection of cervical epithelial cells is "koilocytosis."  This term refers to the appearance of a perinuclear "halo" within the cell, along with enlarged and irregular nuclei that show evidence of mitosis. The proportion of cervical epithelium exhibiting dysplastic cells determines the grade of the dysplasia. CIN-1 (low-grade) involves the lower 1/3 or less of the epithelium, whereas the more significant CIN-2 and CIN-3 (high-grade) progress to include the entire thickness of the epithelium.  Dysplasia becomes cancer when it invades the basement membrane.
