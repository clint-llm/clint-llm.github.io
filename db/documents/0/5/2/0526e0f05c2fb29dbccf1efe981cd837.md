For most uncomplicated deliveries minimal equipment is necessary. Ideally in the prehospital setting, providers should have something to cut and clamp the umbilical cord, andÂ something to dry and stimulate the infant such as a towel. In emergency settings, typical obstetric and gynecological equipment may not be available, but if possible EMS providers should have the following items ready:

- PPE: Mask, gown, booties, sterile gloves

- Towels

- Scissors

- Umbilical clamp

- Bulb suction

- Intravenous (IV) access equipment

- Supplemental oxygen
