Dysarthria is among the most common neurological complaints and can arise from many primary neurological and nonneurological conditions. Collecting detailed history, including onset, progression, associated neurological symptoms, and collateral history from family and friends, is essential.

If dysarthria is a presenting symptom, extensive workup may be required to diagnose the underlying cause. Nurses are often the first to recognize speech difficulties in an inpatient who develops dysarthria and should inform the clinician and make recommendations for interventions. An interprofessional team, including a neurologist, physiatrist, nurses, and speech–language pathologist, must make the diagnosis and formulate a treatment plan. Social workers may assist in locating support groups and local resources for patients and families.

Conventional speech therapy and high-tech AAC devices can assist with functional communication when natural speech is not understandable. The Academy of Neurologic Communication Disorders and Sciences (ANCDS) and the American Speech–Language–Hearing Association (ASHA) published four practice guidelines between 2001–2004 to support the treatment of dysarthria. Various societies, such as the ANCDS, the National Parkinson’s Foundation, the Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the ALS Association, have practical guidelines for managing patients with dysarthria.

The Speech–Language Pathology Medical Review Guidelines published by ASHA focus on specific components of the speech production process, such as improving muscle strength and control, reducing consonant imprecision, and improving respiration for producing an adequate voice. [Level 5] ASHA has an evidence maps section highlighting the most recent evidence-based research in dysarthria. Emerging evidence suggests TR improves costs and patient satisfaction compared to traditional in-person therapy. The study evaluated post-stroke patients’ quality of life and motor, speech, and cognitive function.

The prognosis of dysarthria depends on the cause. Proper consultation with specialists and education of family members and friends is required to optimize patient treatment and allow patients to regain their most significant level of independence. The treatment regimen is highly individualized and requires an extensive interprofessional team. Hence, prompt consultation with interprofessional specialists is recommended to improve outcomes.
