Spontaneous or primary pneumomediastinum occurs in otherwise healthy individuals with no identifiable cause. Secondary pneumomediastinum includes all cases in which an underlying cause such as trauma can be elicited. The most common cause of pneumomediastinum is alveolar rupture.

**Risk Factors for Spontaneous Pneumomediastinum**

- Smoking or tobacco use

- Recreational drug inhalation (cocaine, methamphetamine, marijuana, ecstasy)

**Causes of Secondary Pneumomediastinum**

**Intrinsic Lung and Airway Causes**

- Asthma

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

- Bronchiectasis

- Interstitial lung disease

- Lung cancer

- Foreign body in the airway

- Increased intrathoracic pressure (e.g., forceful sneezing/inhalation)

- Childbirth

- Excessive vomiting (i.e., Boerhaave syndrome, anorexia nervosa)

- Excessive coughing (i.e., asthma exacerbation)

- Strenuous physical activities

**Iatrogenic Causes**

- Endoscopy

- Intubation

- Central venous access procedures

- Thoracostomy

- Chest or abdominal surgeries

**Traumatic Causes**

- Blunt trauma

- Penetrating trauma

- Blast injuries
