A vesicovaginal fistula is an abnormal communication between the bladder and vagina, resulting in continuous urine leakage through the vagina.

In developing countries, obstructed labor with resulting pressure necrosis is the most common cause of vesicovaginal fistulas. The diagnostic workup should be comprehensive as most vesicovaginal fistulae require definitive surgical management. Timing, approach, graft usage, postoperative management, and surgical expertise must be optimized when exercised for successful management. The primary complication of vesicovaginal fistula surgery is recurrent fistula formation.
