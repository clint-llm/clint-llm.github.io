Valsalva maneuver (VM) is a simple, non-invasive test that can be easilyÂ performed using a mouthpiece and a manometer. While the maneuver is relatively safe, it is prudent to rule out any pre-existing disease of the retina before performing the maneuver. Therefore, one should consult an ophthalmologist and seek a thorough examination of the fundus in patients with suspected retinopathy. Similarly, the opinion of a cardiologist may assist in patients with pre-existing ischemic or valvular heart disease before the performance of VM.

It can assist the neurologist to identify patients suffering from autonomic neuropathy. Dysautonomia usually manifests as an absence of blood pressure overshoot and reflex bradycardia after the maneuver.
