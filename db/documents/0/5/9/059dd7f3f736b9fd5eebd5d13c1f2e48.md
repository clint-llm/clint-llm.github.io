CMV infection is characterized histologically by mucosal inflammation, tissue necrosis, as well as vascular endothelial cell damage and the presence of intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions. The Esophageal ulcerations seen in infectious etiology are multiple and punctuate, circumferential in distribution and tends to involve the proximal esophagus. Histologic findings in ulcers caused by herpes simplex virus appear as multinucleated giant cells, with ground-glass nuclei and eosinophilic inclusions (Cowdry type-A inclusion bodies) that occupy up to one-half of the nuclear volume. Ulcers caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is characterized histologically by mucosal inflammation, tissue necrosis, as well as vascular endothelial cell damage and the presence of intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions. The characteristic cytomegalic cells (large cells containing eosinophilic intranuclear and frequently basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions) are present in mucosal biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Other nonspecific histological features seen in GERD induced esophagitis to include the presence of neutrophils and eosinophils, dilated vascular channels in papillae of the lamina propria, and distended, pale squamous ("balloon") cells.
