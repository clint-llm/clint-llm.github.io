Early-onset scoliosis (EOS) occurs in young children and presents a unique and challenging dilemma since the spine, thorax, and lungs are still developing, and allowing for proper lung development is critical. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of early onset scoliosis and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiology of early onset scoliosis.
- Describe the physical exam findings typically seen in patients with early onset scoliosis.
- Summarize the management of early onset scoliosis.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by early onset scoliosis.
