Bias refers to a deviation from the truth in the collection, analysis, interpretation, or publication of data, leading to false conclusions. Poor blinding of a clinical research study may lead to bias that may result in inflated effect size and increase the risk of type I error. Even a small error in blinding may lead to a statistically significant result without any real difference between the study groups.

Keeping both the researchers and the subjects blinded to treatment allows a double-blinded study to prevent the researchers from treating the study groups differently. The double-blinded study minimizes the risk of various types of biases, such as observer bias or confirmation bias, which may influence the results of the investigation.

Unblinding may occur during any portion of the blinded clinical trial. Unblinding that occurs before the conclusion of a trial may be a source of bias that the study should document and report. It is the responsibility of all the healthcare professionals involved in a clinical trial, such as physicians, nurses, pharmacists, technicians, and data analysts, to maintain blinding as effectively as possible during the trial and to report any premature unblinding.
