Conventional knowledge dictates that the coccyx is a single fused entity; however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomogram (CT) based evaluations of coccygeal anatomy in different populations have shown that the coccyx contains anywhere from three to five separate bony segments, with the four segments being the most common.

Together the cornuae form the sacral foramen, allowing for the traversing of various nerves. As the coccygeal vertebra progress, the length and width of each bone decrease, and together form an overall triangular shape. Given its location, the coccyx plays a significant role in weight-bearing when in a seated position and forms a tripod of support along with the two ischial spines of the pelvis.
