The splanchnic nerves have been structured to provide both sensory and motor fibers.

**Thoracic Splanchnic Nerves:**

**Structure**

The thoracic splanchnic nerves arise from the medial branches of the lesser sympathetic ganglia.

The greater splanchnic nerve transverses the diaphragm via aortic hiatus and terminates in the superior preaortic ganglia, which is commonly called the celiac ganglia. The postsynaptic fibers then move toward to organs of the foregut as the celiac plexus.

The lesser splanchnic nerves are found lateral and inferior to the greater splanchnic nerve and synapse with either the superior mesenteric ganglia or the aorticorenal ganglia.

**Function**

The greater splanchnic nerve provides an inhibitory effect on the foregut, which causes inhibition of motility and secretions of the duodenum, stomach and distal esophagus, stimulation of gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis and glucose release, inhibition of bile emptying and contraction of smooth muscle in the gallbladder, inhibits the secretion of pancreatic enzymes, stimulates glucagon release leading to inhibition of insulin release, secretion of catecholamines through stimulation of chromaffin cells, and lastly, innervates the spleens capsule to allow for transmission of splenic pain.

**Lumbar Splanchnic Nerve:**

**Structure**

The lumbar splanchnic nerve also consists of two nerves on each side of the body that form from branches of the L1 and L2 sympathetic chain.

**Function**

The postganglionic sympathetic fibers vasoconstrict blood vessels, allow for secretions from sweat glands, and provide motor to arrector pili muscle. The fibers that reach skeletal muscle by following the motor nerves are vasodilators. Lastly, the fibers that reach the viscera regulate glandular secretions, allow for general vasoconstriction, and inhibit smooth muscle contraction of the gastrointestinal system.

**Sacral Splanchnic Nerve:**

**Structure**

The sacral splanchnic nerves are also a set of nerves that run parallel to one another on each side of the body. They allow the inferior hypogastric plexus to connect with the sacral portion of the sympathetic trunk.

**Function**

The sacral splanchnic nerve provides both motor and sensory information to the posterior leg, foot, lower leg, and the skin and muscles of the pelvis. The major branches of the sacral splanchnic nerve include the superior gluteal, inferior gluteal, sciatic, posterior cutaneous, and the pudendal. The pelvic splanchnic nerve carries the parasympathetic fibers and provides innervation to the distal one-third of the transverse colon through to the sigmoid and rectum, as well as the cervix, and upper vagina.
