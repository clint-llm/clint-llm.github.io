**Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting**

Coronary arteries are the vessels that provide oxygenated blood to the myocardium. These vessels are often affected by atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in stenosis of the vessel. This stenosis results in a decrease in perfusion to the myocardium, often presenting in a patient as angina. The decrease or complete lack of perfusion may result in myocardial infarction. Coronary artery bypass grafting is a surgical procedure used to restore blood flow to the myocardium, through use of a conduit to bypass a stenotic segment of the coronary artery. The left anterior descending (LAD) artery is a branch of the left coronary artery that supplies approximately 50% of the left ventricle and is therefore considered the most significant vessel in myocardial blood supply. In coronary artery bypass grafting, the left internal thoracic artery is most often used to bypass a stenotic segment of the left anterior descending artery. The left internal thoracic artery’s anatomic vicinity to the heart, long-term patency, long-term survivability, and post-operative quality of life render it to be the superior vessel for coronary artery bypass grafting when compared to alternatives.
