This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of aneurysmal bone cysts and highlights the role of the an interprofessional healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of aneurysmal bone cyst.
- Review the evaluation of aneurysmal bone cysts.
- Outline the management options available for aneurysmal bone cysts.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care, coordination, and communication to advance the treatment of aneurysmal bone cysts and improve outcomes.
