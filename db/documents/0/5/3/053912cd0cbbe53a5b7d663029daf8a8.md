Any history of a severe allergic reaction to an NMBA or anaphylaxis is a contraindication to the administration of NMBA. In most cases, the use of these drugs is in critical care settings. The clinician should be familiar with the pharmacokinetics of NMBA. Pancuronium and vecuronium undergo liver metabolism by deacetylation. Hence in patients with liver failure, caution should be exercised in using these drugs.

Rocuronium and vecuronium get excreted via the hepatobiliary system and should be avoided in cases of liver failure if there is an alternative agent available.

Pancuronium, doxacurium, pipecuronium should be avoided in kidney failure because they undergo renal excretion.

AtracuriumÂ and cisatracurium are options in case of kidney or liver failure. These NMDAs get eliminated by a unique process called Hoffman elimination which is a spontaneous degradation process.
