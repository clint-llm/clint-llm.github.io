Trauma continues to be the predominant cause of death for individuals up to the age of 44 years old.

Hemorrhage is the leading cause of both maternal mortality and preventable trauma death worldwide.

Trauma patients also require a large number of hospital resources and are responsible for using approximately 70% of all blood transfused at a trauma center.

Transfusion protocols from donated cross-matched blood remain the standard treatment for the hemorrhagic patient, although it is not without risk and has potential adverse side effects. Transfusion of donated blood carries the risk of disease transmission, citrate toxicity, hyperkalemia, hypothermia, hypomagnesemia, acidosis, sepsis, respiratory failure, and thrombotic complications.

Autotransfusion has not always been a safe procedure. The first known documented procedure of autotransfusion was performed in 1818 by Dr. James Blundell. Dr. Blundell became frustrated by the loss of a patient due to a uterine hemorrhage. Blood transfusions had been attempted for many years before Dr. Blundell, but he was the first to attempt autotransfusion from experimentation with canine specimens. Later he would try his procedure on humans but not without risk. The estimated mortality rate from his procedures was approximately 75%.
