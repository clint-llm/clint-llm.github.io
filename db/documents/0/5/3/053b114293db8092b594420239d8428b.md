Alveoli are microscopic balloon-shaped structures located at the end of the respiratory tree. They expand during inhalation, taking in oxygen, and shrink during exhalation, expelling carbon dioxide. These tiny air sacs are the site where gas exchange between inspired air and the blood takes place. A variety of factors, many of which are currently under research, determine the size and shape of individual alveoli. In the distal airways, a state of balance exists between the forces acting to deflate the lungs and the ones trying to keep them inflated. Alveolar tension is a collapsing force that plays a crucial role in maintaining this balance. The article will review the essential elements of pulmonary anatomy, histology, and physiology that control alveolar tension, one of the main determinants of lung recoil.
