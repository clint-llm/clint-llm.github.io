The pathophysiology of PH group 3 is multifactorial and depends on the underlying disease processes. Pulmonary vasoconstriction in response to hypoxia plays a prominent role in the early phase of the disease process in both obstructive and restrictive lung disease. Prolonged hypoxemia impairs the release of endothelin-derived vasodilators like nitric oxide and prostaglandins. Also, it promotes the release of pulmonary vasoconstrictors like endothelin, increasing pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).

In the late phase, remodeling of pulmonary microvessels with smooth muscle hyperplasia and constriction of intima leads to vascular lumen obliteration.
