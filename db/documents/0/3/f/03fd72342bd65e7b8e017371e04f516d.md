The epidemiology of pulsus paradoxus is difficult to define due to the heterogeneity of the diseases that lead to its manifestation. The incidence of cardiac tamponade leading to pulsus paradoxus has been poorly documented. A single-center retrospective study of 136 patients admitted with the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade, the main causes were malignancy (32%), infection (24%), idiopathic (16%), iatrogenic (15%), postmyocardial infarction (7%), uremic (4%), and other causes (2%). However, the number who developed pulsus paradoxus was not noted. Although the statistics regarding pulsus paradoxus in cardiac tamponade are limited,  it is believed to occur in a majority of cases. In one prospective study of 15 patients with cardiac tamponade, pulsus paradoxus was present in 10 of the 15 patients (66.6%).
