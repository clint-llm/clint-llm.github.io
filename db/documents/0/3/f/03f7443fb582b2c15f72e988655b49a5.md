One study determined a 3-grade classification of Little League shoulder based on radiographic findings.

- Grade I: Widening of the epiphyseal plate in the lateral area only

- Grade II: Widening in all areas of the epiphyseal plate and metaphyseal demineralization

- Grade III: Slipped epiphysis

An older classification system proposes 4 grades based on the level of displacement.

- Grade I: Less than 5 mm

- Grade II: Less than one-third of the width of the shaft

- Grade III: Between one-third and two-thirds of the width of the shaft

- Grade IV: Greater than two-thirds the width of the shaft
