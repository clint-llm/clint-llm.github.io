The International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG)-based clinical staging is used to tailor management strategies in patients with testicular malignancies. All patients are classified as Clinical Stage 0, I, II, or III after imaging and quantification of tumor markers. Stage 0 includes patients with germ cell neoplasia in-situ, stage I includes patients with tumor limited to the testis, stage II patients have lymph node involvement, and stage III patients have distant metastases.

**Stage 0:******If untreated, GCNIS has a risk of developing into TGCT after 7 years in 70% of cases.****Management of GCNIS should involve shared decision-making, and options include close surveillance with ultrasonography, orchiectomy, and radiotherapy. Though low-dose radiotherapy (at least 20 cGy) has similar cure rates as orchiectomy, scatter to contralateral testis can result in up to 40% of men treated by radiotherapy requiring testosterone replacement therapy or experiencing subfertility.

**Stage I:******Orchiectomy is the initial management strategy. The risk of relapse differs between seminoma and non-seminomatous tumors, and management differs accordingly, as discussed below.

**Seminoma:**Approximately 15% to 18% of patients with stage I disease will relapse after orchiectomy without adjuvant treatment.****While surveillance is recommended, two strategies may be considered: single-agent carboplatin chemotherapy for high-risk patients (rete-testis invasion and tumor size >4cm) or surveillance. In the absence of high volume(>4cm) and rete-testis invasion, the risk of relapse is <5%, and no adjuvant therapy is indicated. Invasion of both rete-testis and lymphovascular tissue yields a 25% risk of relapse, while the risk of relapse is only 4% if neither of them is involved.

Surveillance of seminoma, however, relies heavily on cross-sectional imaging, as serum tumor markers are elevated only in approximately 15% of pure seminoma, and longer-term surveillance is required.

**Non-seminomatous tumors:**There is a 14% to 22% risk of relapse without adjuvant treatment in tumors without lymphovascular invasion. The risk of occult metastatic disease is greater if the lymphovascular invasion or embryonal predominance is seen in the primary tumor. If the lymphatic or vascular invasion is involved, there is an approximately 50% risk of developing metastasis without adjuvant treatment.****Such a strategy avoids long-term effects of chemotherapy and surgical recovery from primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, though it relies upon regular laboratory and cross-sectional imaging evaluation.  Though most relapses occur within the first two years after diagnosis, longer-term surveillance is required due to the risk of late relapse. For patients who decline to undergo surveillance, one or two cycles of BEP chemotherapy can be considered.****

A single cycle of BEP is found to reduce the risk of relapse from 50% to 3%.****While relapse rates after primary chemotherapy are low, those patients who do recur following BEP are commonly chemoresistant. In select patients, at dedicated referral centers with experienced surgeons, nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymph node detection(RPLND) offers cure rates comparable to chemotherapy and also results in a decreased need for surveillance cross-sectional imaging.

The rationale for surgery is that modern nerve-sparing techniques can result in an excellent cure rate without diminishing fertility.  Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection also treats occult metastatic teratoma, which is not sensitive to any chemotherapy regimens, and which is present in up to 25% of men with occult metastatic disease.  Studies have shown that between 19% and 28% of men with clinical Stage I disease harbor pathologic Stage II disease in the retroperitoneum and that over 80% of these patients can be cured by RPLND alone, sparing chemotherapy and its side effects.

**Stage IIA and IIB:**Orchiectomy is the initial management strategy. Further management depends on the histopathological type as below.

**Seminoma:**Radiotherapy has been the historical standard for Stage IIA seminomas, though induction chemotherapy with three cycles of BEP or four cycles of EP is increasingly used. The standard radiation field should be extended from the ipsilateral iliac region to the para-aortic region (also called as 'hockey-stick field'). The relapse rate is 5% after radiotherapy, and overall survival is approximately 100%.

**Non-seminomatous tumors:**All IIA and IIB non-seminomatous tumors are treated with IGCCCG risk group-directed chemotherapy and can be treated with three cycles of BEP, four cycles of EP, or primary RPLND.****In patients with residual retroperitoneal disease of >1cm after chemotherapy, salvage resection is recommended.****Nerve-sparing surgical techniques can be undertaken to preserve ejaculation and to conserve fertility.****For N1 disease, surveillance is generally preferred after RPLND since the rate of relapse is <20%. For N2 or N3 disease, recurrence rates are higher, and hence chemotherapy with two cycles of BEP or EP is justified. For N2 and N3 teratomas, surveillance after RPLND is adequate, as teratoma is chemoresistant.****

When imaging data is insufficient to determine the stage, RPLND can be performed, or surveillance with imaging six weeks later to evaluate disease status is also an acceptable alternative. Rapidly growing lesions with rising tumor marker levels should be treated with primary chemotherapy according to IGCCCG risk-group classification, as shown in the figure below. Following chemotherapy, if there are any residual lesions ≥, 1 cm, RPLND should be performed. If patients undergoing chemotherapy have growing tumors and normal or declining tumor markers, teratoma or an undifferentiated malignant tumor should be suspected, and RPLND is indicated.

**Stage IIC and III****:**Standard treatment regimens for advanced tumors include chemotherapy with BEP, EP, or Cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens such as VIP (etoposide, ifosfamide, cisplatin) or VeIP (vinblastine, ifosfamide, cisplatin), according to the IGCCCG risk classification. In an IGCCCG analysis, the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with intermediate prognosis was 80% and for patients with poor prognosis was 48%.****For patients with good prognosis according to the IGCCCG risk stratification, three cycles of BEP or four cycles of EP are recommended. For patients with intermediate or poor prognosis, four cycles of BEP are recommended. Several other studies did not show more effective or less toxic chemotherapy regimens.****

Tumor marker levels should be assessed at the end of the first cycle of chemotherapy. For patients with unsatisfactory tumor marker decline, dose-intensified chemotherapy should be considered. High dose chemotherapy regimens are not indicated as the initial treatment itself since trials have failed to prove a survival benefit when compared to standard doses.

Approximately 1 to 2% of patients present with brain metastasis. The overall survival in such patients at initial diagnosis is poor (30% to 40%), but it is worse in patients in whom brain metastasis occurs as relapsed disease (2% to 5%).****

Concurrent whole-brain radiotherapy and chemotherapy strategy is found to cause central nervous system toxicity (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or cerebral atrophy), and hence should be avoided.

**Treatment of Residual Lesions**

**Seminoma**

Usually, seminoma responds well to chemotherapy (approximately 95% of patients) and does not need residual tumor resection. If serum βHCG levels are increased, salvage chemotherapy is indicated.

**Nonseminomatous Tumors**

When residual radiographic abnormalities (classed as lesions >1 cm) are present after chemotherapy, residual tumor resection is warranted. Among residual masses over 1cm in size following chemotherapy, approximately 10% can harbor vital cancer, 40% may harbor chemotherapy-resistant teratoma, and 50% can be expected to harbor necrotic tissue and/or fibrosis.****

However, some centers prefer to perform RPLND to decrease the risk of late relapse, particularly in the case of teratoma and secondary somatic malignancy. Patients in whom the levels of serum tumor markers (especially AFP) plateau after chemotherapy need residual tumor resection rather than salvage chemotherapy. Even in patients with localized disease and plateauing levels of βHCG, surgery may offer a superior cure rate, and in these cases, the treatment decision should be made by specialized centers for testicular tumors.

**Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Disease**

Standard treatment of patients with tumor marker-positive relapse after first-line chemotherapy, refractory disease, and tumor progression during chemotherapy, or within 3 months thereafter, is salvage chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of residual disease. Standard salvage regimens include four cycles of paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (TIP), four cycles of vinblastine, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (VIP), and two or three courses of carboplatin and etoposide high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT).

The residual disease of any size should be resected since resection is known to be superior to salvage therapy in preventing relapse. Unresectable disease warrants salvage chemotherapy. Late relapse (defined as disease recurrence >2 years after completion of first-line therapy) tumors are more likely to be chemoresistant, and surgery is the first choice of treatment in patients with resectable disease, irrespective of tumor marker levels.
