Tetracyclines are contraindicated in pregnancy because of the risk of hepatotoxicity in the mother, the potential for permanent discoloration of teeth in the fetus (yellow or brown in appearance), as well as impairment of fetal long bone growth. Tetracycline usage is also associated with teeth discoloration in children under the age of eight. Thus it should be avoided in pediatric patients under that age.

Clinicians should also avoid tetracyclines in patients with renal failure due to the excretion of the drug being primarily by the kidneys. If tetracyclines must be used in this group of patients, either reduce the dosage and/or increase the interval between doses should be prolonged.

Tetracyclines do cross into breastmilk; therefore, they are safe while breastfeeding. The significant amount of calcium in breastmilk chelates the drug and limits its availability to the infant.
