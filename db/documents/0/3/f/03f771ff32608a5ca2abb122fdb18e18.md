The function of the cardiac index is to create a normalized value for the cardiac function, which effectively corrects for the patient’s body size. The goal of the heart is to keep blood circulating at an appropriate volume to meet the current metabolic demand of the body. The cardiac output varies by body size and activity level. In general, a normal range for cardiac output at rest is between 4.0 - 8.0 L/min, with the average being 5 L/min. During exercise, elite athletes can reach a cardiac output as high as ~40 L/min. The normal value for the cardiac index should be between 2.5 - 4.0 L/min/m^2. A value under 2.0 should raise suspicion for cardiogenic shock (characterized by <2.2 L/min/m2 with support or <1.8 L/min/m2 without support).
