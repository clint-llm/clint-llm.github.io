The reported incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia is variable, depending on several factors: the population of infants included, the frequency and timing of glucose testing, the method of testing, and the definition of hypoglycemia used. A 2006 study by Harris et al. that sought to determine the incidence of hypoglycemia (blood glucose <47 mg/dL) in the first 48 hours of life in infants greater than 35 weeks gestation at risk of hypoglycemia by AAP guidelines found that 25% of all deliveries were at risk for hypoglycemia; of those at-risk infants, 51% experienced at least one episode of hypoglycemia.
