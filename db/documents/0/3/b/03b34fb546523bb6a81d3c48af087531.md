A. duodenale as well as, Ancylostoma braziliense, Ancylostoma caninum, and Ancylostoma ceylanicum, are anthropophilic human hookworms transmitted from infected soil and transmitted via contact with domesticated animals, such as dogs and cats which are the definitive host of these species. A. duodenale and A. ceylanicum cause intestinal infections with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, anemia, and physical and cognitive impairment. Moreover, A. duodenale pulmonary symptoms can occur in infected humans. Furthermore, all Ancylostoma species can cause creeping skin eruption called cutaneous larva migrans (CLM). Although it is rare, eosinophilic enteritis may occur due to A. caninum infection.
