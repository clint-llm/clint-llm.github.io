In the acute care setting, the practitioner may not be able to differentiate MIRM from other mucocutaneous eruptions. Therefore, consultation with an infectious disease specialist or dermatologist or transfer to a facility with the appropriate resources may be considered.  All patients with MIRM warrant supportive care, pain control for skin lesions and oral ulcerations (“magic mouthwash” solution or sucralfate), mucosal care, and correction of any fluid and nutritional deficiencies due to decreased oral intake. Severe MIRM with extensive skin detachment may require early transfer to a burn center.
