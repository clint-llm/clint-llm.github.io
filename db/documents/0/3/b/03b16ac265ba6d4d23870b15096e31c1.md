Serious complications after globe and orbital surgery requiring immediate intervention include:

- Endophthalmitis

- Persistent open globe wound

- Sympathetic ophthalmia

- Orbital compartment syndrome

- Orbital cellulitis

- Orbital implant impingement on the optic nerve

- Orbital implant impingement on the rectus muscle eliciting an oculocardiac reflex

- Bradycardia is caused by the oculocardiac reflex

- Scleral perforation resulting in retinal breaks, tears, or detachments

Complications also include:

- Anterior segment ischemia if multiple EOMs are transected, detached, and reattached

- Permanent mydriasis

- Infraorbital nerve hypoesthesia

- Upper or lower eyelid retraction

- Persistent diplopia

Persistent diplopia can be a complication of:

- EOM adherence to mesh or porous implants

- EOM adherence/entrapment from inadequate orbital fracture reduction

- Fibrosis from scar tissue or orbital fat adherence

- Fibrosis from a damaged trochlea or superior oblique tendon resulting in an acquired Brown syndrome (though this typically resolves)

- Inadvertently resecting too much of the EOM

- Lost or "slipped" EOM

- EOM palsy from the initial trauma

- Contracture of the antagonist muscle
