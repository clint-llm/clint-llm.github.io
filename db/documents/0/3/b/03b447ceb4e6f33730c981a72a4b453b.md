Education about the risks of drugs of abuse, such as LSD, must be continually emphasized to reduce the risk of accidental ingestion and overdose. Patients often experiment without knowledge of the substances they ingest, and this understandably leads to many negative experiences and potentially unnecessary hospitalizations. Since LSD is a schedule I substance, education about the ramifications of possessing and distributing such substances should also be emphasized, along with the substance's mechanism of action and subjective effects to reduce instances of overdoses.
