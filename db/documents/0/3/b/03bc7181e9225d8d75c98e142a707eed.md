Complications of end-stage renal disease are divided into two groups—complications due to ESRD and complications due to vascular access or dialysis.

**Complications due to ESRD**

- Coronary heart disease is a significant complication of chronic kidney disease and is the most common cause of death in this population. Patients on dialysis have a 10 to 30 times higher cardiovascular mortality risk than the general population.

- Peripheral vascular disease is also commonly seen

- Hypertension

- Mineral and bone disorders (secondary to hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency)

- Hyperuricemia

- Metabolic acidosis

- Hyperphosphatemia

- Hypoalbuminemia

- Anemia

- Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction

**Complications due to Vascular Access/Dialysis**

- Bleeding

- Local or disseminated intravascular infection

- Graft occlusion

- Electrolyte abnormalities after dialysis

- Dialysis dementia

- Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome
