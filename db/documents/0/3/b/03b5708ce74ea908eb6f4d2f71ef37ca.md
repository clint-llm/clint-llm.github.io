Over 150 million people worldwide are affected by erectile dysfunction.Â Alprostadil is an approved second-line treatment for erectile dysfunction (oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors like sildenafil are first-line therapy).

Alprostadil can also be a therapeutic option for the temporary ductus arteriosus patency maintenance in heart conditions where duct patency is mandated for survival until the defect is corrected surgically. The defects are both cyanotic (e.g., TGA - transposition of great vessels, TOF - tetralogy of Fallot, tricuspid atresia, pulmonary stenosis, etc.) and acyanotic (e.g., coarctation of the aorta, interruption of the aortic arch).

Topical alprostadil has also shown promising results for the treatment of FSAD (female sexual arousal disorder) when used in a clinic on females with female sexual arousal disorder, but additional studies are necessary to define further a proper role of topical alprostadil in the treatment of FSAD.
