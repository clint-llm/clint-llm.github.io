The most important risk factors associated with RAM are chronic systemic hypertension (75% of patients), arteriosclerosis, abnormal lipid levels, and inherent structural defects in blood vessels. These lead to focal ischemia of the blood vessel wall bringing about increased vessel permeability and intimal collagen remodeling. This predisposes to saccular (sac-like or blowout, i.e., localized outpouching of arterial wall) or fusiform (spindle-shaped or cuffed, i.e., uniform widening of retinal arteriole) dilatation of vessels.

Retinal arteriolar aneurysms may also be seen in association with ocular sarcoidosis, peripheral multifocal chorioretinitis, and IRVAN (idiopathic retinal vasculitis, aneurysms, and neuroretinitis).

Retinal capillary macroaneurysms or microaneurysms are a result of ischemia due to venous obstruction. These are commonly associated with diabetes or venous occlusive diseases.

Retinal venous macroaneurysm may be seen in branch retinal venous occlusion in patients with chronic hypertension. However, isolated non-occlusive venous macroaneurysms have also been reported.
