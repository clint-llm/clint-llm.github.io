The placenta has several cellular structures to protect the health of the fetus. We can find substances that are part of the superfamily of ATP binding cassettes (ABC), such as multidrug resistance protein type 1, breast cancer resistance protein, multidrug-resistance like protein type 2 and 5.

The placenta can be considered an immune and endocrine organ. It produces many hormones and growth factors in autocrine and paracrine modalities, such as progesterone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, the human chorionic gonadotropin, the human placental lactogen, fibroblast growth factor, and many others.
