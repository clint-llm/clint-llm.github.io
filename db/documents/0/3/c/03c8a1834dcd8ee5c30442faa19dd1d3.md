Ongoing resuscitation is vital for patients who presented with a bowel obstruction. Nasogastric tube decompression should be left in place until an ileus has resolved or output has slowed significantly. Once bowel function has returned, the patient may be discharged home. Lifting precautions should be in place for 6 to 8 weeks.
