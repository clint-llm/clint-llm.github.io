In most case studies, AEN cases initially present symptoms of an upper GI bleed, with haematemesis/melaena (70% to 85% of cases)Â and hemodynamic instability.

On examination, the patient may have epigastric tenderness, pallor, and peripheral hypoperfusion. Vital signs often show low-grade pyrexia, hypotension, tachycardia, and in more severe cases, hypoxia. As AEN often presents as a result of hemodynamic instability, whatever is causing this may well confound the clinical picture.
