Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) is a late and chronic manifestation of Lyme borreliosis. If untreated, ACA progresses from an early inflammatory stage to a chronic, atrophic phase, which can be complicated by neuropathy, arthralgias, and cutaneous malignancy. Due to its insidious onset, the diagnosis of ACA is challenging and often delayed. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of ACA and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. 
- Review the clinical presentation of a patient with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans.
- Outline the appropriate treatment measures for acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. 
-  Summarize the importance of interprofessional collaboration to enhance the care of patients with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans.
