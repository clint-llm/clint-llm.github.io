In upper limb development, the limb bud appears at 26 days (intrauterine age). Somatic mesoderm will lead to the formation of upper limb vessels (as well as muscles and nerves). The presence of capillary networks characterizes this early stage of development which is then followed by the appearance of a marginal vein on day 31. At the time of appearance of the hand paddle on day 33, upper limb axial arteries appear (subclavian, axillary, and brachial). The appearance of the ulnar artery on day 41 coincides with the appearance of the digital rays within the hand paddle.
