Cases of severe benign prostatic hyperplasia that have failed multiple medical interventions can be treated with the transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) procedure.  For this procedure, an instrument is inserted retrograde through the urethra at the tip of the penis.  The device is then used to trim areas of the prostate gland to allow a larger canal for urine flow from the bladder.  Short-term complications of transurethral resection include hematuria, postoperative hemoglobin decrease, blood transfusion, clot retention, recatheterization, urinary retention, dysuria, and urinary tract infection.
