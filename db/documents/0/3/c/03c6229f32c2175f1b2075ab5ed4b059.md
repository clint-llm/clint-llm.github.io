Other mitochondrial disorders should be consideredÂ in patients presenting with a family history concerning for maternal mitochondrial inheritance.

Kearns-Sayre is a rare neuromuscular disorder which also may present as visual disturbance, short stature, hearing loss, and ataxia. However, Kearns-Sayre is distinguished by its characteristic visual findings:

- Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia

- Atypical retinitis pigmentosa

- Pigmentary degeneration of the retina

In addition to these visual findings, Kearns-Sayre patients often have cardiac manifestations which help distinguish these patients from MELAS patients.

Myoclonus epilepsy associated with ragged red fibers (MERRF) may be confused with MELAS as they both involve seizures, mental deterioration, and myopathy with ragged red fibers on biopsy. MERRF patients may also have hearing loss, visual disturbance secondary to optic atrophy, and short stature. The characteristic myoclonic seizure in MERRF may help to narrow diagnosis, but genetic testing should be considered to distinguish the 2 conditions.

Leigh syndrome may also present with progressive neurological deterioration, seizures, and vomiting mainly in young children.
