# Introduction

Perhaps biology faces no greater feat than the generation of a complex, multicellular organism from a single cell origin. The eye quintessentially represents this process through the formation of highly specific cell types, regulated by an intricate network of cellular interactions and genetic interplay of the early embryo.

# Development

**Early Morphogenesis**

The appearance of optic grooves (neuroectoderm origin) from the developing forebrain marks the first sign of eye development at week three of gestation

At four weeks gestation, the optic vesicle invaginates and creates the optic cup

The structures of the eye and its adnexa heavily derive from mesenchyme, particularly neural crest cells. The neural crest contributes to the corneal stroma and endothelium, the ciliary body, the uveal stroma and melanocytes, the sclera, meningeal sheaths, connective tissue of the optic nerve and extraocular muscles, and bones of the orbit

**Retina and Optic Nerve**

The retina emerges as the optic vesicle invaginates and forms the optic cup

**Iris and Ciliary Body**

The iris and ciliary body derive from the anterior-most tip of the optic cup

**Lens**

As the optic vesicle emerges, it induces the overlying surface ectoderm to differentiate into the lens placode. The lens placode then invaginates, eventually separating from the surface ectoderm and becoming the lens vesicle

**Vitreous**

In the mature eye, the vitreous serves to maintain the shape of the globe as well as secure the retina in place. During development, mesenchyme invades the optic cup through the retinal fissures. Among other things, this mesenchyme forms the primary vitreous body, which becomes entrapped as the retinal fissures close and seal off the optic cup. The primary vitreous body loses its vasculature, developing into an acellular gel known as the secondary vitreous body. Finally, the tertiary vitreous forms, giving rise to suspension fibers of the lens

**Choroid & Sclera**

The developing eye begins to take on the mature form with the formation of the choroid and sclera. Development of the choroid, the vascular layer that supplies the outer retina, begins during the sixth to seventh weeks as the outer retinal pigment epithelium of the optic cup induces surrounding mesenchyme

**Cornea**

The cornea, a clear portion of the outer eye, allows the passage of light into the eye and provides a large component of refraction. There are three major layers to the cornea: external corneal epithelium, derived from surface ectoderm, the central stroma layer derived from mesenchyme, and interior endothelium derived from neural crest cells

**Eyelids**

At approximately week six of gestation the eyelids begin to form, deriving from surface ectoderm and mesenchyme. The surface ectoderm contributes to the epidermis anteriorly and palpebral conjunctiva posteriorly. Between the epidermis and palpebral conjunctiva is a core of mesenchymal tissue which forms the orbicularis oculi muscle. It is the accumulation of neural crest mesenchyme at the lateral margin of the optic cup that induces the appendage-like growth of the eyelids, covering the globe

**Lacrimal Gland**

The lacrimal gland is believed to arise during the seventh week of gestation and will come to position itself in the superolateral position of the orbit

- The presumptive glandular stage: Thickening of the superior fornix epithelium and surrounding mesenchymal condensation

- The bud stage: Appearance of nodules through the formation of lumina within epithelial buds

- Glandular maturity stage: Appearance of adulthood features (beginning week 9) and continued maturation

Recent work also shows a developmental role for myoepithelial cells (MECs). MECs may provide a communicative medium for epithelial and mesenchymal cells, which their physical location between acinar epithelial cells and the basement membrane reinforces

# Molecular Level

Recent work in eye embryology has begun to elucidate the complex orchestration of numerous gene products necessary for proper eye development. Among the most notable of these are PAX6, PAX2, sonic hedgehog (SHH), and Rx. Throughout this interplay the importance not only of accurate products but also of accurate gene dosage cannot be overlooked: both deleterious and over-expressive mutations have been shown to result in eye malformations

PAX6 is expressed at the anterior neural plate, indicating the eye field. At this stage, the eye field has not yet been divided to create two globes. The division of the eye field is accomplished by sonic hedgehog (SHH), which is responsible for central nervous system polarity SHH divides the eye field via the division of the forebrain from which the optic vesicles arise. SHH also upregulates the expression of PAX2 PAX2 will become restricted in its expression to the proximal optic vesicle and be essential for optic stalk formation as well as the closure of the retinal fissures Rx is also expressed in the anterior neural plate and will continue to express in the optic vesicles. Rx plays a critical role in spatial patterning and morphogenesis of the optic vesicle. Additionally, Rx is essential for optic vesicle evagination and PAX6 expression Rx becomes localized to the neural retina and may be necessary for retinal differentiation and proliferation

# Clinical Significance

The delicate development of the eye is sensitive to embryologic errors. Some examples of congenital eye malformations include anophthalmia, coloboma, cyclopia, cataract, aniridia, detached retina, hyaloid artery persistence, aphakia, and cryptophthalmos. For brevity, the reader is encouraged to review other sources to learn more about these malformations as they have been well-described elsewhere.

Understanding the components of normal embryology will guide disease management and treatment options. This point is evident by the advent of therapeutic stem cell technologies, such as those under development for retinal and lacrimal gland regeneration
