Nerve blocks are useful when a wound repair is required over a large area that is innervated by one nerve. They are also useful when local infiltration of the wound may not be possible or could result in tissue damage or distortion. Other indications include wound closure, dental procedures, pain relief, debridement, and contraindication to general anesthesia.
