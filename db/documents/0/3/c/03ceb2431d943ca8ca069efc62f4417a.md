Of medications, many anti-hypertensive medications alter serum HDL levels. Diuretics cause an increase in all cholesterol and triglycerides proportionate to the dose. This effect is more pronounced in African Americans. The one exception is the reduction of HDL in diabetics on diuretics. Beta-blockers cause a decrease in HDL secondary to increased triglycerides. Cardioselective beta-blockers, especially in diabetics, have a smaller increasing effect on triglycerides. Alpha-blockers have an opposite effect compared to beta-blockers resulting in decreased triglycerides and increased HDL. HDL and other cholesterol are decreased with central sympathomimetics. Vasodilators increase HDL while reducing LDL and total cholesterol.
