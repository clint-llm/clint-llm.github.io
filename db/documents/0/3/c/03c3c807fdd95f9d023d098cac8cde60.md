Obesity contributes to a large portion of healthcare expenditure in the world. Approximately 5 to 7% of the national health expenditure in the U.S. is associated with obesity; this does not include diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, etc.

Globally,Â obesity is a huge burden. For example, the cost of obesity in 2019 ranged from 0.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) in India and 2.4% of GDP in Saudia Arabia. Reducing obesity prevalence by even 5% is shown to have an average reduction in economic costs between 5 to 13% worldwide.
