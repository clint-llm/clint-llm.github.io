The principles of diagnosis through the use of strain-counterstrain (SCS) involve a holistic evaluation of the patient's history and a thorough observation of body habitus. Before beginning the technique, the provider must assess the patient for any possible contraindications. After a potential dysfunction is determined, the tissue area is evaluated for tenderness and tissue texture abnormalities. It is recommended that the amount of pressure applied to diagnose a TP should typically not exceed the pressure required to blanch the nail-bed of the diagnosing finger. Applying more pressure than what is recommended could elicit pain that may inadvertently be perceived by the patient as a TP.

**Notable tips to keep in mind while utilizing SCS:**

- Anterior TPs typically require flexion.

- Posterior TPs typically require an extension.

- Midline points typically require primarily flexion or extension.

- Lateral points typically require more side-bending and rotation.

- It is best to use both tissue texture changes and tenderness to find the most suitable treatment position.

- Adequate myofascial relaxation is typically achieved by the presence of a "release" or "ease" of tension.
