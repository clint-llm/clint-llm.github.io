Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an aptly-named inherited disease with almost exclusively neurological manifestations, primarily migraines and premature onset of small vessel ischemic disease. It has a relatively characteristic appearance on MRI and diagnosis is made via genetic testing or skin biopsy. No disease-modifying therapies are yet available, and treatment is targeted mainly at cardiovascular risk reduction.
