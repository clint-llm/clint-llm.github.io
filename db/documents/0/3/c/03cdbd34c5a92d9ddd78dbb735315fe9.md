**History:**Patients with left ventricular dysfunction may be asymptomatic or present with exertional fatigue, palpitation, angina, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or orthopnea. Sudden cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death may be the initial presentation.

**Physical:**General physical examination varies with the stage of the disease and may reveal respiratory distress, cyanosis, elevation in JVP, bilateral pitting pedal edema, or congestive hepatomegaly. The precordial examination may reveal a displaced apex beat or pan systolic murmur of secondary mitral regurgitation.
