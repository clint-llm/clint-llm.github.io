The neurological examination in the setting of trauma is a systematic evaluation of important clinical signs that provide evidence to help determine further management and investigation of the patient's condition. The presence of focal neurologic findings or mental status changes is predictive of complications following trauma. A neurologic examination helps to localize and lateralize lesions due to traumatic head or spine injury. The physical examination in the setting of significant trauma must be assessed rapidly, is individualized based on the patient's medical stability, combativeness, and type of injuries, and is often performed under chaotic circumstances. This activity outlines and reviews the basic structure and implementation of a neurological examination in the setting of trauma and describes specific signs that hold clinical significance.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the basic structure of the neurological examination in the setting of acute trauma.
- Review the basic technique and implementation of the neurological examination in the setting of acute trauma.
- Identify both the normal and abnormal clinical signs elicited from a neurological examination in the setting of trauma.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients demonstrating signs of neurological deficits in the setting of acute trauma.
