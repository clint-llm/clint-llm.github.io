Anatomy of the diverticulum, as well as the commonly associated motility disorders, determine the type and range of diagnostic evaluation needed for epiphrenic diverticulum. It usually consists of barium swallow, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and manometry. Esophagogram using barium contrast helps to define the anatomical characteristics of the diverticulum as well as surgical planning. Most commonly, these diverticula are noted on the right side (70%) and are single; however, up to 15% can be multiple.
