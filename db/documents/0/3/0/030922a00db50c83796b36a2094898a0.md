- A thorough history and physical can help direct workup and evaluation of an uncommon clinical presentation.

- Palpation behind the knee revealing a prominent popliteal pulse should raise suspicion of the presence of an aneurysm.

- The differential diagnosis of swelling after hip surgery, although most often due to deep vein thrombosis, should include popliteal artery aneurysm, Bakerâ€™s cyst, or lymphatic obstruction.

- The presence of a large popliteal artery aneurysm can confound the diagnosis and/or increase the risk of deep venous thrombosis.

- Patient risk factors should be taken into consideration when recommending treatment.

- Technical advantages of a posterior approach for open repair include decompression of the aneurysm sac and ligation of collateral branches, which could cause enlargement of the sac at a later date if not addressed.

- Extensive, long aneurysmal degeneration of the popliteal artery that extends into the superficial femoral artery or tibioperoneal trunk may be better managed through a medial approach.

- Endovascular popliteal artery aneurysm repair using stent-grafts is a viable option and best suited for older, less active, or high medical risk patients. This does not necessarily decompress the aneurysm.
