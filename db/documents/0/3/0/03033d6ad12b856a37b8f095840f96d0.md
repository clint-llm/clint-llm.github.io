Like most joint injections, AC joint injections can be performed after or concomitantly with other conservative measures, including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and activity modifications. For patients with suspected AC joint osteoarthritis, an AC joint injection is possible for diagnostic purposes. Other indications include known AC joint osteoarthritis and distal clavicle osteolysis refractory to initial treatment modalities. Distal clavicle osteolysis usually results from prior trauma to the shoulder or from repetitive heavy lifting.
