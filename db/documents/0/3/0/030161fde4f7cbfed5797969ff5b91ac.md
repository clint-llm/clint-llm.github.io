Kaposi sarcoma is an interesting soft tissue tumor occurring in several distinct populations with a variety of presentations and courses. In its most well-known form, Kaposi sarcoma occurs in patients with immunosuppression, such as those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDs) or those undergoing immunosuppression due to an organ transplant. Initially described in 1872 by Moritz Kaposi, an Austro-Hungarian dermatologist in 5 patients with the multifocal disease,

- Classic form occurring in elderly men of Mediterranean and Eastern European descent on the lower extremities

- Endemic African form with generalized lymph node involvement occurring in children

- HIV-related form occurring with patients not taking highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with diffuse involvement of the skin and internal organs

- Iatrogenic form in immunosuppressed patients also with diffuse involvement of the skin and internal organs

Each form has a differing natural history ranging from indolent to more aggressive and fatal in anaplastic varieties.
