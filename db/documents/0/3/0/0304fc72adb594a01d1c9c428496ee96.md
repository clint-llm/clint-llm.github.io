The most common side effects of Dakin solution include redness, swelling, and skin irritation. The main concerns for using Dakin fluid are allergic reactions, skin hypersensitivity, and impaired wound healing, which can occur when using high concentrations of Dakin due to fibroblast toxicity.

Dakin solution often is used in pregnancy and during lactation as there is limited systemic absorption. However, it is classified as a category C agent by the FDA. Dakin has shown adverse fetal effects in animal reproduction studies, but there have been no adequate, well-controlled human studies. For this reason, the potential benefits of the solution in pregnant women warrant its use, notwithstanding the possible risk to the fetus.

The labeling on the Dakin solution may cause some confusion for healthcare providers regarding its strength. The labels list strengths as full strength at 0.5%, half strength at 0.25%, and quarter strength at 0.125%. This terminology can cause confusion for healthcare providers who consider the half strength and quarter strength to correspond to 0.5% and 0.25%, respectively. Of note, most hospitals use a modified Dakin solution of 0.025% for wound care, and studies have suggested that concentrations of Dakin solution greater than 0.025% may potentially be harmful to wound healing.
