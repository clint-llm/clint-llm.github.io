When discussing coronary artery embryology, there are three main topics to consider: the sinusoids, vascular endothelial network, and coronary buds of the aortic sinuses. The sinusoids are formed in the subepicardial space early in fetal development and are extensions of the trabeculae into the myocardium. The purpose of the sinusoids is to facilitate metabolic exchange between blood and fetal cardiac tissue before the establishment of proper coronary circulation.

During this stage, an in situÂ vascular network is developing within the epicardial atrioventricular and interventricular grooves. As the bulbus cordis begins to separate into the aorta and the pulmonary artery, the coronary buds are on both the right and left sinuses of Valsalva, just above the aortic valve primordia.

The ARAA arises from the proximal branching of the newly formed RCA established by the vascular endothelial network.
