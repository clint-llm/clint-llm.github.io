Wet ARMD is a multifactorial disease, and numerous risk factors have been identified in its progression. These risk factors include older age, elevated total serum cholesterol, micronutrient deficiency, smoking, family history, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and visible light exposure.

Many studies have also shown the key role inflammation plays in the pathogenesis of wet ARMD. Most notably, polymorphisms of complement factor H, which normally act to inhibit the alternative complement pathway, are among the best-known mutations in ARMD, suggesting the important role of complement activation in its development.
