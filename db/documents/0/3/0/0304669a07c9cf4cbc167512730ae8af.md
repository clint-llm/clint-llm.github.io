Based on the history and physical exam coupled with risk factor assessment, general screening labs such as complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, EKG, urinalysis (UA), and radiographic studies should be considered. Central nervous system imaging should be considered in patients who are taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications and have an appropriate history and mechanism.

Patients on anticoagulants found to have a significant intracranial hemorrhage require aggressive management. Reversal of the anticoagulant must be achieved rapidly.

The new oral anticoagulants such as dabigatran (Pradaxa), apixaban (Eliquis), and rivaroxaban (Xarelto) are indicated for a variety of clinical conditions that affect the elderly. These include treatment of venous thromboembolism, stroke prophylaxis in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, and acute coronary syndrome. The new oral anticoagulants have a different mechanism of action than warfarin (Coumadin) acting to inhibit Xa and Thrombin IIa in the coagulation cascade. Reversal of the anticoagulation caused by new oral anticoagulants is different then anticoagulation caused by warfarin. Only dabigatran has a direct reversal agent idarucizumab (Praxbind). Several other targeted antidote reversal agents are in development.

Reversal of anticoagulation caused by warfarin historically relied on the use of vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Recent literature suggests relying on vitamin K and FFP might be less effective than the use of vitamin K and prothrombin complex concentrates.  Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) therapy often require 30 min to 60 min to thaw the FFP. Further, large volumes of FFP in the range of 30 cc/kg (4 to 12 units) are often required for adequate reversal. The time to infuse the necessary volume of FFP can complicate care.  Treatment with vitamin K and prothrombin complex concentrates avoids these limitations. Prothrombin complex concentrates do not require blood group system (ABO) compatibility testing and infusion volumes are less than 100 cc**.**

Reversal of the anticoagulation caused by warfarin or new oral anticoagulants should be based on current institution-specific guidelines that are under constant revision.

Understanding the need for a thorough evaluation and aggressive resuscitation of the injured geriatric patient is instrumental in improving outcomes.
