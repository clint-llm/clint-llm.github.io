It is a high-grade neoplasm combining features of B-cell and plasma-cell neoplasms under the microscope. It appears as large cells with an immunoblastic appearance, moderately abundant cytoplasm,Â central oval nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The immunophenotype for plasmablastic lymphoma is similar to that in plasma cell neoplasms, positive for CD79a, IRF-4/MUM-1, BLIMP-1, CD38, and CD138. The neoplastic cells are negative for B-cell markers CD19, CD20, and PAX-5; however, they may be weakly positive for CD45. Few cases express T-cell markers CD2 or CD4. MYC is also expressed in half of the cases of PBL. Ki-67 proliferation index is usually high in most cases. EBV can be detected by EBV coded RNA expression, which is the most sensitive means to detect an EBV infection.
