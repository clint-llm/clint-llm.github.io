Morbid obesity, high ASA-score (≥3), onlay repair, and concomitant bowel surgery are potential risk factors for surgical complication. Lindmark et al emphasize the size of the fascial defect as an important factor in the preoperative risk evaluation of patients with a ventral hernia. They conclude that surgical complication increases by 1% for each mm increase in fascial defect size

1. Wound complications: including seroma, hematoma and surgical site infection. Open hernia repair techniques usually predispose to this kind of complication while the laparoscopic technique has resulted in a decrease in such complications

2. Bowel injury and adhesion:  laparoscopic technique predisposes to this type of complications. There is a low risk for enterotomy and dense adhesion related to direct contact of the mesh with the viscera

3. Recurrence: There is a higher recurrence rate with primary repair even in defects of <4 cm
