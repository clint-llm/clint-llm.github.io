The basis for the diagnosis of classic hydroa vacciniforme is from clinical and histopathologic findings. To distinguish typical hydroa vacciniforme from hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma, the following laboratory tests are beneficial:

- Hematologic and liver profiles

- Percentage of NK lymphocyte subset

- T-cell receptor gene rearrangement

- Anti-EBV antibody titers

- EBV DNA load in the peripheral blood.

Patients with hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma frequently have elevated hepatic transaminases, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, increased NK lymphocytes, monoclonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, and a high circulating EBV DNA load.
