Injury to bone marrow occurs in a multitude of settings (table 1). The most common etiology, idiopathic, accounts for 65%. Fanconi anemia is the most common hereditary cause. It presents in the late first decade with pancytopenia, organ hypoplasia, and bone defects including abnormal radii, absent thumbs, and short stature. Seronegative hepatitis is responsible for 5% to 10% of total cases. Telomerase defects are found in 5% to 10% of adult-onset aplastic anemia. Some of these associations are very rare for example, eosinophilic fasciitis.
