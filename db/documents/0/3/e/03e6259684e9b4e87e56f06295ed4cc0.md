Laboratory evaluations are often not helpful since the leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be normal or elevated; the initial diagnosis is a clinical one. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck should be obtained if there is any indication or suspicion of a deep neck abscess, regardless of a lack of evidence of an infection in the mastoid bone since prior antibiotics may have truncated the infection in the mastoid bone while the abscess was still developing in the neck. Recently, in the emergency room setting, aÂ bedside soft-tissue ultrasound with the use of a high-frequency linear array probe to the mastoid was used to detect a complex hypoechoic-anechoic fluid collection in the neck. An intravenous contrast CT scan was used to confirm the ultrasound findings, and both an abscess in the neck and ear pathology were identified. If there is a palpable fluctuance, needle aspiration at the bedside can be attampted, but great care should be taken.
