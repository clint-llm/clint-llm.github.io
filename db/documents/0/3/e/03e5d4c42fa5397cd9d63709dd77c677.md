Most of the time, the diagnosis can be made upon a thorough history and a physical examination. History includes self-resolving episodes of unilateral or bilateral pain in the neck. The pain may radiate to the head. Signs of active infection such as chills, cervical lymphadenopathy, erythema, and ear or throat pain are remarkably absent.

Physical examination should include a thorough review of the ear, nose, and throat along with evaluating for lymphadenopathy in the head and neck. Furthermore, it is important to examine the thyroid for thyroid tenderness and to look for any masses that are pulsatile or non-pulsatile in the neck region. Physical examination typically reveals a point tenderness in the lateral neck over the carotid bifurcation. Palpation of the carotid artery can worsen the pain, leading the pain to radiate to the ipsilateral ear. A systolic carotid bruit might be appreciated in some cases.

Although most of the literature reports a normal neurological examination, a case series reported neurological events in 8 out of 47 patients recruited in the study.
