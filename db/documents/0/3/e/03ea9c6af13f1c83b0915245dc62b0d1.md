MAbs have evolved drastically since their inception in the 1970s by Drs Kohler and Milstein. The initial agents were murine in origin and presented several issues with their continued use, including immunogenicity and the potential for anaphylaxis with repeated exposure. As the research in immunology, molecular biology, and biochemistry continued to advance, it became possible to create chimeric, humanized, and, eventually, fully humanized mAbs.

The mechanisms of action associated with mAbs include direct cell toxicity, immune-mediated cell toxicity, vascular disruption, and modulation of the immune system. Their evolution has placed mAbs at the forefront of highly individualized therapeutics for a variety of cancers and autoimmune diseases whilst limiting the adverse systemic effects associated with traditional treatment options.

Yet, despite these advancements and the wide variety of mAbs now available on the market, there is still significant work to be done to identify novel mAb targets and optimize the pharmacology-related properties of such molecules. Future directions include the continued developmentÂ and refinement of bispecific antibodies, which have the potential to target multiple therapeutic targets, activate multiple pathways simultaneously, and enhance the potency of therapy.
