Alternobaric vertigo is a benign condition that affects individuals traveling in environments with changing ambient pressures, such as SCUBA diving or aviation. However, it has also been reported in patients utilizing positive airway pressure breathing assistance. It is the direct result of an incongruency in middle ear pressures caused by incomplete or insufficient equalization, typically while moving from an area of higher pressure to one of lower pressure. Numerous factors may increase the likelihood of experiencing this phenomenon, including recent upper respiratory infections, use of decongestants, or abnormal eustachian tube morphology. The vertigo is typically considered mild and usually resolves with further ascent and with the use of equalization techniques to restore similar pressures between the two chambers, though it has been reported to persist for days or weeks. Patients are often first seen by nurses, evaluated by primary care, emergency medicine, or hyperbaric physicians. They may need evaluation by an otolaryngologist. Care can be improved by the coordination and communication of this interprofessional team. [Level 5]
