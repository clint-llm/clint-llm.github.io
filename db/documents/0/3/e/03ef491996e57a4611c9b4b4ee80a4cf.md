The sinoatrial nodal artery consists of vasculature smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscle cells exist within the media of the artery and group into electrically coupled aggregates. The smooth muscle cells respond to various signals for vasodilation and vasoconstriction to allow the artery to meet the metabolic requirements of the tissue for which it is serving. Furthermore, smooth muscles cells of the artery are essential in adaptive wall remodeling. Remodeling occurs in response to intraluminal injuries such as catheters, stents, or downstream ligation; this is done mainly through micro ribonucleic acids which signal the migration and differentiation of smooth muscle cells to repair the injured tissue. Finally, When atherosclerosis is present in the endothelial lining of the artery, the intimal smooth muscle cells initiate a pro-inflammatory response which leads to the conversion of smooth muscle cells to foam cells (which are macrophage-like cells located in a hyperlipidemic environment).
