When a stable pregnant patient presents for an evaluation with complaints of pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, or trauma, the initial action is to get the patient on a monitor and obtain a full set of vital signs. Vital signs must be monitored closely in the pregnant patient to ensure shock is promptly recognized. In addition to cardiac monitoring and continuous pulse oximetry, 2 large-bore intravenous (IV) lines must be established, coordinating care between the physician and nursing staff of paramount importance.

In cases when an unstable female patient presents for an evaluation in an acute setting (e.g., the emergency department), staff must work together to ensure that portable bedside ultrasound is available and ready for use by trauma or emergency medicine providers (preferably before the unstable patient arrives). While the primary assessment is being performed, nursing staff should obtain a full set of vital signs and establish at least 2 large-bore IVs. In cases of known pregnancy or if bedside ultrasound reveals pregnancy, emergent consultation with obstetrical specialists must be requested. Nursing should be prepared and plan for a prompt sign-out to obstetrical services in the setting of a pregnant patient.
