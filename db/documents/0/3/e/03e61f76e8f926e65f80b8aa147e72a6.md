Patients can develop a rash based on exposure time to the drug. It was found that the higher the exposure time, the greater the risk of developing a rash. Patients that experience rash also had signs of systemic illness, which is treatable with antihistamines, steroids, or discontinuation of the drug.

Research has determined that a small number of patients may experience seizures with ziprasidone. Therefore, caution is necessary when dosing ziprasidone in patients with a history of seizures or conditions that can lower the seizure threshold.

As ziprasidone also has a binding affinity to histamine H1 receptors, the possibility of somnolence can occur. Priapism, body temperature regulation, and suicide can also occur if the appropriate patient and case management are not in place.

The risk of esophageal dysmotility and aspiration pneumonia in the elderly must be assessed before giving this drug. Antipsychotics, in general, have been associated with both of these conditions, particularly in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

In an overdose, ensure the patient maintains ventilation, and intubation may be possible. Intravenous (IV) access must be done with gastric lavage after intubation if the patient is unconscious. Charcoal is also an option, along with a laxative for drug clearance.
