The pathogenesis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is Virchow triad. Three components of Virchow triad as below,

- Vascular endothelial injury, such as atherosclerosis, central venous catheter placement, vascular inflammation, trauma, severe burn

- Change of blood flow, such as immobility, arrhythmia, venous mechanical obstruction

- Hypercoagulopathy, such as thrombophilia, malignancy, nephrotic syndrome, pregnancy, hormone therapy

Internal jugular vein thrombosis is most commonly due to prolonged central venous catheterization, trauma to the neck, infection, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) andÂ intravenous drug abuse.
