The transsphenoidal approach is contraindicated in sphenoid sinusitis, intrasellar vascular anomalies, ectatic midline carotid arteries, or significantÂ lateral suprasellar extension of tumor, especially when the epicenter is lateral to the carotid artery. Relative contraindications include a poorly pneumatized sphenoid sinus, significant suprasellar adenoma extension, and constrictive diaphragma sellae.
