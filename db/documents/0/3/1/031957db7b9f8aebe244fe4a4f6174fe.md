Approximately one-third of women will have had a UTI by age 24 and one-half by age 32. The incidence of UTI is 12% in women based on self-reported annual incidence. A university cohort study estimates the annual incidence of UTI at 0.5 to 0.7 UTIs per person-year in sexually active women. Factors that increase the risk for uncomplicated cystitis include sexual intercourse, spermicide use, new sex partner within the past year, previous UTI, strong family history of UTI in a first-degree female relative, and post-menopausal state. Acute cystitis is much more common than pyelonephritis, with an estimated ratio of 18 to 28 cystitis episodes for every episode of pyelonephritis.

Depending on the underlying condition, there is wide variation in the incidence of complicated UTIs. The estimated prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in women with diabetes is 26% compared to 6% in non-diabetic females. Patients with diabetes are also at increased risk of developing both acute cystitis and pyelonephritis. UTIs are common in patients who had renal transplantation, with retrospective cohort studies showing an incidence between 47% and 75%.

The risk is highest in the first year post-transplantation. Approximately 2.3% of pregnant women develop a symptomatic UTI. Other risk factors for developing a complicated UTI include nephrolithiasis, immunocompromised status, the presence of foreign bodies such as a urinary catheter, urinary tract instrumentation, renal insufficiency, functional or anatomic abnormality of the urinary tract, urinary stents, strictures, and obstructive uropathy.

The incidence of simple cystitis in men is relatively low. It is estimatedÂ to be fewer than 10 cases per year per 10,000 men under age 65.
