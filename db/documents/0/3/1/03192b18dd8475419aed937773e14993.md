Neurons are electrically excitable, reacting to input via the production of electrical impulses, propagated as action potentials throughout the cell and its axon. These action potentials are generated and propagated by changes to the cationic gradient (mainly sodium and potassium) across their plasma membranes. These action potentials finally reach the axonal terminal and cause depolarization of neighboring cells through synapses. This action is the way these cells can interact with each other, i.e., at synapses via synaptic transmission. Normally, the cell’s interior is negative, compared to its outside. This state is the resting membrane potential of about -60mV. A neuronal action potential gets generated when the negative inside potential reaches the threshold (less negative). This change in membrane potential will open voltage-gated cationic channel (sodium channel) resulting in the process of depolarization and generation of the neuronal action potential. Neuronal action potentials are vital for propagation of impulses along any nerve fiber even at a distance. They also are crucial for communication among neurons through synapses. Disruption of this mechanism can have drastic effects resulting in lack of impulse generation and conduction, illustrated by various neurotoxins and demyelinating disorders.
