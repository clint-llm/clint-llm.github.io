Bone marrow biopsy is the mainstay of the diagnosis of CAMT or AAMT (see the section on histopathology).

**CAMT**

Approximately 1% to 5% of newborns are found to have thrombocytopenia, of which 5% to 10% have platelet counts below 50,000.

The c-Mpl gene analysis is done with bidirectional sequencing of all 12 exons, including coding regions, splice sites, and intron-exon boundaries. This testing is conducted at GeneDx in Maryland (with 95% to 97% sensitivity to detect CAMT mutations) and Prevention Genetics in Wisconsin.

The findings of homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in c-Mpl are considered confirmatory for the diagnosis of CAMT.

**AAMT**

Since the etiology of AAMT is so varied, no standard algorithm can be laid out to come to the diagnosis. A strong clinical suspicion for AAMT and a knowledge of the disease are needed to request a bone marrow biopsy and confirm the diagnosis.
