Facilitated intubation, also known as medication-facilitated intubation or sedation-facilitated intubation, refers to intubation performed using a sedative or anesthetic drug as an induction agent, without the use of a paralytic (neuromuscular blocking agent). In comparison, rapid sequence intubation (RSI) employs both an induction agent and a paralytic drug. However, on the field, paralytics are often unavailable. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques involved in performing intubation without a paralytic agent and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe how to evaluate for the need for intubation. 
- Summarize the indications for intubation without paralytic agents.
- Outline the technique involved in performing intubation without paralytic agents.
- Explain the importance of optimizing care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients requiring intubation without paralytics.
