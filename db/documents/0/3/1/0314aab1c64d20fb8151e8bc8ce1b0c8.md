Clinical manifestations vary depending on the severity of the illness. Fever and chills are the most common manifestations. Still, they may be masked if the patient is immunocompromised or at extremes of an age where atypical presentations of sepsis occur (altered mental status, hypotension, lethargy, fatigue). Exit site examination to look for signs of inflammation of tunneled catheters with inspection and palpation of the subcutaneous track is essential. Patients may report pain, swelling, or discharge from the exit site and redness surrounding or along the subcutaneous track when exit site or tunnel infections are present. For long-term catheters, difficulty drawing blood or poor flow are considered risk factors and manifestations of CLABSI.
