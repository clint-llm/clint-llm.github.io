In microscopical blood smear evaluation, spherocytic red blood cells appear as smaller round cells lacking the normal central pale area due to the absence of a normal biconcave shape. Spherocytes may also be present in other types of hemolytic anemia, although more commonly in hereditary spherocytosis.

Howell-Jolly bodies are frequently present in post-splenectomy blood smear microscopic evaluation; their absence after splenectomy may be a sign of residual functioning splenic tissue.
