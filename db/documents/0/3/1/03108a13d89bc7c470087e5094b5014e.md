Symptomatic Coracoclavicular Joint

A symptomatic coracoclavicular joint is a condition associated with the actual presence of a coracoclavicular joint. While the prevalence is of the coracoclavicular joint morphology is around 1%, the literature suggests it is typically asymptomatic.

Trauma

AC joint injuries commonly result from a direct fall onto the shoulder. Trauma, whether direct or indirect, may lead to dislocation or failure of the AC joint. The CC ligament helps to oppose the separation of the joint and maintain the approximation of the acromion and clavicle. If one component of the coracoclavicular joint suffers disruption, the other component acts as a fulcrum for the coracoid process to rotate under the clavicle. In the setting of injury to the AC joint, these sites of injury act for the basis of the multiple acromioclavicular joint dislocations that may occur. Rupture of the CCL occurs in grade III to VI injuries according to Rockwood Classification.

- Type I—Sprain of acromioclavicular (AC) ligament, joint space intact, no CC involvement.

- Type II— Tear of AC ligament. Widened joint space; coracoclavicular distance is maintained with intact CC ligament.

- Type III—Complete disruption of AC. Coracoclavicular ligaments disrupted up to 100%, though are intact and remain attached to the periosteal sleeve — a high probability of muscle detachment. The clavicle appears mildly is displaced superiorly.

- Type IV— AC joint rupture with posterior joint dislocation into the trapezius. AC ligament complete disruption. Evident widened joint space: partial or complete coracoclavicular disruption.

- Type V— Demonstrates complete disruption of acromioclavicular ligament, coracoclavicular ligament, and muscle attachments. The clavicle dislocates grossly superiorly.

- Type VI—Complete disruption of acromioclavicular ligament. Coracoclavicular ligament completely torn, the coracoclavicular interval does not exist - partially intact or absent muscle attachments. The clavicle is displaced inferiorly relative to the acromion process.
