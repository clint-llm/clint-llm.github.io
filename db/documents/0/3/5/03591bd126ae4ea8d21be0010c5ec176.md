The human cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), also known as mucin 16 (MUC16), is a cell-surface, glycoprotein antigen normally expressed in tissues derived from coelomic epithelia, such as ovary, fallopian tube, peritoneum, pleura, pericardium, colon, kidney, and stomach.

In a study carried out by Bast et al. in 1983, elevated levels of serum CA 125 (> 35 U/mL) were present in 82% of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, 28.5% of patients with non-gynecological cancers such as pancreatic, lung, breast, colorectal, and 6 % of the patients with benign diseases such as an ovarian cyst.
