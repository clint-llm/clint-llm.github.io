The common fibular nerve receives innervation from the L4-S1 nerve roots with a minor contribution from the L2 nerve root. The nerve is formed at the lumbosacral plexus and initially travels within the sciatic nerve.

The sciatic nerve’s fibular branch innervates the short head of the biceps femoris muscle. This finding is significant from an electrodiagnostic standpoint because it is the only muscle proximal to the knee that the fibular nerve innervates. If a patient experiences fibular neuropathy at the fibular neck, the short head of the biceps femoris muscle will not be affected. The knee's lateral surface is innervated by the lateral cutaneous nerve, a sensory branch of the common fibular nerve. Following this branch, the common fibular nerve curves around the fibular neck and passes between the fibula and the peroneus longus muscle through the fibular tunnel.

The tibialis longus and brevis muscles are innervated by the superficial fibular nerve, terminating in sensory branches that supply the lateral portion of the two-thirds of the lateral lower leg and the dorsum of the foot and toes except for the first dorsal web space.

The deep fibular nerve, also called the anterior tibial nerve, supplies the tibialis anterior muscle, the extensor digitorum longus muscle, extensor hallucis longus muscle, peroneus tertius muscle, and the extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) muscle. Terminal sensory branches provide innervation of the skin of the first dorsal webspace.
