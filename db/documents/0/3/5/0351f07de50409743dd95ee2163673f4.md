Psuedo-hypertelorism or the appearance of widely spaced eyes may occur when examining patients with features including a flat nasal bridge, epicanthic folds, exotropia, widely spaced eyebrows, or narrow palpebral fissures. Telecanthus is a term used to describe an increased inner canthal distance with preserved outer cantal distance. Telecanthus is often associated with prominent epicanthic folds. Disorders that feature telecanthus as a prominent finding include Down syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome,  fetal alcohol syndrome, Turner syndrome, Cri du Chat syndrome, and Waardenburg syndrome.
