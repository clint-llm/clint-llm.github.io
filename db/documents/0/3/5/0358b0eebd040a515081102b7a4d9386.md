Pulmonary regurgitation is a valvular abnormality with a myriad of etiologies, the most common of which being secondary to the repair of tetralogy of Fallot. In addition to covering the evaluation and management of this condition, it is particularly important to understand the need for pulmonary valve replacement in these patients prior to the occurrence of deleterious complications of this disease. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of pulmonary regurgitation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the common etiologies that lead to the development of pulmonary regurgitation.

- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with symptoms of pulmonary regurgitation.
- Identify the indications for surgical pulmonary valve replacement in patients with pulmonary regurgitation.

- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate identification and selection of candidates for pulmonary valve replacement and to enhance postoperative recovery and resolution of symptoms.
