The differential diagnosis of adult Still disease (ASD) is very broad and includes infections, malignancy, rheumatologic disorders, and adverse drug reactions.

Among infectious etiologies, many acute viral infections including parvovirus B19, hepatitis, and others may cause symptoms similar to AOSD. Bacteremia can also cause fever, elevated white cell count, and acute phase reactants.

Among rheumatologic diseases include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and reactive arthritis also cause elevation of acute phase reactants. Vasculitic disorders, like polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), which present with fever, arthralgia, skin lesions, and pain in the abdomen can also mimic AOSD.

Malignancy, especially lymphomas may mimic AOSD given the features of lymphadenopathy, fever, and leukocytosis.
