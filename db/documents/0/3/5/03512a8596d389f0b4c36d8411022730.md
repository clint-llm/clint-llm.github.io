Cutaneous lupus has a complex pathogenesis that relies on the interplay between genetic and environmental components. For all types of CCLE, including tumid lupus, UV radiation (specifically UVB) serves as a trigger. Immune alterations have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of TLE, specifically the decrease of T-regulatory cells and epidermal Langerhans cells and increased plasmacytoid dendritic cells. There is upregulation of type-1 interferon, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and Th17 cells.
