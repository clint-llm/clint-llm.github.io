The following represent some of the possible comlications

- Although complications are rare, the most common are sneezing, and mucosal tearing and bleeding secondary to injury - to prevent this, adequate nasal decongestion and limited force should be used

- Laryngospasm, a serious risk, although reported in less than 1% of procedures

- Gagging and adverse reaction to the nasal decongestant are other potential risks

- Damage to anatomic structures is more common with the use of rigid scopes, and rarely seen with flexible scopes
