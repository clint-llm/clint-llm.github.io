Ankyloglossia is commonly encountered by the nurse practitioner, primary care provider, pediatrician and the internist. Making the diagnosis for ankyloglossia is not difficult. However, management has many controversies, and it can be very confusing for parents, and they seek different opinions. The best approach for any healthcare worker who encounters this issue is to weigh the benefits for the patient. If the condition is not causing any problems during the neonatal period, observation is the best treatment option. If other causes of difficulty feeding have been ruled out, then a frenotomy can be offered as a treatment option. Only a trained and qualified healthcare provider should do this procedure. Regarding those patients who present with articulation problems, the decision is more difficult, and evaluation and therapy with a speech pathologist can be recommended. Overall, most patients benefit from observation; surgery is more likely to cause more harm than good.
