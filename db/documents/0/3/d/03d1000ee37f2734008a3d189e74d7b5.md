The two gastrointestinal hormone families discussed above are responsible for most of the regulation of gastrointestinal function. The main actions of the gastrin-CCK family and the secretin family of hormones are listed below.

**Gastrin**

- Stimulates H+ (acid) secretion by parietal cells in the stomach

- Trophic (growth) effects on the mucosa of the small intestine, colon, and stomach

- Inhibits the actions of Secretin and GIP

- Inhibited by H+

**CCK**

- Contraction of the gallbladder with simultaneous relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi

- Inhibits gastric emptying

- Stimulates secretion of pancreatic enzymes: lipases, amylase, and proteases

- Secretion of bicarbonate from the pancreas

- Trophic effects on the exocrine pancreas and gallbladder

**Secretin**

- Inhibits gastrin, H+ secretion, and growth of stomach mucosa

- Stimulates biliary secretion of bicarbonate and fluid

- Secretion of bicarbonate from the pancreas

- Trophic effect on the exocrine pancreas

**GIP**

- Stimulation of insulin secretion

- Induces satiety

- In large doses, decreases gastric acid secretion

- In large doses, decreases the motor activity of the stomach and therefore slows gastric emptying when the upper small intestine is already full of food products.

- Stimulates the activity of lipoprotein lipase in adipocytes

- Protects beta-cells of the pancreas from destruction by apoptosis

**GLP-1**

- Decreases gastric emptying

- Induces satiety

- Increases sensitivity of pancreatic beta-cells to glucose.

**Motilin**

- Increases gastrointestinal motility by stimulating the “migrating motility” or “myoelectric complex” that moves through the fasting stomach and small intestines every 90 minutes. This cyclical release and action get inhibited by the ingestion of food. Not much is known about this peptide, except for this essential function.
