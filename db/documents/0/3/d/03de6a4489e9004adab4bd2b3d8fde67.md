Cohenâ€™s classification of congenital glottic webs is as follows and is similar to the older Cotton grading system:

- Type I: very thin glottic web, involving less than 35% of the glottis and vocal cords are easily visible. Patients have no airway issues but present with mild voice alteration.

- Type II: thicker web, involving 35 to 50% of the glottis and vocal cords are visible as well. Patients present with mild airway and voice problems.

- Type III: very thick web, involving 50 to 75% of the glottis with subglottic extension and vocal cords are not visible. Patients present with marked voice problems and airway problems.

- Type IV: thick web involving 75 to 90% of the glottis with impossible vocal cord identification as they appear as a continuous thick band. Very severe airway issues that frequently require an emergency tracheostomy.
