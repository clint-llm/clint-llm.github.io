A low-frequency convex probe is best for a transabdominal pelvic ultrasound. Alternatively, a phased array probe can be used if a convex probe is not available. The settings on the ultrasound machine should be set to "obstetrics" or “pregnancy.” The first view should be a sagittal view through the uterus. The convex probe is placed just superior to the pubic symphysis, with the indicator directed superiorly. The footprint should be directed slightly inferiorly. Structures closest to the probe appear at the top of the screen, and structures further away appear toward the bottom of the screen, so in this view, the top of the screen is anterior, and the bottom of the screen is posterior. The left of the screen represents the direction the indicator is pointing toward, which in this view is superior or cephalad, and the right of the screen is inferior or caudad. The bladder, if full, will take up most of the anterior (top) portion of the screen, ending just superior to the pubic symphysis on the right of the screen. Posterior to the bladder is the vaginal stripe, a hyperechoic line starting at the inferior (right) side of the screen and leading to the cervix and uterus. Fanning to the right and left until the uterus disappears in both directions allows for a complete view of the uterus. If a gestational sac is visualized, interrogation for a yolk sac or fetal heartbeat within the gestational sac, as well as measurement of the thinnest endomyometrial mantle around the gestational sac should take place to confirm the presence of an IUP. If there is a fetal heartbeat, Motion-Mode (M-mode) should be employed to calculate the fetal heartbeat. When selecting M-mode, move the M-mode line to where it crosses through the flicker of the fetal heartbeat before graphing the motion across that line over time. A regular pattern of peaks and troughs should trace out on the screen. Freeze that image and use your calculations menu to select the most appropriate calipers for calculating the fetal heartbeat. By placing your calipers at the start of one peak to the start of the next, the machine should calculate the fetal heart rate based on that distance. Some machines require that the calipers be placed over two beats (start of one peak to the start of the second peak after that peak) to calculate an average fetal heart rate.

Transvaginal ultrasound: The endocavitary probe is a high-frequency transducer with a longer handle compared to other transducers. The footprint is small and tightly curved. The transducer shape in its entirety is analogous to a rifle, where the indicator is the side opposite the “trigger.” Before performing a transvaginal ultrasound, a transabdominal ultrasound should be performed to look for uterine landmarks (vaginal stripe and bladder) as well as an IUP. If NDIUP is appreciated, have the patient empty her bladder and when she returns, place an upside-down bedpan with several chucks underneath her pelvis and, while keeping the patient draped, insert the probe with the indicator pointing anteriorly (toward the ceiling). Watch the decompressed bladder move out of view towards the top left side of the screen. When the bladder is barely out of sight, the probe is at the appropriate depth and by fanning the probe to the left and right, obtain a sagittal view of the uterus. The top of the screen represents the inferior aspect of the patient (cervix), the bottom of the screen represents the superior aspect of the patient, the left of the screen represents the anterior aspect of the patient, and the right of the screen represents the posterior aspect of the patient. The Pouch of Douglas, therefore, is the right lower aspect of the screen. While fanning through the uterus, look for a yolk sac and/or fetal heartbeat to diagnose an IUP.

After interrogating for an IUP as well as for free fluid in the Pouch of Douglas, rotate your probe 90 degrees counterclockwise to visualize the uterus in a transverse (more accurately, coronal) plane, where the top of the screen is still inferior, the bottom of the screen is superior, the left of the screen is the patient’s right, and the right of the screen is the patient’s left. In this plane, the uterus tapers on either side where the fallopian tubes take off. On ultrasound, it is difficult to appreciate the fallopian tubes unless there is a tubal ectopic, or fluid within the tubes (hydrosalpinx or pyosalpinx). However, the areas where the uterus tapers in size on either side are called the cornua. The ovaries typically sit between the cornua and the more lateral iliac vessels and are slightly more hypoechoic than the uterus. After locating the cornua with the indicator pointing toward the patient’s right side, and the footprint steered toward the patient’s right side, fan anteriorly and posteriorly until either an undefined hypoechoic area or a defined ovary with anechoic follicles is appreciated. If an undefined hypoechoic area is seen, apply gentle pressure with the probe until an ovary comes into view. Typical ovarian dimensions are 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm x 3 cm. A simple ovarian cyst is 2.5 cm or greater, whereas a follicle is smaller than 2.5 cm. A corpus luteum cyst, which tends to have a thicker wall than a simple cyst, is frequently appreciated in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.
