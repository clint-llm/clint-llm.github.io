The greater petrosal nerve or superficial petrosal nerve is a branch of the nervus intermedius (nerve of Wrisberg)Â that carries parasympathetic, taste, and sensory fibers of the facial cranial nerve (CN VII).

The preganglionic parasympathetic fibers develop from the superior salivatory nucleus of the tractus solitarius in the pontine tegmentum and progress in the nervus intermedius before joining the facial nerve proper.

In the proximal region of the pterygoid canal, the greater petrosal nerve is joined by the deep petrosal nerve, forming the nerve of the pterygoid canal - also called the Vidian nerve.
