PRP is a very rare skin disorder that may be encountered by the primary care provider and nurse practitioner. Because there is no laboratory test to make a diagnosis, the patient should be referred to the dermatologist for further workup. Once diagnosed, the treatment can be challenging. In many cases, PRP is self-limited and asymptomatic therefore does not necessarily require treatment. There are no treatments approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Most practitioners recommend combination therapy with topical for symptomatic management and systemic therapy aimed at reducing inflammation. Topical agents which have shown promise especially in mild disease include emollients, keratolytic agents, such as urea, salicylic acid, or alpha-hydroxy acid containing preparations, topical corticosteroids, tazarotene, and topical calcineurin inhibitors. Generally accepted first-line systemic agent for both adults and children is oral retinoids. Recently, some case reports and small case series have shown a possible role for biologic immunosuppressive agents typically used in the treatment of psoriases such as TNF-alpha inhibitors and secukinumab and ustekinumab. The prognosis for this skin disorder remains unknown because the disorder is so rare, there has not been adequate long term follow up.
