Blood vessels arise from the mesodermal embryonic layer. Embryonic development of vessels and the heart begins in the middle of the third week of life. Fetal circulation through this vasculature system begins around the eighth week of development.

Blood vessel formation occurs via two main mechanisms: (1) vasculogenesis and (2) angiogenesis.

Vasculogenesis is the process by which blood vessels form in the embryo. Interactions between precursor cells and various growth factors drive the cellular differentiation seen with vasculogenesis

All other vasculature in the human body forms by angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is the process in which new blood vessels derive from the endothelial layer of a pre-existing vessel. Interactions involving VEGF drive angiogenesis. This process is the predominant form of neovascularization in the adult.
