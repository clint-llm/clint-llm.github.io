Before performing OAPS, practitioners should have the following equipment and supplies either open or readily available:

- Monitoring equipment and a stethoscope assist in monitoring a patient's blood pressure, heart rate, EKG, end-tidal CO2, pulse oximetry, and temperature.

- Supplies to establish intravenous access

- A suction device with a Yankauer suction tip

- Airway supplies to include a bag-valve-mask, supraglottic airway, bougie, direct or video-assisted laryngoscope with appropriate blades, oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airway adjuncts, and endotracheal tubes of appropriate sizes

- Supplemental oxygen delivery equipment to include a nasal cannula, simple face mask, and high-flow oxygen mask

- Appropriate rescue medications and reversal agents

All equipment/supplies should be routinely checked for their expiration, and their proper usage should be regularly reviewed by practitioners and personnel involved in OAPS.
