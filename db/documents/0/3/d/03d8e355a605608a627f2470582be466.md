The primary issue of concern associated with the Orphan Drug Approval Law is that despite its aim to improve access to pharmaceutical treatments for rare diseases, those with rare diseases are faced with exorbitant drug costs to treat their conditions and are often unable to meet these costs- thus contradicting the original goal of the passed act.

Per critics, the incentivization process associated with the ODA has led to a disproportionate focus by pharmaceutical companies on orphan drug development. By applying for orphan drug approval, pharmaceutical companies may avoid the costs associated with non-orphan drug applications. Furthermore, market exclusivity of orphan drugs allows pharmaceutical companies to set the market price for a personal medication, giving patients with rare diseases limited treatment options due to the absence of a generic medication.

The paradoxical result of the ODA is particularly demonstrated by the case of a drug developed to treat Gaucher disease, which affects about 2,000 persons per year in the United States. At the time of its release, the drug displayed a prohibitive cost of nearly $400,000 per year per adult patient.

The financial implications associated with orphan drugs are of particular concern to some. In 2010, orphan drugs represented 22% of total pharmaceutical sales and demonstrated an increased return on investment compared to non-orphan drugs.

While the ODA has provided an adequate incentive for drug development, drug affordability, and patient access concerns remain. Many patients may inadvertently pay for their rare disease treatment twice-- once during public drug development funding efforts and once during the actual treatment process.

Additionally, the industry-wide focus on developing effective cancer treatment pharmaceuticals has shifted research attention away from more rare diseases, leaving those living with said conditions with significant unmet needs. Individuals responsible for determining current public policies are charged with assessing the therapeutic areas of approved drugs to assess whether one group is receiving more developmental attention than another.

It is not uncommon for individuals with rare diseases to experience barriers to a successful diagnosis. Misdiagnosis, re-diagnosis, and incorrect treatments often result in undue financial and psychological stresses on the patient. Physicians may not be adequately trained to look for or diagnose rare diseases, leading to delays in care. A survey study assessing European individuals with rare disease diagnoses demonstrated that 41% of patients with an orphan disease experienced one or more incorrect diagnoses before the correct diagnosis was found.
