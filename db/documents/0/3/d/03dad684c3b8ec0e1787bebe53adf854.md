HaNDL syndrome is more common in males between ages 15 to 40 years (68%) compared to females. However, the literature does not consistently report this, and in pediatric cases(may constitute 15% of the total cases), there may be a significant female predominance.

Only 26% of the patients have a positive history of migraines, and typical presentation is of moderate to severe intensity headache with a range of 1 to 12 episodes accompanied by neurological deficits.
