No direct antivenom for the venom of C. barnesi or other Irukandji-causative species currently exists. As such, treatment is largely supportive. Similar to the management of other cnidarian envenomations, treatment should be primarily directed towards:

- Patient stabilization

- Preventing further nematocyst discharge into the victim

- Alleviating local venom effects, including pain and tissue damage

- Controlling the systemic effects of envenomation

- Preventing complications associated with Irukandji syndrome

There is a paucity of evidence regarding the optimal management of Irukandji syndrome, and studies with conflicting results have been published in the scientific literature. Although there are multiple consensus guidelines for the management of cnidarian envenomations in general, the applicability of these management strategies on the various cnidarian species, a group extremely heterogeneous in both physiology and toxin effects, is questionable. The only consensus guidelines specifically directed towards the management of Irukandji syndrome comes from the Queensland Government Irukandji Taskforce, Pereira, et al. 2007.

**Patient Stabilization**

If in the acute field setting, shortly after a suspected sting, victims should be rescued/removed from the water to prevent further stings. Basic life support measures should be performed, if necessary. As most stings from Irukandji-causative species will result in severe symptoms, emergency medical services should always be alerted, and the patient transported to a hospital. Respiratory failure can ensue, prompting the need for oxygen, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, or even endotracheal intubation.

**Preventing Nematocyst Discharge**

The prevention of further nematocyst discharge into victims, either by inactivation, removal, or a combination, is likely beneficial for pain control, minimizing local tissue toxicity, and decreasing systemic toxicity. Various modalities have been proposed in the literature.

Acetic acid: Acetic acid, usually in the form of household vinegar (5% acetic acid), has been traditionally recommended for the use of cnidarian stings, usually in the pre-hospital setting. It is believed that it acts by deactivating undischarged nematocysts in the skin. Several studies have demonstrated that acetic acid can inactivate undischarged nematocysts of several species, including C. fleckeri, Carybdea rastonii, and species implicated in causing Irukandji syndrome including Tamoya spp.C. barnesi and many other jellyfish species.

Although in the United States, vinegar is recommended as a first-aid treatment for all jellyfish envenomations by the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Red Cross, medical toxicologists caring for such patients generally recommend acetic acid application for "jellyfish" stings occurring in the Indo-Pacific region, as acetic acid application to jellyfish stings occurring in the United States could enhance nematocyst discharge, thus worsening the condition. Since Irukandje syndrome typically occurs in the area of the Indo-Pacific, geographical guidelines emphasize the use of acetic acid, as there some evidence to specifically support its use specifically in stings from C. barnesi. However, no randomized control trials currently exist that support its use for cases of Irukandji syndrome.

If vinegar or another acetic acid solution is not available, nematocysts can be washed away with seawater. Care should be used not to expose the nematocysts in the skin to freshwater, as this might lead to a massive discharge of nematocysts.

**Alleviating Local Venom Effects**

Heat: Applications of heat, in the forms of hot water, hot packs, or warm showers has been proposed as a possible treatment to relieve pain associated with jellyfish stings. Although no trials have been conducted for the stings of C. barnesi, at least two trials in the literature have investigated the effect of heat application on the pain caused by the related carybdeid species C. alata.

The other compared the use of hot packs that reached a maximum temperature of 118 degrees F (approximately 43.3 degrees C) to cold packs with minimum temperatures of 42 degrees F (approximately 5.5 degrees C) in swimmers accidentally stung on the beach, which demonstrated greater efficacy in pain control from the use of heat compared to cold pack applications. A more recent systematic review evaluating multiple studies and multiple treatment modalities for jellyfish stings also demonstrated similar increased efficacy of hot water immersion in controlling pain, but in victims stung by Physalia spp.

Lidocaine: Topical lidocaine in concentrations ranging from 1%-15%, has been shown to both decrease pain and inhibit nematocyst discharge in a study involving stings from the Chironex fleckeri, Chiropsalmus quadrumanus, and the Atlantic sea nettle, Chrysaora quinquecirrha. However, this study was limited by a small sample size of two subjects, consisting only of the authors themselves, leaving it susceptible to bias.Pelagia noctiluca.

Opioid analgesia: The severe pain associated with Irukandji syndrome will likely require opioid analgesia to manage, usually intravenously. Fentanyl has been proposed as the recommended opiate for use in Irukandji syndrome due to its decreased likelihood of causing cardiovascular collapse and hypotension.

**Controlling Systemic Effects**

Nitroglycerin: Nitroglycerin, a potent and titratable vasodilator, is the first-line treatment for hypertension associated with Irukandji syndrome as recommended by the Queensland Government Irukandji Taskforce. Its effect on both venous and arterial dilation, decreasing both systemic pre-load and afterload confers benefits in patients with life-threatening pulmonary edema. It already has established use and benefits in decreasing rates of intubation for acute decompensated heart failure from etiologies other than Irukandji syndrome. Known outside the United States as glyceryl trinitrate, it was first proposed as a pre-hospital treatment for hypertension associated with Irukandji by Fenner and Morris in 2003.

Phentolamine: Due to its alpha-adrenergic antagonism effects, phentolamine has been proposed as a possible treatment for hypertension associated with Irukandji syndrome in doses of 5 to 10 mg boluses, or as an infusion.

Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines have long been established as the mainstay of treatment in hyperadrenergic states, such as sympathomimetic toxicity. It is recommended as an adjunctive treatment for pain and hypertension in Irukandji syndrome by the Queensland Irukandji Taskforce. The combination of appropriate analgesia and benzodiazepines will usually resolve hypertension associated with Irukandji syndrome.

Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4): Magnesium has been an established therapy in multiple hyperadrenergic conditions including but not limited to pheochromocytomas and pre-eclampsia. It is also used to treat and prevent cardiac arrhythmias. It is believed that magnesium can decrease the release of catecholamines, as well as decrease systemic vascular resistance in hyperadrenergic states. As such, magnesium has been implicated as a potential treatment for Irukandji syndrome and was first introduced in 2003 as a potential treatment in hypertension associated with Irukandji syndrome (Corkeron 2003). However, the evidence in existence regarding the efficacy of magnesium is conflicting. A systematic review in 2017 regarding the efficacy of magnesium in reducing symptoms associated with Irukandji syndrome included one small randomized control trial and 8 case series.

The one randomized control trial, which included 39 patients throughout 2003-2007, evaluating the efficacy of magnesium infusion in conjunction with fentanyl patient-controlled analgesia, did not show any significant reduction in opioid medication usage compared to fentanyl with the addition of a placebo. As such, the use of magnesium sulfate infusion did not appear to have any clear benefit for pain control. Of the 8 case series, 7 reported some benefit of magnesium for pain relief and/or blood pressure reduction. More recently in 2019, Rathbone et al., including two of the three authors who wrote the previous systematic review, performed a retrospective review examining 112 patient cases of Irukandji syndrome that received care by the Queensland Ambulance Service, did find statistically significantly lower pain scores in patients treated with the combination of magnesium and morphine compared to morphine alone. This study, although a retrospective review, did have a larger sample size compared to the previous randomized control trial and showed results consistent with the multiple case series.

**Treatments Not Recommended**

Urine: Despite popular belief, urine should not be used in the acute treatment of any cnidarian stings and can actually cause nematocyst discharge, which can increase a patient's venom load as well as worsen their clinical condition.

Box jellyfish antivenom: The antivenom for the similar yet more deadly cubozoan C. fleckeri has been proposed as a possible treatment for Irukandji syndrome. However, studies have not demonstrated any efficacy of this antivenom for Irukandji syndrome.

Beta-blockers: Although potent as anti-hypertensive agents, beta-blockers should be avoided in the management of Irukandji syndrome due to the potential for causing significant hypotension, or by theoretically causing unopposed alpha stimulation during the potential catecholamine excess in Irukandji syndrome, which could potentiate coronary vasoconstriction and ischemia.
