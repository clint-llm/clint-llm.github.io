The assessment of a patient who is found unconscious in the water requires rapid intervention.  Remove the person from the water and get them safely on shore or in the boat. The most critical step is mouth-to-mouth ventilation, which should begin as soon as the patient’s airway can open, and the rescuer is safe. Prompt initiation of rescue breathing is associated with an increased likelihood of survival.

The physical exam will also be brief. Once the patient is out of the water, rapidly assess the patient’s level of consciousness as you initiate evaluation with the BLS/ACLS protocol using CAB: circulation, airway, and breathing. The resuscitation efforts should start even as one examines the patient.
