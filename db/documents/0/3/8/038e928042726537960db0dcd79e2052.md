Chilaiditi syndrome is a generally benign condition in which a segment of the intestine is interposed between the liver and diaphragm, which can be confused for more severe conditions and lead to unwarranted procedures. This activity reviews the evaluation, diagnosis criteria, and management of Chilaiditi syndrome and the role of the interprofessional team in managing a patient with Chilaiditi syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Chilaiditi syndrome.
- Identify Chiladiti sign radiographically and distinguish between pneumoperitoneum and pseudo-pneumoperitoneum.
- Explain the treatment approach to a patient with suspected Chilaiditi syndrome.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team in identifying, treating, and managing a patient appropriately with suspected Chilaiditi syndrome.
