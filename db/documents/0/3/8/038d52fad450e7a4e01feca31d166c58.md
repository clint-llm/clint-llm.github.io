# Continuing Education Activity

Salivary gland neoplasms encompass a wide array of different histologies and locations, including the parotid, submandibular gland, sublingual gland, and minor salivary glands of the upper aerodigestive tract. The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2017 recognized 11 different benign epithelial salivary gland tumors. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of benign salivary gland tumors and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of benign salivary gland tumors.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with a benign salivary gland tumor.
- Review the management of patients with benign salivary gland tumors.

# Introduction

Salivary gland neoplasms encompass a wide array of different histologies and locations, including the parotid, submandibular gland, sublingual gland, and minor salivary glands of the upper aerodigestive tract. The majority (80%) of these neoplasms are benign but are heterogeneous in their ability to recur and/or transform into malignant lesions.

The most common benign subtypes identified include pleomorphic adenoma (PA), Warthin’s tumor (WT), and myoepithelioma (MYO), followed by rarer histologies including lymphadenoma (LA), sebaceous adenoma (SA), oncocytoma (OC), cystadenoma, sialadenoma papilliferum (SP), ductal papilloma (intraductal and inverted), canalicular adenoma (CA), and basal cell adenoma (BCA).

# Etiology

The etiology of benign salivary tumors is unknown but has been linked to radiation, smoking, trauma, viruses, and genetics. Studies have shown a correlation between salivary gland tumors and prior radiation exposure with 50% of radiation-induced tumors being pleomorphic adenoma.

Ductal papilloma (intraductal type) is suspected to occur secondary to oral trauma and is usually found at the lower lip, floor of mouth, palate, and tongue.PLGA1) and high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2), respectively. PLGA1 and HMGA2 are highly specific for pleomorphic adenomas and carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenomas.

# Epidemiology

Salivary gland neoplasms most commonly affect women with an overall male to female ratio of 1 to 1.5 and a male to female ratio of 1:1.6 for benign tumors.

The parotid gland is the most common location for salivary gland tumors, comprising 60-75% of all cases.

The submandibular gland encompasses 10 to 15% of all salivary gland tumors with an even distribution of benign and malignant neoplasms. The most common benign submandibular tumor is a pleomorphic adenoma, which consists of 36% of all submandibular tumors.

Sublingual gland tumors are extremely rare.

Minor salivary glands comprise 9.5% to 14.7% of all salivary gland tumors, with the most commonly affected site being the palate.

In a series of 216 benign salivary tumors, 138 (64%) were pleomorphic adenomas (PA), followed by Warthin's tumor (23%), recurrent pleomorphic adenoma (5.1%), oncocytoma (2.8%), myoepithelioma (1.9%), cystadenoma (1.4%) and basal cell adenoma (0.9%).

- **Pleomorphic adenoma**, also known as a benign mixed tumor, is the most common salivary gland tumor and comprises 60 to 70% of all benign salivary gland neoplasms.

- **Papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum,**also known as a Warthin tumor, is the second most common benign salivary tumor and comprises 15% to 36% of all benign salivary gland tumors with 94.7% of cases located in the parotid.

- **Myoepithelioma**occurs in the parotid in 40% to 90% of cases. The palate is the most common site when minor salivary glands are involved.

- **Lymphadenoma**is most commonly found in the parotid in over 80% of cases. It has no gender predilection and usually affects patients after the 3rd decade of life.

- **Sebaceous adenoma**accounts for 0.1% of all salivary neoplasms. Approximately 60% of cases occur in the major salivary glands, mainly in the parotid gland. When found in the minor salivary glands, the most common site is the buccal mucosa.

- **Oncocytoma**accounts for 2% of all salivary gland neoplasms and is mainly found in the parotid gland. It has a predilection for those in the 5th to 6th decade.

- **Cystadenoma**comprises 4% of all benign salivary gland tumors.

- **Sialadenoma papilliferum**consists of 0.4% to 1.2% of all salivary gland tumors, with 80% occurring on the hard palate.

- **Ductal papilloma (Intraductal type)**occurs mainly in the minor salivary glands with rare appearances in the parotid.

- **Ductal papilloma (Inverted type)**is more common than the intraductal type. It is almost always reported in the minor salivary glands, with exceedingly rare cases found in the major salivary glands.

- **Canalicular adenoma**is virtually mostly seen in the minor salivary glands. Approximately 60 to 80% are seen in the upper lip, followed by the buccal mucosa and hard palate.

- **Basal cell adenoma**accounts for about 1.8% to 5% of all salivary gland tumors. Around 75% to 80% are seen in the parotid glands, followed by 5% in the submandibular glands. The upper lip is the most common site for minor salivary gland involvement. It has a predilection for females, patients in the 7th decade of life, and in western countries.

# Pathophysiology

Salivary gland tumors are heterogeneous in their morphology and are postulated to develop from the same stem-cell differentiation pathways as normal salivary gland tissues. Four main theories have been proposed. These include the basal reserve cell theory, pluripotent unicellular reserve cell theory, semi-pluripotent bicellular reserve cell theory, and the multicellular theory.

- **Basal reserve cell theory**– The basal cells of both excretory and intercalated ducts develop into functional salivary units and are capable of tumor development.

- **Pluripotent unicellular reserve cell theory**– The basal cells of excretory ducts are responsible for developing the functional salivary unit and tumor differentiation.

- **Semi-pluripotent bicellular reserve cell theory**–The basal cells of the excretory duct form the progenitor cells of the intercalated ducts, which then form the striated ducts and acinar units. The basal cells of the excretory duct and the progenitor cells of the intercalated ducts are capable of cellular division and tumor development. In contrast, the acinar unit and striated ducts are terminally differentiated and cannot undergo either.

- **Multicellular theory**– all cellular types in normal salivary glands, including those of acinar units and striated ducts, can cellular division and development into salivary tumors. Each tumor develops from a specific cell of origin.

# Histopathology

**Pleomorphic adenoma**consists of varying amounts of epithelial and mesenchymal components. The epithelial elements give rise to ducts, whereas the mesenchymal elements give rise to cartilaginous, osseous, hyaline, and myxoid tissues. The mesenchymal component develops from a metaplastic process of the myoepithelial cells.

**Warthin tumor**presents with a classic bi-layered eosinophilic, oncocytic epithelium with papillary projections and interspersed goblet cells. The epithelium is surrounded by a stroma of varying amounts of lymphoid tissue and germinal centers.

**Myoepitheliomas**are well-circumscribed, encapsulated masses of myoepithelial cells with spindle, epithelial, plasmacytoid, and clear cytoplasmic features.

**Lymphadenoma**is a well-circumscribed, encapsulated tumor of epithelial and lymphoid components. The non-sebaceous lymphadenoma variant contains epithelial (squamous or basaloid) cells surrounded by an intense lymphoid stroma. The sebaceous variant is more common (60%) and has epithelial cells with sebaceous differentiation. Lymphadenoma can be misdiagnosed as metastatic adenocarcinoma or lymphoepithelial carcinoma.

**Sebaceous adenoma**is a well-circumscribed, encapsulated mass with solid nests of sebaceous cells in a fibrous stroma. Occasional oncocytic metaplasia and foreign body giant cells can be present.

**Oncocytoma**is a well-circumscribed tumor with large epithelial, oncocytic cells with granulated eosinophilic cytoplasm surrounded by fibrovascular stroma nests, sheets, trabeculae, or ductal structures.

**Cystadenoma**is a well-circumscribed, non-encapsulated, multi-cystic mass. It contains a proliferative, papillary, and oncocytic epithelium and with papillary projections into the lumen. The lumen is filled with inflammatory, squamous, and foamy cells. There is no cellular atypia, mitotic figures, or invasive growth.

**Sialadenoma papilliferum**is a non-encapsulated, biphasic tumor consisting of an exophytic, hyperplastic squamous epithelium overlying deeper ductal elements (often creating cleft-like cystic spaces where both cell types are fused) in a papillary growth pattern. These tumors most commonly (>80%) occur in the oral cavity.

**Ductal papilloma (intraductal type)**consists of a papillary network of vascular fronds lined with the same columnar-cuboidal cells found on dilated salivary ducts. The papilla is often filling part of the cystic cavity. Cellular atypia and mitosis are usually absent.

**Ductal papilloma (inverted type)**presents with epithelial cells that form a broad papillary projection. Columnar cells, mucous cells, and microcysts can be present. There are few mitotic figures, and it is similar in histology to sinonasal inverted papilloma.

**Canalicular adenoma**consists of a bi-layered strand formed by columnar and cuboidal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. A vascular stroma separates the strands. squamous balls (morules), microliths, and tyrosine crystals may be present.

**Basal cell adenoma**is an encapsulated mass comprised of uniform basaloid epithelial cells and inner ductal epithelial cells with 4 distinct growth patterns: solid, trabecular, tubular, and membranous.

# History and Physical

Patients with salivary gland tumors often present with a long-standing history of a painless, palpable mass. A detailed history, including pain symptoms, the onset of the mass, growth rate, swallowing difficulties, and facial weakness symptoms, should be obtained. Past medical history, surgical history, family history of malignancies, and social risk factors (such as smoking, past radiation exposure, and occupational hazards) should be elicited.

Physical exam should include a focused head and neck exam. Both benign and malignant tumors can present as painless, fixed masses. Parotid masses most commonly occur at the superficial lobe. Deep parotid lobe tumors are often asymptomatic but can present with oropharyngeal airway narrowing, sleep apnea, or dyspnea on exertion.

- Pleomorphic adenoma presents as a painless, slow-growing, and well-circumscribed mass. As the tumor grows, the overlying skin may become attenuated and bosselated.

- Warthin’s tumor presents as a painless, cystic, compressible encapsulated mass, usually at the tail of the parotid. A bilateral exam is warranted as it can present with bilateral lesions.

- Myoepithelial tumors present as well-circumscribed encapsulated tumors commonly located in the parotid.

- Sialadenoma papilleferum can present as a painless exophytic papillomatous mass, most often seen on the hard palate (80%).

- Ductal papilloma (intraductal type) can present as a unicystic, well-circumscribed, and encapsulated lesion. It can present in the parotid gland or on the lower lip, floor of mouth, palate, and tongue.

- Ductal papilloma (inverted type) can present as a well-circumscribed, unencapsulated endophytic papillomatous mass at the junction of the salivary gland and the surrounding oral mucosa.

# Evaluation

The evaluation may include:

**Ultrasound:**Ultrasound is the initial non-invasive modality for localizing superficial tumors; distinguishing solid masses from cystic collections, and helping guide fine-needle aspiration biopsy.

**Computerized tomography (CT):**Conventional CT and MRI have similar sensitivity and specificity in determining tumor location, tumor margin, and tumor infiltration.

**Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):**For lesions in the deep parotid lobe, sublingual glands, and minor salivary glands, MRI provides an accurate extent of the tumor, the location of the tumor, and its relationship to the facial nerve, for preoperative planning purposes.

**Positron emission tomography (PET).**Compared with conventional CT, PET may be more accurate in demonstrating tumor extension, nodal involvement, local recurrence, and distant metastasis due to the tissues’ higher levels of standardized uptake values (SUV).

**Biopsy.**Imaging is unable to completely distinguish between benign and malignant lesions. Obtaining histological samples is key to determining treatment options. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a safe diagnostic tool with a high level of accuracy including sensitivity and specificity of 73% and 91%, respectively, in distinguishing benign from malignant tumors.

# Treatment / Management

The mainstay of treatment for benign salivary lesions is complete surgical excision with negative margins. Radiation and medical therapy play little role in the treatment of benign salivary tumors. However, radiation has been utilized in cases of recurrent disease, extensive facial nerve involvement, and non-surgical candidates to improve local control. Repeated surgical interventions increase the risk of tumor spillage and facial nerve damage.

# Differential Diagnosis

- Malignant salivary gland tumors (mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenoid cystic adenoma, acinic cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, salivary duct carcinoma, carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, squamous cell carcinoma)

- Intra-parotid lymphadenopathy

- Neuroma of the facial nerve

- Lymphoma

- Paraganglioma

- Developmental cyst

- Plunging ranula

- Granulomatous disease (sarcoidosis, tuberculosis)

- Sialadenitis

- Sialoliths

- Mucocele

- Hemangioma

# Surgical Oncology

Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for benign salivary tumors. Enucleation is not advised due to the higher rates of local recurrence.

Lesions of the superficial lobe of the parotid gland can be excised with a superficial parotidectomy. Total parotidectomy with facial nerve preservation is performed for large superficial tumors, deep parotid tumors, or cases of metastasizing pleomorphic adenoma.

The disadvantages of superficial parotidectomy include excessive resection of parotid tissue leading to loss of parotid function, disruption of Stenson’s duct, facial contour defects, and facial nerve paralysis. Gland-preserving surgery has been recommended for benign tumors with a reduction in surgical complications and improvement in patient quality of life.

Extracapsular dissection (ECD) is the most conservative approach and involves removing the tumor with only the immediate pseudocapsule without identifying nor dissecting the facial nerve branches. George et al showed that complications such as facial nerve damage, sialocele, and Frey syndrome were rare during ECD. In studies comparing ECD with superficial parotidectomy for benign tumors, superficial parotidectomy showed a higher rate of facial nerve complications.

Extirpation of the entire submandibular gland is the treatment of choice for benign submandibular tumors.

For benign minor salivary gland tumors of the palate, a wide local excision within the palatal mucosa is recommended with 5 to 10 mm margins and preservation of the pseudocapsule. The exposed palatine bone is left to heal by secondary intention or resected and reconstructed with soft tissue flap.

# Radiation Oncology

Surgical resection with negative margins achieves local control in over 95% of benign salivary gland tumor cases.

Recurrent PA can be seen in 0% to 23% of cases, and a second surgery is recommended for local control.

# Prognosis

The prognosis of benign salivary gland tumors varies widely based on the myriad of tumor histologies with different rates of recurrence and malignant transformation.

- **Pleomorphic Adenoma**recurrence has been reported in 1% to 5% of cases at 7-10 years after initial treatment, likely secondary to incomplete excision, capsule rupture, pseudopodia presence, and satellite lesions.

- **Warthin’s tumor**recurs at a rate of 7% to 12% due to incomplete excisions, tumor spillage, multicentric tumors, or de novo growth.

- **Myoepithelioma**recurrence is rare and is usually attributed to incomplete excision of the primary tumor.

- **Lymphadenoma**rarely recurs. The sebaceous variant has been reported to transform into sebaceous carcinoma in 4 cases in the literature.

- **Sebaceous adenoma**after adequate surgical resection has not been reported to recur. Sebaceous carcinoma has been documented to arise de novo and not from pre-existing sebaceous adenoma lesions.

- **Oncocytoma**can present as a multifocal lesion and recur if not completely resected. There is no evidence that oncocytic carcinoma arises from existing oncocytoma.

- **Cystadenoma**does not recur after complete surgical resection, but there are rare reports of cystadenocarcinoma developing from preexisting cystadenoma.

- **Sialadenoma papilliferum**recurrence is extremely rare, with only 2 reported cases of suspected malignant transformation.

- **Ductal papilloma**(intraductal and inverted type) have no tendency to recur or undergo malignant transformation.

- **Canalicular adenoma**has a recurrence rate of 3%, likely due to its multifocal presentation and incomplete excision.

- **Membranous BCA**has a recurrence rate of 25%.

# Complications

Surgical excision is the standard of treatment for all salivary gland tumors. This may lead to a loss of functional tissue and saliva secretion, causing xerostomia, dental caries, halitosis, periodontal disease, and oral infections.

Treatments for Frey syndrome have included antiperspirant ointment, botulinum toxin A injections, and barrier flaps such as superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) flap, temporoparietal flap, sternocleidomastoid flap, anterolateral thigh flap, or thick skin flap.

Patients who undergo submandibular gland resection have a risk of neurological damage to the hypoglossal nerve, lingual nerve, and marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve.

Complications from radiation include sensorineural hearing loss, chronic otitis media/externa, otalgia, skin erythema, mucositis, dysphagia, dysgeusia, xerostomia, soft tissue fibrosis, osteoradionecrosis, and radiation-induced malignancy.

# Consultations

Diagnosis and management of salivary malignancies would need to consist of an interprofessional team, including an otolaryngologist, plastic surgeon, general surgeon, radiation oncologist, speech-language pathologist, and primary care physician.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patient education on salivary tumors can be challenging due to the heterogeneous array of histologies and the need for multidisciplinary and multimodal management. Patients and their families should be educated on the different treatment options and timeline, including surgical resection, radiation therapy if indicated, and long-term follow-up for recurrence. Patients and parents should be counseled on the possible risks and complications of all treatment modalities and their comorbidities fully assessed by their primary care physicians to determine if they will be candidates for surgical resection. Long-term follow-up is crucial for benign salivary tumors and must be emphasized to patients, given the risk of recurrence and malignant transformation of certain histologies.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Patients with benign salivary gland tumors should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of otolaryngologists, plastic surgeons, general surgeons, pathologists, radiation oncologists, speech-language pathologists, and primary care physicians. Salivary tumors present with varying histologies and severities requiring therapy involving surgery and occasional radiation for recurrent or invasive diseases. Close communication and collaboration between the surgeons and radiation oncologists can provide a tailored approach for each patient. Difficulties with swallowing can occur from acute radiation toxicity.

Patients may need a consultation with general surgery for gastric tube placement to ensure optimal nutrition through treatment, especially if radiation therapy is planned. Early post-treatment intervention by speech-language pathologists can help patients regain pre-treatment function to prevent malnutrition and dependence on enteric feeding. Facial nerve paralysis may occur after parotid surgery, and consultation with an otolaryngologist or plastic surgeon for facial nerve rehabilitation is recommended.

Recurrence of salivary tumors can occur after incomplete excision, and malignant transformation can occur several years after initial treatment. Thus, routine close follow-up by the otolaryngologist, radiation oncologists, and primary care physician is advocated. Finally, patients may develop depression, social anxiety, and avoidance due to visible surgical scarring and facial nerve paralysis. Formal peer support groups can aid patients in addressing their concerns.
