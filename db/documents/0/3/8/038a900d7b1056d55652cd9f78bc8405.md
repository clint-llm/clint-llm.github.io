Carbamazepine modulatesÂ voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC), causing inhibition of action potentials and decreased synaptic transmission. Similar to other anti-convulsions, carbamazepine is suggested to bind to the alpha subunit of VGSC, specifically at a binding pocket formed by the external pore loop and the pore-lining part of domain IV.
