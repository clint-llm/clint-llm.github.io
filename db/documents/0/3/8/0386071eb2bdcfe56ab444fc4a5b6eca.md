The most common complication of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is barotrauma. BarotraumaÂ is caused by the expansion of gases in a confined space. The most common barotrauma is rupture or irritation of the tympanic membrane. Other more serious injuries include pneumothorax, rupture of small vessels, and damage of the inner, middle, and external ear canals. More serious hazards include oxygen seizures, convulsions, and pulmonary edema, and hemorrhage. Catastrophic complications are chamber fires and explosions.
