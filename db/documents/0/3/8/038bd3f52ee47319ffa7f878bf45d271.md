A complication related to elevated BUN levels is mostly associated with excess nitrogenous waste production from renal failure. The toxic effects of such waste can cause uremia. Uremic complications include platelet dysfunction and bleeding, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, vomiting, hypothermia, and itching. Uremia is an indication for emergent hemodialysis. Allopurinol and rasburicase are medications that control uric acid levels and are renal-protective.
