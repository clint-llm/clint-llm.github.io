The basic principle of treating niacin deficiency is the correction of underlying causes of niacin deficiency, but replacement of niacin is a must. For susceptible persons, preventive measures reduce the risk of developing the disease. One of these steps is supplementation.

A niacin deficiency may indicate multiple nutritional deficiencies; therefore, a balanced diet is a strong recommendation. Nicotinamide doses of 250 to 500 mg/day orally should be given. Despite nicotinic acid being the more common form of niacin, nicotinamide is used for niacin deficiencies as it does not cause symptoms such as tingling sensation, itching, or flushing.

For patients who receive isoniazid for TB prophylaxis, B complex multivitamin or nicotinamide supplementation should be considered to prevent niacin deficiency.

Treating patients with excess alcohol use who have multiple vitamin B deficiencies with a B complex with insufficient amounts of niacin or with pyridoxine and thiamine therapy without niacin could aggravate the neurological clinical state or trigger the appearance of alcoholic pellagra encephalopathy.
