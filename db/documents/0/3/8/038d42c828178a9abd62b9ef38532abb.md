Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is usually secondary to hepatocellular disease or cholestasis (intrahepatic and extra-hepatic ). Early workup and diagnosis is necessary for the appropriate management and to prevent future complications. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
- Outline the pathophysiology of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
- Summarize the treatment considerations for patients with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
- Describe the reasons for a delayed diagnosis of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
