Lateral epicondylitis, also commonly referred to as tennis elbow, describes an overuse injury secondary to an eccentric overload of the common extensor tendon at the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) tendon. Tennis elbow primarily results from the repetitive strain caused by activities that involve loaded and repeated gripping and/or wrist extension. It is common in individuals who play tennis, squash, badminton, or any activity involving repetitive wrist extension, radial deviation, and/or forearm supination.
