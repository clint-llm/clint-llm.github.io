There is no cure for atrial flutter and the disorder is known to be associated with a high risk of a stroke and other embolic phenomena; this the management of atrial flutter is best done by an interprofessional team including physicians, specialists, pharmacist, and a cardiac specialty nurse is recommended. While the cardiologist may initiate the initial treatment, the majority of patients are followed by the primary provider or nurse practitioner. These patients need life-long follow up because there is a risk of an embolic stroke. If the disorder receives inadequate therapy, it leads to a poor quality of life.

The primary care providers, pharmacists, and nurse practitioners should enforce medication compliance. Those patients on warfarin should have a dietary consult because a sudden change in the consumption of green leafy vegetables can affect the INR. The hematology nurse and pharmacist should monitor the INR but the dose adjustment of warfarin should be done by the clinician.

At each clinic visit, an ECG should be performed and the patient examined for any embolic phenomenon. To improve outcomes, open communication between members of the interprofessional team is essential.

**Outcomes**

Despite advances in treatment, recurrence and multiple admission to the hospital are very common.
