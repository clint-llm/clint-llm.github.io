Blockade of the median nerve provides anesthesia to the palmar aspect of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, the radial aspect of the ring finger, or radial half of the palm including skin and underlying metacarpals and phalanges. This block may be used as the sole anesthetic, or as an adjunct forÂ reduction or surgical repair of fractures and dislocations, repair of complex lacerations, or performing incision and drainage of cysts and abscesses. The use of peripheral nerve blocks for postoperative analgesia has demonstrated shorter recovery times and decreased opioid use. A median nerve block is also an excellent opioid-sparing analgesic option for burns involving tissue in the median nerve distribution. A terminal median nerve block is a valuable rescue technique for incomplete brachial plexus blocks. Although compartment syndrome is frequently a concern with high energy injuries, there are reports of using forearm median, ulnar, and radial nerve blocks in blast injuries and other high energy injuries without serious sequelae.
