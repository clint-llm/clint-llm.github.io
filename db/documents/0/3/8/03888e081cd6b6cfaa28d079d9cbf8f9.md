Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion (CNG) channels are ion channels that become directly activated via the binding of cyclic nucleotides. CNG channels are nonselective cation channels that mainly promote a current of sodium and calcium ions, and have been best characterized in retinal photoreceptors. However, researchers have also identified them in olfactory sensory neurons and the pineal gland. Rod and cone CNG channels are selective for cGMP, while cAMP can also activate others.
