The Achilles tendon can be palpated just superior to the posterior aspect of the calcaneus. The strongest and largest tendon in the human body attaches the triceps surae (soleus and gastrocnemius) muscle to the calcaneal tuberosity.

**Innervation and Reflex Arc**

The Achilles tendon is innervated primarily by the S1 and S2 nerve roots of the tibial nerve.

The afferent neurons then synapse on and activate an alpha motor neuron in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The activated alpha motor neuron then transmits an efferent stimulus back to the neuromuscular junction of the agonist (triceps surae) muscle leading to a muscular contraction (reflex).

Although spinal reflex arcs bypass the brain to provide a quick response, the descending corticospinal tracts dampen and refine the amplitude of the reflex arc.

The deep tendon reflex arc is divided into the upper motor neuron (UMN) component and the lower motor neuron (LMN) component. The UMN component consists of the descending structures that transmit the dampening stimulus to the LMN at the ventral horn, such as the corticospinal tracts, brainstem, internal capsule, and cerebral cortex.
