The euthyroid sick syndrome, also known as nonthyroidal illness syndrome, refers to changes seen in the patient thyroid function tests administered in the medical intensive care unit during episodes of critical illness. It is not a true syndrome, but it represents significant alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis in about 75% of hospitalized patients. This condition is often seen in patients with severe critical illness, deprivation of calories, and following major surgeries. The most common hormone pattern in euthyroid sick syndrome is a low total T3 and free T3 levels with low or normal T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels.
