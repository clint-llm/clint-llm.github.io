The mechanisms by which transcription regulation is determined can be positive or negative. If the regulatory protein is an activator, we can say that it is a positive regulation; if the protein is a repressor, the regulation will be negative. We can distinguish inducible operons with negative and positive regulation; repressible operons with positive and negative regulation.
