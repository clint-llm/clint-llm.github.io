CKTR requires differentiation from other causes of late kidney allograft dysfunction:

**Calcineurin Inhibitor (CNI) Toxicity**

CNIs are among the most widely used immunosuppressive medications in kidney transplantation. The introduction of cyclosporine and tacrolimus in the early 1980s and late 1990s, respectively, lead to improved clinical outcomes.

**BK-Virus Associated Nephropathy (BKVAN)**

BKVAN is also a significant cause of late allograft dysfunction and requires differentiation from CKTR. BKVAN occurs when the BK virus, a polyomavirus, propagates in the face of immunosuppression. Most transplant centers screen for BK virus in the bloodstream during the first year post-transplant, and particularly high-level viremia tends to correlate with BKVAN. Histologically, BKVAN can present with tubulointerstitial scarring similar to CKTR. Suspicious biopsy findings need confirmation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of viral DNA in the blood, characteristic intranuclear viral particles on electron microscopy, and/or BK virus detection using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization (e.g., staining for the SV40 large T antigen).

**Recurrent or De-Novo Glomerular Disease**

Recurrent glomerulonephritis (GN) causes approximately 8.4% of late renal allograft loss.
