Pilar cysts are intradermal cysts that arise from the epithelium located between the sebaceous gland and the arrector pili muscle. They are lined by stratified squamous epithelium without a granular cell layer similar to what is seen in the outer root sheath of the hair follicle and filled with keratin and its breakdown products.
