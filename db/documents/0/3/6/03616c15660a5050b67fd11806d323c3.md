Physicians should assess for psychiatric or cognitive impairment associated with THC use and be aware of interactions with drugs of similar effects. Hemodynamic changes also require monitoring after administration. Patients should be informed not to operate motor vehicles or heavy machinery until reasonably certain they are not impaired by THC. The risk of dependence and misuse must also be assessed, especially in patients with a history of substance abuse or dependence. As seizures or seizure-like activity has occurred in patients using THC, care is necessary when prescribing to patients with risk factors or a history of seizures, including those taking anti-epileptic medication.
