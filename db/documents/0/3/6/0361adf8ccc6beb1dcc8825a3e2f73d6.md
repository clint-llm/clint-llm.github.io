The prognosis varies by tumor stage and histology. Favorable histology has survival rates of 99% to 86%, while unfavorable histology survival ranges from 84% to 38%, depending on the stage.

End-stage renal failure occurs in about 1% of patients, usually due to metachronous bilateral tumors.

Females with Wilms tumor-aniridia (WAGR) syndrome may develop streaked ovaries and are at an increased risk for developing gonadoblastoma.

A poorer prognosis is associated with the following characteristics:

- Anaplastic histology in stage II to IV tumors

- Diffuse anaplasia is worse than focal

- Loss of heterozygosity at chromosomes 1p, 1q, 11p15, and 16q or presence of TP53

- Higher stage (most epithelial predominant tumors are stage I; most blastema predominant tumors are stage III and IV)

- Age older than two years

- Higher positive lymph node density

- Large tumor size

- Even small tumor foci can be associated with a poorer prognosis due to resistance to chemotherapy.
