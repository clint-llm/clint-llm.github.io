**Composition**

Alginate is an irreversible hydrocolloid material that can reproduce soft and hard tissue details when in the presence of water. Alginates are salts produced from the combination of alginic acid with either sodium, calcium, potassium, or magnesium.

**Setting Mechanism**

The setting mechanism of alginate is a chemical reaction between the salt sodium alginate and the reactor calcium sulfate.

The retarder can slow the setting reaction, giving rise to dental alginates with different working times. Type I is a fast set that hardens within 1 to 2 minutes, and type II is a standard set that hardens within 2 to 5 minutes.

**Properties**

Alginates are mucostatic impression materials. When freshly spatulated, alginates have low viscosity and record the soft tissues without compressing them. Alginates are easy to manipulate, affordable, and have rapid setting times.

However, several downsides of dental alginates have been described. Alginates provide a less accurate reproduction than elastomers; they have low tear strength and are likely to tear when removed from deep undercuts, such as interproximal and subgingival areas; they can only be poured once, producing only one plaster model; and they have poor dimensional stability when pouring is delayed.

An ideal impression material would have sufficient dimensional stability over time to allow for pouring whenever convenient.
