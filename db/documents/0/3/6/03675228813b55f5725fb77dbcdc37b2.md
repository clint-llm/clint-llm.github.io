Lichen nitidus is a rare benign condition characterized by extensive 1- to 2-mm skin-colored papules commonly occurring on upper extremities, chest, abdomen, or genitalia. It typically occurs in children and young adults as a self-limited process with no long-term sequelae. Most patients remain asymptomatic and may only seek treatment if pruritus or a generalized distribution is present.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of lichen nitidus. 
- Describe the presentation of lichen nitidus. 
- Summarize the treatment options for lichen nitidus.
- Outline potential patient cosmetic concerns with lichen nitidus and the treatment options to address them that the clinician can explain to the patients.
