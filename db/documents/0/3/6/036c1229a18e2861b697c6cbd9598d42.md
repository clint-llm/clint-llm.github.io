The shape of the distal humerus is roughly triangular in the coronal plane, with the base composed of the lateral epicondyle, capitellum, trochlea, and medial epicondyle. In the axial plane, it is dumbbell shaped owing to the thin plate of the bone in the middle, at the site of the olecranon fossa and coronoid fossa. Most fracturesÂ occur when the child falls on an outstretched arm causing hyperextension of the elbow. The olecranon process engages the olecranon fossa producing an extensive force on the distal humerus.

The mechanism of injury and the resultant displacement of the fracture also guides the reduction maneuver performed. In posteromedial displacement of the distal fragment, the medial periosteum is intact. Due to this, the reduction is performed in pronation which tensions the medial periosteum and prevents varus malalignment. On the other hand, posterolateral displacement tends to rupture the medial periosteum, and the reduction is therefore performed in supination.
