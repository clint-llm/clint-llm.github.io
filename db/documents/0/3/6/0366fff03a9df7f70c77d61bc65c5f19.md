Onychoscopy provides good detail but should be used in conjunction with other clinicopathologic information. Some challenges to its use have included: equipment cost, training, and lack of information. The International Dermoscopy Society and the Council for Nail Disorders, among other organizations, have committed to disseminating informationÂ on nail disease and evaluation. More information can be found on their respective websites for further training and information.

Diagnoses achieved through onychoscopic examination may require interprofessional action from other health care team members, including other specialists, nurses, and pharmacists, depending on the problem revealed and the treatment needed.
