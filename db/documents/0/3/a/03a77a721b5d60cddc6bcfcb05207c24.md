DPP-4 inhibitors (linagliptin, saxagliptin, and sitagliptin) are oral hypoglycemic agents. Inhibition of DPP-4 results in increased plasma concentration of incretins and glucose-dependent insulin release. Therefore, they are beneficial in the treatment of diabetes. Studies have shown DPP-4 inhibitors are well tolerated, weight neutral, and do not cause hypoglycemia due to their glucose-dependent action.
