High-frequency ventilation (HFV) is not without complications. The following are the challenges faced in HFV.

- Its efficacy is questionable in patients with high airway resistance and can lead to air trapping and barotrauma like pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, and pulmonary interstitial emphysema.

- It can also cause harmful heart-lung interactions and can, lead to high intrathoracic pressures and thus can cause decreased venous return and cardiac output.

- As it is an unorthodox method of ventilation, it leads to decreased clearance of secretions and higher risks of secondary sepsis.

- Other limitations include transport difficulties, noisy machines causing problems in clinical examinations, and delayed identification of complications.
