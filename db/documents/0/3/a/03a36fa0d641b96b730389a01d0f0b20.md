Several RhIG products are currently available in the United States. Although there are multiple brand names, they all have similar clinical indications and dosing but differ significantly in specific attributes. Pharmacists can play an essential role in ensuring the safe administration of these products by guiding clinicians on the use and timing of RhIG therapy. This is one example of the kind of interprofessional activity that must accompany RhIG therapy, with clinicians, mid-level practitioners, specialists, nurses, and pharmacists working and communicating collaboratively to achieve optimal patient outcomes while minimizing adverse effects.

The recommendation is to delay live vaccine administration until at least 12 weeks after the last dose of RhIG. However, according to CDC guidelines, postpartum vaccination of rubella-susceptible women with rubella or MMR vaccine should not be delayed during the last trimester or delivery. It should be serologically tested 6 to 8 weeks post-vaccination to ensure that seroconversion has occurred.

If RhIG is inadvertently omitted after delivery, it should be given as soon as possible within the first 72 hours. Partial protection can be achieved when administered with 13 days of birth and may provide some benefit as much as 28 days after delivery; the longer the delay, the less protective.
