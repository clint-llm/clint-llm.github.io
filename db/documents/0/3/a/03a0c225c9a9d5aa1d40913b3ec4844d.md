Patients require monitoring for medication side effects during treatment, and it is often necessary to screen patients before treatment to obtain baseline results. Since thioridazine can cause significant ECG (electrocardiogram) changes and arrhythmias, it is important to get a baseline ECG and potassium level. Furthermore, an additional ECG is recommended for any change in dose and periodically after that. Another possible side effect of thioridazine is leucopenia, and thus routine complete blood counts are recommended over the course of the initial weeks.

Opthomalogic exams should be implemented as well, as thioridazine can also cause irreversible retinal pigmentation over time. Studies are equivocal regarding the use of thioridazine in pregnancy, so it may be advisable to get a pregnancy test before administering the drug. Thioridazine must be cautioned for use in the third trimester of pregnancy, as it may be associated with a risk of neonatal withdrawal symptoms and extrapyramidal side effects. Furthermore, thioridazine has a narrow therapeutic index, which means it is necessary to carefully monitor each patient for adverse side effects.

In patients with pre-existing or a history of leukopenia or neutropenia, frequent CBC with differential is recommended during the initial phase of treatment.
