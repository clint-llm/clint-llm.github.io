The development of Pacinian corpuscles (PCs) starts at the gestational age of 13 weeks and is completed at the age of 4 months postnatal. The inner core forms from a compact network of Schwann cells and outer core, and the surrounding mesenchyme forms the capsule. The development of Meissner corpuscles (MCs) starts at 22 weeks and attains complete morphology by 8 months of life. The developing MCs have a complex relationship of their axons with the epidermis and are covered by Schwann cells until late maturity. The present data suggest that there is an asynchronous relationship between the development and immunohistochemical maturation of MCs and PCs.
