Since myoglobinuria is directly related to muscle injury, it is difficult to assess its stand-alone incidence. However, it is mostly seen in the young population due to more incidences of infection as well as trauma. The athletic population is also much more prone to injuries and rhabdomyolysis, hence the increased incidence of myoglobinuria in that population. Similarly, in the young population, there is an increased incidence of infections leading to myositis, ultimately increasing the cases of myoglobinuria in that population. Rhabdomyolysis and crush syndromes are also common results of natural disasters such as earthquakes, so myoglobinuria is also more commonly seen in the affected population of these disasters.
