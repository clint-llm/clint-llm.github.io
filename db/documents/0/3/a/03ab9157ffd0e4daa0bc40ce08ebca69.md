The clinical presentation varies with the anatomic location of the subphrenic abscess. However, fever, upper quadrant pain, costal margin tenderness, shoulder pain, abdominal tenderness, and dyspnea may be present. It may also present as a hiccup, cough, or unexplained pulmonary manifestations like pneumonia, pleural effusion, and basal atelectasis. Pyrexia of unknown origin is not uncommon. The majority of the patients who are not treated immediately will progress to have a systemic inflammatory response syndrome and develop tachycardia, hypotension, and low urine output, eventually leading to multiorgan failure and death.
