The umbilical cord develops from the yolk sac and allantois during the fifth week of development. It remains roughly equal in size to the crown-rump length through pregnancy. At birth, the cord is, on average, 2 centimeters in diameter and 50 centimeters in length and must be clamped and cut. The umbilical cord has two umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein. The umbilical arteries are recognizable by their smaller lumen and thick walls. The umbilical vein is normally present at 12 oâ€™clock and has a thinner wall and a larger lumen than the arteries. A catheter placed in the umbilical vein should travel from the umbilical vein into the ductus venosus and ideally terminate in the inferior vena cava just below the right atrium.
