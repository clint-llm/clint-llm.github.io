The outer membrane of platelets is critical for its function in hemostasis. Several receptors that are expressed on its surface either constitutively or after activation allow for adhesion to endothelial surfaces as well as aggregation with other platelets. Inside the platelet, alpha granules and dense granules are present, which contain specific compounds that are critical for a variety of functions. Alpha granules are more numerous and contain compounds like P-selectin, GPIIb/IIIa, GPIb, von Willebrand factor (vWF), factors V, IX, and XIII, and others. Dense granules contain some of these compounds but are principally responsible for storing calcium, potassium, serotonin, and important nucleotides such as ATP and ADP.
