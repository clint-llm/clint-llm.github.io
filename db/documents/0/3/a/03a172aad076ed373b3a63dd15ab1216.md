Petrone et al. suggests that TDI complications can be subdivided into morbidity as a direct result of the diaphragm repair and secondary to the trauma. Complications associated with the repair include iatrogenic phrenic nerve paralysis and suture dehiscence. Both complications can lead to the need for additional invasive procedures and potentially long-term complications whose details are beyond the scope of this paper. Morbidity associated with traumatic injury varies depending on the presence of associated injuries but could include empyema, subphrenic abscess, and resultant ventilator-dependent respiratory failure. When these patients present in a delayed fashion due to a missed injury, the timeframe to presentation has varied in the literature from a few weeks to years. Complications in this setting such as atelectasis, respiratory failure, pneumonia, bowel obstruction, strangulation, and perforation have all been reported.
