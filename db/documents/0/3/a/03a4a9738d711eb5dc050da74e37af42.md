The palmar interossei receive innervation from the deep palmar branch of the ulnar nerve. As such, injury to the ulnar nerve can manifest as weakness or even atrophy of the interossei muscles and is typically caused by nerve root impingement, brachial plexus compression, or nerve entrapment at the elbow, forearm, or wrist. Ulnar nerve entrapment is the second most prevalent compression neuropathy with which patients present.

Several clinical examinations are used to assess the integrity of ulnar nerve function. In a positive Wartenbergâ€™s sign, patients are instructed to adduct all fingers. A positive test will produce abduction of the fifth finger relative to all other digits, implying weakness of the third palmar interosseous muscle and fourth lumbrical.
