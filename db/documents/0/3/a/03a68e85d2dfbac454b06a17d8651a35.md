KFS patientsÂ with fusion above C3 tend to be more symptomatic.

By definition, Klippel-Feil is a heterogeneous presentation. Prognosis can be related to the Samartzis classification system.

- Type I: Single-level congenital fusion of cervical segment

- Type II: Multiple, noncontiguous congenitally fused segments

- Type III: Multiple, contiguous congenitally fused segments in the cervical region

Samartzis et al. noted that over an eight-year period, approximately two-thirds of patients with Klippel-Feil syndrome had no symptoms. Those with a type-I deformity had more axial symptoms, while those with type II and type III were the patients who developed myelopathy and radiculopathy.
