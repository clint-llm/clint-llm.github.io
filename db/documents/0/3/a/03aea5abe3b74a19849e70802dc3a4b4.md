Early retropharyngeal abscess presents similarly to uncomplicated pharyngitis. Aspects of a patient's history that are concerning for early retropharyngeal abscess would be antecedent upper respiratory tract infection or trauma to the posterior pharynx. As this infection progresses, symptoms related to upper aerodigestive obstruction become more prominent and typically progress over days. The following are red flags in a patient’s history which should be concerning for upper aerodigestive obstruction:

- Dysphagia

- Odynophagia

- Inability to tolerate oral secretions

- Neck stiffness

- Torticollis

- Refusal to extend neck due to pain or discomfort

- Change in voice, “hot potato voice,” muffled voice

- Trismus

- Neck swelling, cervical lymphadenopathy

- Chest pain (mediastinal extension)

- Respiratory distress (stridor, tachypnea, retractions).

Patients who present with retropharyngeal abscesses typically are febrile and ill-appearing. Early in the illness, patients may only have mild to moderate pharyngeal erythema and refusal to tolerate anything by mouth. As the disease progresses, pharyngeal erythema and swelling will become more prominent, and patients will be unable to tolerate even their oral secretions. Patients typically will have extreme discomfort with neck extension and often will prefer to hold their necks in flexion, as opposed to epiglottitis, where patients will preferentially hold their necks in extension.

The oropharynx of a patient with a suspected retropharyngeal abscess only should be thoroughly examined with palpation or probing by clinicians who are experienced in emergent airway management. Abscess rupture can occur during the examination of the posterior pharynx, leading to aspiration and potential asphyxiation. It has been suggested that this exam should be performed with patients in the Trendelenburg position to prevent aspiration in case of abscess rupture, and suction equipment should be readily available.
