In terms of etiology, there are three potential artery disease subtypes: large artery disease of the basilar artery, branch disease of the basilar artery, and small vessel disease. An MRI of the brain is necessary to evaluate for other brainstem structural etiologies such as intracranial hemorrhage, tumor, or inflammatory lesions. The vascular evaluation will help determine the etiologies discussed above. The area of the inferomedial pons receives vascular supply from the paramedian branches from the basilar artery and thus an MRI angiography or CT angiography, depending on availability and access, should be performed.
