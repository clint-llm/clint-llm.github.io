Traumatic glaucoma is a type of secondary glaucoma occurring because of various mechanisms related to the trauma of the eye. All types of ocular trauma have the potential to cause an elevation of the intraocular pressure (IOP) in the affected eye through various mechanisms. Without appropriate treatment, this can lead to irreversible glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve and potentially permanent loss of visual function. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of traumatic glaucoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiologies of traumatic glaucoma.
- Summarize the epidemiology of traumatic glaucoma.
- Outline the treatment options for all causes of traumatic glaucoma.
- Review the typical examination findings in traumatic glaucoma.
