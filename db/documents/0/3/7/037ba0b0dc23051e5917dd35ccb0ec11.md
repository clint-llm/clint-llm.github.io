Various prognostic indicators have been evaluated with regard to mortality and morbidity associated with emphysema. The following measures have been correlated with the disease burden and prognosis:

- FEV1

- DLCO (diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide)

- Blood gas measurements

- BMI

- Exercise capacity

- Clinical state

- Radiographic severity

The coexistence of other illnesses also makes the prognosis poorer in COPD patients. For instance, patients with features of both asthma and COPD have a poorer quality of life with higher mortality rates. Similarly, patients with emphysema who have raised serum alpha-1 antitrypsin levels also have higher mortality.

A widely used tool for prognosis prediction is the BODE index which takes into account the following:

- BMI

- FEV (obstruction)

- Dyspnea

- Exercise capacity
