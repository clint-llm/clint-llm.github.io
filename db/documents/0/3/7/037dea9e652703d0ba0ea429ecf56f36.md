**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid the use of melatonin due to insufficient evidence of safety.

**Renal Dosing**

Clinicians should exercise caution for patients undergoing dialysis due to the risk of increased adverse effects due to the inability to adequately clear melatonin.

**Hepatic Dosing**

Clinicians should exercise caution in patients with impaired liver functioning due to decreased ability to metabolize melatonin. Nevertheless, based upon several clinical trials, researchers concluded that melatonin doesn't cause hepatotoxicity. Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).

**Autoimmune Conditions**

Clinicians should exercise caution for patients with some autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or post-organ transplant. Melatonin stimulates the function of the immune system via the production of interleukins IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-12, interferon-gamma, helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, B-cell precursors, and T-cell precursors. However, the clinical significance of this effect is not yet precise.
