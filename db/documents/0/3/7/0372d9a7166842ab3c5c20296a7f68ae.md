Recurrent ankle sprains are multifactorial injuries, with index (first-time) ankle sprain being predictive of recurrent ankle sprains in up to 61% of those injured. The most common mechanism of injury for a lateral ankle sprain includes inversion with adduction, as the body asserts force over the foot. This injury most commonly affects the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL). During an index ankle sprain, the ligaments of the ankle undergo microscopic tears due to the stress applied, resulting in attenuation. Factors associated with recurrent ankle sprains include:

- Diminished postural control

- Impaired proprioception

- Loss of muscle strength

- Ligamentous laxity (i.e., Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and Turner's syndrome)

- Decreased ankle joint range of motion

- Cavus foot-type

An impairment in the baseline, or pre-injury, level of proprioception in an injured individual pre-dispose the ankle to re-injury. Injury prevention relies on factors such as ankle joint stability. It is heavily dependent on the body's ability to self-assess internal kinesthetics regarding the position and movement of the ankle joint. Passive and dynamic restraints, such as the joint capsule and muscles, respectively, are weakened, increasing the risk of recurrence.
