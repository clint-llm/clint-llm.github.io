Normal uterine contractions are generated in a coordinated fashion by two uterine pacemakers located at the cornua portion of the uterine fundus (fundal dominance) and propagated in a synchronous order towards the lower uterine segment. The downward coordinated path of contraction explains the role of contraction in the downward migration of the fetus and cervical changes.

In the normal active phase, the frequency of contraction is usually 3 to 4 within 10minutes with a pressure of 30 to 50 mmHg above the resting tone. The minimum characteristics required to describe a contraction as effective are:

- minimum frequent contractions with intervals less than 5 minutes apart and,

- the intensity of contraction greater than 25 mmHg.

The duration of each contraction also increases from 30 seconds in early labor to between 60-90 seconds in the latter part of labor.

Friedman established the accepted pattern for the normal progression of labor in the 1950s. The WHO adopted the Friedman curve on the partograph, a graphical labor monitoring tool. Based on his data on nulliparous and multiparous women, he described that transition from latent to the active phase of labor occurs at 3 to 4 cm cervical dilatation. He also described that for most women, the minimum rate of cervical dilatation in the active phase is 1.2cm/hour in nulliparous and faster in multiparous women at 1.5 cm cervical dilatation/ hour.

In hypocontractile uterine dysfunction, although the uterine basal tone is within the normal range (less than 10 mmHg), the peak/active pressure does not rise higher than 25 mmHg (normal pressure is about 60mmg or 8kPa). The hypotonic contractions are described with four properties: intensity, duration, relaxation, and interval. Characteristically, there is diminished intensity lower than 10mmHg, the duration is shortened less than 20 to 30 seconds, there is good relaxation between contractions, but the interval between contractions is increased. The frequency of contractions is often less than 2-3 within 10 minutes.
