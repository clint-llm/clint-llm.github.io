In the human body there is very little change in blood pressure as it travels in the aorta and large arteries, but when the flow reaches the arterioles, there is a large drop in pressure, and the arterioles are the main regulators of SVR.

The basis for the mechanism of peripheral vascular resistance is expressed by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:

**R = 8Ln/(pi*r^4)**

- R is the resistance of blood flow [change in pressure between the starting point and end point]

- L is the length of the vessel

- n is the viscosity of blood

- r is the radius of the blood vessel

This equation shows that modifying the radius of the vessel has drastic effects on the resistance to blood flow. As the vessel dilates (radius increases), the resistance is divided by the change to the fourth power; this goes for a decrease in radius as well, such as during an adrenergic state (e.g., exercise) when blood pressure must increase.
