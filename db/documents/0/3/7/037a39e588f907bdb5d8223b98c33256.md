Human brain development starts with the neurulation process from the ectodermic layer of the embryo and takes, on average, 20 to 25 years to mature.

The most prominent white matter structure of the brain, the corpus callosum, increases by approximately 1.8% per year between the ages of 3 and 18 years.

Gray matter in the frontal lobe undergoes continued structural development reaching its maximal volume at 11 to 12 years of age before slowing down during adolescence and early adulthood. The gray matter in the temporal lobe follows a similar development pattern, reaching its maximum size at 16 to 17 years of age with a slight decline afterward.

Below is a list of the brain vesicles and the areas of the brain which develop from them.

- Lateral ventricles

- **Diencephalon**
- Thalamus
- Hypothalamus
- Epithalamus (pineal gland)
- Subthalamus
- Posterior pituitary
