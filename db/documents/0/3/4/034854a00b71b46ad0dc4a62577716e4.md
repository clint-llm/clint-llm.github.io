Consistent with the variation seen in the arterial supply of the posterior neck triangle, the spinal accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI), also expresses variation that will receive further elaboration in the Physiological Variants section.

The most clinically relevant nerve coursing through the posterior neck triangle is the spinal accessory nerve. This is due to its susceptibility to injury from surgical intervention in this area. Other nerves present in the triangle include trunks and branches of the brachial plexus, as well as the phrenic nerve supplied by the third, fourth, and fifth cervical spinal nerves.
