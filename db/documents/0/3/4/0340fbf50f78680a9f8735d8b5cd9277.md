The histopathology seen in atopic dermatitis is non-specific. In the acute phase lesions, characterized by intensely pruritic, erythematous papules, histopathology reveals mild epidermal hyperplasia, infiltrations of lymphocytes and macrophages along the venous plexus in the dermis and intercellular edema of the epidermis (spongiosis). Lesions biopsied in chronic atopic dermatitis, which are characterized by lichenification and fibrotic papules, may reveal increased hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis of the skin. There is also persistent dermal inflammatory cell infiltrate with lymphocytes and macrophages. The chronic phase lacks the edema or spongiosis that is present in acute phase lesions.
