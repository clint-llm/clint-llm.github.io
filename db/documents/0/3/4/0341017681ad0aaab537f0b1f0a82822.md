**Degenerative Processes**

Lumbosacral facet syndrome can occur secondary to repetitive overuse and microtrauma, spinal strains and torsional forces, poor body mechanics, obesity, and intervertebral disk degeneration over the years. This notion is supported by the strong association between the incidence of facet arthropathy and increasing age.

Intervertebral disc degeneration is often related to the amount of heavy work done before the age of 20. However, the association between degenerative changes in the lumbar facet joints and symptomatic low back pain remains unclear and is subject to continued debate.

**Spondylolisthesis**

Degenerative spondylolisthesis occurs due to the displacement of one vertebra to another in the sagittal plane. This is related in most cases of facet joint osteoarthritis and failure of segmental movement. This occurs from subluxation of the facet joints, which causes progressive loss of cartilage and articular remodeling, leading to instability and capsular tension.

**Septic Facet Arthritis**

Septic arthritis is a rare etiology of facet joint syndrome.Kingella kingae.

**Inflammatory Conditions**

Ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis are seronegative spondyloarthropathies that may also involve the lumbar facet joints, as the facet joints are synovial in nature.
