Healthcare workers including nurse practitioners and primary care providers should be familiar with anoscopy. This bedside procedure is inexpensive, can be performed quickly without bowel preparation or the need for sedation. With this method, the examiner can visualize the internal portions of the anal sphincter and the distal rectum. Prospective studies suggest that anoscopy has a higher sensitivity for anorectal lesions such as internal hemorrhoids, proctitis, lacerations, fistulas, ulcers, and masses than a flexible sigmoidoscopy. Up to 50% of rectal bleeding can be falsely attributed to hemorrhoids without internal examination to confirm this diagnosis. However, it is also important to know the limitations of anoscopy and whenever there is a doubt about the diagnosis, the patient should be referred to the gastroenterologist or general surgeon for further workup.
