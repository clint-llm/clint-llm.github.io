The key to Traveler's diarrhea is preventing it. Today, nurses and pharmacists are in the prime position to educate the patient on the importance of hydration and good hygiene. The Traveler should be educated on drinking bottled water and washing all fresh fruit and vegetables before consumption. Plus, travelers shouldÂ be warned not to drink from lakes and streams. The pharmacist should educate the Traveler on managing the symptoms of diarrhea with over-the-counter medications or loperamide. Finally, the Traveler should be educated on the symptoms of dehydration and when to seek medical care.
