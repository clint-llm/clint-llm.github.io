The muscles of the abdominal wall, externally to internally, are the external oblique muscle, internal oblique muscle, transversalis muscle, and the rectus abdominis muscle. These muscles are all found deep to both Camper's fascia and Scarpa's fascia. Both layers of fascia are important in separating the muscular layers from the integument.
