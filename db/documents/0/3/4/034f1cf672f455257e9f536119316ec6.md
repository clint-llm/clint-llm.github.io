Visual outcome after a diagnosis of epithelial downgrowth is generally poor due to recurrence, refractory glaucoma, and corneal decompensation.

In a series of 52 patients from 1980-1996 treated with en bloc excision and corneoscleral grafting, the mean visual acuity at the final follow-up visit was 20/100 in the cystic-type cases and 20/200 in the diffuse-type cases.
