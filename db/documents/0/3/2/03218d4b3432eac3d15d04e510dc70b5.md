Selenium deficiency is often a population-level problem rather than an individual one.Â  It affects a community as a whole. Biofortification has been the approach used to tackle this problem by fertilizing the soil at the agricultural end of things. Alternately enrichment of food sources through fodder with selenium compounds, for instance, eggs (or rather, egg yolks) with more selenium, is also another approach that has been used to raise nutritional selenium content. In many countries, eggs, meat, and milk fortified with selenium have been introduced successfully. Using microorganisms for the production of functional foods such as selenium yeast is yet another approach that is being used. Organic selenium is less likely to reach toxic levels as quickly as supplementing with selenite and selenate (the inorganic salt forms of selenium supplements) can. However, using inorganic salts is a quick way to supplement selenium in the situation of gross and immediate deficiency. The goal to target is supplementation, achieving about 90 mcg/day for adults. Per the World Health Organization, the tolerable upper intake level for selenium in adults 19 years or older is 400 micrograms or 5.1 micromoles per day. Levels above this are considered toxic. Ultimately, a balanced diet is the best way to stave off selenium deficiency.
