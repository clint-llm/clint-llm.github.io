**Acute AR**

The operative risk in sudden severe aortic regurgitation is far higher than for chronic severe aortic regurgitation. Patients with acute AR have coexisting complicating diseases such as infective endocarditis or dissecting aneurysm, making their prognosis poor.

**Chronic AR**

Asymptomatic chronic AR, even though severe, is often associated with a generally favorable prognosis for many years. Quantitative measures of AR severity predict clinical outcome, and LV size and systolic function also are strong predictors of clinical outcome. LV dysfunction is more likely to be reversible if detected early, before EF becomes severely depressed, before LV dilation, and before symptoms develop. Surgical intervention is necessary before irreversible changes occur as surgery reduces cardiac mortality rates in high-risk patients.

Once the patient with AR becomes symptomatic, a rapidly downhill course ensues. Congestive heart failure, acute pulmonary edema, and sudden death may occur. 4-year survival without surgery in patients with NYHA Class III or IV symptoms is only 30%.
