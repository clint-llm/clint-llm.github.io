Polycythemia, or erythrocytosis, refers to an increase in the absolute red blood cell (RBC) mass in the body. In practice, this is reflected by an increase in hemoglobin levels, or hematocrit, over what is considered physiologic for the particular age and gender.

The standard RBC mass does not usually exceed 36 ml/kg in males and 32 ml/kg in females. The reference ranges for normal hemoglobin levels and hematocrit vary depending on altitude, ethnicity, and country.

Polycythemia vera is a sub-type of polycythemia. Often referred to colloquially as simply “polycythemia,” it is an acquired, Philadelphia-chromosome negative

The clinical significance of erythrocytosis, due to any cause, lies in the associated risk of thrombotic events due to hyperviscosity of blood. Additionally, the potential for progression to leukemia in cases of polycythemia vera also warrants additional management strategies to be implemented.
