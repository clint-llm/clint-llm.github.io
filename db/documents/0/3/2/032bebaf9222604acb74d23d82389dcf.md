The diagnosis and management of the electrical injury are best done with an interprofessional team that includes an emergency department provider, radiologist, surgeon, trauma specialist, anesthesiologist, and a burn specialist. Depending on the severity of the injury, one may need to first follow theÂ advanced trauma life support protocol. Cardiac monitoring should be initiated in all patients that have experienced anything greater than a minor low-voltage burn.

Any patient with facial or oral burns, hypoxia, respiratory distress, loss of consciousness, or other issues resulting in difficulty protecting the airway or maintaining a patent airway should be given oxygen and airway protection (e.g., ventilation, intubation, cricothyrotomy). All patients who developed respiratory or cardiac arrest need ICU admission. Consultations with trauma or critical care specialists, surgical specialists, and orthopedists should be considered as soon as possible to avoid any complications or irreversible damage.

Prior to discharge, patients should be educated on potential sources of household and workplace exposures and risks, in addition to any potential long-term effects of their electrical injuries (e.g., neurological, psychological, or physical), and scheduled follow-up as needed.
