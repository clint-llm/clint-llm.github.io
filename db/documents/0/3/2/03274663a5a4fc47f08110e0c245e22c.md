Lactose-intolerant patients and their families should be advised that ingestion of lactose-containing products generally only leads to reversible symptoms without causing permanent damage to the gastrointestinal tract (unlike celiac disease). Also, there are no long-term complications if an adequate intake of proteins, calories, calcium, and vitamin D is ensured.

Primary and congenital lactase deficiency can not be prevented. However, secondary lactase deficiency could be prevented if underlying secondary causes are diagnosed early and promptly instituted appropriate treatment to preserve intestinal mucosal integrity. In addition, avoiding lactose-containing foods helps limit long-term disease severity.
