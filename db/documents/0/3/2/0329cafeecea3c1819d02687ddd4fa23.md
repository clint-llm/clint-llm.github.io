- The acute toxicity of melatonin, as observed in both animal and human studies, is remarkably low. Melatonin may cause minor adverse drug reactions, such as headache, insomnia, rash, gastritis, and nightmares at supraphysiological doses. Researchers could not discover an LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of the subjects) in animals. Melatonin is not fatal even at a dose of 800 mg/kg in animal studies.

- In humans, preliminary observations suggest that long-term melatonin administration is associated with decreased semen quality in several healthy men, probably through aromatase inhibition at the testicular level.
