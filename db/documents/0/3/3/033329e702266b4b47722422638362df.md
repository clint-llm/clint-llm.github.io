Visual changes are physiologic in pregnancy and can be caused by ocular surface, corneal stromal, and lenticular thickness changes, which respond to the expected hormonal variations during the gestational period. These can lead to refractive changes in the structure of the eye but usually result in a myopic shift of less than 1-diopter magnitude.

Retinal arterial and structural abnormalities are identified in 30 to 100% of patients with preeclampsia and eclampsia. Retinal vascular anomalies have been found in 70% of fundus examinations of patients with preeclampsia; they include arteriole narrowing, tortuosity, and segmental retinal artery vasospasm.

Blindness, both reversible and irreversible, has been shown to have a rate of 0.1 to 3%.

Cortical blindness has been identified as a cause of visual pathology in 1 to 15% of pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia.

Few studies have been performed to analyze the incidence and prevalence of intraocular and visual pathway pathology in specific populations with preeclampsia. To the author’s knowledge, there are no studies that identify specific risk factors for acute ischemic stroke causing visual symptoms nor ocular/visual pathway toxicity of commonly administered medications in patients with preeclampsia.
