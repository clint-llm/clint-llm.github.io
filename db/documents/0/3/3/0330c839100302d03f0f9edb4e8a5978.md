The evaluation should include the following:

- Serum PCP level -  not available at many hospitals

- Fingerstick blood glucose - present in 22% of cases of PCP toxicity

- Complete blood count–leukocytosis can be seen

- Electrolyte panel–BUN and creatinine can be elevated

- Creatine kinase– elevated it in 70% of cases with PCP toxicity

- Acetaminophen and salicylate levels–to evaluate for other coingestions

- Electrocardiogram – to evaluation for conduction abnormalities

- Consider CT head – to rule out other causes of altered mental status

- Consider cerebral spinal fluid evaluation – to rule out CNS infection

- Urine toxicology screen – can be helpful to identify coingestions, but may not be helpful to identify acute PCP intoxication because chronic PCP users can have a positive test weeks after their last use. False positives occur for PCP with methadone, ibuprofen, venlafaxine, and chlorpromazine use

- Liver function test – elevated in 50% of cases with PCP toxicity

- Urinalysis -  elevated myoglobin levels

- Imaging studies-  should be performed when there is a concern for trauma secondary to PCP intoxication
