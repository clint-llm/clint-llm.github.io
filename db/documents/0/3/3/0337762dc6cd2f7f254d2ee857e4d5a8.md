Digoxin immune fab is an anti-digoxin immunoglobulin fragment only used in the hospital setting. It is indicated in the treatment of digoxin toxicity. In acute toxicity, the drug is usually administered by an emergency clinician. However, a board-certified cardiology pharmacist must play a role in dosing, scheduling, and administration. Cardiac nurses must be aware of the possible complications that can arise during infusion, and they must also receive instruction to report such adverse reactions immediately to the cardiologist. Pharmacists must also have involvement in determining proper dosing and checking for potential drug-drug interactions. This type of interprofessional team approach will optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse events. [Level 5]

Educating the patient is essential and requires a sequential approach. Discuss the potential use of this drug concerning their health condition. Educate the patient about the various signs and symptoms of delayed allergic reactions. Provide or describe possible adverse effects and instruct the patient to report back immediately. A careful history is necessary to rule out a possible allergy to papaya extracts, ovine proteins, and prior fab therapy. Extra care is a requirement when administering in patients with renal failure and previous heart disease. An interprofessional team approach is vital to optimizing outcomes in patients receiving digoxin immune fab for digoxin poisoning.
