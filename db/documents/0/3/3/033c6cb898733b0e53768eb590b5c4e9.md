Immunohistochemical staining has had poor success in distinguishing fibroblasts as there are no fibroblast specific markers. The result is the staining of multiple cells that overlap in specificity. Immunofluorescence (IF) techniques can be deployed to compare fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. IF shows the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA), a type of actin present in myofibroblasts but not found in fibroblasts. Identification of proteins exclusively found in smooth muscle cells, such as smoothelin, can also assist in distinguishing cell type.
