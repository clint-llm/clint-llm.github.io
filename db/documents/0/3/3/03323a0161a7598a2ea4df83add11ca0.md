The lacrimal gland is a bilobed, tear-shaped gland with the primary function of secreting the aqueous portion of the tear film, thereby maintaining the ocular surface. It is primarily located in the anterior, superotemporal orbit within the lacrimal fossa of the frontal bone. The tendon of levator palpebrae superioris bisects the lacrimal gland, giving rise to 2 lobes: a smaller palpebral component found continuous with the inner eyelid, and a larger orbital component. Its histological composition is mixed serous and mucinous acini, myoepithelial cells, and small interconnecting ductules.
