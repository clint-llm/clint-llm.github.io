The plentitude of different drug-eluting stents requires knowledge about their characteristics to align the advantages and disadvantages of the stent with the requirement of each unique lesion. Stent performance depends strongly on lesion characteristics.

New-generation DES can be used in complex lesions such as with diabetic patients,

Bare metal stents are not outdated, but drug-eluting stents have largely replaced them.

The discussion about the appropriateness of real-world stenting practice is ongoing. For example, the NORSTENT study emphasized the advantages of BMS compared to DES. Designing studies and finding evidence is difficult, which can be illustrated by the fact that the progression of restenosis differs, which makes early angiographic measures unrelated to late stenotic changes. Measuring restenosis risk as a surrogate is common among studies, but it may not correlate with clinical endpoints such as death and myocardial infarction.

Evidence advocates for everolimus-eluting stents, which exhibit the most favorable outcomes and the future might belong to biodegradable polymers and bioabsorbable scaffolds.
