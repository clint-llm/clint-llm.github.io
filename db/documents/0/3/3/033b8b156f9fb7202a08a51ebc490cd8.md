The pathophysiological mechanisms for ventricular premature complexes include enhanced automaticity, re-entry, and triggered activity. The enhanced automaticity characteristically results from an ectopic ventricular focus that fires spontaneously. A variety of stimuli, including myocardial ischemia, electrolyte imbalance, and heightened adrenergic state, can cause enhanced automaticity. An impulse can trigger the premature ventricular ectopics during the early-depolarization phase due to exceeding the cell membrane activation threshold. The VPCs associated with bradycardia is often caused by this mechanism, along with other factors like electrolyte abnormalities, ischemia, and digoxin toxicity. The re-entry mechanism leading to VPCs occurs typically in the areas of scarring or ischemia.
