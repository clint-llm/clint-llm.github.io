Ivabradine is FDA-approved in the United States for use in patients with symptoms due to stable heart failure and an ejection fraction of 35% or less to reduce their risk of hospital admission for worsening heart failure.

Patients on ivabradine therapy should have a resting heart rate of at least 70 beats per minute and must be in normal sinus rhythm. They should also be on their maximum tolerated beta-blocker or have a contraindication to beta-blocker use.

In Europe, ivabradine is indicated in the treatment of heart failure and chronic stable angina.
