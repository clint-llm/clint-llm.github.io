The lac operon spans over 5300 base pairs and contains three structural genes: LacZ, LacY, and LacA. Their transcription is coordinately regulated by a single lac promoter, located between base pairs: -36 and -7, from the transcription start site. During each transcription cycle, the DNA-dependent RNA-polymerase binds to the promoter and initiates transcription. This produces a single polycistronic mRNA containing multiple independent Stop and Start codons such that each of the three proteins is translated separately and not cleaved from a single polypeptide precursor.

Structural genes of the lac operon encode proteins that coordinately metabolize lactose. LacZ gene encodes for a tetrameric enzyme, beta-galactosidase. It contains four identical polypeptide subunits and plays a central role in the breakdown of lactose. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of lactose and allolactose to glucose and galactose and the transgalactosylation of lactose to its structural analog allolactose.

LacY gene encodes for lactose permease (LacY), a transmembrane protein belonging to the oligosaccharide/H+ symporter subfamily. It is a secondary active transporter and drives the reversible transport of galactosides (such as lactose) with a proton molecule into the cell.

LacA gene encodes for thiogalactoside transacetylase, also called galactoside acetyltransferase. It transfers an acetyl group from coenzyme A to the 6-O-methyl position of pyranose rings in beta-galactosides. Although the roles of the former two enzymes are well known, the biological function of galactoside acetyltransferase remains uncertain. Acetylation of these galactosides causes their efflux and reduces their re-entry into the cells. This prevents the toxic accumulation of these compounds and reduces cell stress by decreasing the intracellular concentration of the inducers.

The lac operon also contains regulatory genes that switch on or off the operon depending on the nutritional environment of the bacterial cells. A primary operator locus(O1) located upstream of the structural genes plays a key role in regulating their transcription. Centered around +11 base pairs from the transcription start site, it binds to a repressor protein and negatively regulates the lac operon. In addition to the primary operator, two additional auxiliary operators, formerly called the “pseudo-operators,” have been recognized. O2 is located 401 base pairs downstream from O1, while O3 is positioned 82 base pairs upstream from the primary operator. They differ from O1 in a few nucleotide sequences and their binding affinity for lac repressor.

The repressor protein is encoded by a regulatory gene, LacI,  located on a different operon having its independent promoter. It encodes constitutively for a homo-tetrameric polypeptide: lac repressor. A protein made of 360 amino acids has a molecular mass of 154520 Dalton. It contains a separate DNA binding site, with which it associates with the operator, and an inducer binding site, with which it binds to lactose and its structural analogs. Each tetrameric unit of the protein is arranged in two functional dimers, allowing the repressor to simultaneously bind to two different operators. The lac repressor acts as a master switch for the lac operon and optimizes the synthesis of enzymes from the structural genes.

Immediately upstream to the lac promoter and centered between base pairs -72 and -50 is the catabolite activator protein (CAP) binding site. The transcription factor, CAP, contains two functional dimers that interact with the alpha subunit C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase, increasing its recruitment and binding with the lac promoter.
