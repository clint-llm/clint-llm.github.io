The management of mycosis fungoides is best done with an interprofessional team of healthcare workers that includes an oncologist, internist, dermatologist, nurses, pharmacists, and social workers. The disorder has no cure, and the aim is to improve the quality of life. The patient should be encouraged to use ample moisturizer to prevent skin dryness and pruritus. The patient should be told to avoid the sun and wear long-sleeved garments when going out. A cool humidified environment is highly recommended. The patient should also be educated about the other treatment options like irradiation, Photodynamic therapy and UV light treatment enhanced with psoralen. Finally, the patient should be seen by a dietitian as many people develop moderate nausea from the treatment and lose significant weight. A high-calorie diet with regular exercise is recommended.

**Outcomes**

Mycosis fungoides is an incurable disorder unless the patient has very early stage disease. The mortality and morbidity increase as the tumor advances. While early-stage patients have a 95% survival over ten years, those who advanced cancer only have a 3-4 year survival. Those with the advanced extra-cutaneous disease only have a survival of fewer than 18 months. Poor prognostic factors include male gender, advanced age, and elevated LDH.
