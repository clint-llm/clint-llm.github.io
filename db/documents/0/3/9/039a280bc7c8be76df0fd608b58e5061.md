A thorough history and physical evaluation are crucial in providing rapid detection of SCI. This, together with neuroimaging, can aid in expedited detection of SCI. Suspected patients are managed with hemodynamic support to maximize blood pressure, lumbar drainage to lower the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure is often indicated to increase spinal perfusion and halt the progression of the injury.
