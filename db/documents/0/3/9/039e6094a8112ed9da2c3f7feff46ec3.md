Although excessive accumulation of cerumen is typically asymptomatic, patientsÂ should be treated if they present with hearing loss, ear fullness, pruritus, dizziness, tinnitus, or otalgia. The inability to examine an ear by otoscopy, particularly an ear with other symptomatology, such as hearing loss, tinnitus, pain, or vertigo, due to cerumen impaction is also an indication for cerumen removal.

When encountered in an asymptomatic patient, it is not always necessary to treat a cerumen impaction. It is important to explain to patients that cerumen does not always need to be removed, as cerumen naturally has bacteriocidal, protective, and emollient properties. Unless symptomatic, patients should be encouraged to leave their cerumen alone. Observation should be offered as a management strategy, if appropriate.

In young children, the elderly, schizophrenic, or cognitively impaired individuals, treatment is a reasonable option because these patients may not be able to verbalize, perceive, or attend to concerning symptoms, significantly worsening their quality of life.
