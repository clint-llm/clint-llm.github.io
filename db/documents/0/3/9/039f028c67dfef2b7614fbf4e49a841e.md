Often collaborative work is required in the medical setting when patients with NPD work with non-mental health professionals such as surgeons, medical nursing, nutritionists, etc. These patients are often described as "difficult and demanding," and importantly, their medical needs remain untreated. Often mental health professionals may be consulted for a mood disorder on the inpatient floor for a patient with underlying NPD and have to liaison with the primary medical team in charge of the patient. Other medical professionals must be educated about personality disorder and their countertransference towards the patient so that it does not impact clinical care. Mental health professionals in the consult-liaison service may provide support and education to the first medical teams as well.

In the outpatient setting, patients are asked to discuss their diagnosis as they feel relevant to their medical providers. A partnership among medical professionals and other ancillaries may ensure optimal care. Pharmacists need to have input into the medication process, ensuring proper dosing and the absence of interactions. Nurses function as the glue that holds the team together and are often the primary point of patient contact. The education of both patients and their providers is also helpful. All these disciplines functioning as an interprofessional team are vital to achieving optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
