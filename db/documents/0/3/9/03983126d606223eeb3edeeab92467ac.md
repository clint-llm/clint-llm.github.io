Though trauma is typically incidental, some methods remain to reduce the chance of occurrence and severity of injuries. This involves evaluating the potential risk of child abuse, suicidal tendencies, and risky social behavior (including injurious sports or recreational activities). Adults and children alike see a decreased rate of injury or death when using age- and size-appropriate car seats and restraints.
