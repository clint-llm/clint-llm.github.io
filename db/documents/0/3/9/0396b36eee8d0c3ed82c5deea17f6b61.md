The conjoint tendon forms the medial part of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal.

Hesselbachâ€™s triangle, also referred to as the inguinal triangle, includes the following borders:

- Medial: linea semilunaris

- Superolateral: inferior epigastric vessels

- Inferior: inguinal ligament

While the lateral abdominal muscles are the major stressors of the conjoint tendon, the conjoint tendon also receives force from its connection with the rectus abdominis tendon and the pubic plate distally.
