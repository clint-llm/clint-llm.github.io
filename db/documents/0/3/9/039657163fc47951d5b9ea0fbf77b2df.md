Systemic therapy is reserved for patients with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable synovial sarcoma. Synovial sarcoma is chemo-sensitive histology. Hence first-line regimen usually involves an anthracycline-based regimen.

**Cytotoxic Chemotherapy**

- Anthracycline based regimens

- Either used alone or in combination with Ifosfamide
- The expected response rate is between 25% and 60%.

- Ifosfamide

- Has significant activity in patients with synovial sarcoma
- Primarily used in combination with anthracyclines. 
- It can be used as a single agent for those not fit to receive anthracyclines. 
- A recent phase III trial evaluated evofosfamide in combination with doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone. In the subset of patients with synovial sarcoma, a numerical benefit in the OS was noted in patients receiving both doxorubicin and evofosfamide (22.1 months versus 9.4 months). Although evofosfamide is not approved in the US, this trial does reinforce the activity of Ifosfamide in synovial sarcoma.

- Trabectedin

- The drug has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in translocation-driven sarcomas. 
- Retrospective studies have demonstrated response rates of up to 15%.

**Targeted Therapy**

- Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI)- A functional role of PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor alpha) has been described in synovial sarcoma. Hence inhibition of PDGFRA may help achieve a response in patients with synovial sarcoma. Pazopanib is a multi-targeted TKI with several targets, including PDGFRA.

- Pazopanib is the only USFDA-approved TKI available in the market for patients with synovial sarcoma.

- PALETTE trial- included 38 patients with synovial sarcoma. An improvement of 3 months was noted in the median PFS with pazopanib versus placebo (4.1 months versus one month).
- In patients with pleuro-pulmonary synovial sarcoma, a risk of pneumothorax exists. However, some patients can achieve a dramatic response using pazopanib.


- Regorafenib

- It was evaluated in the phase II French trial- REGOSARC. All patients in this trial were randomized between regorafenib and placebo.
- In the subgroup of synovial sarcoma, a PFS benefit of 4 months was noted (5.6 months versus one month).

Multiple other molecular targets have been identified in patients with synovial sarcoma, including EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2), mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathways, and CDK 4/6 (cyclin D1-cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6) pathways. However, clinical trials investigating these pathways have not resulted in positive results. Most recently, a novel small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor AL3818 (APROMISS trial) has shown a progression-free survival benefit compared to dacarbazine.

**Promising Ongoing Trials**

- NCT04044768- This phase 2 study evaluating ADP-A2M4 in HLA-A*02 eligible and MAGE-A4 positive subjects with metastatic or inoperable (advanced) synovial sarcoma. This trial uses the novel concept of genetically engineered T-cells to target MAGE-A4 positive cells in the context of HLA-A*02.

- NCT03016819- This is a phase 3 trial where a novel small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor AL3818 is being tested in patients with advanced synovial sarcoma (APROMISS trial). Preliminary results were presented at ASCO 2021, and authors reported a progression-free survival benefit compared to dacarbazine.
