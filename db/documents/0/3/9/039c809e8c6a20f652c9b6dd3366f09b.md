Any disease process which causes direct injury to the adrenal cortex can result in primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease). In most of the developedÂ world, autoimmune destruction of the adrenal glands is the most common cause of Addison disease. Autoimmune destruction can be an isolated finding or part of autoimmune polyglandular endocrinopathies (type 1 and 2). Patients with the autoimmune adrenal disease are more likely to have polyglandular autoimmune syndromes.

Other causes include infections (such as sepsis, tuberculosis, and HIV), bilateral adrenal hemorrhages (precipitated by coagulopathy, trauma, meningococcemia, neoplastic processes involving the adrenal glands. Rarer causes include sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, fungal infections, and genetic disorders such as adrenal leukodystrophy and Wolman disease.
