Approach to a patient with retinal artery macroaneurysm has to be both extensive and synergetic. For example, patients suffering from hypertension should be advised of blood pressure control by referring them to a primary care physician, and those with macular involvement require prompt treatment by the ophthalmologist depending upon the characteristics, location, and duration of the lesion. Other associated systemic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, kidney disease, ischemic heart disease, may need interprofessional coordination with various specialists, including endocrinologists, nephrologists, and cardiologists.

The condition hence requires an interprofessional team approach which includes initiation of treatment and motivation by the physician for the taking advice of the ophthalmologist for early detection and prevention of vision-threatening complications, validation of proper dosage of the medication by the pharmacist, monitoring the vital signs as well as assisting in educating the patient for compliance to the treatment by the nurses, complete evaluation of visual acuity by the optometrist, and finally proper counseling and laying down the various treatment options available for this condition by the ophthalmologist.

This interprofessional teamwork is pivotal in successfully treating and managing retinal artery macroaneurysm and securing favorable patient outcomes.
