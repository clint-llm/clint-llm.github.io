The FDA regards and regulates sunscreen as an over-the-counter medication. The efficacy of sunscreen is determined by UVB protection, which is measured by the sun protection factor (SPF) and substantivity. SPF is the ratio of the smallest dose of UVB radiation required to produce minimal erythema on sunscreen-protected skin compared to the necessary dose of UVB to produce the same amount of erythema on non-protected skin. SPF is a better predictor of protection against UVB since it is 1000 times more erythemagenic than UVA. An SPF-15 can block 94% of UVB radiation, while an SPF-30 can block 97% of UVB radiation.
