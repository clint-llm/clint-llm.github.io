Surgeons should know the mental nerve sensory territory and its foramen to perform a successful nerve block and prevent complications during surgical procedures. For example, in plastic surgery, the mental nerve is blocked during chin reconstructive interventions. As a result, in mentoplasties and other chin surgeries, the patient may be awake — the nerve block aids in safe and successful surgery with reduced potential complications. The surgeon may also block the mental nerve in the jaw and lower lip surgeries

Nerve damage due to stretching, compressing, or transecting the mental nerve can cause sensory dysfunctions of the inferior lip, surrounding skin and mucosa, and teeth, including numbness, increased or decreased sensation, painful sensation, or complete loss of sensation. Many factors can produce such disturbances, for example, a denture compressing the nerve, a dental implant invading the nerve, edemas, hematomas, or dental injections. Furthermore, osteotomies can damage the inferior alveolar and mental nerve and blood vessels of the area
