Colon polyps are protrusions occurring in the colon lumen most commonly sporadic or as part of other syndromes. Polyps are classified as diminutive if 5 mm in diameter or less, small if 6 to 9 mm, or large if they are 1 cm in diameter or more. Polyps can be depressed, flat, sessile or pedunculated. Few polyps arise from submucosa including lipomas, carcinoids or lymphoid aggregates. Most commonly, however, they result from the mucosa, and they can be adenomatous, serrated, or non-neoplastic. Hyperplastic polyps are very common and have a very low malignant potential. They are encountered more in the distal colon. Juvenile polyps are benign hamartomas and are common in childhood. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of colonic polyps, presentation, and diagnosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for and pathophysiology of for colonic polyps.
- Describe the examination methods and criteria used to evaluate for colon polyps.
- Summarize the treatment and management of colonic polyps.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in the diagnosis of colon polyps and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
