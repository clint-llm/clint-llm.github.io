Specimen collection modalities include fine-needle aspiration cytology, fluid sampling and centrifugation, and tissue sampling. A cytogenetic test can be obtained for fetal diagnostic testing as early as 10 weeks of gestation from chorionic villus sampling (CVS), using trophoblast cells or cultured mesenchymal cells. By analyzing cells cultured from amniotic fluid, false mosaicism detected on chorionic villus sampling can be eliminated. Amniocentesis can be performed from the 15th to the 18th week of pregnancy. This requires the cultured sample to grow for one to two weeks.

Another test that may be performed is an examination of the lymphocytes of the fetus by obtaining a sample from the umbilical vein at around the 19th week of gestation. Fibroblasts are the preferred material to obtain from the skin of the abortus. After birth, evaluation of fibroblasts or peripheral blood lymphocytes can be performed. For chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), genomic DNA can be obtained from peripheral blood, skin fibroblasts, or amniocentesis.

In acute leukemias, bone marrow samples are routinely obtained for conventional karyotype and FISH testing. A timely collection of a bone marrow sample for cytogenetic testing at diagnosis of acute leukemia is essential for adequate prognostic evaluation and treatment selection. In solid tumors and lymphoproliferative disorders, FISH is usually performed using histopathological samples and also impacts prognosis and treatment selection.
