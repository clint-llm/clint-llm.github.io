**Acute Aortic Insufficiency**

In acute aortic insufficiency, the retrograde backflow of blood results in a quick rise in the left ventricular end-diastolic volume. The acute increase in preload and afterload does not allow the time for the left ventricle to acclimatize to the rapid increase in volume during diastole, and this also results in a sharp rise in left ventricular diastolic pressure. When the left ventricular diastolic pressure rises above the level of left atrial pressure, premature mitral valve closure and mitral regurgitation can be seen. Additionally, there will be increases in left atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure that cause pulmonary edema. Compensatory tachycardia may occur to blunt the decline in anterograde stroke volume, and concentric hypertrophy with increased wall thickness can occur.

**Chronic Aortic Insufficiency**

In chronic aortic insufficiency, the left ventricle compensates for the diastolic regurgitation of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle by remodeling of the left ventricle via eccentric hypertrophy of the cardiomyocytes and left ventricular dilatation to allow for an increase in left ventricular stroke volume and a lesser increase in wall thickness than that which would be seen in acute aortic insufficiency. However, the left end-diastolic volume and pressure rise to a high degree such that the sarcomeres can become maximally stretched, left ventricle remodeling and compensation mechanisms fail, and interstitial fibrosis and a drop in left ventricular compliance occur.
