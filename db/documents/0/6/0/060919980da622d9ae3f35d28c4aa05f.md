Post-cholecystectomy syndrome (PCS) is the term used to describe the persistence of biliary colic or right upper quadrant abdominal pain with a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms similar to those in patients with cholecystitis prior to cholecystectomy. As the name suggests, this syndrome can represent either a continuation of symptoms caused by gallbladder pathology or the development of new symptoms. The symptoms include fatty food intolerance, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, flatulence, indigestion, diarrhea, jaundice, and intermittent episodes of abdominal pain. Post-cholecystectomy syndrome can present early, typically in the post-operative period, but can also manifest months to years after surgery.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of post-cholecystectomy syndrome.
- Explain when post-cholecystectomy syndrome should be suspected and what evaluation should be done.
- Describe the management of post-cholecystectomy syndrome.
- Describe how enhanced coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid detection of post-cholecystectomy syndrome and subsequently enhance the detection of pathology and allow for treatment when indicated.
