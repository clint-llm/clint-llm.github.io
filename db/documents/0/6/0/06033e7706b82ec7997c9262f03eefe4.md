Videostroboscopy requires the same equipment and supplies that are used for flexible nasolaryngoscopy, with the addition of the videostroboscopic unit:

- Flexible fiberoptic or digital chip-on-the-tip (distal chip) nasolaryngoscope, or a rigid 70-degree endoscope

- Specialized laryngeal or throat microphone to be placed on the neck

- Stroboscopy apparatus that analyzes input from the microphone to synchronize the strobe frequency of the light source

- Recording apparatus to document the exam and review in slow motion or image by image
