The prognosis differs between infants with symmetrical or asymmetrical FGR. Asymmetrical FGR infants, in general, have a better prognosis compared to those with symmetrical FGR. As the timing of intrauterine insult is later in pregnancy in asymmetrical FGR, cell number is usually normal, which translates to normal postnatal growth.

Infants with symmetrical FGR may potentially remain small throughout their lives. A study showed that the father’s height, mother’s height, and birth length influence the final height of FGR infants.
