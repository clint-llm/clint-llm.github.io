A timed-endpoint method is used to measure iron concentration. The steps are as follows:

- The iron (ferric form) bound to transferrin is freed by adding acetic acid.

- Then the iron is reduced to its ferrous form by using hydroxylamine and thioglycolate.

- The iron then forms a complex with FerroZine Iron Reagent.

- The concentration of iron in the sample is measured by the change in the absorbance of light.

- Change in absorbance is tracked at 560 nm wavelength at a fixed-time interval.

- TIBC excess is estimated by addingÂ excess ferric iron to saturate transferrin and the unbound ferric iron is removed.
