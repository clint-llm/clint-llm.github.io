The role of an ultrasound technologist is exceptionally important in helping the operator during the procedure. Patient comfort is critical in properly performing the procedure as significant patient movement can affect specimen acquisition and potentially injure adjacent anatomy such as blood vessels or the trachea. The assistant's role is essential in ensuring patient comfort, safety, and maintaining the sterile field. Quickly obtaining specimens is also important, considering blood infiltration within the thyroid parenchyma limits the quality of successive needle passes. If possible, an assistant ultrasound technologist can deliver the specimens to the cytopathologist while the operator continues acquiring additional specimens. Thus potentially improving the quality and adequacy of all aspirated specimens acquired during the procedure.
