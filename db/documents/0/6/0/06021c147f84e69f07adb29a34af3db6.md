There is a wide spectrum of EPS presentations. Dystonia most often occurs within 48 hours of drug exposure in 50% of cases, and within five days in 90% of cases.

Akathisia is characterized by a subjective feeling of internal restlessness and a compelling urge to move, leading to the objective observation of repetitive movements comprising leg crossing, swinging, or shifting from one foot to another.

Drug-induced parkinsonism presents as tremor, rigidity, and slowing of motor function in the truncal region and extremities. The classic appearance is an individual with masked facies, stooped posture, and a slow shuffling gait. Gait imbalance and difficulty rising from a seated position are often noted.

Finally, tardive dyskinesia manifests as involuntary choreoathetoid movements affecting orofacial and tongue muscles, and less commonly the truncal region and extremities. While symptoms are typically not painful, they may impede social interaction and cause difficulty in chewing, swallowing, and talking.
