Some papers have reported a worse prognosis for subungual melanoma compared to cutaneous melanomas. This is likely to be related to the late presentation of the condition. Therefore, the prognosis is likely the same as for cutaneous malignant melanoma.

The American Cancer Society has recently published up-to-date prognostic statistics:

- Stage IA: The 5-year survival rate is around 97%. The 10-year survival is approximately 95%.

- Stage IB: The 5-year survival rate is around 92%. The 10-year survival is approximately 86%.

- Stage IIA: The 5-year survival rate is around 81%. The 10-year survival is approximately 67%.

- Stage IIB: The 5-year survival rate is around 70%. The 10-year survival is approximately 57%.

- Stage IIC: The 5-year survival rate is around 53%. The 10-year survival is approximately 40%.

- Stage IIIA: The 5-year survival rate is around 78%. The 10-year survival is approximately 68%.

- Stage IIIB: The 5-year survival rate is around 59%. The 10-year survival is approximately 43%.

- Stage IIIC: The 5-year survival rate is around 40%. The 10-year survival is approximately 24%.

- Stage IV: The 5-year survival rate is about 15% to 20%. The 10-year survival is about 10% to 15%. The outlook is better if the spread is only to distant parts of the skin or distant lymph nodes rather than to other organs and if the blood level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is normal.
