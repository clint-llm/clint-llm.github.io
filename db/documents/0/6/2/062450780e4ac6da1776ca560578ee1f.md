The presence of cytoplasmic granules characterizes mast cells. Owing to the high acidity of the heparin in these granules, alkaline dyes undergo a change in color. This property, known as metachromasia, is unique to mast cells and basophils. The alkaline dye toluidine blue will stain secretory granules red-violet. After granules are expelled from the cell, they lose their metachromatic properties and stain pink with toluidine blue.

Mast cells can usually be distinguished from basophils due to their mononuclear morphology, and any question can be resolved with special stains such as tryptase or monoclonal antibodies to the mast cell kit (CD117) receptor.

Hematoxylin and eosin staining reveals eosinophilic granules and does not allow the microscopist to reliably distinguish between mast cells and eosinophils.
