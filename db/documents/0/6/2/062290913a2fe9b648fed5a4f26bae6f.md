Pathogenesis of congenital rubella syndrome is multifactorial

- Non-inflammatory necrosis of chorionic epithelium and in endothelial cells which are then transported to fetal circulation and fetal organs.

- Intracellular actin assembly is inhibited by rubella infection, leading to inhibition of mitosis and restricted development of precursor cells.

- Upregulation of cytokines and interferon in infected cells which could contribute to congenital defects.
