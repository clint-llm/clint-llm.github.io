After hysteroscopic polypectomy, significant improvement in intermenstrual bleeding has been reported.

Spontaneous pregnancy and delivery at term rates in some studies increased after the hysteroscopic polypectomy. There was no statistical difference in fertility rates between patients having polyps less than or equal to 1 cm and patients having greater than 1 cm polyps or multiple polyps. The spontaneous abortion rate in the first trimester of pregnancy showed no statistical difference between patients with small or bigger/multiple polyps.
