Peroneal tendon disorders are a cause of hindfoot and lateral foot pain. There are three primary disorders of the tendons; Peroneal tendonitis, peroneal subluxation, and peroneal tendon tears. These conditions are a cause of lateral ankle pain and may lead to ankle instability. The peroneal tendons are in the lateral compartment of the leg and include the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis muscles. This activity outlines the presentation and treatment of peroneal tendon syndromes and offers a review of the current non-operative and operative treatment options. This activity also highlights the importance of the interprofessional team in the management of peroneal tendon syndromes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of peroneal tendon syndromes.
- Review the evaluation of peroneal tendon syndromes.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for peroneal tendon syndromes.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance peroneal tendon syndromes and improve outcomes.
