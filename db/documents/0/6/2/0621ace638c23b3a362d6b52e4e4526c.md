The following equipmentÂ is required to perform a caudal epidural block.

- Appropriately sized syringe

- Needle or IV access catheter

- Medication

- Skin cleaning solution, commonly alcohol, chlorhexidine, or an iodine solution

- Personal protective equipment (sterile gloves, mask, head covering)

Ultrasound can assist in caudal epidural placement in pediatric or adult patients. A study by Shin et al. demonstrated that identification of the sacral hiatus by ultrasound facilitated the completion of the caudal epidural placement.

The gold standard for a successful caudal epidural block is fluoroscopy-guided. However, this is rarely performed in an operating room environment due to impracticality and radiation exposure to both the patient and providers.
