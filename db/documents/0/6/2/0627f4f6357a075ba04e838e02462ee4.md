Lung transplantation is a well-established life-saving treatment to improve the quality of life of patients with end-stage respiratory failure not responding to other medical or surgical interventions.

Because lung transplantation is evolving both in the application and in success, it is worthwhile to be acquainted with the procedure. The first lung transplant procedure was performed by Dr. James Hardy and colleagues at the University of Mississippi in 1963. The recipient had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but was a suboptimal candidate for several reasons, including the presence of advanced lung cancer and renal insufficiency.
