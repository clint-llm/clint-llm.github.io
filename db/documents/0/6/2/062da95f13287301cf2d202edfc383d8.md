The prognosis for most Hymenoptera stings is very good. Most patients have anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of days of discomfort. For patients with severe systemic reactions, mortality is often high, unless treated promptly. All patients with a history of severe reactions to insect bites should avoid Hymenoptera insects to the best of their ability and carry an epinephrine auto-injecting pen at all times. Deaths from bees and wasps account for about 62 deaths each year in the United States.
