Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a severe life-threatening emergency that demands prompt treatment. Most patients present to the emergency department; thus, the emergency department team must know how to assess the patient and order the appropriate tests. Neurocritical care and a neurosurgical consultation are mandatory.

This entails an interprofessional team approach to care involving clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and physical and occupational therapists. When medication plays a role in managing the case, a pharmacist should be consulted to verify dosing and perform medication reconciliation. Neurocritical care nurses must be familiar with the management of these patients. All team members must keep meticulous records of their patient interactions and interventions so that everyone involved in care has the most accurate, up-to-date data on the case. If anyone notes a concern or deterioration or other change in status, they must immediately be able to reach out to the appropriate persons for additional workup or therapeutic action.

Unfortunately, the disorder carries a mortality of over 50%, irrespective of treatment. Even those who survive are left with disabling morbidity, hence the need for ongoing therapy. An ethics team should be involved early in the goals of care planning.
