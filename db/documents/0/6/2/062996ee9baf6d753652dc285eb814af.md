The mass usually reveals a well-circumscribed lesion in the testis. The cut surface of the mass shows a distinct golden brown or homogeneous yellow to light brown appearance. Microscopically, the tumor cells are large to polygonal with a round to oval nucleus and deeply acidophilic with granular cytoplasm. The cytoplasm also shows rod-shaped crystals referred to as "crystalloids of Reinke," which appear in 35% of tumors, and lipofuscin pigment in a smaller percent (10% to 15%).
