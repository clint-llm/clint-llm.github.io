Under normal conditions, myoglobin circulates in the blood bound to plasma globulins which are maintained between 0 to 0.003 mg/dL.

Myoglobin release from muscle tissues occurs due to damage to muscle cells and a change in skeletal muscle cell membrane permeability.

In health, myoglobin is easily filtered by the glomerulus and quickly excreted in the urine. However, large amounts of myoglobin in renal tubules can lead to an interaction of the hemoprotein with Tamm-Horsfall proteins, subsequent precipitation, and tubular obstruction.
