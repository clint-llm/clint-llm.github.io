The choroid plexus is a complex network of capillaries lined by specialized cells and has various functions. One of the primary functions is to produce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via the ependymal cells that line the ventricles of the brain. Secondly, the choroid plexus serves as a barrier in the brain separating the blood from the CSF, known as the blood-CSF barrier. In addition to these vital functions, the choroid plexus also secretes various growth factors that maintain the stem cell pool in the subventricular zone. Not only are these functions necessary for successful brain development, but they are also essential to protect against harmful microbes and toxins.
