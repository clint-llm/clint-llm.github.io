Currently, there is no approved chemoprophylaxis, vaccine, or disease-specific treatment for POW virus infection. Management of patients is supportive and should involve the expertise of an infectious disease specialist. General supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, antipyretics, and critical care, as required, have been effective, but the overall case mortality remains high. Several case reports have proposed the potential use of high-dose corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).
