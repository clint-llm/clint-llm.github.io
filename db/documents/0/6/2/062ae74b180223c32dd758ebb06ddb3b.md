Mural thrombi are thrombi that attach to the wall of a blood vessel and cardiac chamber. Mural thrombus occurrence in a normal or minimally atherosclerotic vessel is a rare entity in the absence of a hypercoagulative state or inflammatory, infectious, or familial aortic ailments. Mural thrombi can be seen in large vessels such as the heart and aorta and can restrict blood flow. They are mostly located in the descending aorta, and less commonly, in the aortic arch or the abdominal aorta. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis of mural thrombi and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of mural thrombus.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with mural thrombus.
- Outline the management options available for mural thrombus.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with mural thrombus.
