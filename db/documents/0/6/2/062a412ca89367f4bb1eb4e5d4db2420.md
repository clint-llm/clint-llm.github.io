Acute hepatic inflammation can be caused by many infectious and noninfectious causes, of which the most common causes are secondary to a viral infection or drug-induced liver injury. Below is a list of common causes for acute hepatitis and acute liver failure

**Infectious causes**:

- **Hepatotropic viruses**:

- 
              
- Hepatitis A Virus(HAV)
              
              
- Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)
              
              
- Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)
              
              
- Hepatitis D Virus (HDV)
              
              
- Hepatitis E Virus (HEV)

- **Nonhepatotropic virus**:

- 
              
- Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
              
              
- Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
              
              
- Herpes simplex virus (HSV)
              
              
- Coxsackievirus
              
              
- Adenovirus
              
              
- Dengue virus
              
              
- Coronavirus-19(COVID-19)

- 
**Bacteria, fungi, and parasites**

**Toxin or substance-related causes include:**

- **Alcohol-related**: fatty liver disease, acute alcoholic hepatitis, or alcoholic cirrhosis

- 
**Drugs and toxins**

- 
              
- Dose-dependent, e.g. acetaminophen (paracetamol)
              
              
- Non-dose-dependent, e.g., idiosyncratic drug reaction most commonly related to antibiotics and anticonvulsants but also statins, NSAIDs, herbal/nutritional supplements
              
              
- Other toxins, e.g., mushroom (Amanita phalloides),Â herbal and dietary supplements, carbon tetrachloride, sea anemone sting

**Immunologic or inflammatory conditions**

- Autoimmune hepatitis

- Biliary disease such as primary biliary cholangitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis.

**Metabolic or hereditary**

- Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease

- Hemochromatosis

- Wilson's disease

**Pregnancy-related**

- Preeclampsia

- Acute fatty liver of pregnancy

- HELLP syndrome

**Ischemic and Vascular**

- Cardiogenic/Distributive shock

- Hypotension

- Heatstroke

- Cocaine, methamphetamine, ephedrine

- Acute Budd-Chiari syndrome

- Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome

**Miscellaneous**

- Acute fatty liver of pregnancy

- Malignancy

- Eclampsia

- HELLP syndrome

- Reye' syndrome

- Primary graft non-function after liver transplantation
