The main cause of CVID remains unknown despite more than four decades of investigation. It is known that environmental and genetic factors may be involved: approximately, 20% of CVID patients have a first-degree family member with a selective IgA deficiency; while the specific environmental factors are unclear, the genetic influence in CVID is believed to cause an intrinsic B cell defect (CD19-deficiency by mutations in CD19; 16p11.2), an intrinsic T cell defect (ICOS-deficiency by mutations in ICOS; 2q33), and mutations in TNF receptors (TACI-deficiency or BAFFR- deficiency by mutations in TNFRSF13B and TNFRSF13C respectively; 17p11.2 and 22q13.1-q13.31). Other monogenic defects reported include MSH5, CD81, and CD20 deficiencies; however, CVID can be present without a known genetic defect.

There is no observable, clear pattern of inheritance. Different modes of inheritance, such as autosomal dominant with variable penetrance, autosomal recessive, and X-linked forms, have been reported.
