Sliding hernias are thought to develop secondary to progressive disruption of the GE junction, which leads to a widening and circumferential laxity of the phrenoesophageal membrane. Herniation results in an alteration of the physiologic anatomy of the GE junction by decreasing the amount of intra-abdominal esophagus thus allowing reflux of gastric contents.  It has been shown the susceptibility of the esophagus to reflux during abdominal straining was directly proportional to the size of a sliding hernia. Sliding hernias predispose to reflux by altering both the competence of the GE junction as well as decreasing the clearance of contents in the distal esophagus. Sliding hiatal hernias impair clearance in the distal esophagus by a phenomenon called "re-reflux." It occurs predominantly during inspiration and is most pronounced in the recumbent position. The crural diaphragm is thought to pinch off the distal esophagus and act as a one-way valve. In the setting of type 1 sliding hiatal hernia, the GE junction is no longer intra-abdominal and has subsequently migrated superiorly through the hiatus and above the crural diaphragm.  As mentioned earlier, type 2 to 4 hiatal hernias are not clearly understood and thought to be from multiple contributing risk factors. Most often the combination of an increased diameter of the hiatus in the setting of persistent increased intra-abdominal pressure set the stage to develop a paraesophageal hernia.
