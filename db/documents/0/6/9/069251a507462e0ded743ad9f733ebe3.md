The kidneys function in a wide variety of ways necessary for health. They excrete metabolic waste, regulate fluid and electrolyte balance, promote bone integrity, and more. These two bean-shaped organs interact with the cardiovascular system to maintain hemodynamic stability. Renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration are important aspects of sustaining proper organ functions. A delicate balance exists between renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate as changes in one may affect the other.
