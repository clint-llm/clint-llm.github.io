Histologic findings are a hallmark for Sweet syndrome, and typical histopathological features are a requirement for the diagnosis of Sweet syndrome.

The classic histopathologic pattern of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet syndrome) consists of a diffuse dense neutrophilic infiltrate in the reticular dermis. Leukocytoclastic nuclear debris presents interstitially, and papillary dermal edema is common. True vasculitic changes usually are absent, although subtle vasculitic changes may occur. Eosinophils and lymphocytes may be present, but neutrophils predominate.Â The epidermis typically is spared, although spongiosis and subcorneal pustule formation may be present.

Direct immunofluorescence testing is not contributory. In rare instances, the inflammation may extend to involve the subcutis. In most instances, cases with subcutaneous involvement show extensive involvement of the reticular dermis.

Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome has been described as a variant and includes histiocytoid cells, which are immature myeloid cells, commonly mistaken as histiocytes. The most important differential diagnosis for this variant is leukemia cutis.
