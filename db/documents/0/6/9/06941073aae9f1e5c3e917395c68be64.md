Given the nature of mexiletine and potential side effects, cardiac, hepatic, and metabolic monitoring is necessary while on this drug. ECG should be used to monitor QRS and QTc intervals and the development of any evidence of heart block. Liver function tests should be monitored for evaluation of hepatic function as the drug gets metabolized hepatically. Electrolytes, particularly potassium and magnesium, should be monitored and replaced accordingly.

Moreover, clinical monitoring is necessary, as well. Any development of a symptom or sign after starting mexiletine should undergo a thorough evaluation to ensure that toxicity is not occurring. For example, patients presenting with a newly developing tremor may be exhibiting signs of toxicity.  Mexiletine serum levels are also obtainable. However, it is not a common practice and is expensive.
