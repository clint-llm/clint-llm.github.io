The management of radiation injury to the skin, especially grade 4 in which there are skin necrosis and full-thickness wounds, is complex with no accepted standards regarding specific modalities that are based upon irrefutable conclusions from RCT with a large number of patients. There are, however, accepted guidelines based on retrospective reviews that contain a small or large number of subjects. These reviews suggest, in general, that the treatment of radiation injuries, either acute, subacute or delayed, should follow good medical practices, with adaptations of known wound care principles to the problem at hand. For the management of full-thickness wounds due to delayed radiation injury, the accepted guidelines of management of necrotic tissue, prevention, and treatment of infections, management of wound exudate, and reevaluation of the treatment plan based upon observation of wound progress, should be coupled with patients education. This education should include everyday skin and wound care management and evaluation for methylxanthine derivatives in conjunction with hyperbaric oxygen treatment as well as the application of tissue containing stem cells, other live cells, as well as cytokines and growth factors, coupled with a healthy extracellular matrix.
