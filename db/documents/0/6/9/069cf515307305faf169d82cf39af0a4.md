The diagnosis of interstitial lung disease can be made with pulmonary function testing (PFT) demonstrating restrictive lung disease with diminished total lung capacity (TLC), decreased forced vital capacity (FVC), and impaired diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Reduction in forced vital capacity determines the severity of restrictive physiology. PFT is predominantly a guide of the severity of disease and response to treatment, and should not be used alone to diagnose interstitial lung disease as it is nonspecific.

A chest radiograph is often the first radiologic modality used in the investigation of interstitial lung disease, though it is insufficient in making a diagnosis. The X-ray may detect basilar reticulonodular infiltrates or cystic changes in various subtypes of interstitial lung disease, though many patients with interstitial lung disease may have an unremarkable study.

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest shows a variety of patterns in different interstitial lung diseases.

In nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, there are bilateral and generally symmetric ground-glass opacities and subpleural reticulation, occasionally with microcystic honeycombing, with subpleural sparing. Traction bronchiectasis or bronchiolectasis is a nearly universal feature in fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, as is lower-lobe architectural distortion. Cellular and fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia are ultimately distinguished only by histology.

Usual interstitial pneumonia may be indistinguishable from nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, with ground glass opacities and subpleural reticulation in an apicobasal gradient. Consolidation and honeycombing, however, are more common in usual interstitial pneumonia.

Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia is characterized by diffuse ground-glass opacities with thin-walled central or perivascular cysts. There may be centrilobular nodules, bronchovascular bundle thickening, and interlobular septal thickening.

Organizing pneumonia appears as patchy bilateral and peripheral consolidations and ground-glass opacities. Alveolar opacities may appear triangular, polygonal, or wedge-shaped in appearance, range in size from small nodules to mass-like consolidations, and expand or migrate over time. The atoll or reverse halo sign may be appreciated.

Diffuse alveolar damage demonstrates diffuse consolidation and ground-glass opacification, often with lobular sparing as well as traction bronchiectasis in later stages.

Acute or chronic aspiration, such as from esophageal dysmotility in systemic sclerosis or respiratory muscle weakness in polymyositis/dermatomyositis, may appear as centrilobular nodules, tree-in-bud opacities, and/or bronchial wall thickening.

In rheumatoid arthritis, irregular hyperattenuating areas represent intralobular lines and interlobular septal thickening. Honeycombing may be seen at the lung bases. CT patterns include subpleural reticulation or ground-glass opacities with or without honeycombing (nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, usual interstitial pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia), centrilobular branching structures with or without bronchial dilatation or traction bronchiectasis (usual interstitial pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia), and consolidation (cryptogenic organizing pneumonia). The reticular pattern predominates in early disease, whereas honeycombing and consolidation typically appear in progressive disease.

In systemic sclerosis, there may be evidence of interstitial pneumonitis and fibrosis involving the lower lobes in a peripheral and posterior distribution.

In systemic lupus erythematosus, ground-glass opacities and consolidations may reflect interstitial pneumonitis and fibrosis. Interstitial abnormalities, including interlobular septal thickening, irregular linear hyperattenuating areas, and architectural distortion may be seen in up to one-third of patients, and are commonly mild and focal.

In polymyositis and dermatomyositis, there may be prominent interlobular septa, ground-glass opacities, patchy consolidation, parenchymal bands, bronchial thickening, and subpleural lines. Consolidation with or without ground-glass opacification corresponds to cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or diffuse alveolar damage. Patchy consolidations, parenchymal bands, and bronchial thickening are reversible, while ground-glass opacities with subpleural lines representing usual interstitial pneumonia may progress to honeycombing.

In mixed connective tissue disease, abnormalities may include irregular linear hyperattenuating areas with reticulation at the lung bases. In the later stages of the disease, there may be honeycombing with fibrosis extending apically, as well as areas of consolidation that may be related to cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.

In Sjogren's syndrome, the most common findings on CT are bronchiolectasis and centrilobular nodular or branching linear hyperattenuating areas, ground-glass opacities, and honeycombing. The characteristic pattern of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia with extensive ground-glass opacification and thin-walled cysts may be seen. Poorly defined centrilobular nodules and bronchovascular thickening represent lymphoplasma cell infiltration of interstitial tissue.
