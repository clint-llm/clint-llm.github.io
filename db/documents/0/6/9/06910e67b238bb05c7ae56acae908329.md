The filling of root canals, commonly referred to as obturation, is a critical step in successful root canal treatment (RCT). The goals of obturation are twofold: to create an apical seal and fill the root canal without incorporating voids within the filling material.

The ability to adequately obturate a root canal is directly related to the preceding step of cleaning and shaping. Cleaning and shaping refer to the mechanical and chemical preparation of a root canal to remove organic and inorganic matter. A canal that has been poorly cleaned and shaped will result in equally poor obturation and is one of the strongest indicators of treatment failure.

Root canals are 3D structures with complex and unique anatomy, and no two are alike. Achieving a 3D obturation with complete coronal, lateral, and apical seals is essential for long-term success.

There are countless materials and techniques for obturation. Most techniques employ the use of a sealer and a core filling material in order to ensure complete obturation. This activity will discuss available sealers and proceed to core obturation materials.
