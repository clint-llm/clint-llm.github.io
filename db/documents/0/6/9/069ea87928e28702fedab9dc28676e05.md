Hamate fractures are rare and underreported. These injuries are usually misdiagnosed or confused with simple wrist sprains. Delayed diagnosis is not uncommon.

The hamate is a triangular-shaped bone that forms part of the distal carpal row, articulating with the capitate (radially), triquetrum (proximally), and fifth and fourth metacarpals (distally).

Considering its unique anatomy (Figure 1), hamate fractures usually get subdivided into two broad groups: hook fractures and body fractures.

Classification of hamate fractures:

- Type 1: Hook of the hamate fracture

- Type 2: Body of the hamate fracture

- 2a: Coronal (may be dorsal oblique or splitting fracture)
- 2b: Transverse fracture

Associated hook fracture injuries:

- Ulnar artery injury

- Ulnar nerve injury

Associated body fracture Injuries:

- Fourth and fifth metacarpal fracture-dislocation

- Greater arc perilunate fracture-dislocation
