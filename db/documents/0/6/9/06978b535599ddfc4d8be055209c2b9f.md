The pulmonary veins begin development around two months of fetal gestation. Pouching of the dorsal wall of the dorsal mesocardium, which later develops into the left atria, gives rise to the common primitive pulmonary vein. During this time the common primitive pulmonary vein is still in connection to the systemic circulatory system. The primitive pulmonary vein then undergoes canalization into four independent and asymmetrical pulmonary veins, which connect the primitive intraparenchymal pulmonary network to the primitive left atria.
