Many factors can compromise fascial integrity, including aging, genetics, and surgery. Dysfunctions in fascia may result in clinical conditions due to altered structure and functional properties. There exist two main categories of fascial dysfunction; lack of fascial stiffness and an increase in fascial stiffness.

Lack of fascial stiffness can be seen in inguinal, abdominal, femoral, and incisional hernias. Increased fascial stiffness can be seen in Dupuytren contracture, adhesive capsulitis, and Peyronie disease. Genetic conditionsÂ leading to widespread fascia laxity include Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome.
