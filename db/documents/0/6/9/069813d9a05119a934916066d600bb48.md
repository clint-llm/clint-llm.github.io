Viral meningitis can occur at age any but is most common in younger age groups. Because of the lack of apparent distinguishing features between viral and bacterial meningitis on initial presentation, an interprofessional team with strong medical knowledge and open communication is essential in providing appropriate care to these patients. Pharmacists can recommend empiric antibiotic coverage until there is confirmation of a diagnosis of viral meningitis. Nurses who look after patients with viral meningitis should know the disorder, what potential complications can arise, and when to call the clinician. The treatment of viral meningitis, for the most part, is supportive but residual sequelae of the disease are not uncommon; hence follow up with the primary care provider, and nurse practitioner is necessary. Interprofessional collaboration is crucial for optimal results in the management of viral meningitis, as with any condition. [Level 5]
