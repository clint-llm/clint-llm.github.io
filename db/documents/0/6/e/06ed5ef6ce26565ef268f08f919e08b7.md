Patient education on palatal cancer can be challenging due to the heterogeneous array of pathologic histologies and the need for multidisciplinary and multimodal management. Patients and their families should be educated on the different treatment options and timelines, including surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy as well as reconstructive surgery for large palatal defects.

Patients and parents (for minors) should be counseled on the possible risks and complications of all treatment modalities and their comorbidities fully assessed by their primary care physicians to determine if they will be candidates for surgical resection. Cessation counseling for social risk factors such as smoking and alcohol must be provided to reduce the risk of recurrent cancer and poor treatment outcomes. The importance of long-term follow up is crucial for oral malignancies given the high recurrence rates and indolent growth patterns of certain pathologies and must be emphasized to patients.
