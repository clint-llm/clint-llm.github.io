The history and physical examination are very important in the diagnosis of HHS. In many instances, there is a significant overlap in the signs and symptoms seen in HHS and DKA. In the history taking andÂ the initial assessment, particular attention should be focused on the insulin regimen, missed dosages of oral hypoglycemic agents, overconsumption of carbohydrate-rich diet, or simultaneous use of medications that can trigger hyperglycemia or cause dehydration.

If an infectious process precedes HHS, signs and symptoms include:

- Fever

- Malaise

- General weakness

- Tachypnea

- Tachycardia

If the precipitating factor is a cardiac or vascular condition, signs and symptoms will include:

- Chest pain

- Chest tightness

- Headache

- Dizziness

- Palpitations

The typical clinical presentation of patients with HHS is increased urination (polyuria) and increased water intake (polydipsia). This is a result of the stimulation of the thirst center in the brain from severe dehydration and increased serum osmolarity. Weakness, malaise, and lethargy can also be part of the complaints.

Severe dehydration from HHS can also affect the skin and integumentary system. Typically, the skin and the oral mucosa are dry with a delayed capillary refill.

The most important distinguishing factor in HHS is the presence of neurological signs. Decreased cerebral blood flow from severe dehydration can cause:

- Focal neurological deficit

- Disturbance in visual acuity

- Delirium

- Coma

A system-based approach is necessary for the physical assessment:

- General appearance: Patients with HHS are generally ill-appearing with altered mental status

- Cardiovascular: Tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, weak and thready pulse

- Respiratory: Rate can be normal, but tachypnea might be present if acidosis is profound

- Skin: Delayed capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and skin tenting might not be present even in severe dehydration because of obesity

- Genitourinary: Decreased urine output

- Central Nervous System (CNS): Focal neurological deficit, lethargy with low Glasgow coma score, and in severe cases of HHS, the patient might be comatose.

The physical examination should also focus on other comorbidities associated with diabetes mellitus. Acanthosis nigricans, oral thrush, vulvovaginitis, and multiple pustular skin lesions might all indicate poor glycemic control. This is particularly important if HHS is the initial presentation of type 2 diabetes.
