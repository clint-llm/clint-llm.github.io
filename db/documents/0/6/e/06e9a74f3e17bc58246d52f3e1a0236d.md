During a left hemicolectomy, the inferior mesenteric artery is usually ligated near its take-off from the abdominal aorta.

There is some debate regarding the location of ligation of the IMA during a rectal resection. A high-tie approach involves ligation of the IMA near the origin of the aorta. A low-tie approach involves ligation distal to the origin of the left colic artery. Ligation of the IMA near its’ origin has shown to decrease perfusion to the splenic flexure significantly. This situation can cause anastomotic leakage after restorative rectal excision with anastomosis. Care must be taken to ensure good perfusion on both sides of colonic anastomosis.

During the repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, the inferior mesenteric may be reimplanted into the aortic graft if there are no collaterals. After clamping the aorta, the inferior mesenteric artery may continue to perfuse if there are collaterals. In such cases, the inferior mesenteric artery can be ligated. In the postoperative period, rectal bleeding and abdominal pain may be signs of ischemic colitis if the inferior mesenteric artery is not reimplanted. An urgent sigmoidoscopy is recommended if one suspects an ischemic bowel.
