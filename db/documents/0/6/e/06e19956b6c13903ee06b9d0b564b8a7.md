Infection is a serious complication of compartment syndrome and fasciotomy. In one study, 11 out of 24 patients with surgical decompression developed infections. Infection can become chronic. Other complications include hematomas and seromas, peripheral nerve injury, and deep vein thrombosis.

The recurrence of symptoms ranges from 2% to 17% in published studies. This may be due to incomplete release of the fascial layers, failure to release all of the appropriate compartments, or fascial scarring. Thus, some patients may require revision.
