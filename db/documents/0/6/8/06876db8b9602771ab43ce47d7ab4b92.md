More than one billion adults worldwide have hypertension with up to 45% of the adult populace being affected with the disease

In the year 2010, the global health survey reportÂ was published in Lancet, which comprised of patient data from 67 countries, reported Hypertension as the leading cause of death and disability-adjusted life years worldwide since the year 1990.

In the United States, HTN alone accounts for more cardiovascular disease-related deaths than any other modifiable risk factor and is second only to cigarette smoking as a preventable cause of death for any reason.

Recent estimates have suggested the number of patients with hypertension could increase as much as by 15 to 20%, which could reach close to 1.5 billion by 2025.
