The diagnosis of rapid eye movement behavior disorder comprises two features: loss of normal atonia during REM sleep and dream enactment behavior. The suspicion of RBD is usually due to presentation consistent with dream enactment behavior. The diagnosis requires however confirmation with in-lab polysomnography (PSG) with video recording.

The presence of isolated RSWA is considered an incidental finding in normal individuals, especially in patients receiving antidepressant therapy (SSRI)

The scoring of ESWA requires at least 1 of the following features developed by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM):

– Sustained muscle activity in the chin EMG during the REM sleep stage.

– Excessive transient muscle activity in the chin or limb EMG during REM sleep.

The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3 ed., states that diagnostic criteria for RBD must include the following:

- Repeated episodes of sleep-related behaviors such as vocalization and/or complex motor behaviors.

- Documenting behaviors by polysomnography during REM sleep or based on clinical history.

- Recordings of polysomnography that demonstrate REM sleep without atonia via submental or limb leads

- Behaviors are not better explained by another sleep disorder, mental disorder, medication, substance use, or epilepsy.

Validated questionnaires have been established to screen patients for RBD. Two single-question questionnaires have been established; the Mayo Sleep Questionnaire and the RBD1Q. The Mayo sleep question was tested in the general population and queried the bed partners (sensitivity 98% and specificity 74%); it asks “Have you ever seen the patient appear to ‘act out his or her dreams’ (punched or flailed arms in the air, shouted, or screamed) while sleeping?”
