Rapid eye movement behavior disorder exhibits abnormal behaviors during REM sleep that may disrupt sleep and injury. Dream-enactment is the most distinct abnormal behavior associated with RBD characterized by purposeful movements during REM sleep with or without vocalization linked to a dream. These sleep-related movements could be violent and lead to self-injuries or injuries to the bed partner. These complex behavior could result in walking out of bed or falling. Symptoms are usually associated with enacting undesirable or violent dreams where the patient is attacked, chased, or compromised. The patient often wakes up abruptly with prompt alertness and can recount the dream coherently. More than half of the patients are usually aware of their dream-enactment behaviors.

Acute forms of RBD can be exhibited with intense REM sleep rebound due to withdrawal effects from REM suppressing drugs. These include alcohol, sedative-hypnotic medications, drug intoxication, or antidepressants.
