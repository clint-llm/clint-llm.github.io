Managing insufficient sleep requires extending total sleep time to the amount needed for age. The underlying etiology involves an inadequate opportunity to sleep; hence increasing total sleep time requires lifestyle changes and cognitive and behavioral interventions to allow an adequate opportunity to sleep. These interventions help promote sleep quality and duration in patients reporting poor sleep without a diagnosed sleep disorder.

Sleep hygieneÂ education involves avoiding caffeine, nicotine, or alcohol close to bedtime, regular bedtimes, and waketimes, and avoiding daytime naps.

Similarly, nicotine stimulates cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain promoting wakefulness and is associated with sleep disruption and a reduced total sleep time.

Regular exercise is recommended as a part of sleep hygiene education and has increased total sleep time and slow-wave sleep.
