Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoma, accounting for about 25% to 30% of all the non-Hodgkin lymphomas. It typically presents as a rapidly growing mass or enlarging lymph nodes in a nodal or extranodal site. Though aggressive, they do respond well to six cycles of rituximab along with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of DLBCL and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of the B cell lymphomas.
- Review the workup of the patients with lymphoma.
- Outlines the treatment of B cell lymphomas, as it depends not only on their staging but also on the type of the disease (indolent or aggressive) and the molecular subtype. 

- Summarize the role of the interprofessional team members in optimizing collaboration and communication to ensure patients with DLBCL receive high-quality care, which will lead to better outcomes.
