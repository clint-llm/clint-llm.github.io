In female patients with dysuria, differential diagnoses include vaginitis and urethritis. Vaginitis is usually associated with vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, and pruritus. Its causes include bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, or yeast infection. Painful bladder syndrome may be considered in patients with persistent symptoms of bladder discomfort but with no evidence of infectious etiology. This is, however, a diagnosis of exclusion. Prostatitis must be ruled out in men with lower UTI symptoms, especially when associated with fever, malaise, perineal pain, or obstructive urinary symptoms. Recurrent UTIs in male patients should heighten suspicion of chronic bacterial prostatitis.

- **Painful bladder syndrome**- No evidence of infection (pyuria, bacteriuria, positive urine cultures) but symptoms of frequency, urgency, and dysuria.; it is usually a diagnosis of exclusion.

- **Pelvic inflammatory disease**- This is associated with pelvic and lower abdominal pain, fever, and possible cervical discharge.

- **Prostatitis**- May present with ejaculatory pain and/or vague pelvic discomfort along with a soft, boggy, tender prostate on rectal exam. Urinalysis is usually negative.

- **Vaginitis**- Usually associated with vaginal discharge, itching, odor, dyspareunia, and possibly dysuria. Typically no urinary urgency or frequency.

- **Vaginitis, atrophic (hormonal)**- This condition presents in post-menopausal womenÂ and is associated with vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, vaginal discharge (thin, watery), pale labia, and vaginal lining.

- **Urethritis**- White cells (pyuria) present on urinalysis but no bacteriuria. Sexually active women are at high risk.
