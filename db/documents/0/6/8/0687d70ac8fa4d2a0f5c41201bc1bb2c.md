Simulation is well suited to provide continuing medical education (CME). It is more engaging and effective for learners because it is in-person and uses multiple media to teach a concept or skill (e.g., usually a didactic lecture followed by simulated practice). And since it more closely approximates clinical practice than traditional CME, clinical outcomes are more likely to be affected.
