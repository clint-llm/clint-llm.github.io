Cavernous sinus aneurysms are most common in the elderly population and often present with an indolent ophthalmoplegia. The morbidity of these aneurysms is limited, and many patients do not require treatment. However, in select patients, endovascular occlusion is an option. It is important to note that cavernous sinus aneurysms are not malignant lesions, and the majority of affected individuals are asymptomatic. Hence good clinical judgment is required in the management of these lesions. This activity examines when cavernous sinus aneurysms should be considered, how to properly evaluate this condition, and the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of cavernous sinus aneurysms.
- Review the evaluation of cavernous sinus aneurysms.
- Summarize the treatment options for cavernous sinus aneurysms.
- Outline the importance of communication and coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients with cavernous sinus aneurysms.
