The uterine artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery (IIA).  The IIA has two divisions, each with multiple branches:

**Anterior Division**

- Obturator artery

- Superior vesical artery

- Vaginal (females)/inferior vesical (males) artery

- Middle rectal artery

- Internal pudendal artery

- Inferior gluteal artery

- Uterine artery (UA)

Variations in this organization can occur.  For example, the vaginal artery may arise from the uterine artery itself.

**Posterior Division**

- Superior gluteal artery

- Lateral sacral artery

- Iliolumbar artery

The uterine artery is typically the first branch of the IIA anterior division, whereas the dominant (largest) branch of the IIA anterior division is usually the inferior gluteal artery.  Five distinct IIA branching patterns have been described.  The most common is as described above.  The second most common is a trifurcation of the IIA into the UA, the IIA anterior division, and the IIA posterior division.

The UA has three segments.  Its first segment descends along the pelvic sidewall to the broad ligament.  The second segment courses transversely toward the abdominal midline.  As it reaches the uterus, it again turns, and the third segment ascends the uterine sidewall.  Thus, the segments are termed the descending, transverse, and ascending segments.  The descending segment has no side branches.  A branch termed the cervicovaginal branch usually arises from the mid to distal transverse segment, but it can arise from the ascending segment.  From the ascending segment, numerous branches course over the surface of the uterus and in turn give rise to numerous arterioles that perforate the myometrium.  Arterioles supplying individual fibroids are usually too small to be seen or to be catheterized.

Communication (anastomosis) between the UA and the ovarian artery (OA) can be demonstrated in almost half of female cadavers, but during angiography this anastomosis is visible about 10% of the time.  A classification for OA-UA anastomoses has been proposed.

- Flow from the OA into the descending or transverse UA is the most common (type 1).

- An OA branch can bypass the main UA to an ascending UA branch supplying a fibroid (type 2).

- In about 1 out of 20 women, an OA is absent, and the ovary itself is supplied by the UA (type 3).

Conversely, the OAs (instead of the IIA) rarely can supply the uterus directly with no UA derived from the IIA (which is not alotted a type number but is similar to type 1).  There are other rarer variants as well. The OAs  typically arise from the aorta a few centimeters below the origins of the renal arteries.  Their courses are often too tortuous to insert a standard catheter for more than a few centimeters.  The importance of the OAs in the management of patients underoing embolization is discussed below.
