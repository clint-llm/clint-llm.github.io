The classical LB are spherical hyaline eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions (8 to 30 micrometer-diameter) comprising concentric lamellar bands surrounded by a pale-stained halo of 10 nm of wide radiating fibrils. Cortical LBs are difficult to find under the microscope, chemically eosinophilic, rounded, angular, without a halo. Additionally, cortical LBs are disorganized, granulofibrillary structures composed of 10- to 27-nm wide filaments, without a central core. They concentrate in lower cortical layers, with recorded accumulation in the hippocampus, insular cortex, amygdala, and sometimes cingulate gyrus. Similar lesions, rounded areas of granular, pale-staining eosinophilic material displacing neuromelanin (NM) in brainstem neurons are precursors of LBs.  As described, the alpha-synuclein is the best marker to detect LBs. Antibodies that recognize N-terminal epitopes (synucleins 505, 506, and 514) selectively detect a-Syn.
