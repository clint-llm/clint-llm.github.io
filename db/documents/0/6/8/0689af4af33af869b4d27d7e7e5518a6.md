Evaluation of the eye to assess for a globe injury after trauma is possible once an assessment of the patient’s airway, breathing, and circulation has taken place. Patients will often have decreased visual acuity, and this can be assessed using a Snellen chart or near card. In patients with severe visual impairment, acuity evaluation is by the patient's ability to count fingers (CF), see a moving hand (HM), or flashes of light (LP). Inspection of the eye using a slit lamp enhances the ability to detect penetrating foreign bodies, scleral or corneal lacerations, uveal prolapse, or iris abnormalities such as peaked or “tear-drop” pupil. A Seidel sign may also be present when performing fluorescein staining of the cornea and sclera as a stream of clear aqueous fluid originating from the globe wound site, although the globe can be open even if this sign is negative.

A maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) scan can aid in the management of globe rupture, although it should never replace an ophthalmic evaluation.
