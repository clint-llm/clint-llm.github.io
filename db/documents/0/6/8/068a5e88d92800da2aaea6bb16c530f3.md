The glenohumeral joint is a complex joint that lacks innate stability; the humeral head relies heavily on the ligaments of the shoulder and the rotator cuff to maintain stability.  The humeral head stabilizes against the glenoid fossa, which is the lateral articular extension of the scapula.

The glenoid fossa fractures are often associated with other injuries and are the result of blunt trauma or high-velocity sporting injuries where the humeral head forcefully abuts the glenoid fossa.
