According to the drug manufacturer's package insert, there are reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions with alogliptin, including anaphylaxis.

- Stevens-Johnson syndrome

- Hepatic failure

- Heart failure (alogliptin and saxagliptin; FDA drug safety communication bulletin)

- Alogliptin is not associated with an increase in cardiovascular event risk

- Tubulointerstitial nephritis

- Pancreatitis

- Severe or even disabling arthralgia (DPP-4 inhibitor class effect; FDA drug safety communication bulletin - see below for additional details)

- Hypoglycemia; typically mild

- Bullous pemphigoid - see below for additional details

- Rhabdomyolysis

More common reactions include nasopharyngitis, which occurred in 4.4% of patients, while a headache and upper respiratory tract infection both occurred in 4.2% of patients. Renal function abnormalities appeared to occur more often in patients with high CV risk (3% without CV risk versus 23% with CV risk).

One concern related to adverse events includes arthralgias. The FDA cautioned in 2015 that treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors might cause serious arthralgias. In a meta-analysis published in 2017 evaluating 67 randomized controlled trials, there was a suggestion of a significantly increased risk of overall arthralgia (p = 0.003) but a non-significant increase in serious arthralgias (p = 0.20). The benefits of glycemic control versus the risk of arthralgia should be a factor when prescribing DPP-4 inhibitors, including alogliptin.

Bullous pemphigoid (a cutaneous autoimmune blistering disorder) is also a reported side effect of DPP-4 inhibitor use. Cases have typically resolved following discontinuation of the offending drug and topical or immunosuppressive therapy. If patients develop blisters, they should be advised to stop the DPP-4 inhibitor and seek care from a dermatologist.

Baseline liver function tests are a recommendation because reports exist of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in postmarketing surveillance. Ruling out underlying liver disease may be warranted.

There are case reports of pancreatitis, and alogliptin should be discontinued immediately if pancreatitis is suspected.

Alogliptin is not associated with weight gain like some other oral glycemic control medications.
