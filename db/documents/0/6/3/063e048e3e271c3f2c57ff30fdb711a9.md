There are higher rates of sinusitis in the South, Midwest, and among women. Children younger than 15 years of age and adults aged 25 to 64 years are affected the most.

Other risk factors or sinusitis include

- Anatomic defects such as septal deviations, polyps, conchae bullosa, other trauma, and fractures involving the sinuses or the facial area surrounding them

- Impaired mucous transport from diseases such as cystic fibrosis, ciliary dyskinesia

- Immunodeficiency from chemotherapy, HIV, diabetes mellitus, etc.

- Body positioning, intensive care unit (ICU) patients due to prolonged supine positioning that compromises mucociliary clearance.

- Rhinitis medicamentosa, toxic rhinitis, nasal cocaine abuse, barotrauma, foreign bodies

- Prolonged oxygen use due to drying of the mucosal lining

- Patients with nasogastric or nasotracheal tubes
