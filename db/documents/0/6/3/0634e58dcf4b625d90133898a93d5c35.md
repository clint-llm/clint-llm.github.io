Late decelerations are the most precarious decelerations among all types. Persistent and recurrent late decelerations need immediate, meticulous assessment to evaluate the cause and to rule out fetal acidemia.

The three-tier fetal heart rate tracing system is one of the valuable means in classifying the severity of the fetal oxygenation status.

- **Category I**is defined as with a baseline rate of 110 to 160 beats per minute, moderate baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) variability (amplitude 6 to 25 bpm), accelerations and early decelerations may be either present or absent, and no late or variable decelerations

- **Category III**is defined as fetal heart rate pattern with absent variability, recurrent variable,Â and late decelerations, bradycardia, or sinusoidal pattern

- **Category II**any other FHR pattern that does not qualify for Category I or III

Foremost, the entire fetal heart rate tracing requires evaluation, which includes assessing the uterine activity for tachysystole, presence or absence of variability, and accelerations.
