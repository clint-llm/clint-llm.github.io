Because CO is an odorless, tasteless, and non-irritating gas in a poorly ventilated area, people exposed to CO can quickly succumb to its toxicity. The result is a loss of consciousness and eventually death. Poisoning can be intentional, unintentional, or for unknown reasons. It is always best to be suspicious of attempted suicide until a complete history and further patient observation determine the cause of the poisoning. Unintentional poisoning is seasonal and weather-related; for example, during winter, cold spells, and after natural disasters when electric power service is interrupted, and people are inclined to run generators or heaters in enclosed areas, poisonings are more common. Cases of poisoning can occur because of faulty stoves, charcoal grills, and improperly ventilated or defective furnaces or heaters used indoors. Cases can often be clustered when entire families or many workers come down with similar symptoms of toxicity.
