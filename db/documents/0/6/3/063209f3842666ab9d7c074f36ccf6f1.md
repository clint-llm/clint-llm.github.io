The anatomy of the vulva includes the mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, vestibule, vestibular bulb, and the greater vestibular glands. The internal and external pudendal arteries are responsible for most of the vulvar blood supply. The ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, and pudendal nerves are responsible for the innervation of the vulvar tissue. Vulvar lymphatic drainage is via the inguinal lymph nodes. The first lymphatic chain encountered are the superficial inguinal nodes, then after crossing through the cribriform fascia, lymphatic drainage is to the deep inguinal nodes, followed by the external iliac nodes, and finally the paraaortic nodes. History of vulvar illness may include pruritis, irritation, or pain, but the patient can also be asymptomatic. Most patients with vulvar melanoma present with advanced symptoms, including bleeding, mass, and ulceration.

Approximately 25% of vulvar melanomas are amelanotic, making diagnosis difficult in many patients.

A physical exam may show an erythematous lesion, a scaly patch, plaques, or ulcer, or an ill-defined mass. Lesions of verrucous carcinoma commonly have a cauliflower-like appearance. Any suspicious lesions warrant further investigation, including a pelvic exam, speculum exam, colposcopy of vulva and vagina, and biopsy.
