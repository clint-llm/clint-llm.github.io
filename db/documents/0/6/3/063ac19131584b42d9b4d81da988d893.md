Renal calculi are the products of abnormal crystallization of sediments in the urine. Although the acute interventions for all types of stones are similar, the diagnosis and management of the underlying conditions will vary and may indicate a metabolic or genetic disorder. Calcium oxalate stones are the most common type of renal calculi and result from an imbalance between the urinary levels of calcium and oxalate or a lack of urinary stone inhibitors. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of hyperoxaluria and highlights the interprofessional team's role in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the predisposing factors for developing calcium oxalate renal calculi.
- Describe the etiology of primary and secondary hyperoxalurias.
- Review the different parameters of treatment for patients with hyperoxaluria.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by renal calculi and hyperoxaluria.
