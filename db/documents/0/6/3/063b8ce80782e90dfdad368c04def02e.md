HLA antigens can be variable, and researchers have investigated their presence and function to determine their use in disease diagnosis and treatment. HLA polymorphisms can change depending on the epidemiological composition of a particular population, so this presents an importantÂ area of research to further delve into as technology progresses. Studies can be performed on specific demographics of humans to find out more about the presence of particular diseases that have a predilection in certain groups. For example, in 2018, a trial was conducted in Thailand to evaluate the efficacy of a Dengue vaccine. The HLA antigens were mapped in the population, and researchers identified 201 different HLA antigens through next-generation sequencing techniques. Through this investigation, researchers identified HLA alleles with higher frequencies in the population and could incorporate that information and begin applying it to disease association in the population.
