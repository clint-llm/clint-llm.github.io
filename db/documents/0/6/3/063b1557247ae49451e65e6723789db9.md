Ablative laser resurfacing is a useful tool to produce cosmetic improvements for photoaging, scarring, and superficial skin lesions. The CO2 and Er:YAG lasers remain the workhorse modalities for ablative treatments; energy delivery should be personalized based on patient goals and expectations, such as degree of change desired and length of recovery tolerated, as well as individual physiological and anatomical factors, such as degree of skin pigmentation and history of scarring. Compared to full field lasers, fractional lasers represent a less aggressive modality that can shorten recovery times while providing a similar therapeutic effect. Overall, ablative laser therapy represents a primary means by which cosmetic physicians can provide safe, effective non-surgical facial rejuvenation.
