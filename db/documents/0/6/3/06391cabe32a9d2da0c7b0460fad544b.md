Most patients with SFN experience a slowly progressive course, with a clinical plateau reached following years of symptom development. One study showed only 13% of 124 patients with SFN had developed signs of large-fiber involvement over a two-year period.

This same study found that none of the patients developed Charcot joints, weakness, sensory ataxia, or foot ulcers, which are symptoms typically seen in patients with chronic or severe large fiber neuropathy. It additionally found that over half of the patients either improved or remained stable over the two years. Further studies would be useful in evaluating symptomatic progression over a period longer than two years.
