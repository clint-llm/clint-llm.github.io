Trophoblast cells are the first cells to differentiate from the fertilized ovum: they supply the embryo with nutrients and eventually form the fetal share of the placenta. The placental trophoblasts are made of cytotrophoblasts, syncytiotrophoblasts, and intermediate trophoblasts. The placental trophoblasts are the origin of molar pregnancies and gestational trophoblastic neoplasias.

GTN represents the malignant transformation of trophoblastic cells.Â While the cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts make the hydatidiform moles and choriocarcinoma and PSTTs along with ETTs arise from intermediate trophoblasts.
