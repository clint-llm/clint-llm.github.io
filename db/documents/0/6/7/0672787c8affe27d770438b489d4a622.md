Water constitutes about two-thirds of the human body. In an adult man weighing 70 kg, the body water content is about 42L. This water content is divided into two major compartments:

- Intracellular fluid (ICF): It forms about 28 L (about 40% of total body weight)

- Extracellular fluid (ECF): It forms about 14 L (about 20% of total body weight), of which 15% is interstitial fluid and 5% is plasma

Plasma can be measured using marker substances like radioactive iodine (131 I) and Evans blue (T-1824). Evans blue is the commonly used marker substance (aka tracer) since it binds strongly with albumin. The concept behind using a tracer is to use one that is well distributed in the compartment of interest. A known amount of tracer is introduced into the compartment, and its volume of distribution is measured.

- 
**Volume = Amount of Tracer/Concentration of Tracer
**

Compartment volumes are measured based on the volume of distribution of tracer. When measuring plasma volume, the albumin-bound tracer, i.e., Evans blue, is used. As albumin tends to continuously leak out of the circulation, the tracer concentration is measured at serial intervals and is plotted on a logarithmic curve. This curve is then extrapolated to identify a “zero time” that allows the estimation of a virtual volume of distribution. The volume of distribution measured is the volume of plasma.
