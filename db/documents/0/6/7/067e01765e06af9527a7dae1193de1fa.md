Anticoagulation therapy is most commonly indicated in the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and after placement of prosthetic heart valves. Patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary interventions are typically on dual antithrombotic therapy, as well as patients with a past medical history of stroke, coronary artery by-pass grafting and essential thrombocytosis could require antithrombotic therapy.
