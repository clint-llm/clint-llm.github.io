TA is a complex vascular disorder that has no cure. It is best managed with an interprofessional team that includes a vascular surgeon, radiologist, cardiologist, internist, neurologist, and nephrologist. A nurse should provide assistance with and coordination of patient education. While isolated lesions may be stented, long lesions may require a bypass. Some patients may benefit from steroids and other immunosuppressive agents. These patients will need long term monitoring for adverse side effects of the drugs by the nurse practitioner and primary care provider. The prognosis of patients with TA is guarded.
