Suspicion for rectal injury should increase with any identification of penetrating wound to the lower abdomen, pelvis, perineum, buttocks, or thighs. With the identification of trauma to this region, the differential diagnosis must include intra-peritoneal vs. extraperitoneal rectal injury, vascular injury, bladder injury. Nearly any major vasculature or viscera may be injured and subsequently must be excluded with the identification of a penetrating injury.
