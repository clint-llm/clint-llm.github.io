A felon is an infection that occurs within the closed-space compartments of the fingertip pulp. The infection may initially start as cellulitis which can progress to abscess formation if not treated early. The compartments of the fingertip are divided by vertical fascial strands known as ‘septae’ which run from the periosteum of the distal phalanx to the skin. These fibrous septae provide structural support to the pulp and form small compartments. Blood flow may be compromised when edema and infection form in these non-compliant compartments which in turn can lead to skin and pulp necrosis. The swelling in these small compartments causes the severe pain associated with felons. Septae may also impede complete drainage after and an incision and drainage procedure if they are not properly separated. If not properly treated, felons can progress to osteomyelitis, tenosynovitis, and septic arthritis.
