Doxazosin may not be a drug that providers find themselves prescribing daily. However, it has a few key contexts where it proves to be a valuable tool for health care workers in the treatment of BPH, hypertension, ureteral stones, and PTSD-associated nightmares. Doxazosin is a medication that requires titration to an effective dose and tolerance. As such, interprofessional healthcare teams need to monitor patients closely upon the initiation and titration of therapy, starting with the prescribing clinician. The extended-release formulation of doxazosin has the benefit of once-daily dosing and more stable serum concentrations. Nurses can serve as the initial point of contact for patient questions and provide initial counseling on using the drug, dosing, and what to watch for regarding possible adverse reactions. This dosing regimen reduces the incidence of orthostatic hypotension and various other adverse effects. Because doxazosin has many drug-drug interactions, it may be helpful for a pharmacist to review the different medications that a patient is on before initiating therapy. These examples of interprofessional teamwork show how such an approach can lead to improved patient outcomes with doxazosin. [Level 5]
