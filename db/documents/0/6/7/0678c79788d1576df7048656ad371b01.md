The most common complications of the surgical treatment of bladder exstrophy are wound dehiscence and bladder dehiscence. Complete dehiscence can cause bladder prolapse. It can be prevented by adequate mobilization of the flaps and by incorporating osteotomy during bladder turn-in, thus reducing the tension over the abdominal wall and bladder plate.

**Other complications:**painful micturition or dysuria: this is very common after open bladder surgeries and is due to bladder spasms, wound infection, urethral obstruction: this complication has reduced over time as the use of paraexstrophy flaps has declined. When urethral obstruction or stricture occurs, the first step is to perform urethral dilatation. Urethrocutenous fistula, urethral stricture, loss of hemiglans/corpora, and persistent dorsal chordee: These complications usually occur after epispadias repair. Persistent incontinence, urinary tract infection (UTI), and bladder stones: These complications occur after bladder neck reconstruction. Osteotomy complications: risk of malignancy: There is a 1-2% risk of development of malignancy of the bladder. Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of malignancy seen in patients of bladder exstrophy. It has been shown that this can develop in even the unrepaired bladders.
