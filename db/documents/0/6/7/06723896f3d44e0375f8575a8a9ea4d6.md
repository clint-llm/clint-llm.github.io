The pharmacologic management of the ossification of the longitudinal ligament is still not established. Standard treatment is surgical decompression of the spinal cord. The surgical management is done either by anterior decompression or by posterior decompression in modern medical practices.

- Physiological kyphosis in the thoracic region

- The thoracic region of the spinal cord is the watershed region, which predisposes to ischemic change.

Even after the surgical treatment, there may be chances of re-progression of ossification. So for young patients without any neurological deficits, strict radiological follow-up is recommended. For those with progressive deficits, surgery is the only way of treatment.
