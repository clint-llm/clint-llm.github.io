On evaluation, imaging for any suspected trauma according to ATLS protocol as well as labs to assess end-organ health, electrolyte status, and nutritional status including complete blood count, complete metabolic profile, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, and pre-albumin should be obtained. A urine drug screen in this patient population is important as well as a pregnancy test for women of childbearing age. Elevated carboxyhemoglobin levels can indicate carbon monoxide poisoning and give insight into possible inhalation injury and impending respiratory failure. However, be aware that the half-life of carboxyhemoglobin has been shown to be four hours or shorter in a patient on 100% oxygen, and therefore low levels taken several hours after injury do not necessarily rule out inhalation injury.
