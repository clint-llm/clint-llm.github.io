The complication unique to toric IOL implantation is IOL misalignment. IOL alignment is influenced by various factors, including marking technique, capsulorhexis size, coverage of IOL edge by rhexis margins, corneal incision sealing at the end of the surgery, rotational stability of IOL, and surgeon experience.

IOL misalignment may occur secondary to either incorrect calculation of the IOL axis, incorrect placement of the IOL intraoperatively, or due to postoperative rotation. When the misalignment exceeds 30 degrees, it may induce a cylindrical power in a new meridian. One degree of misalignment leads to a 3% loss of effective power, and 30 degrees of misalignment results in the loss of the entire toric effect with significantly worse visual acuity.

Postoperative IOL rotation may occur as early as one hour to up to ten days post-surgery. Incomplete removal of the viscoelastic from the bag results in early postoperative rotation, and late postoperative rotations may occur due to IOL design, rhexis extension, large bag size, axial length, and inadequate coverage of IOL by the rhexis margins. With-the-rule astigmatisms were associated with a higher rate of postoperative rotations.

Realignment of the IOL has to be considered in cases with more than 10 degrees of malalignment. An intraoperative marking indicates the new target axis in relation to the current misaligned axis. A side port incision is made, and a long cannula is mounted on a syringe filled with the balanced salt solution is used to rotate the IOL to the desired position.

The complications inherent to routine phacoemulsification may be encountered while or after the surgery for implanting toric IOLs.

**Intraoperative Complications**
