Staging is a process in oncology that allows health care providers to determine the extent of disease burden from its primary locations.

It should be known that malignant lymphadenopathy can occur from both primary lymphomas or from metastatic cancer.

Most, but not all, cancers use the tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging system. A tumor refers to the primary involvement by the neoplasm and the depth of involvement. Node describes the local lymph nodes that are involved by the disease process, and metastasis defines distant sites of involvement.

The staging of non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma is based on the Lugano classification, which is based on the Ann Arbor system.

- Stage I: Lymphoma found in 1 lymph node or in only one lymphoid organ

- Stage II: Lymphoma is found in 2 or more groups of lymph nodes on the ipsilateral side of the diaphragm

- Stage II: Lymphoma involvement bilaterally in reference to the diaphragm

- Stage IV: Lymphoma has metastasized to one organ beyond the lymphatic system
