**Helicobacter Pylori Eradication**

There have been numerous studies assessing the role of eradication therapy on chronic atrophic and non-atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer. In one meta-analysis, eradication therapy significantly improved the histological (OLGA/OLGIM) grading of gastric atrophy in the corpus and antrum and intestinal metaplasia in the antrum (but not corpus).

There may be a significant improvement in the risk of developing intestinal GC by H. pylori eradication. In two other meta-analyses, H. pylori eradication significantly reduced the risk of GC but not chronic atrophic gastritis and IM.H. pylori eradication therapy is recommended in individuals endoscopically treated for superficial gastric neoplasia. This reduces the metachronous recurrence of GC by almost half.

In summary, H. pylori eradication has an essential role in histological downstaging and may have a role in the reduction of progression to GC.

**COX Inhibitors**

Even though cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (COX-1 or COX-2) have been shown to slow down the progression of precancerous gastric conditions, and in theory, reduce the risk of GC, there is not enough statistical evidence from trials to recommend them for prevention.

**Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs**

There is some evidence of the beneficial effect of NSAIDs and aspirin in slowing down the progression of gastric precancerous lesions after H. pylori eradiation from previous trials. Still, the effect is small to recommend it as a guideline. Further research is required to study the effects of NSAIDs on GPLs. Low dose aspirin may be safer to use and provide other systemic benefits, for example, in cardiovascular disease, but any benefit should be reviewed against the known gastrointestinal effects.

**Other Drugs**

Moluodan, a Chinese herbal medicine, reported in an RCT in individuals with dysplasia downgraded to non-dysplastic tissue by 24.6% on histological testing after six months of treatment.

Vitamin A, C, and E have been shown to reduce the risk of gastric cancer by a third in the general population when ingested in low supplemental doses.

**Endoscopic Treatment**

The treatment of chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia is surveillance to reduce progression to more advanced GPLs like dysplasia. The frequency of surveillance depends on histological findings.

Endoscopic resection is recommended for dysplastic lesions and early gastric adenocarcinoma. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) technique is required for en-bloc excision of less than 10 mm lesions. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) may be required for lesions larger than 10 mm.

The protocols for more advanced intestinal gastric adenocarcinoma lesions are beyond the scope of this article and should follow gastric cancer protocols to ensure R0 resections.
