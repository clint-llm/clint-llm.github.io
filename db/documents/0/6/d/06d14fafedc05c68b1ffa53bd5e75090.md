# Continuing Education Activity

Osteitis pubis (OP) is a noninfectious, chronic inflammatory state of the pubic symphysis and surrounding soft tissues with multiple etiologies, all resulting in groin or lower abdominal pain. This activity reviews the evaluation, pathology, and management of osteitis pubis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk factors for developing osteitis pubis.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of osteitis pubis.
- Outline the treatment options available for osteitis pubis.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to lead to the best possible outcomes for patients with osteitis pubis.

# Introduction

Osteitis pubis (OP) is a non-infectious, chronic inflammatory state of the pubic symphysis and surrounding soft tissues with multiple etiologies, resulting in groin or lower abdominal pain.

# Etiology

Osteitis pubis has an incomplete understanding of the exact cause of the condition. However, it is commonly believed to result from overuse stress injury of the pubic symphysis.

# Epidemiology

To date, there has been no epidemiological study to determine the true incidence of osteitis pubis. The incidence in athletes has been reported as 0.5% to 8%, with a higher incidence in distance runners and athletes in kicking sports, in particular, male soccer players who account for 10% to 18% of injuries per year.

More recently, the relationship between femoroacetabular impingement and athletic pubalgia has been of interest. Eighty-six percent of those diagnosed with osteitis pubis undergoing operative intervention had FAI on radiographs.

Regarding urological procedures resulting in osteitis pubis, in the literature review, the Marachall-Marchetti-Kranz (MMK) urethropexy has an incidence of 2.5%. Overall it occurs in less than 1% of those undergoing urologic procedures.

# Pathophysiology

The pubic symphysis is a non-synovial amphiarthrodial joint with an interposed fibrocartilaginous disc separating hyaline cartilage. The joint normally has minimal motion due to the static ligamentous complex. The pubic symphysis serves as the insertion point of the rectus abdominis and origin of the adductor complex. The antagonistic nature of the rectus abdominis, which elevates the pubic symphysis while the adductors depress the joint, serves as a nidus for the development of osteitis pubis—the repetitive use of the anterior pelvic musculature results in chronic tendinosis. The chronic muscle imbalance results in abnormal forces across the pubic symphysis, causing symphyseal instability, pubic bone stress reaction, and eventually degeneration of the hyaline cartilage. Another emerging theory poses that osteitis pubis develops secondary to increased compensatory motion across the joint because of limited motion elsewhere in the kinetic chain, such as in femoroacetabular impingement.

Birmingham et al. found increased rotational motion at pubic symphysis when cam-type FAI was mimicked in cadaveric pelvis specimens.

# Histopathology

The few histological studies regarding osteitis pubis come from bone and cartilage samples taken during surgical procedures on athletes with osteitis pubis. Verrall et al. performed a study in which they took samples of pubic rami from Australian rugby players with pubic bone stress injuries. The samples, surprisingly, revealed the lack of inflammatory cells or signs of osteonecrosis. However, the samples did demonstrate woven immature bone with neovascularization, osteoblasts, and fibroblasts consistent with a bony stress response.

# History and Physical

Patients, particularly athletes with osteitis pubis, often have concomitant pathology making the diagnosis difficult. The entire kinetic chain of the lower extremity can be involved requiring evaluation of the sacroiliac joint, hip labrum, femoroacetabular impingement, adductors, and abdominal muscles. Pathology at any of these locations can result in osteitis pubis for the reasons mentioned earlier.

The physical exam can be difficult in osteitis pubis as it does overlap with athletic pubalgia or sports hernia. However, according to Lynch et al., the two can be differentiated with pain elicited by direct palpation over the pubic symphysis with OP. Another exam maneuver, the spring test, where direct pressure is applied just lateral to the pubic symphysis on the ramus, evokes pain.

Due to osteitis pubis’s common association with FAI, the hip joint must be evaluated. Patients with limited flexion, extension, or internal and external rotation of the hip should undergo evaluation. Patients presenting with either sacroiliac pathology or with FAI may have pain with the FABER test, which is flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the hip.

# Evaluation

Both radiographs and MRI aid in the diagnosis of osteitis pubis. In the early stage, plain radiographs might appear normal.

MRI has become the imaging modality of choice.

In patients diagnosed with cam-type FAI with symptoms greater than 3 months, Akgun et al. demonstrated a 45.56% prevalence of osteitis pubis on MRI findings compared to 5.86% in control subjects.

# Treatment / Management

The management of osteitis pubis includes both conservative and surgical options. The first option remains conservative treatment.

Steroid injections have been demonstrated as a useful adjunctive therapy.

If conservative management does fail, surgical intervention may be required. The timeframe of when to consider conservative treatment as a failure ranges, and no set timetable has been established.

Those with symptomatic FAI and osteitis pubis may see a relief of their osteitis pubis when FAI is treated, supporting the notion that osteitis pubis is a result of altered joint motion elsewhere in the pelvis.

# Differential Diagnosis

- Athletic pubalgia

- Osteomyelitis

- Adductor strain

- Rectus Abdominus strain

# Prognosis

The prognosis of those with osteitis pubis is very good. Those treated conservatively return to sports in approximately 3 months with a low chance of recurrence.

# Complications

Surgical treatment of osteitis pubis can result in:

- Chronic pain

- Infection

- Nonunion of fusion

- Recurrence

- Haemospremia

- Scrotal or labial swelling

# Deterrence and Patient Education

- Osteitis pubis is a rare cause of groin pain but is more common in the athletic patient, specifically soccer players, runners, and rugby players.

- Patients often present with groin pain made worse with activity.

- Plain radiographs and MRI may aid with the diagnosis.

- The condition is usually treated with NSAIDs, activity restriction, and physical therapy.

- In rare cases, surgical intervention may be required.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Patients, especially athletes with osteitis pubis, benefit from a team approach involving orthopedic surgeons, coaches, physical therapists, and athletic trainers. Conservative treatment should be attempted first and results in successful treatment in a majority of cases. Orthopedic surgeons and physical therapists should be mindful of concomitant pathology and treat them accordingly.
