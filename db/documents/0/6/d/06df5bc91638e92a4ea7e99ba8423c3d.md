The development of the nervous system derives from the ectodermal germ layer. First, the ectoderm differentiates into neuroectoderm and neural plate due to the influences of the underlying notochord. Next, the neural plate will give rise to the neural tube and the neural crest cells. The neural tube contains neuroepithelia that will give rise to the central nervous system's neurons, while the neural crest cells will give rise to the peripheral nervous system's neurons. Interestingly, the cranial nerves are usually considered to be part of the peripheral nervous system. Still, the first and second cranial nerves categorize better as part of the central nervous system. Since the first two cranial nerves are part of the central nervous system, they will be myelinated by oligodendrocytes. As for cranial nerves three through twelve, they are considered part of the peripheral nervous system and myelinated by the Schwann cells.
