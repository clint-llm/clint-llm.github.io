Globe rupture may result in a variety of complications, including permanent blindness, endophthalmitis, and chronic pain. Delayed complications of a penetrating injury include cyclitic membrane formation, tractional retinal detachment, choroidal rupture, and phthisis bulbi.

Retained intraocular foreign bodies can cause chronic disease in the eyes. Copper foreign body toxicity is called chalcosis and causes the complications of a sunflower cataract, chronic uveitis, vitreous opacification, and copper deposition in the macula. Iron toxicity from a retained intraocular foreign body is called siderosis bulbi and causes the complications of retinal degeneration, iris heterochromia, loss of accommodation, nyctalopia, and loss of visual field.
