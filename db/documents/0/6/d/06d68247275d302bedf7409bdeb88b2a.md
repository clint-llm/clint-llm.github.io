Bullying is common in our society and has become a public health emergency. It is a form of repeated peer aggression which is intentional and involves a power differential between the bully and the victim. It is often subtle and hidden, profoundly affecting a substantial number of children. The information in the following activity will provide clinicians with tools for increased awareness and early recognition of bullying; this, in turn, is likely to result in the development of strategies for prevention and intervention with respect to this significant societal issue. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, presentation of patients that are victims of bullying and the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of bullying.
- Discuss the presentation and signs and symptoms suggestive of bullying.
- Outline strategies for the treatment and prevention of bullying.
- Recognize that strategies for addressing bullying may be different for bullies and their victims.
