Man in a barrel syndrome is a neurological syndrome involving bilateral upper extremity weakness with preserved facial and lower extremity strength. This syndrome can result from injury to the bilateral cerebral hemispheres, the cervical spinal cord, or bilateral brachial plexuses. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of man in a barrel syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of man in a barrel syndrome.
- Summarize the localization of neurologic lesions that can cause a man in a barrel syndrome. 
- Describe the typical imaging findings associated with man in a barrel syndrome.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by a man in a barrel syndrome.
