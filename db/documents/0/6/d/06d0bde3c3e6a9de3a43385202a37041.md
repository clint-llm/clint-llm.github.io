Unstable angina is a veryÂ common disorder that is seen in the emergency room. There are many recommendations on the management of this serious cardiac disorder. Current recommendations are that this disorder should be managed by an interprofessional team that includes primary health care providers, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, cardiologists and emergency room physicians. In addition, a consult from a cardiac surgeon is highly recommended. Both the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Foundation have issued guidelines on the management of unstable angina
