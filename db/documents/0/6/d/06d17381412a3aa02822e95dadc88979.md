There are two distinct clades of the mpox virus, with a third possible clade potentially being described in the present outbreak.

In a cohort of 1119 confirmed cases of mpox from the ongoing outbreak in Spain, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, there have been no reported deaths even though it included a subset of patients with HIV, suggesting that the circulating strain may be less virulent. However, the quality of medical care could also play a factor in this.
