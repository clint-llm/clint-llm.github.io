The common fibular nerve is ultimately responsible for innervating the muscles that compose the anterior and lateral muscular compartments of the lower extremity. The anterior muscular compartment of the lower extremity consists of the tibialis anterior muscle, the extensor hallucis longus muscle, and the extensor digitorum longus muscle. This compartment is responsible primarily for the dorsiflexion of the foot.

In addition to carrying motor fibers, the common fibular nerve carries afferent cutaneous sensory fibers from the lower extremity that ultimately travel proximally to the spinal cord. The majority of anterior sensation of the leg is carried by the superficial fibular nerve; however, the deep fibular nerve carries some as well. Specifically, the superficial fibular nerve carries sensory fibers from the anterolateral aspect of the lower extremity that extends from midway down the leg to the majority of the dorsal aspect of the foot and toes. The deep fibular nerve carries sensory fibers from between the first and second toes. These nerves also carry some posterolateral sensation, albeit minimal. The common fibular nerve is responsible for sensation inferolaterally to the knee via the lateral sural cutaneous nerve, which is a small cutaneous branch off the common fibular nerve. The superficial fibular nerve is responsible for some lateral leg sensation just below where the sensation from the lateral sural cutaneous nerve ends.
