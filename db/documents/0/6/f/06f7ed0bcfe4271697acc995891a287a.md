Felodipine is an orally administered drug. It is available in the strengths of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg. Felodipine dosing is often an extended-release (ER) tablet formulation. The ER formulation offers several benefits, including once-daily dosing, minimal drug interactions, and lesser adverse effects. Therefore, starting the patient on a 5 mg dose of felodipine ER once daily is recommended. If the dose needs to be adjusted, a decrease or increase of 2.5 mg should be done every two weeks. The recommended dosage range of felodipine is 2.5 to 10 mg once daily. The tablet should be swallowed whole and not crushed or chewed. It can be taken with or without food or with a light meal.

**Use in Specific Patient Populations**

**Patients with Hepatic Impairment:**It is not recommended to use felodipine in patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with liver impairment have higher plasma concentrations of felodipine since it undergoes hepatic metabolism and, if needed, are started at 2.5 mg once daily dosing. These patients need to have their blood pressure monitored closely during dose adjustment.

**Patients with Renal Impairment:**Felodipine is safe for use in patients with renal failure.

**Pregnancy Considerations:**In animal studies, felodipine has been shown to cause teratogenic effects, including digital anomalies and ossification of terminal phalanges. Felodipine is a former pregnancy category C drug. According to ACOG( American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) guidelines, if calcium channel blockers are used during pregnancy, then felodipine is preferred.

**Breastfeeding Considerations:**No clinical information is available on using felodipine during breastfeeding. It is not known whether felodipine is present in human milk. There is a potential for serious adverse reactions from felodipine in the infant; hence an alternate drug is preferred.

**Pediatric Population:**Felodipine is not approved by FDA for pediatric hypertension.

**Elderly Patients:**In patients above 65 years of age, starting them on a low dose of felodipine (2.5 mg) is recommended. While changing the dose of the medication, their blood pressure should undergo strict monitoring.
