Almost all cases of vitamin B6 toxicity are from supratherapeutic dosing, either iatrogenic or laypersons self-treating with over-the-counter supplements. Daily dietary intake will not provide enough pyridoxine to causeÂ toxicity. The daily dietary intake of vitamin B6 is approximately 1.9 mg/day in the United States.
