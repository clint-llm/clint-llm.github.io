The mesencephalon serves as the embryonic precursor to the midbrain and thus the superior colliculus at both the primary and secondary vesicle stages of brain development at weeks 4 and 5, respectively. Expression of the specific genes Pax7 and engrailed have correlations with the formation and specialization of the superior colliculus, with the expression of Pax7 being essential for initiation of its creation as well as all stages of tectal development and engrailed expression being necessary for regulating cell migration during the formation of the tectal lamina.
