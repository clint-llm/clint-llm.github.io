Routine screening of males with breast cancerÂ is not established due to the rarity of occurrence. Yet, males (especially those older than 35) should be educated on the potential risk factors discussed and be advised on genetic counseling if they have a family history of breast cancer (in both males and females) or other cancers that may be triggered by a BRCA gene, for example, ovarian, pancreatic, testicular, or prostate cancers.
