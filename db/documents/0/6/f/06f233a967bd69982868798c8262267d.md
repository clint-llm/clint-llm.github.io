Colic affects 5% to 20% of infants worldwide, although some studies suggest the prevalence may be as high as 40%. A recent population-based survey in the United StatesÂ suggested a prevalence rate of nearly 6%. These ranges in prevalence may reflect the previous lack of uniformity in defining colic. However, the recognition of colic also depends on the parental perception of crying intensity and duration. Parental wellbeing, as well as cultural differences in what is considered acceptable crying, may also affect these data. Regardless of the variability in prevalence, both genders are affected equally, and there seems to be no correlation between breastfeeding or bottle feeding, gestational age, or socioeconomic status.
