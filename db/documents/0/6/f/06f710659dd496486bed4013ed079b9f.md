In addition to percutaneous radiofrequency ablation, several additional ablative techniques such as microwave and cryotherapy have emerged as effective alternatives. According to the literature, the overall survival and local recurrence rates, as well as complications and mortality rates in liver metastases patients treated with radiofrequency ablation (vs. microwave ablation), are not statistically different in terms of both survival time from diagnosis and survival time from ablation.
