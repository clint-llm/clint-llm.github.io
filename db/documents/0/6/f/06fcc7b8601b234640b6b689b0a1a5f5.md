Antiphospholipid antibodies are autoantibodies that are directed against phospholipid-binding proteins. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) is a multisystemic autoimmune disorder. The hallmark of APLS comprises the presence of persistent antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) in the setting of arterial and venous thrombus and/or pregnancy loss. The most common sites of venous and arterial thrombosis are the lower limbs and the cerebral arterial circulation, respectively. However, thrombosis can occur in any organ.

To identify APLA, the laboratory tests include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and functional assays. The three known APLA are:

- Anticardiolipin antibodies IgG or IgM (ELISA)

- Anti-beta-2-glycoprotein-I antibodies IgG or IgM (ELISA)

- Lupus anticoagulants (Functional assays)
