Dietary protein macromolecules are formed of sequences of amino acids connected by peptide linkages. These linkages must be hydrolyzed and exposed to enzymatic actions before free amino acids can be absorbed. The process of digestion of proteins starts in the stomach by pepsins with the help of hydrochloric (HCl) acid. This partially digested protein then reaches the duodenum where a high pH stops the peptic activity, and pancreatic enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidases) take over the process of digestion. The small chains of amino acids produced in the lumen are now subjected to membrane digestion at the brush border of the enterocytes. The membrane exopeptidases hydrolyze amino acid chains to form individual amino acids that are absorbed into the enterocytes and to the bloodstream to be utilized in the body.

Protein intolerance can occur due to any abnormalities in the digestion or metabolism process. When food proteins are incompletely denatured by the gastric acid, they are found to result in the sensitization of the protein in the gut leading to food allergies. Hypoacidic conditions, as seen in patients treated long-term for dyspeptic disorders, are frequently found to develop food protein allergies.
