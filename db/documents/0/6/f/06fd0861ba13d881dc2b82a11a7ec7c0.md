The pathophysiology of concussion includes a combination of metabolic, physiologic, and microstructural injuries to the brain. Other theories in the literature have stated a psychogenic origin in nature, however, it is possible that both provide a significant contribution to PCS.

In terms of neurobiological factors related to the pathophysiology of PCS, both structural and biochemical changes have been described and documented in animals and humans, such as increased atrophy and increased regional volume loss.

In terms of psychogenic factors contributing to the development of PCS, it has been suggested by a number of empiric and clinical observations. The cardinal symptoms presented in PCS patients include headache, dizziness, and sleep impairment, which in turn, are all similar to the somatization seen in psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The cognitive deficits seen in anxiety and depression are similar to those seen in PCS andÂ improve with antidepressant treatment.
