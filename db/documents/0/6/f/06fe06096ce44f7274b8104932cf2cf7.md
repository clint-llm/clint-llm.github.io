For the primary care specialties, emergency medicine teams, or intensivist teams, prompt consultation to the otolaryngology team(s) and its subspecialties is crucial to preventing concurrent morbidity and mortality. In situations or facilities in which otolaryngology is not easily or readily available, airway examination by anesthesiologists, pulmonologists, or general surgery team is vitally important. Respiratory therapy should always be consulted on any suspected patient with bacterial tracheitis as great pulmonary toilet and tracheostomy care/evaluation is needed to improve patient outcomes and help prevent this disease.
