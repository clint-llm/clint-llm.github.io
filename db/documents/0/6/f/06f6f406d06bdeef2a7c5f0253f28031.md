The levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which receives nerve supply from CN III, elevates the upper eyelid. It is superior to the superior rectus muscle at the roof of the orbit, and these two muscles join in a common aponeurosis anteriorly. This intimate muscular relationship explains why the eye elevates as the upper eyelid is retracted.

The extraocular muscles and their actions are as follows:

- Superior rectus: Elevates, adducts and rotates medially

- Medial rectus: Adducts

- Inferior rectus: Depresses, adducts and rotates laterally

- Lateral rectus: Abducts

- Superior oblique: Depresses, abducts, and rotates medially

- Inferior oblique: Elevates, abducts, and rotates laterally
