LP is caused by a homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) gene located on chromosome 1q21.

LP is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Patients often have affected family members, and some are children of consanguineous parents.
