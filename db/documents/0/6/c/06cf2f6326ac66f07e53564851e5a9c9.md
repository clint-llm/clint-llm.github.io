Diagnosis during the acute phase is made by detecting the parasite microscopically, from a fresh preparation of anticoagulated blood or buffy coat, due to the high level of parasitemia. However, levels may decrease within 90 days of infection and may be undetectable by microscopy, as the sensitivity of the test decreases and as the disease progresses from acute to chronic. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is another diagnostic tool that may be used during the acute phase, monitoring for acute infection in organ transplant recipients or following accidental exposures. PCR assays can demonstrate positive results days to weeks before a peripheral blood smear detects circulating trypomastigotes. Detection of IgG antibodies to T. cruzi can be used to demonstrate chronic infections.

A chest x-ray may show heart involvement with cardiomegaly.

ECG findings may include intraventricular blocks, particularly a right bundle branch block and/or on the left the anterior fascicular block and diffuse ST-T changes.
