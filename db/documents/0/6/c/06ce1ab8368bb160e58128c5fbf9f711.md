A Spigelian hernia typically results from underlying pathology which increases intra-abdominal pressures, abdominal wall trauma, or degeneration of the aponeurotic layers of the abdominal wall as happens with aging or disorders of collagen synthesis. In other cases, this hernia can be idiopathic and has previously been referred to as a “spontaneous lateral ventral hernia.”
