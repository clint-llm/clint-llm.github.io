A congenital melanocytic nevus (CMN) is a skin lesion characterized by benign proliferations of nevomelanocytes and presents at birth or develops within the first few weeks.

CMN are principally classified based on size into small, medium, and large or giant. This is determined by the projected adult size of the maximal diameter of the lesion. Small CMNs are projected to be <1.5cm in diameter, medium 1.5Â to 19.9cm, and large or giant >20cm.
