Though the specific pathophysiology associated with the De Winter pattern is still not fully ascertained, several potential mechanisms have been proposed. One which has garnered substantial interest relates to subendocardial ischemia, with ensuing subendocardial (as compared to subepicardial) action potentials at a hyperacute stage of the event (before transmural ischemia becomes predominant).
