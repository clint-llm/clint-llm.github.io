The diagnosis of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is made primarily by the history and clinical findings supplemented by labs and imaging. One should maintain a high level of suspicion because of the severe morbidity and mortality that results if treatment is delayed. Prophylactic thiamine administration is relatively safe and should be started even if the diagnosis has not been confirmed. Importantly, thiamine should be administered before glucose to avoid precipitating or exacerbating Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.
