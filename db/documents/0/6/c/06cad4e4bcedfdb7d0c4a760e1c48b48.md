Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist. It competitively inhibits the activity of benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine substances that interact with benzodiazepine receptors site on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. It can also reverse the binding of benzodiazepines to benzodiazepine receptors.

The onset of action is about 1 to 2 minutes; 80% response occurs within the first 3 minutes.The peak effect is 6 to 10 minutes after administration.The duration ranges from 19 minutes to 50 minutes, depending on the dose and benzodiazepine plasma concentrations.

Intravenous flumazenil has been shown to antagonize sedation, impairment of recall, psychomotor impairment produced by benzodiazepines.
