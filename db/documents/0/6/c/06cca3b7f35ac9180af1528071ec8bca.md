The prognosis of pleurisy and pleuritic chest pain depends on the etiology and effectiveness of treatment. Acute coronary syndromes, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism carry high morbidity and mortality if left untreated. Category 3 and 4 pleural effusion (alternatively known as complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema) have a high mortality rate (30%) and high morbidity if left untreated or are treated suboptimally. Lupus pleuritis does not have high mortality but has significant morbidity.
