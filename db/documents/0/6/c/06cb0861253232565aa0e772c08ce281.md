Neck pain is widespread and causes significant pain and disability. Workers with a history of neck pain account for up to 40% of work absenteeism. In the setting of cervical radiculopathy, because the nerve root of a spinal nerve is compressed or otherwise impaired the pain and symptomatology can spread far from the neck and radiates to arm, neck, chest, upper back and/or shoulders. Often muscle weakness and impaired deep tendon reflexes are noted along the course of the spinal nerve. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of cervical spine radiculopathy and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of the various types of cervical spine radiculopathy.
- Summarize the relevant steps in performing an examination and evaluation of cervical radiculopathy, including any indicated diagnostic imaging.
- Review treatment options for cervical radiculopathy based on the specific etiology.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in the diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
