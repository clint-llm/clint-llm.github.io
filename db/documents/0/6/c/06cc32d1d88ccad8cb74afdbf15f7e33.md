# Continuing Education Activity

The mental status examination is the physical examination for psychiatry. It is the defining status of the current state of the patient during evaluation. This activity defines mental status examination, describes the components of a mental status examination and how it can be useful in practice, and highlights how it can enhance diagnosis and treatment for the interprofessional team in psychiatric practice.

**Objectives:**
- Identify what a mental status examination is and how it can be used in practice.
- Describe the components of a mental status examination.
- Outline an example of mental status examination and how it can be documented.
- Summarize how a mental status examination can lead to early identification and better management by the interprofessional team for patients with mental illness to improve patient outcomes.

# Introduction

The mental status examination is the psychiatrist’s version of the physical examination. In 1918, Adolf Meyer developed an outline for a standardized method to evaluate a patient’s “mental status” for psychiatric practice.

# Function

The mental status examination is organized differently by each practitioner but contains the same main areas of focus. For the purposes of this activity, the mental status examination can be divided into the broad categories of appearance, behavior, motor activity, speech, mood, affect, thought process, thought content, perceptual disturbances, cognition, insight, and judgment. Cognition can subdivide into different cognitive domains depending on what areas the practitioner determines necessary to assess. Each section below will detail the definition, the proper method of assessment, and how that information has a use in the diagnosis and monitoring of mental illness.

**Appearance**

This is a description of how a patient looks during observation. It can be determined within the first seconds of clinical introduction as well as noted throughout the interview. Details to be included are if they look older or younger than their stated age, what they are wearing, their grooming and hygiene, and if they have any tattoos or scars. If a patient looks more youthful than their stated age, they may have a developmental delay or dress in an age-inappropriate manner. Patients that look older than their stated age may have underlying severe medical conditions, years of substance abuse, or often years of poorly controlled mental illness. Grooming and hygiene can give an idea of a patient’s level of functioning. Those with poor hygiene and grooming generally denote that in the context of their mental illness that they currently have poor functioning. Those with poor grooming or hygiene may be severely depressed, have a neurocognitive disorder, or be experiencing a negative symptom of a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia.

**Behavior**

This is a description obtained by observing how a patient acts during the interview. First, it is essential to note whether or not the patient is in distress. If a patient is in distress it may be due to underlying medical problems causing discomfort, a patient having been brought against their will to the hospital for psychiatric evaluation, or due to the severity of their hallucinations or paranoia terrifying the patient. Next, a description of their interaction with the interviewer should be noted.

**Motor Activity**

This describes how a patient is moving and what kinds of movements they have. Motor activity can indicate an underlying mental illness or neurological disorder. Furthermore, as the dopamine system targeted by medications plays a vital role in the movement, it is especially essential in monitoring for medication side effects.

One aspect of monitoring is the speed of movements. This can be described as normal, psychomotor retardation/bradykinesia, or psychomotor agitation/hyperkinesia. A patient with depression or a neurocognitive disorder may have psychomotor retardation.

A patient’s posture is important to note, as this may indicate underlying issues. Sustained posturing may point to catatonia, a type of psychomotor immobility/stupor/inflexibility, and a feature of psychotic disorders. Practitioners unfamiliar with the condition often overlook catatonia but is critical to differentiate as it requires a separate treatment than the underlying psychosis.

**Speech**

Speech is evaluated passively throughout the psychiatric interview. The qualities to be noted are the amount of verbalization, fluency, rate, rhythm, volume, and tone. It is of key importance to note the amount a patient speaks. If the patient speaks less than normal, they may be experiencing depression or anxiety. Conversely, an increased/hyperverbal amount of speech may also indicate some level of anxiety or that a patient is currently manic. Fluency refers to the patient’s language skills. English may not be a patient’s first language, and they may not be fluent. Alternately, English may be their first language, but they may have word-finding difficulty due to an altered mental status or a neurocognitive disorder. The rate of speech may be slow in depressed patients or those with a neurocognitive disorder. The pressured rate may indicate acute substance intoxication or that the patient is experiencing a manic episode.

**Mood**

This is a patient’s subjective description of how they are feeling. It is determined by directly asking the patient to describe how they are feeling in their own words.

**Affect**

This is how the practitioner describes a patient’s observed expression through their non-verbal language.

**Thought Process**

This is a description of the organization of the thoughts expressed by a patient.

**Thought Content**

This is essentially the subject matter of the thoughts that are in the patient’s mind. It is determined by listening throughout the interview and through direct questioning. If a patient has a particular preoccupation, they may have a perseveration-type thought process for which it is important to document the topic. When assessing a patient’s thought content, it is imperative to determine suicidal ideations, homicidal ideations, and delusions.

The practitioner may ask the patient if they have suicidal ideations or homicidal ideations. Suicidal ideations need to be further clarified by passive thoughts of wishing to be dead versus active thoughts of wanting to take one’s own life. Furthermore, practitioners need to be able to ascertain whether the patient has a plan and intent to act on such thoughts. This can be difficult to determine as patients are rarely forthcoming about such details. If there is any concern for suicidal intent, a more thorough suicide risk assessment is warranted. Assessing homicidal ideations follows a similar pattern of needing to determine if the thoughts are passive ones of wishing someone was dead versus active thoughts of killing someone with or without a plan and/or intent to act.Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California, it is a mental health professional’s duty to warn a person if a patient has made a threat against their life.

Delusions are firmly held false beliefs of a patient which are not part of a cultural belief system and persist despite contradicting evidence.

**Perceptions**

This section describes some of the various kinds of hallucinations that a patient may be experiencing. This is assessed by asking a patient what they are perceiving. A hallucination is the perception of something in the absence of any external stimuli. It is important to contrast an illusion, which is a misperception based on an actual stimulus such as thinking one hears their name called in a crowd. Contrarily, hallucinations that occur when going to sleep (hypnagogic), waking up from sleep (hypnopompic), or sleep paralysis are non-pathological and may be considered to be normal.

Frequently a patient will deny having any hallucinations despite experiencing them. This may either be due to paranoia or fear generated by what they are experiencing. Even if a patient denies experiencing hallucinations, it is important to note whether the patient appears to actively respond to internal stimuli by talking to someone not present or looking at something not present.

**Cognition**

The most common areas of cognition evaluated on a mental status examination are alertness, orientation, attention/concentration, memory, and abstract reasoning. If when assessing cognition or any other part of the mental status examination the practitioner finds symptoms of a possible neurocognitive disorder, more thorough screening is possible with additional evaluation tools such as Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), or Mini-Cog.

Alertness is the level of consciousness of a patient. This can be described as alert, somnolent, obtunded, in a stupor, or comatose. Alert means that the patient is fully awake and can respond to stimuli. Somnolent means that the patient is lethargic or drowsy. Somnolence is considered to be a reduced level of consciousness, but the patient is still able to perceive stimuli and can be awakened fairly easily. Obtunded means that mild to moderate stimuli may not arouse the patient, and when the awoken patient will be drowsy with delayed responses. A patient in a stupor is unresponsive to almost all stimuli and when aroused may quickly go back to sleep without continued stimulation. A comatose patient is unresponsive to all stimuli, including vigorous and noxious stimuli.

Orientation refers to the patient’s awareness of their situation and surroundings. This is assessed by asking the patient if they know their name, current location (including city and state), and date. Someone who is normally oriented fully but is acutely not oriented may be experiencing substance intoxication, a primary psychiatric illness, or delirium. Delirium can be easily missed and miscategorized as a primary psychiatric illness. It is important to be able to differentiate this altered mental state because it may mean there is a critical medical condition that needs to be evaluated and treated.

Attention/concentration is assessable throughout the interview by observing how well a patient stays focused on the questions asked.

Memory subdivides into immediate recall, delayed recall, recent memory, and long-term memory. A practitioner can choose to assess one or all types of memory during evaluation. Immediate recall is asking the patient to repeat something back to you. This determines if a patient can register new information.

Abstract reasoning is a patient’s ability to infer meaning and concepts. This is assessable by asking a patient what two objects have in common or how to interpret a common saying, adage, or proverb. Literal interpretations and answers indicate concrete thinking, which is seen in many psychiatric disorders but also some intellectual disabilities and neurocognitive disorders.

**Insight**

This refers to a patient’s understanding of their illness and functionality.

**Judgment**

This refers to a patient’s ability to make good decisions. A way to directly assess judgment is to ask a patient what they would do in specific scenarios. Often this is assessed through a patient’s history during an interview and their observed actions.

# Issues of Concern

The mental status examination is a subjective assessment of a patient and may vary significantly between practitioners depending on their level of skill in observation and eliciting responses from the patient.

Several factors can limit the mental status examination. To perform an effective mental status examination, a certain level of trust needs to have been built with the patient to be able to have their cooperation and openness. Some patients are agitated to the point of being unable to answer questions or have to be sedated for safety concerns limiting the ability to perform a mental status examination. If a patient has an intellectual disability, or neurological disorder, observations and answers to questions require interpretation in the context of these conditions. If a patient is not English-fluent, had limited education from a different culture, is lacking in nutrition, has sleep deprivation, or is medically ill, they may not be able to understand everything asked.

# Clinical Significance

The mental status examination is essential for use by psychiatrists in evaluating a patient on initial and subsequent encounters. The mental status examination can aid in the diagnosis of a patient when combined with a thorough psychiatric interview including the history of present illness, past psychiatric history, substance use history, medical history, review of systems, family history, social history, physical examination, and objective laboratory data such as toxicology screening, thyroid function, blood counts, and metabolic levels, neuroimaging.

The example mental status examination note shown previously was that of a patient with bipolar I disorder, current episode manic, severe with psychotic features in an inpatient psychiatric unit. The diagnostic criteria for bipolar I disorder would have been determined by combining the information gathered from a thorough psychiatric interview with those seen in the mental status examination that indicates current mania.

In subsequent encounters, comparing the mental status examination to previous ones will help the clinician to determine if a patient’s symptoms are improving or worsening.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

A mental status examination is a key tool in improving the detection of psychiatric signs and symptoms, diagnosing mental illness, pointing to possible underlying medical conditions, and determining the patient’s level of severity and disposition.

Nursing will often have the most ongoing contact with a patient, particularly inpatients; they can assess and inform the treating clinicians of any concerns. They can consult with the pharmacist regarding the dosing and administration of any psychiatric medications. Pharmacists may encounter patients outside of the institutional setting, and based on their medication profile, be aware of psychiatric conditions. If they can assess and evaluate that the patient is experiencing issues, then they can reach out to the treating clinician who can determine if intervention is necessary, such as a change in medication.

Clear communication and regular meetings of the entire interprofessional healthcare team to discuss their observations on how the patient has been doing from each member’s perspective can point the team in the right direction for the patient’s care and improve patient outcomes. In an outpatient setting, there still needs to be open lines of communication, and each member of the interprofessional team should have some ability to perform mental status assessments so patients can get the help they need promptly, leading to better outcomes.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

Nurses caring for patients must include a mental status exam in the overall physical assessment of the patient. The evaluation may take place during admission or soon after. The mental status exam should include the general awareness and responsiveness of the patient. Additionally, one may also include the orientation, intelligence, memory, judgment, and thought process of the patient. At the same time, the patient's behavior and mood should undergo assessment. The patient care plans often have to be altered when there are observable abnormalities on the mental status exam.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring

When obtaining a mental health history, the nurse should note the general appearance, posture, and facial appearance. Also, they should observe and note the general behavior, as well as intellectual functioning and orientation. Other things of note include communication skills, memory, cognition, and judgment. Finally, one may also determine if the patient is suicidal or at risk for self-harm. The key for nurses is to be tactful. Everything requires documentation in the chart. The safety of nurses and the patient is vital at all times.
