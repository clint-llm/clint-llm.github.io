Atrioventricular nodalÂ reentry tachycardia is usually not prevalent in patients with structural heart disease. The anatomy of the reentrant circuit defines the type of AVNRT present. A slow-fast AVNRT accounts for 90% of AVNRTs with anterograde conduction by the slow AV nodal pathway and retrograde conduction by the fast AV nodal pathway. Fast-slow AVNRT represents approximately 5% to 10% of AVNRTs with anterograde conduction by the fast AV nodal pathway and retrograde conduction by the slow AV nodal pathway. Slow-slow AVNRTs account for 1% to 5% of AVNRTs with anterograde conduction by slow AV nodal pathways and retrograde conduction by slow atrial fibers.
