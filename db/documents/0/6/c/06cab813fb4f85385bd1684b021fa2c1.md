To conclude, Pythium keratitis is a vision-threatening ocular condition which warrants a high index of suspicion to diagnose along with prompt and meticulous management for salvaging the vision.Â The classical clinical features are tentacular projections, peripheral furrowing, and early limbal spread.

It is difficult to distinguish Pythium hyphae from fungal hyphae on smearing alone. Hence culture is mandatory for zoospore identification. Antibacterials have shown better outcomes than antifungals; hence antibacterials should be resorted to as the first-line drugs. Early keratoplasty is required for good anatomical and functional outcomes.
