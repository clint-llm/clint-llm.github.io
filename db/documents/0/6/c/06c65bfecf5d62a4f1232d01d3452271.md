Diaphragmatic pacing is a therapy aimed at patients with ventilatory failure due to bilateral diaphragm paresis or paralysis. This is aimed at giving these patients an opportunity to become free or delay the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, improving the quality of life. DP is a relatively rare procedure, so patients should be evaluated at centers of expertise.
