TEF and EA result from the defective lateral separation of foregut into the esophagus and trachea. A fistula tract between the esophagus and the trachea is possibly formed secondary to a defect in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions.

Type A is isolated esophageal atresia without associated tracheoesophageal fistula and has a prevalence of 8%. Type B is esophageal atresia with a proximal tracheoesophageal fistula. It is the rarest with a prevalence of 1%. Type C esophageal atresia is the most prevalent at 84% and involves a proximal EA with distal tracheoesophageal fistula. Type D is esophageal atresia with both a proximal and distal TEF. It is rare at 3%. Type E esophageal atresia is just an isolated tracheoesophageal fistula without associated esophageal atresia. It is known as an "H" type, with prevalence around 4%.
