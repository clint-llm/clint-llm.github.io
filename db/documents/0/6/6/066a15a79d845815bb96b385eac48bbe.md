Patients may endorse sensory, motor, or autonomic symptoms. Sensory symptoms include allodynia (usually non-painful stimuli cause pain) and hyperalgesia (usually painful stimuli cause exaggerated pain). Patients can also experience autonomic symptoms, including skin color and temperature changes (vasomotor dysfunction) as well as swelling and sweating changes (sudomotor dysfunction). Motor symptoms of CRPS include weakness, reduced range of motion, tremor, and even dystonia in the affected extremity.

CRPS is associated with worsening depression, anxiety, poor function, and diminished quality of life. AÂ systematic review by Lohnberg et al. examined psychosocial factors associated with CRPS and concluded there is no support in the literature for specific personality or psychopathology predictors of CRPS.

CRPS has also been associated with systemic medical issues, including neuropsychological deficits (executive functioning, memory, word retrieval), constitutional symptoms (lethargy, weakness, disruptions in sleep architecture), cardiopulmonary involvement (neurocardiogenic syncope, atypical chest pain, chest wall muscle dystonia leading to shortness of breath), endocrinopathies (impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with low serum cortisol, hypothyroidism), urologic dysfunction (increased urinary frequency and urgency, urinary incontinence), and gastrointestinal dysmotility (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, indigestion).
