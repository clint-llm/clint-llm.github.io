The cause of Wilms tumor is not precisely known, but it is believed to be due to genetic alterations that deal with the normal embryological development of the genitourinary tract. Some of the genetic markers that have been associated with Wilms tumor include WT1, CTNNB1, and WTX gene alterations that have been found in about 1/3 of all Wilms tumors.  Other genes associated with Wilms tumor include TP53 and MYNC.  A poorer prognosis has been linked to TP53 and with the loss of heterozygosity at chromosomes 1p, 1q, 11p15, and 16q.

Only about 1% of Wilms patients have a relative with the disease who is typically not a parent.

Wilms is thought to develop from persistent metanephric tissue or nephrogenic rests. These may occur in 1% of infantile kidneys but typically regress during childhood. These abnormal metanephric cells are found in up to 100% of cases of bilateral Wilms but only 35% of unilateral tumors.

Hemihypertrophy and aniridia as well as a variety of urological disorders like cryptorchidism, horseshoe kidney, and hypospadias, are associated with the malignancy although it is unlikely they play any role in actual carcinogenesis.

The bilateral disease represents only about 5% of all patients with Wilms tumor and is more commonly found in girls.
