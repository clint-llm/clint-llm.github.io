Treatment of Berrett's metaplasia and prevention of its progression to adenocarcinoma requires a multifaceted approach. It requires an interprofessional team of clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and dieticians to collaborate to improve patient care and outcomes.

The nurse's role lies in assisting the team by educating the patient about lifestyle modifications to prevent the progression of this disease. These include smoking cessation, weight loss, reduction in portion size, and elevation of the head of the bed while sleeping. Ensuring compliance with these modifications and informing the clinician when specific additional therapies are needed to help the patient achieve these goals will significantly improve the morbidity associated with this disease.

The pharmacists should ensure timely refill of proton-pump inhibitor medications and ensure the patient's other medications do not interfere with these drugs. The pharmacist is also charged with the task of educating the patient on the use of over-the-counter medications, especially nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, to limit gastrointestinal complications in these patients. If the pharmacist identifies a specific need for analgesic medications or interference of other prescribed medications with these drugs, he/she should communicate these findings to the clinician so that alternative therapies may be advised.

The dietician's role lies in educating the patient on appropriate portion size and weight reduction therapy to help them achieve weight loss and minimize complications.

Only by working as a collaborative interprofessional team can we improve patient outcomes related to Barrett's esophagus and help decrease the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma.
