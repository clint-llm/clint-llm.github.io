Feeding disability in children is a challenging diagnosis requiring the collaboration of a pediatric gastroenterologist, a psychiatrist, a nutritionist, an occupational and speech therapist, and a behavioral analyst. The integration of a pediatric pathologist in the team is also key in ruling out organic feeding disabilities. This critical interprofessional communication markedly improves outcomes when the etiology is rare or multifactorial. Patient-centered care is given, involving the interaction of different specialists to achieve satisfactory outcomes.
