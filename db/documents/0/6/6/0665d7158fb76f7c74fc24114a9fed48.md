Patients will often describe a sudden onset of pain during a specific activity as opposed to a more insidious onset. They will describe the pain as severe and in the groin region or medial thigh that is worse with activity.

Individuals can sustain injury anywhere along the medial compartment of the thigh along the adductor complex. The clinician may observe bruising or swelling in moderate to severe injuries. Typically, there is an area of point tenderness or localized tenderness. They may be tender along the proximal attachment of the pubic ramus. The patient will have pain with resisted adduction of the hip or with passive stretching. They may have decreased strength secondary to pain or depending on the degree of injury, this strength deficit may be due to muscle or tendon rupture or avulsion injury.
