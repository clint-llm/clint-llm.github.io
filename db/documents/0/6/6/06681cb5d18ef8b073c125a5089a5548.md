Making a diagnosis of keratitis is not difficult; however, finding the etiology is not always easy. Many times the direct microscopy and culture reports are unremarkable, and the patient has to be treated based on clinical findings. In early-stage, Acanthamoeba keratitis and HSV stromal keratitis are often indistinguishable; however, late stages of Acanthamoeba keratitis may simulate fungal keratitis.
