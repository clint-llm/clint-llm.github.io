The primary goal of treatment is to provide patients with a safe sleeping environment for them and their bed partners. Healthcare professionals can achieve this through non-pharmacologic approaches and pharmacotherapy if needed.

It is important to counsel patients and their bed partners on avoidance of potentially hazardous and injuries objects near the patients, for example, firearms or glass objects. Bed partners should be educated on the disease, and the patient’s enactments during dreams are not under voluntary control.

Sleeping alone may be advisable in severe cases. Many patients may require padded bed rails or must sleep in a sleeping bag.

Patients may be advised to stop SSRI and tricyclic antidepressants that are known to cause or exacerbate RBD.

Regarding pharmacotherapy, melatonin is now considered first-line therapy in the treatment of RBD.

Low-dose clonazepam (0.5 to 1 mg at bedtime) has been traditionally used to control RBD symptoms. Its mechanism of action is not clear either but may help suppress unpleasant dreams.
