Mercury toxicity can be very difficult to identify with multisystem involvement. It is imperative to have a high index of suspicion and obtain a thorough history while always keeping in mind the complex of symptoms found in the toxidromes.

A keen awareness leading to early identification and treatment is critical due to the severe and potentially irreversible damage.
