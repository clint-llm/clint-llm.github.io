Even with intervention, injured children encounter difficulties in every aspect of their lives; from classroom learning to developing a secure sense of self.  The traumatic situations which lead to the attachment disorder create a persistent state of stress; diminishing their capacity for resilience.  Early identification and treatment have been shown to improve outcomes; however, parent education and support are key.  Parents adopting children from state custody or from overseas orphanages should receive education on the impact of social deprivation and connected with service agencies or providers specializing in attachment disorders.
