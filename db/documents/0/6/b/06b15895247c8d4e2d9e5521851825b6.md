A most challenging clinical dilemma attempts to differentiate between physiological left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (athlete's heart) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is recognized as the most common cause of non-traumatic exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in young athletes (<35 years old). Detailed echocardiography assessment of left ventricle structure and left ventricle function helps in making the diagnosis.

As outlined above, the differential diagnosis to consider in patients with evidence of LVH includes:

- Essential hypertension

- Renal artery stenosis

- Athletic heart with physiological LVH

- Aortic valvar stenosis

- Coarctation of the aorta

- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without or with outflow tract obstruction (HOCM)

- Subaortic stenosis (left ventricular outflow tract obstruction by muscle or membrane)

- Aortic regurgitation

- Mitral regurgitation

- Dilated cardiomyopathy

- Ventricular septal defect

- Infiltrative cardiac processes (e.g., Amyloidosis, Fabry disease, Danon disease)
