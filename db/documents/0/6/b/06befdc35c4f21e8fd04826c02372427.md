Because phenazopyridine is available as an OTC product, there is an opportunity for misuse and abuse. In conducting medication reviews, collecting OTC drug use and prescription use should be considered.

The health care team should provide effective patient education. Treatment with an appropriate antibiotic will result in much faster symptom relief and eradication of the infection. Clinicians should prescribe phenazopyridine to relieve the burning, urgency, frequency, and pain associated with lower UTIs, possibly for two days only until the antibiotic should have cleared the offending bacteria. Use after two days may delay diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Nurses should verify the dose before administration and counsel patients that the longer duration of treatment increases the potential for severe adverse effects. [Level 4]

Pharmacists should educate patients that phenazopyridine only provides symptomatic relief and should not replace seeing a medical provider but should instead work collaboratively with the patient's medical provider, reporting their findings regarding the patient's medication regimen. Open communication and collaborative work of all interprofessional health care team members (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs, nurses, and pharmacists) improves patient safety and betters treatment outcomes using phenazopyridine.
