PPV is a highly technical procedure that can save vision in many patients with acute or chronic vitreoretinal pathology. A good outcome can have a significant impact on the patientâ€™s quality of life. Although the procedure carries a low overall risk, there is still a risk of severe complications. These can compromise vision or even cause blindness. However, expectant post-op surveillance and management can alleviate the burden of these complications. Overall, vitrectomies can serve a crucial role in preventing or even reversing vision loss.
