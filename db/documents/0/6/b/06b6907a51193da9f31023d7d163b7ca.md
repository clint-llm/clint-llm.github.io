The management of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) must be an interprofessional team approach. Typically, whenever feasible, an interprofessional team should include an obstetrician, maternal-fetal medicine specialist (MFM), gastroenterologist, anesthetist, and the nursing team.

A weekly biophysical profile for fetal health monitoring should take place in patients with ICP with elevated total bile acid level (over 100 micromol/L). Delivery between 36 to 37 weeks should be considered to avoid fetal complications in a patient with severely elevated total bile salt acid levels and other risk factors, as mentioned above. Once the condition gets diagnosed, the patient should be closely monitored by the nurse and obstetrician to ensure that the ICP is not worsening. A team approach to patient management is vital if one wants to improve outcomes.
