The first case of renal embolic disease was reported in 1856.

In a study by Huang et al., the incidence of renal infarction was 0.004% (20 of 481,540), with the most common etiology being cardiac in origin (75%), i.e., 15 of 20 patients had atrial fibrillation, cardiac thrombus, or valvular heart disease**.******In the same study, right-sided renal infarctions were more common than a left-sided and bilateral disease.

In a study by Yang et al., unilateral renal involvement was seen in 80.9%, and bilateral involvement in 19.1% of patients.

The mean age of patients who presented with renal infarction was 63.5 +/-15.42 years.

The majority of patients who receive angiography have significant atherosclerotic disease. This puts them at higher risk for atherosclerotic plaque emboli resulting in renal artery occlusion and infarction at an overall rate of about 2%. This may be a relatively common cause of acute kidney injury, as renal atheroemboli have been reported in 7% of such patients.
