The short-term prognosis, about symptoms such as daytime sleepiness and snoring, ranges from good to excellent with regular use of CPAP.

Severe OSA is a significant risk factor for the development of cardiovascular morbidity, which includes nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke.

Patients with a history of ischemic stroke and sleep apnea who regularly used their CPAP device had a decreased mortality compared with those who did not use their CPAP device.

All patients should receive education about sleep and proper sleep hygiene, OSA and the risks of driving while sleepy. They also should receive education regarding the role of nasal CPAP and the importance of daily use, as well as training in the use of CPAP, from a physician, trained technician, or nurse for at least the first month of therapy. This training promotes long-term adherence with treatment.
