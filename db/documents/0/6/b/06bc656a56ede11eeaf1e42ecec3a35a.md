Strychnine is an alkaloid, colorless, bitter powder. It is a competitive inhibitor of the postsynaptic glycine receptor mostly in the spinal cord. The inhibition of glycine, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, causes uncontrolled stimulation of postsynaptic neurons leading to involuntary diffuse muscle contractions. Because it does not affect the higher motor neuron centers, patients typically present with severe muscle contractions that appear as if they are having “awake seizures” or seizures with no postictal period. The mental status will be preserved until late when sequelae of unchecked muscle contractions create hyperthermia, acidosis, and further physiologic derangements.

Symptoms occur between 15 and 30 minutes after oral ingestion, faster through the intranasal or intravenous route. The initial symptom is excitability and heightened awareness followed by vomiting and muscle contractions. Convulsions last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes and take the form of opisthotonic posturing: back arched, extremities extended and jaw clenched (See Figure 2). Patients may demonstrate risus sardonicus, –muscle contractions of the face causing a fixed, stiff appearance of a sardonic smile. Uncontrolled muscle contraction can lead to tachycardia, hyperthermia, airway compromise from stiffness at the jaw and neck, and later findings of rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, lactic acidosis, metabolic acidosis, kidney failure, and seizures. Patients can have a respiratory failure from the airway and respiratory muscle spasm. Unchecked strychnine poisoning can cause death within several hours.
