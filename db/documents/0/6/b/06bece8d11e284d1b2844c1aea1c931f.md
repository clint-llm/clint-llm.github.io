A review of 48 hospital-admitted phenothiazine toxicities with concentrations of 200 mg to 500 mg per patient has listed common reactions such as hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, and decreased diastolic blood pressure. A tendency towards obtundation can present in cases where other drugs were also involved. Furthermore, a pupil size of less than 3 mm was present in the most severe poisoning cases. Prolonged QTc interval was noted, and patients were treated with diphenylhydantoin. An echocardiogram is a suggested approach for all cases of phenothiazine overdoses.

Treatment methods for phenothiazine overdoses included administering ipecac, gastric lavage, intravenous diphenhydramine, and intravenous hydration to reverse extrapyramidal symptoms and absorption. No fatalities occurred, and 50% of the patients were discharged following 24 hours, while the other 50% stayed for an average duration of 3.4 days. Potentially serious complications were present in 71% of the patients who stayed longer than 24 hours; however, all of those patients recovered.
