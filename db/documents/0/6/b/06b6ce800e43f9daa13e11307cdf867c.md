As described above, mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in the development of valproate-induced steatohepatitis. Valproate can lead to the buildup of intracellular lipids as well as reactive oxygen species by inhibiting beta-oxidation resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction.

There are various forms of valproate hepatotoxicity, and all show a characteristic pattern of mitochondrial injury, and microscopic histology of the liver reveals microvesicular steatosis with inflammation and cholestasis. Of note, in 5 to 10% of cases, valproate hepatotoxicity can be associated with a rise in ALT levels without an increase in GGT levels.

Valproate toxicity may also lead to cerebral edema associated with ischemia and herniation.
