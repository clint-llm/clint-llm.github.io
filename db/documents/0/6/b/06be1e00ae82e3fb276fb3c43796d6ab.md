The Schwartze sign is named after the German otologist Hermann Schwartze (1837-1910), who, in his day, was the first otologic professor in Germany. His work focussed on different otologic diseases, one of which being the ankylosis of the stapes now known as otosclerosis, a name defined several years later by Adam Politzer. Modern literature credit Hermann Schwartze with the discovery of a characteristic coloration of the promontory related to otosclerosis, but it remains unclear whether he used the term himself.

Other terms used are Flemingo's flush sign and Rising sun sign.

The terms Schwartze and Schwartz are used interchangeably by different authors. To avoid any confusion, we will use the term Schwartze, named after the discoverer.
