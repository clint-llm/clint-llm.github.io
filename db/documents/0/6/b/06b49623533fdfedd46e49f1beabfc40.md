Torsade is a rare arrhythmia, but it can quickly be fatal if not diagnosed and treated. Patients may present with a range of symptoms but it is the ECG that is diagnostic. While the arrhythmia is managed by physicians, all nurses should recognize this arrhythmia and consult with the cardiologist. Those who have a congenital disorder causing prolonged QT interval should be told to refrain from exercise. The pharmacist should educate the patient on medication compliance to prevent recurrence. Close follow up is required because the risk of sudden death is present. The pharmacist must be aware of all drugs the patient is taking and ensure that he or she is not on any medications that prolonged the QT interval. Finally, the nurse should teach all patients how to monitor their pulses and note for the presence of any adverse effects from the medications. In addition, the family should be taught basic life support.

**Outcomes**

For patients with congenital long QT syndromes, the mortality for untreated patients is more than 50% over 5 years. With intervention, the mortality rates can be decreased to single digits. In patients with acquired long QT syndrome, the prognosis is good as long as the trigger medication or factor has been identified and discontinued.
