Patients with autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease should be informed about this disease's congenital nature. Health professionals should clarify that there are no available medications to treat the underlying cause. The management plan should focus on preventive measures to slow the progression of the disease toÂ ESRD and relieve the symptoms associated with each form of the disease.

Health care providers must also advise patients about the importance of medication adherence and compliance. Since this condition is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner, other family members are likely to be affected even if they are asymptomatic, so screening for genetic mutations in the affected family members is rational.
