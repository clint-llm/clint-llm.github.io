Fungal endocarditis is a serious infection with extremely high morbidity and mortality. These patients are best managed by an interprofessional team that consists of a cardiologist, infectious disease specialist, intensivist, cardiac surgeon, and internist. More importantly, the care is ideally managed and monitored in the ICU by an ICU nurse reporting to the interdisciplinary team. The key to lowering mortality is early detection and treatment. Any patient who fails to respond to antifungal agents should be referred to a cardiac surgeon. Some of these patients may require radical debridement and or valve replacement. However, even with surgical treatment, survival rates are low. Patients who are immunocompromised tend toÂ have the worst outcomes. In most case reports, recurrence is common, and the risk of embolization has been high. Most patients require long-term antifungal therapy, and hence the pharmacist should educate the patient on the need for parenteral antifungal medications. A home care nurse may be required to administer the therapy. Serial echocardiograms are often required to determine if the vegetations are resolving. For those with an embolic phenomenon, a CT of the brain may be necessary. Close communication between the team members is vital if one wants to improve outcomes.
