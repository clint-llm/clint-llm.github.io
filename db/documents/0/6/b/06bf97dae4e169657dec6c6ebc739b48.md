History and physical along with AP/lateral radiographs comprise the essential components for evaluating Scheuermann kyphosis. Lateral radiographs are required for diagnosis and diagnostic criteria include the following

- Rigid hyperkyphosis, greater than 40 degrees

- Anterior wedging, greater than or equal to 5 degrees in three or more adjacent vertebral bodies

**Technique for Determining Degree of Kyphosis on Lateral Imaging**

- The line is drawn along the superior endplate of the most tilted vertebrae on the cephalad portion of the kyphotic curve

- The line is drawn along the inferior endplate of the most tilted vertebrae on the caudal portion of the kyphotic curve

- The angle formed by the intersection of lines perpendicular to the above-described lines is the measured Cobb angle

- Hyperkyphosis is described as measured Cobb angle greater than 40 degrees

**Technique for Determining Degree****of Anterior Wedging on Lateral Imaging**

- The line is drawn from posterior to anterior along the superior endplate

- The line is drawn from posterior to anterior along the inferior endplate

- The angle formed by the intersection of these lines anteriorly is the measured Wedge angle

- Anterior wedging ofÂ greater than or equal to 5 degrees in three or more adjacent vertebral bodies, with an associated rigid hyperkyphosis greater than 40 degrees, is diagnostic for Scheuermann disease

**Other Associated Findings Noted on AP/Lateral Radiographs**

- Irregular vertebral endplates

- Schmorl nodes

- Loss of disc space height

- Scoliosis

- Spondylolysis/spondylolisthesis

- Disc herniation

Although typically not a necessity, MRI can be helpful to further evaluate anatomic changes or for pre-operative planning. CT imaging is usually not needed. There are also no specific laboratory tests or histologic findings necessary for the diagnosis of Scheuermann kyphosis.
