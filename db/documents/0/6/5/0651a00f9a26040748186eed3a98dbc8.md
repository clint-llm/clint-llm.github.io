The prognosis of a patient with HIV and a CD4 count greater than 500 (normal) results in a life expectancy as someone without HIV. A person with untreated AIDS has a life expectancy of about 1 to 2 years after the first opportunistic infection. Antiretroviral treatment can increase CD4 counts and change the patient's status from AIDS to someone with HIV.
