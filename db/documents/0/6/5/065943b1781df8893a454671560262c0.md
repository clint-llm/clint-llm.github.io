Prostaglandin E2 is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to prostaglandins. As an oxytocic agent, prostaglandin E2 should be avoided in scenarios in which vaginal delivery or the induction of labor is contraindicated and should be stopped before administering oxytocin.

**Suppository**

Clinicians should avoid the suppository should in patients with acute inflammatory pelvic disease, as well as patients with active cardiac, renal, pulmonary, or hepatic disease. Additionally, it requires caution in patients with a history of these diseases and patients with a history of cervical malignancy, asthma, hypo- or hypertension, anemia, jaundice, pulmonary disease, or epilepsy. The prostaglandin E2 suppository is not indicated for uterine evacuation for fetuses at the stage of viability.

**Gel/Insert**

The gel or insert versions used for cervical ripening are contraindicated in patients with fetal distress where delivery is not imminent or who have vaginal bleeding during pregnancy, marked cephalopelvic disproportion, and/or multipara with six or more previous term pregnancies. Prostaglandin E2 should also be avoided when prolonged uterine contraction may pose a risk to uterine integrity or fetal safety, such as with prior cesarean section or major uterine surgery. Prostaglandin E2 for labor induction should also be avoided in patients with a history of asthma, glaucoma, or heart disease.
