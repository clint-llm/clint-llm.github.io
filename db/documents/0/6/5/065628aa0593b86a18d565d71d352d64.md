Before performing any diagnostic study, a comprehensive review of the patient's history and clinical course, and a complete physical exam is necessary. The technician will inform the patient bedside of the indications and overview of the studies needed to diagnose CTS with electrodiagnostic testing properly. TheÂ technician must thoroughly explain the risks and benefits of the exam to the patient and get consent. One should ideally examine at least two extremities, performing both sensory and motor nerve conduction studies and EMG needle testing in both proximal and distal muscles for comparison.

The temperature of the patient's limbs should be kept warm at or above 32 degrees Celsius. Cold temperatures can cause mistakenly increased amplitudes, prolonged latencies, and slowed conduction velocities on NCS.
