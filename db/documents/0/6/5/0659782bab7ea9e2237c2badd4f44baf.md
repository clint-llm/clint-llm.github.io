The ascending aorta contains three layers. The intimal layer consists of a single layer of endothelial cells. The medial layer is composed of elastin, smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix, and collagen. An external layer of adventitial tissue is present, which also houses the nerves and vasa vasorum. In an aortic aneurysm, the elastic layer breaks up, and the smooth muscle cells become defective. In due course, a cystic appearing mucoid material replaces the contents of the medial layer, leaving behind the intima and adventitia only.
