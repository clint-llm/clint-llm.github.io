The diagnosis and management of night terrors is complex and requires an interprofessional team that includes the pediatrician, nurse practitioner, social worker, primary care provider, and neurologist. Once diagnosed, there is no specific treatment for night terrors other than comforting the child. Reassurance and education for the parents or guardians are strongly encouraged especially to ensure the safety of the child during a night terror. Parents should be educated about safety measures including secure windows. Limiting access to the potentially harmful location in the home and outside.

If there is excessive stress or conflict in the child’s life, a combination of therapy and coping techniques can be recommended to help decrease the frequency of episodes. Medication administration is strongly discouraged and not indicated.

Rarely is a sleep study ever indicated since the prognosis of night terrors is good and self-limiting; however, there is developing research involving scheduled awakenings through the night with a vibration machine to help improve quality of life. To avoid night terrors, it is vital that a sleep nurse educate the parents on the importance of good sleep hygiene.

The prognosis for night terror is good with most children outgrowing these episodes by 10 years of age.
