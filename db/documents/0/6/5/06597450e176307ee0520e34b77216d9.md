Stargardt disease is one of the common causes of visual loss in young patients. It is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ABCA 4 gene. Several patients initially seek the opinion of an optometrist for reduced vision. However, due to myriad presentations, the diagnosis may be delayed. As a result, the patients are unnecessarily subjected to multiple investigations like neuroimaging, lumbar punctures, and therapies like occlusion.

Pediatricians and other clinicians play a key role in appropriate referral and parent/ patient education. The treating personnel should know about performing and interpreting the various imaging modalities. This knowledge will help in establishing an early diagnosis. Currently, no treatment modalities are approved to prevent or reverse visual loss in these patients. However, several ongoing clinical trials are investigating various novel therapeutic modalities.

Multimodal imaging also helps monitor the disease progression and evaluate the efficacy of the treatment modalities. A multidisciplinary approach is required to manage these patients as few patients may have systemic associations.
