Treating the underlying etiology is important, as hemiballismus tends to resolve with time. Therefore, supportive treatment for comorbidities and related complications is important.

**Medical Treatment**

Medical management includes the use of first and second-generation antidopaminergic drugs, to target D2 receptors (e.g. risperidone, haloperidol, perphenazine, pimozide, chlorpromazine), benzodiazepines (clonazepam), anti-epileptics (topiramate), and tetrabenazine to relieve severe hyperkinetic movements.

**Surgical Treatment**

If patients become refractory to medical management, and the symptoms are severe enough to impair activities of daily living, surgery becomes an option. A stereotactic posteroventral pallidotomy is the procedure of choice and leads to decreased firing of pallidal neurons, leading to relief of the hyperkinetic movements. Micro-recording and intraoperative monitoring are performed during surgery to improve targeted accuracy during the procedure. Intrathecal baclofen has also shown results with post-traumatic hemiballismus.
