Rosacea has previously been thought to progress sequentially through various subtypes, including erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, papulopustular rosacea, and phymatous rosacea. However, given the high frequency of overlapping clinical features and etiologies within subtypes, the classification of rosacea has now taken a phenotype-based diagnostic approach to accurately characterize patients.

The vasculature is further dysregulated by the histamine-induced vasodilation and vasoconstriction from local angiotensin II produced subsequently to chymase release. Cutaneous fibrosis of connective tissue and hyperplasia of sebaceous glands result from persistent inflammation and is characteristic of phymatous change. Demodex folliculorum, is known to live within the sebaceous unit and has been linked to this condition with unclear timing of a primary or secondary disease manifestation.
