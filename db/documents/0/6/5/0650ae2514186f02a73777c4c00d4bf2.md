Naproxen overdose is common due to its OTC availability, but the overdose is usually mild in severity, and serious adverse effects from overdose are rare. There is no available antidote for naproxen overdose; however, monitoring vital signs and supportive care is recommended. The role of activated charcoal is uncertain due to time constraints and unclear benefits, and there is no role for hemodialysis due to naproxen's high degree of protein binding. However, ingestion of large amounts of Naproxen can lead to severe toxicity causing seizures and metabolic acidosis, which can potentially cause renal failure. Therefore, although hemodialysis is not generally recommended, it can correct acid-base disturbances and provide additional support to those with renal impairment in specific situations.
