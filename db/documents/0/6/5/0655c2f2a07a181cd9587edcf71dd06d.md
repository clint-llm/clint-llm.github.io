Full history taking and clinical examination should be conducted in patients with suspicion of intrathoracic goiter, followed by thyroid function and antibody tests. Surgical planning before substernal thyroidectomy should include fiberoptic nasendoscopy (FNE) to assess the airway and vocal cord status.

Proper surgical management requires a multiplanar CT to plan the most suitable surgical technique. CT scanning, or MRI scanning rarely, helps determine the goiter anatomy and relationship to the adjacent structures, which are the trachea, esophagus, aortic arch, and great vessels. It also helps recognize possible tracheal obstruction and pathological lymph nodes. Finally, it is the work of a multidisciplinary team, including an endocrinologist, anesthetist, oncologist, head and neck and thoracic surgeons to take part in a discussion of possible oncological cases.
