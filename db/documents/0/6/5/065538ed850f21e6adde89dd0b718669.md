Patients and their families require instructions on strict non-weight-bearing status. They will also require counseling on adequate pain control. If, after pediatric orthopedic consultation, urgent operative management is not performed, patients and families should be given anticipatory guidance regarding SCFE and the need for urgent orthopedic follow-up. If there is any concern that the family may be unable or unwilling to follow up with an orthopedic surgeon, admission with pediatric orthopedic consultation should be strongly considered.
