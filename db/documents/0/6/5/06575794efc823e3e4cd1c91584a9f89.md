Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a broad term used to cover a spectrum of conditions that are characterized by evidence of hepatic steatosis on imaging or histology (macro-vesicular steatosis), and absence of secondary causes of hepatic steatosis such as significant alcohol consumption, chronic use of medications that can cause hepatic steatosis or hereditary disorders. This activity reviews the etiology and pathophysiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
- Review the presentation of a patient with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
- Summarize the treatment options for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
