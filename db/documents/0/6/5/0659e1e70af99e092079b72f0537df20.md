Preliminary culture data from urine, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue, fluid, or wounds are generally read as Gram-positive cocci in chains. Differentials at this point can include Group A, B, C Streptococci, andÂ Streptococcus bovis, in addition to enterococcal species. However, when a nosocomial infection is likely in a critically ill patient, one should empirically cover for Enterococcus before the final culture read is available.

UTI, bacteremia, infective endocarditis, meningitis, intra-abdominal and wound infections can be caused by hundreds of pathogens that can mimic an enterococcal infection. Again, if suspicion for resistant species exists in the appropriate clinic context, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage is warranted until sensitivities can be obtained.
