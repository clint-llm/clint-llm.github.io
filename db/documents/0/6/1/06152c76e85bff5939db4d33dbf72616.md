PUK is usually unilateral but sometimes bilateral at the initial presentation.

The classic clinical signs of PUK diagnosis are the combination of peripheral crescentic ulceration, superimposed epithelial defect, loss of stroma, and infiltrates at the limbus with an overhanging edge (figure 1). When PUK is associated with a systemic disease, the inflammation can also involve the surrounding conjunctiva, episclera, and sclera, with additional nodular or necrotizing scleritis. Persistent inflammation and stromal lysis can progress to corneal perforation, and clinically iris tissue will be visible as a "plug" in the perforation site. This is an ocular emergency. Chronic PUK with peripheral thinning and corneal vascularization will result in significant irregular astigmatism, scarring, and reduced vision.

Mooren's ulcer is PUK due to an unknown cause. Watson et al. described three clinical presentations (as above).

Taking a detailed clinical history and examination can identify most causes of PUK. History should include asking about constitutional symptoms, musculoskeletal pain, gastrointestinal, respiratory, skin, cardiac, neurological signs, and symptoms.
