A study evaluating data from the ESCAPE trial showed the importance of evaluating the hepatojugular reflux in patients admitted with heart failure.

Prior studies have shown the hepatojugular reflux to be very useful in dyspnea patients for predicting heart failure if the PCWP greater than or equal to 15 mmHg. Some studies have also noted a high specificity of about 96% for the hepatojugular reflux in diagnosing heart failure.

The 6-month mortality of patients who had persistent hepatojugular reflux on discharge was significantly higher compared to those who had a resolution of hepatojugular reflux (univariate OR: 2.167; 95% CI: 1.189–3.949; ?? = 0.012). This study also assessed the role of combined assessment of positive hepatojugular reflux and jugular venous distention (defined as jugular venous pressure greater than 8 mmHg) in outcomes after discharge. Patients with positive hepatojugular reflux and jugular venous distention on discharge had a higher 6-month mortality compared with those with positive hepatojugular reflux and no jugular venous distention (33.8% versus 16.7%, resp.; univariate OR: 2.558; 95% CI: 1.023 to 6.397; ?? = 0.045).
