Thermal nerve ablative techniques should be performed by highly-trained specialists with experience in performing spinal procedures under fluoroscopy. Typically, these are board-certified, fellowship-trained pain medicine physicians with backgrounds in anesthesiology, physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R), family medicine, neurology, emergency medicine, and psychiatry. Like many other procedures, support staff often includes a circulating nurse to assist with equipment and patient support. Additionally, a radiology technician assists with radiographic imaging.
