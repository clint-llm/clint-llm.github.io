Toxicity to RTIs mainly occurs via adverse reactions that the patient may present with (see above for a list of severe reactions). Patients should understand the serious adverse effects the drugs that make up their HAART regimen can cause. If a patient presents with an adverse effect, then the drug should be discontinued and replaced with another from the same subclass of reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Specifically for stavudine, studies suggest that switching to abacavir will help improve lipodystrophy and still maintain optimal regimen efficacy.
