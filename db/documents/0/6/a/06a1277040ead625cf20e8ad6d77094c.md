**Recommendations for DEXA Scan**

In 2012 the Endocrine Society published the guideline for Osteoporosis in men which is still updated in regards to the indications for DEXA scan and investigation for osteoporosis in males. It recommends testing men 70 years or older and aged 50 to 69 years if risk factors are present. DEXA scan of the spine and hip is recommended in men at risk for osteoporosis and the forearm DEXA scan (proximal 1/3 portion of dominant radius) is recommended when the lumbar spine or hip BMD cannot be reliably interpreted and for men with hyperparathyroidism or on androgen deprivation therapy.

**Interpretation of DEXA Scan**

For patients ≥ 50 years old, a T-score less than or equal to -2.5 SD (compared to a young adult female) is used for the diagnosis of osteoporosis according to the WHO and the ISCD. However, there is controversy since randomized trials of osteoporosis therapy in men used T-scores calculated using male normal controls. A T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 suggests the diagnosis of osteopenia in males in this age group.

For patients younger than 50 years old, the ISCD recommends using a Z-score less than or equal to -2.5 D for the diagnosis of osteoporosis(which would compare males with peers of the same age if these data are available or with women on the same age if male data are not available). A Z-score between -1.0 and -2.5 suggests a diagnosis of osteopenia in males in this age group. A history of fragility fracture or risk factors for osteoporosis should also be considered for the diagnosis and decision to treat. In a patient with a fragility fracture, a densitometric diagnosis of osteoporosis is not needed to initiate treatment.

In patients younger the 50 years old, the diagnosis of osteoporosis should not be made based on BMD alone.

For patients with densitometric osteopenia without prior history of osteoporotic fractures, it is recommended to use the FRAX calculator to determine the decision for treatment.  In patients 50 years and older with densitometric osteopenia and a 10-year hip fracture probability 3% or higher or a 10-year major fracture probability 20 % or higher based on the U.S.-adapted WHO absolute fracture risk model warrants treatment.

**Other Imaging**

In patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis who might have had undiagnosed vertebral fractures, thoracic and lumbar spine imaging should be obtained by Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA). It has lower cost and radiation exposure than regular plain radiographs and can be obtained at the same time as the DEXA scan. If VFA is not available then lateral spine radiographs should be obtained.

Lateral spine radiography should also be considered:

- In men aged 80 and older if BMD T-score is ≤−1.0 at the spine, total hip, or femoral neck

- In men aged 70 to 79 if BMD T-score is ≤−1.5 at the spine, total hip, or femoral neck

- In 50 years or older men with specific risk factors: Low-trauma fracture during adulthood (age 50 and older); historical height loss of 1.5 inches (4 cm) or more when compared to peak height at age 20; prospective height loss of 0.8 inches or more (2 cm) with previously documented height; recent or current long-term glucocorticoid treatment.

- If DEXA scan is not available, vertebral imaging may be considered based on age and risk factors.

**Laboratory Evaluation**

Initial laboratory evaluation for males with osteoporosis should include serum calcium, phosphate, creatinine with estimated glomerular filtration rate, alkaline phosphatase, liver function, 25(OH)vitamin D, total testosterone, complete blood count, and 24-h urinary calcium (including creatinine and sodium). If a specific cause of osteoporosis is suggested by history and physical exam, a more thorough investigation can be pursued, including free testosterone, prolactin, IGF-1, serum protein electrophoresis with free and light chains and/or urine protein electrophoresis, tissue transglutaminase antibodies, thyroid function tests, and PTH levels. In order to rule out endogenous hypercortisolism, 1 mg-dexamethasone suppression test is the preferred initial investigation, but two different essays are ideal to confirm endogenous hypercortisolism. The second test can be either free urinary cortisol (urine 24h) or nocturnal salivary cortisol.

Note that the list for secondary causes of osteoporosis is extensive and the laboratory investigation needs to follow clinical suspicion.

Biochemical markers of bone turnover can also be checked at baseline to aid in risk assessment and to serve as an additional monitoring tool when treatment is initiated, also to assess compliance with treatment. However, their role in patient individual care is not well established.
