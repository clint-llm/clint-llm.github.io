The primary function of smooth muscle is contraction. Smooth muscle consists of two types: single-unit and multi-unit. Single-unit smooth muscle consists of multiple cells connected through connexins that can become stimulated in a synchronous pattern from only one synaptic input. Connexins allow for cell-to-cell communication between groups of single-unit smooth muscle cells. This intercellular communication allows ions and molecules to diffuse between cells giving rise to calcium waves. This unique property of single-unit smooth muscle allows for synchronous contraction to occur.

The function of smooth muscle can expand on a much larger scale to the organ systems it helps regulate. The functions of smooth muscle in each organ system is an incredibly broad topic and beyond the overall scope of this article. For simplicity, the basic functions of smooth muscle in the organ systems appear listed below.

- Gastrointestinal tract - propulsion of the food bolus

- Cardiovascular - regulation of blood flow and pressure via vascular resistance

- Renal - regulation of urine flow

- Genital - contractions during pregnancy, propulsion of sperm

- Respiratory tract - regulation of bronchiole diameter

- Integument - raises hair with erector pili muscle

- Sensory - dilation and constriction of the pupil as well as changing lens shape
