The history should determine the circumstances surrounding the drowning; one needs to know if the individual died accidentally or if it was a homicide or suicide. Intentional deaths in newborns are not uncommon and the risk factors include:

- Maternal depression

- Unwed mother

- Young mother

- Financial crises

- Inability to cope with a newborn

Someone who is drowning or nearly drowning usually has a history of struggling to breathe after an extended period of water submersion. The skin may appear blue or pale from lack of oxygen in the blood. The patient may be in respiratory distress with apnea or shallow breathing, have an altered level of consciousness, be coughing, fatigued, or have other neurological findings.
