Traditional surgical treatment of adrenal cortical hyperplasia harbors several complications, with the most common one being any type of bleeding, occurring during or after the surgical process in more than one out of five patients. Moreover, a couple of more surgery-related complications are incisional hernia and wound complications. Most predictable medical complication related to surgical adrenalectomy includes the metabolic effect of systemic elimination of cortisol. Among laparoscopic-related complications, infectious and thromboembolic morbidities are more common in devastating events.
