The common workup required to diagnose normocytic normochromic anemia includes the following:

- CBC with differential - repeat if there is an acute drop; also, rule out any dilutional effect - usually observed in a patient receiving a substantial amount of fluids in a short period of time, and is associated with an equal drop in other cell lines.

- Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)

Reticulocyte count must be obtained to determine the pathophysiologic mechanism of anemia. Increased reticulocyte count demonstrates hemolysis; other evidence related to increased RBC destruction, e.g., increased LDH, increased indirect bilirubin level, decreased haptoglobin, etc., should also be taken into consideration. A decreased reticulocyte count is associated with a hypoproliferative state like aplastic anemias, kidney disease, hypothyroidism, etc.

- Corrected reticulocyte count = percent reticulocytes x (patient's HCT/normal HCT)

- Peripheral smear - Erythrocyte morphology (shape and size; absence of schistocytes rules out microangiopathic hemolysis; microspherocytes indicate hemolysis; rouleaux formation relates to multiple myeloma.

- LDH, haptoglobin, bilirubin - to rule out hemolysis

- Iron panel (iron, ferritin, TIBC, transferrin saturation)

If normocytic normochromic anemia with a secondary cause is suspected, the following tests should be done as per diagnosis/clinical suspicion:

- Renal failure: BUN/creatinine, erythropoietin level (end-stage renal disease)

- Autoimmune causes: ANA, ESR, CRP, and other studies depending on symptoms and signs

- Hypothyroidism: Thyroid function tests

- Multiple myeloma: Serum and urine electrophoresis, serum and urine free light chains

- Aplastic anemia: Drug exposure, infections (EBV, hepatitis, CMV, HIV, parvovirus), hematologic malignancies, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)

- Pure red cell aplasia: Test for parvovirus B19, exclude thymoma
