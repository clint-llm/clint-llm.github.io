Thorough knowledge of the heart and the major vessels in the mediastinum is required to understand the transplant procedure. Historically, two types of transplant procedures have been described:

- Orthotopic heart transplant involving excision of the recipient's heart and implantation of a donor's heart in the chest of the recipient

- Heterotropic heart transplant in which the recipient's heart is not excised and the donor's heart is implanted into the recipient's chest
