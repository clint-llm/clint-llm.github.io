Sickle cell hepatopathy (SCH) encompasses several different entities, which can be broadly divided into acute and chronic presentations. Acute sickle cell hepatic crisis, hepatic sequestration, intrahepatic cholestasis, and overt liver failure are some of the common entities of acute SCH. More chronically, SCH includes viral hepatitis, transfusion overload, gallstone disease, and sickle cell cholangiopathy. Each entity has its own particular presentation, evaluation, and management. This activity describes the evaluation and management of patients with SCH and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the most common presentations of each of the different entities of sickle cell hepatopathy.
- Describe the pathophysiology of the acute and chronic entities of sickle cell hepatopathy. 
- Identify physical examination and laboratory findings associated with each of the different manifestations of sickle cell hepatopathy.
- Summarize management considerations by the interprofessional team for patients with sickle cell hepatopathy.
