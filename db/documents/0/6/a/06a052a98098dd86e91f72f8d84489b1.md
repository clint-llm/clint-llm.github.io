A TKA system will consist of instrumentation that helps the surgeon prepare the ends of the femur, tibia, and patella to receive an implant.Â  The instrumentation will be specific to the brand and type of implant being used with each company and model having specific intricacies.

In general, the instrumentation will consist of:

- Intramedullary femoral guide to help establish the distal femoral alignment

- Distal femoral cutting guide

- Femoral sizing guide

- 4-in-1 femoral cutting guide

- Extramedullary or intramedullary tibial guide

- Proximal tibial cutting guide

- Patella sizing guide

- Femoral component trial

- Tibial baseplate trial

- Patellar button trial

- Trial plastic bearing

The final implants will come in individual sterile packages and will consist of:

- Femoral component, typically made of cobalt-chrome

- Tibial component, typically made of cobalt-chrome or titanium

- Tibial polyethylene bearing, made of an ultra high molecular weight (UHMW) polyethylene

- Patellar button, made of UHMW polyethylene
