The deep cervical fasciae of the neck, since its first description in the early 1800s, have been a source of considerable controversy amongst anatomists. Several different classification systems for these anatomic structures have been proposed based on topographic morphology, embryologic origin, and surgical approach. The most commonly accepted classification system found in the literature is by topographic morphology (i.e., basic anatomy), however considerable variation in the nomenclature and anatomic description of these facial layers exist.

This discussion will consider the topographic morphology of the deep cervical fascia. By this classification system, the deep cervical fascia of the neck can subdivide into the investing layer, pretracheal and prevertebral layers, also known as the external, middle and deep layers respectively. The pretracheal, or middleÂ layer, can be further subdivided into the muscular and visceral divisions. The deep fascia of the neck lies deep to the superficial cervical fascia, a layer that is integral to the subcutaneous tissue and invests the platysma muscle.

The deep fasciae of the neck are anatomic structures with crucial clinical significance for both surgical procedures and in the spread of infection and neoplasia.
