MALToma is a cancer of one of the blood cell types, but it can involve any organ, and hence, symptoms depend on the location where it forms. The presenting symptoms can be non-specific at times, so patients must seek advice from healthcare professionals. MALTomas formed in the stomach are mostly related to the stomach infection due to H. pylori bacteria and fortunately can be treated with antibiotics. If being managed for MALTomas, the patient must adhere to regular follow-ups as MALTomas increase the likelihood of other types of cancers even after successful treatment. Regular follow-ups may include talking to a doctor and having exams. Also, patients must keep an eye on the recurrence of the symptoms. For the MALTomas formed inside the stomach, there are follow-up tests to confirm that the H. pylori infection has gone away. These include breath tests, checking a stool sample, and upper endoscopy.
