V. vulnificus is a lethal disease. All-case overall mortality is approximately 35%. Mortality rates approaching 50% to 60% are seen in patients who present with underlying hepatic or immunosuppressive disease, as compared to 16% in those without an underlying disease (risk ratio 1.84, 95% CI 1.41-2.85). All patients presenting with sepsis have an overall mortality rate of 50%, but those treated with antibiotics after 72 hours (from arrival) have mortality rates approaching 100%. Delayed surgical debridement of patients manifesting necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis have mortality rates approaching 100%. The overall death rate for all patients presenting with wound infection is 25%. Death in patients manifesting primarily limited gastroenteritis is rare.

Though the prevalence of V. vulnificus infection is low, it is the leading cause of all seafood-related deaths in the United States (95% of all cases).

Certain serologic markers are useful not only for diagnosis but in mortality prediction. Tissue necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) level and real-time PCR V. vulnificus DNA load level in blood sampled on arrival are both significantly higher in those dying as opposed to those surviving.
