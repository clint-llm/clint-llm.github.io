Various histochemical tests can be performed on gastric mucosa to depict the composition of the parietal cell membrane. Research has demonstrated that parietal cells contain little to no acid mucosubstance. Even though acidic glycoproteins, such as sialoproteins and sulfated glycoproteins, are found on the surface of these cells, the only fundic cell found to have mucopolysaccharides is the chief cell.
