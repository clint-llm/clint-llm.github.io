The indications of a colostomy are divided on the basis of the type of colostomy:

A double-barrel colostomy is a type of colostomy done after bowel resections involving the mesentery and is done in conditions like colorectal cancers, after resection of gangrenous bowel segments, inflammatory bowel disease, penetrating bowel injuries or after resection of gangrenous sigmoid volvulus.

A loop colostomy may be done in case of penetrating abdominal injury, colorectal cancer, intraoperative bowel injury, perineal injury, a diverticular disease with obstruction, blunt abdominal injury, protection of a distal anastomosis, anal incontinence or perineal injury, Fournier gangrene involving the perianal region and perianal fistulas. They may also be done in case of anorectal malformations or Hirschsprung disease in the neonatal population as a temporary emergency measure before correction surgery can be performed.

An end colostomy, after Hartmann procedure, is the most common type of colostomy worldwide. It is done in case of gangrenous sigmoid volvulus, colorectal cancer after abdominoperineal resection, ileo-sigmoid knotting, penetrating abdominal injury, ulcerative colitis, intussusception, anastomotic leak, anorectal cancer, and perineal injury. It involves the closure of the distal segment with fixation to the abdominal wall. Stomal closure, in this case, requires midline exploration and is hence least preferred in case colostomy is planned as a temporary measure, when there is an adequate distal segment, but this is a rare scenario.
