Although the treatment of hand infections is specific to the particular pathology, several basic tenets of management exist. Conservative management of infections includes splint immobilization, soaks, and elevation in addition to adequate antimicrobial coverage. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage should be started while awaiting objective culture data, and with consideration to preliminary gram stain results and epidemiologic clues.

The typical treatment for chronic paronychia is the avoidance of predisposing factors and the application of topical antifungals and steroids. In certain cases, additional oral antibiotics may be included in the management of chronic paronychia to cover for potential secondary bacterial infections.

Deeper infections more frequently require intravenous antibiotic treatment and prompt surgical management. In certain cases of flexor tenosynovitis, a trial of intravenous antibiotics under close inpatient observation may be attempted, provided the patient presents within 24 hours of symptom onset.

Given their location and deep anatomic connections, infections of the flexor tendons, web spaces, and deep spaces of the hand require incision and drainage to eradicate the infection and prevent further contiguous spread.
