Bedside examination of agraphia by a clinician provides the initial characterization of writing dysfunction. In equivocal cases, a more extensive assessment can help further characterize agraphia. Specialized tests such as the Western Aphasia Battery or Boston Diagnostic Aphasia examination conducted by a speech and language pathologist can provide more granularity than a bedside clinical assessment and can aid in tracking the severity of agraphia.

Once agraphia is identified, localization should be clinically correlated to determine the underlying cause of the agraphia and guide further diagnostic workup. In some cases, as in the writerâ€™s cramp, history and examination are sufficient to establish a diagnosis. Brain imaging with computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often useful to localize or identify lesions causing agraphia, especially if caused by stroke. Volumetric MRI or neuropsychological testing may be helpful in cases of suspected dementia. Dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography with an injection of ioflupane I-123 may aid in distinguishing idiopathic Parkinsonism from drug-induced Parkinsonism or essential tremor.
