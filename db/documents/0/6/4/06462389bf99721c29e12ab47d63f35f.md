In terms of clinical significance and diagnostic accuracy, stress echocardiography has an advantage in terms of specificity over standard exercise electrocardiography. When compared to nuclear perfusion imaging studies, stress echocardiography has similar accuracy, with a moderate sensitivity gap that is well balanced by a higher specificity. Both dipyridamole and dobutamine have overall good tolerance and feasibility. The choice of one test over the other depends on patients' clinical characteristics and the physician's preference. Diagnostic accuracy can significantly be affected by antianginal medical therapy, particularly beta-blocking agents, and therefore, it is recommended to withhold medical therapy at the time of testing to avoid a false-negative result.
