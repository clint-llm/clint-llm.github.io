**Physical exploration:**Clinical signs and symptoms of Achilles tendinopathy include localized pain, focal or diffuse sensitivity,  swelling, stiffness/morning pain, perceived rigidity in the Achilles tendon, positive arc sign, Royal London Hospital test, and Thompson test.

Tests used to diagnose Achilles tendinopathy:

- **Lateral and axial calcaneus x-rays:**May detect calcifications in the proximal extension of the tendon insertion or bony prominences in the upper portion of the calcaneus. Also, x-rays can help exclude pathological bone tumors.

- **Ultrasound:**Can help assess injury to the tendon

- **Magnetic Resonance Imaging:**Provides significant information about the state of joint structures with a study in multiple planes in static and dynamic views.

- **Computed Tomography (CT):**The CT scan is useful to rule out trabecular structural alterations of the calcaneus in Achilles pathology of insertion. However, it exposes the patient to radiation**.**

- **Victoria Institute of Sports Assessment - Achilles (VISA-A)**remains the gold standard for assessing pain and function,
