Equine mortality is significant and is estimated to be 19-83% during epizootic outbreaks. Fatality rates are much lower in humans, and less than 1% of cases are lethal. Adults are more likely to develop febrile flu-like illness. Children are at greater risk for developing neurological disease or encephalitis.
