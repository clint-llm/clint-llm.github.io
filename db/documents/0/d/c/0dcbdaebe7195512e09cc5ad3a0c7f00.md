The muscle is normally electrically silent outside the end-plate zone. Therefore, abnormal spontaneous activity is considered when there is the persistence of spontaneous activity outside of the end-plate zone, usually defined as lasting more than 3 seconds on an EMG recording. This activity outlines abnormal spontaneous electromyographic activity seen in a variety of specific pathologies and diseases and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the function and key concepts of abnormal spontaneous electromyographic activity.
- Describe the issues of concern regarding abnormal spontaneous electromyographic activity.
- Describe the clinical significance of abnormal spontaneous electromyographic activity.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to elucidate the significance of spontaneous electromyographic activity to improve patient outcomes.
