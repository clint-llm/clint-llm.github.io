Latent TB infection is prevalent, and treatment of patients with LTBI can reduce the burden of active tuberculosis, especially if screening is performed in populations at high risk for progression to active disease. Current United States guidelines endorse the use of either the TST or IGRA test for this purpose, although there are some minor differences in their performance in some populations. In general, both types of tests should not be used routinely in individual patients. A decision to test should presuppose intention to treat LTBI if detected.
