Basilar invagination is an abnormality at the craniovertebral junction, either congenital or degenerative, resulting in the odontoid prolapsing into the already limited space of the foramen magnum. It is commonly associated with conditions such as Chiari malformation, syringomyelia, and Klippel-Feil syndrome. Clinical presentations can range from chronic headaches, limited neck motion, and acute neurologic deterioration. CT and MRI are critical to diagnosing and managing this condition, including operative planning when needed. Determining the need for operative intervention is controversial in asymptomatic patients, but those at risk of neurologic compromise could require preoperative cervical traction and algorithmic surgical strategies. This activity outlines the evaluation, management, and reviews upon the latest anatomical basis pertaining to basilar invaginations pathogenesis and addresses the paradigm shift related to its surgical management.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pathophysiology of basilar invagination.
- Explain the clinical signs and symptoms and outline characteristic radiological findings among patients with basilar invagination.
- Outline recent advances in the guidelines for managing Group A and Group B variants of basilar invaginations.
- Summarize common complications associated with different approaches for managing basilar invagination and how the interprofessional team can provide appropriate coordinated care to improve outcomes.
