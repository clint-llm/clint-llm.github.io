Since undifferentiated connective tissue disease is considered a diagnosis of exclusion, the diagnosis of this disease should not be established until an extensive workup has been evaluated. Other connective tissue diseases should be considered while evaluating any patient presenting with features of this disease. Nonetheless, features of connective tissue diseases can overlap; thus, early differentiation is a must to initiate appropriate treatment, monitor patients, and predict the prognosis. However, some disease criteria can also overlap and further complicate the diagnostic workup in some patients who present with a possible connective tissue disease.
