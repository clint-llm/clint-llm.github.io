Anosmia is the inability to perceive smell/odor. It can be temporary or permanent and acquired or congenital. There are many causes. Neurological causes can include disturbances to the sensory nerves that make up the olfactory bulb or anywhere along the path in which the signal of smell is transferred to the brain. From the olfactory bulb, the signal is further processed by several other structures of the brain, including the piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. Any blockage or destruction of the pathway along which smell is transferred and processed may result in anosmia. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of anosmia and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the causes of anosmia.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with anosmia.
- Describe the treatment and management options available for anosmia.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with anosmia and improve outcomes.
