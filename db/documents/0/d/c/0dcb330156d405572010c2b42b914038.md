There is an absolute contraindication in patients with known hypersensitivity to chlordiazepoxide, other benzodiazepines or its components, and the patient who has angle-closure glaucoma. Strong drug interactions exist with the use of another CNS depressant or opioid medications. Respiratory depression, increased sedation, coma, and death can occur if taking these two drugs simultaneously. If it is necessary to use an opioid and chlordiazepoxide together, using the lowest possible dose with the shortest duration would help decrease the likelihood of respiratory depression. Clinicians should use this medication cautiously in people with pulmonary disease. An increased risk of suicidal ideation exists in a patient with major depressive disorder. It is not recommended for a pregnant patient or planning to get pregnant due to the potential risk of congenital anomalies, especially during the first trimester. Chlordiazepoxide may reduce the mental and physical abilities needed for the performance of some tasks, including driving a vehicle or operating heavy machinery. Likewise, it may diminish mental alertness in children.
