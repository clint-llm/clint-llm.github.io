A child's skull is thinner and more pliable than an adult skull, thus providing less protection to the brain. Head trauma is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in children. It is a regular presentation in the Paediatric Emergency Department (PED) and primary care. Suspected pediatric skull fractures should be evaluated using a CT, plain radiograph, MRI, and ultrasound to determine the extent of the injury. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of pediatric skull fractures and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the unique anatomy of a child's skull vs. an adult.
- Identify the important factors in an examination for a pediatric skull fracture, including diagnostic imaging, and cite possible evidence of child abuse.
- Outline management and treatment strategies for a pediatric skull fracture.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members for close follow to ensure safe outcomes in those with pediatric skull fractures.
