Erythema annulare centrifugum (EAC) is an annular, erythematous lesion that appears as an urticaria-like papule and enlarges centrifugally, then clears centrally. A fine scale is sometimes present inside the advancing edge, known as a trailing scale. Erythema annulare centrifugum is classified as a reactive erythema and has been associated with many different conditions, including malignancy. When erythema annulare centrifugum occurs as part of a paraneoplastic phenomenon, it is called paraneoplastic erythema annulare centrifugum eruption (PEACE). PEACE is more commonly seen in females, typically precedes the clinical diagnosis of malignancy, and may recur with subsequent relapses. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of erythema annulare centrifugum and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of erythema annulare centrifugum.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with erythema annulare centrifugum.
- Review the management options available for erythema annulare centrifugum.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and management of erythema annulare centrifugum and improve outcomes.
