Levofloxacin is a bactericidal antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone drug class that directly inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis. Levofloxacin promotes the breakage of DNA strands by inhibiting DNA-gyrase in susceptible organisms, which inhibits the relaxation of supercoiled DNA.

Of the fluoroquinolone class, levofloxacin has the most enhanced activity against gram-positive penicillin-sensitive and resistant organisms, notably, Streptococcus pneumoniae) and reduced action against gram-negative bacilli, notably Pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared to ciprofloxacin. Levofloxacin has effectiveness against other common respiratory organisms, notably Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella spp, Mycoplasma spp, and Chlamydia pneumoniae.****has a higher in-vitro activity againstmycobacterium tuberculosis and is preferred over the other fluoroquinolones as second-line antitubercular therapy.

There is a growing concern about drug resistance to fluoroquinolones worldwide, which can occur through chromosome-encoded or plasmid-mediated mechanisms.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**Levofloxacin is rapidly absorbed and widely distributed in the body. The bioavailability of levofloxacin is 99%; therefore, levofloxacin's intravenous and oral preparations are used interchangeably. The time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) is approximately 1.5 hours.

**Distribution:**The volume of distribution of levofloxacin generally varies from 74 Liters to 112 Liters(single and multiple 500 mg or 750 mg doses), demonstrating extensive distribution in body tissues. Outcomes of the study suggest that levofloxacin is widely distributed in the skin, muscles, liver, kidney, and spleen. Drug concentrations in tissues and fluids are typically higher than in plasma. Levofloxacin has plasma protein binding of  24–38 %; it binds primarily to albumin.

**Metabolism:**Levofloxacin undergoes little hepatic metabolism in humans and is eliminated unchanged in the urine.

**E****xcretion:**Levofloxacin clearance is primarily via the renal route (87%). The mean plasma elimination half-life (t) of levofloxacin is approximately 6 to 8 hours following single or multiple doses of levofloxacin.
