The immune system has two arms, the more ancient innate immune system and the more recently evolved adaptive immune system. The innate immune system is non-specific to individual pathogens and cannot build memory. It is a first-line defense that consists of the skin, saliva, tears, bacterial flora, and numerous cells and proteins, including complement, lysozyme, white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.

On the other hand, the adaptive immune system is capable of mounting specific immune responses against pathogens encountered in the past due to its capability to build memory. The adaptive immune system utilizes B- and T- lymphocytes and their products, immunoglobulins, and cytokines to generate a highly specific response that becomes more efficient at attacking a certain pathogen with each subsequent exposure.

To protect against a wide variety of pathogens, host receptors on lymphocytes undergo extensive gene rearrangement and somatic mutation processes to create a repertoire of receptors that recognize a vast amount of antigens. Upon recognition, the adaptive immune system delivers a message of either immunity or tolerance. Tolerance refers to the process where "self" antigens found normally in the body are prevented from mounting an immune response, while "non-self" antigens mount the appropriate response. When the tolerance process fails, autoimmunity can manifest. Both central and peripheral tolerance are crucial in preventing autoimmunity.
