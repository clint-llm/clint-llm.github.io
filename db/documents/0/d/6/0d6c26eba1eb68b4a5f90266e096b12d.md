Frey syndrome is often seen as a minor complication, and its significance to patients is frequently underestimated by surgeons. When surveyed, many patients do not recall being adequately educated on the risk of developing Frey syndrome after parotid surgery.

The social impact of Frey syndrome should not be overlooked. In a questionnaireÂ given to patients who underwent parotidectomy for benign salivary diseases, gustatory sweating was identified as the most serious and concerning complication. Patients reported reduced quality of life, difficulty enjoying meals, and overall discomfort that worsened over time.
