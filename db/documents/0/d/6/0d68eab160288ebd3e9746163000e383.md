Following a basic history and exam, some investigations are necessary to diagnose the common and urgent causes of upper airway obstruction.

**Flexible Laryngoscopy**

No comprehensive ENT examination is complete without flexible nasendoscopy/ laryngoscopy to assess the pharynx and larynx dynamically. This can help diagnose turbinate inflammation, septal deviation, adenoidal hypertrophy, Waldeyer’s ring hypertrophy, or laryngeal/hypopharyngeal pathology. It is particularly useful when assessing the dynamic function of the larynx. A dynamic assessment is essential when assessing vocal cord movement and relatively common conditions affecting the larynx, such as laryngomalacia in children. It can also diagnose a laryngeal tumor in adults.

**Oxygen Saturation**

Oxygen saturations are an essential first step in assessing a patient with airway obstruction, as it can act as a marker for the severity of their obstruction.

**Imaging**

Imaging studies help delineate the affected anatomical area and can also aid in the diagnosis of the cause of obstruction. Ultrasound or MRI are the imaging modalities of choice in children, as they do not involve radiation.

**Sleep Study**

To formally assess OSA, a sleep study or polysomnography should be performed. The important results of a sleep study are the patient’s oxygen nadir and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). The AHI averages the number of apneic and hypopneic episodes that occur per hour. An AHI of anything above 1 is abnormal in a child, and there is a grading system of severity for increasing numbers of AHI in adults.
