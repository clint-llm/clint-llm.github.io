Gambierdiscus toxicus is a dinoflagellate responsible for the production of various toxins that can cause Ciguatera toxicity. These include ciguatoxin, maitotoxin, palytoxin, scaritoxin, and palytoxin. Predator species in tropical waters are most likely to cause ciguatera toxicity. Barracudas, groupers, moray eels, snapper, and amberjacks are commonly implicated, but it is also found in over 400 species of reef fish. Ciguatoxin is tasteless, odorless, lipid-soluble, and heat-resistant, so normal cooking cannot detoxify ciguatoxin-laden fish.
