Bronchiolitis is most common in children less than 2 years of age. During the first year of life, the incidence has been reported to be about 11% to 15%. Depending on the severity of the infection, there are at least 5 hospitalizations for every 1000 children younger than 2 years of age. Bronchiolitis is classically a seasonal disorder that is most common during autumn and winter, but sporadic cases may occur throughout the year. Some of the risk factors that have been identified for severe infections include the following:

- History of prematurity (less than 32 to 34 weeks gestational age)

- Age younger than 3 months

- Neuromuscular disease

- Congenital heart disease

- Chronic lung illness
