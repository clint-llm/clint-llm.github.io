Sigmoid volvulus is typically caused by two mechanisms i.e. chronic constipation and a high-fiber diet. In both instances, the sigmoid colon becomes dilated and loaded with stools, making it susceptible to torsion. The direction of the volvulus is counterclockwise. With repeated attacks of torsion, there is a shortening of mesentery due to chronic inflammation. Subsequently, there is the development of adhesions which then entrap the sigmoid colon into a fixed twisted position. Cecal volvulus can be either organoaxial (cecocolic or true cecal volvulus) or mesentericoaxial (cecal bascule). In the organoaxial variety, the ascending colon and distal ileum twist around each other in a clockwise manner. However, in the mesentericoaxial sub-type, the caecum is not completely fixed and is located anteriorly over the ascending colon at a right angle to the mesentery. Since there is no twisting of the vascular pedicle, vascular compromise is rarely associated with cecal volvulus.
