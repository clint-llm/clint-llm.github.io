Since most C. perfringens-associated acute diarrheal disease is self-limiting, only supportive care is needed to maintain a euvolemic state. Antibiotics are generally not indicated.

The exception is clostridial sepsis, which is a medical emergency. Clostridial sepsis often presents in septic shock with possible intravascular hemolysis due to CPA-mediated destruction of red blood cells. In this situation, early antibiotic treatment with penicillin G and clindamycin, tetracycline, or metronidazole in combination with surgical debridement of necrotic tissue may help to prevent death.

A suspicion ofÂ clostridial myonecrosis warrants a surgical consultation. Consultation should not be delayed waiting for laboratory or imaging results. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be promptly administered. In addition, hyperbaric oxygen is shown to improve outcomes in cases of severe infection.
