**Root Canal Sealers**

**Zinc Oxide Eugenol (ZOE) Sealers**

Advantages:

- Absorption, if extruded past the apex

- Anti-inflammatory effects

- Antimicrobial effects

Disadvantages:

- Transition into a weak, porous state upon setting

- Shrinkage upon setting

**Calcium Hydroxide Sealers**

Advantages

- Antimicrobial properties

- Milder cytotoxicity

- Promotes tissue healing

Disadvantages

- Solubility

**Glass Ionomer (GI) Sealers**

Advantages:

- Improved adherence (via dentin bonding)

- Increased resistance to root fracture

- Enhanced resistance to solubility in tissue fluids

- Antimicrobial properties

- Sustained fluoride release

Disadvantages:

- Technically difficult to prepare deep aspects of root canal (potentially limits dentin-bonding ability)

- Difficult to remove in cases of endodontic retreatment

**Resin Sealers**

Advantages:

- Improved adherence

- Enhanced tolerability of apical tissues

Disadvantages:

- Technically difficult to prepare deep aspects of root canal (potentially limits dentin-bonding ability)

- Difficult to remove in cases of endodontic retreatment

- Potential for allergic and mutagenic bodily responses

- Shrinkage upon setting

**Bioceramic Sealers**

Advantages:

- Biocompatible

- Ability to promote biomineralization

- Enhanced bonding between dentin and core material

- Dimensional stability upon setting

Disadvantages:

- Technically difficult to manipulate

- Expensive

- Shorter shelf-life (cv. other sealers)

**Core Obturation Materials**

**Gutta Percha**

Advantages:

- Ease of manipulation

- Radiopaque

- Low toxicity and plasticity

- Relatively inexpensive

Disadvantages:

- No dentin-bonding properties

- Material shrinkage upon setting

**Bioceramic Core Obturation Materials******

Advantages:

- Biocompatible

- Ability to promote biomineralization

- High fracture resistance

- Antimicrobial

- Dimensional stability upon setting

Disadvantages:

- Technically difficult to manipulate

- Expensive

- Shorter shelf-life (cv. other core materials)
