The UGH syndrome appears to arise from the repetitive mechanical iris or ciliary body trauma by a malpositioned or subluxated lens.

The surface of intraocular lenses, especially PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate), activates the plasma-derived enzymes. The contaminants may cause toxicity on the IOL surface during manufacturing. Poorly manufactured edges, iris-claw intraocular lenses, or rigid closed-looped lenses were more prone to cause iris chafing, but the newer generations of lenses have reduced their risk due to their better designs, fabrications, and improved surgical techniques.

Poor finish of the edges (serrated, sharpened, or uneven), warped footplates, imperfect polishing, and finishing of injection-molded intraocular lenses lead to the mechanical excoriation of the iris, which increased the risk of the UGH Syndrome.

The UGH syndrome was originally reported with ACIOLs. Material, edges of the implant, manufacturing process, and quality control are important factors influencing the occurrence of the UGH syndrome. The ACIOL should be properly sized (ACIOL diameter= horizontal white to white diameter in mm + 1 mm).

Smaller ACIOLs are unstable and may rotate or tilt, causing damage to the anterior segment structures. A larger ACIOL causes damage to the angle, and the vault may touch and decompensate the corneal endothelium.

PCIOLs placed in the sulcus may irritate the posterior iris surface and cause UGH syndrome. Specifically, single-piece acrylic PCIOLs with square optic edges and thick square haptics or small uniplanar haptics may rub the posterior pigmented surface of the iris. Multi-piece PCIOL with posterior angulation (causing a posterior shift of the optic), smooth optic surface, and round edges is preferred for placement at the ciliary sulcus.
