Alport syndrome is commonly present at a young age, from 5Â to 20 years of age. These children present with chronic haematuria before the fourth decade, depending on the collagen mutation. Sensorineural hearing loss manifests in adulthood. X-linked Alport syndrome affects more men than women.

Anterior lenticonus usually presents bilaterally in patients with Alport syndrome, a hereditary systemic pathology with a prevalence of 1/5000 in the normal population. Out of all patients, approximately 85% are X-linked, 10% have autosomal recessive inheritance, and autosomal dominant 5%.

Progressive renal failure, sensorineural hearing loss, and ocular manifestations develop in approximately 11 to 43% of the patients. Flecked retinopathy and anterior lenticonus are seen in approximately 25% of the patients with X-linked Alport. PPCD is seen in very few patients.
