The treatment for subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord is the supplementation of vitamin B12 either in oral or parenteral form. The specific route and duration of therapy are determined by the underlying cause of vitamin B12 deficiency. Patients with Crohn's disease and celiac disease should be monitored for signs and symptoms, and declining levels of vitamin B12 levels. In patients with chronic conditions that can deplete vitamin B12 levels such as celiac disease, pernicious anemia, and Crohn's disease post-resection, indefinite supplementation of vitamin B12Â is warranted.

Oral administration is indicated in conditions where dietary deficiency of vitamin B12 is identified as the cause. Parenteral administration is the route preferred in symptomatic anemia or severe neurological dysfunction. Upon the resolution of symptoms, the oral route of administration may be used. Parenteral administration is also indicated in malabsorption is determined to be the cause, such as celiac disease or pernicious anemia. However, sufficient evidence exists to support oral administration even in these conditions if the dose is high enough to generate a favorable response.
