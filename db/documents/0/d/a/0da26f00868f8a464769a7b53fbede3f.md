Mastery learning has also been studied for clinical skills. A recent study examined its utility for the achievement of Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs), core skills that are part of competency measures in undergraduate medical education. The EPAs are various skills that medical students should achieve before entering into residency and should be able to complete without supervision.

Robinson et al. studied the effect of an online training program for the detection of melanomas. Their analysis revealed that a mastery training program decreased unnecessary referrals to dermatologists for benign skin lesions and led to an increase in referrals for melanomas.

Another study examined the use of mastery learning for communication skills, specifically difficult conversations like breaking bad news. This represents an important method for assessing learners on skills that affect patient-provider relationships.
