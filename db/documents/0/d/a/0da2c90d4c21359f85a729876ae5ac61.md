Acute postpartum hemorrhage has several potential causes and can be mainly divided into primary and secondary. Primary causes of postpartum hemorrhage include:

- Uterine atony

- Genital tract lacerations

- Retained placenta

- Uterine inversion

- Abnormal placentation

- Coagulation disorders

Uterine atony, or lack of effective contraction of the uterus, is the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Postpartum hemorrhage in a previous pregnancy is a significant risk factor and providers should make all the effort to establish its severity and cause.

Secondary causes of postpartum hemorrhage include:

- Retained products of conception

- Infection

- Subinvolution of the placental site

- Inherited coagulation deficits
