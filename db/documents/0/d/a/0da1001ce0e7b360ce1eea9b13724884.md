Macrosomia and its complications and its risk factors can be subdivided under two broad categories:

**Maternal Complications**

- Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH): postpartum hemorrhage typically refers to excessive blood loss (greater than 500 mL) with vaginal delivery or loss of 1000 mL of blood or greater with the cesarian section. PPH is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide as well as in industrialized nations; it is one of the top three causes of maternal mortality. One of the most significant contributors to postpartum hemorrhage is uterine atony, which arises from the over-distention of the pregnant uterus and can be further complicated by macrosomic pregnancies.

- Perineal trauma of various degrees: this arises from the prolongation of the second phase of labor and operative vaginal deliveries, both of which are associated with the delivery of macrosomic babies.

- Prolongation of the second phase of labor

**Fetal Complications**

- Shoulder dystocia: this refers to the mechanical inability to deliver the anterior fetal shoulder after delivery of the fetal head and is also associated with injury to the clavicle and brachial plexus. The occurrence of shoulder dystocia after vaginal deliveries varies with the weight of the newborn. There is a 1 percent chance of shoulder dystocia in newborns with birth weight less than 4000 g and about a 5 to 10 percent chance for the newborn with a birth weight of 4000 to 4500 grams

- Fetal distress

- Congenital anomalies: most of which are associated with infants of diabetic mother includes congenital heart diseases, caudal regression syndrome, small left colon syndrome, spinal bifida, etc.

- Metabolic and electrolyte imbalance, e.g., hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypoglycemia

- Polycythemia

- Hyperbilirubinemia
