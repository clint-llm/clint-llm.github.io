Pancuronium bromide is a long-acting, bis-quaternary aminosteroid, non-depolarizing, neuromuscular blocking drug (NMBD), which was first synthesized in 1964 and found to possess fewer adverse effects with regards to hemodynamic stability and histamine release as compared to the prototypical NMBD, d-tubocurarine.

The FDA-approved indications for pancuronium are similar to those of other NMBDs and include laryngeal muscle relaxation that facilitates endotracheal intubation, skeletal muscle relaxation to support optimal surgical conditions and exposure, and chest wall and diaphragmatic muscle relaxation to improve thoracic compliance in mechanically ventilated patients.

NMBDs are an adjunctive therapy that may decrease the inflammatory response associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and lead to reduced mortality and barotrauma related to mechanical ventilation; however, the studies which investigated utilized a 48-hour infusion of cisatracurium rather than pancuronium or other NMBDs.
