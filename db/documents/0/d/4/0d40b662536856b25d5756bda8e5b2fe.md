Microphthalmia with cyst is a challenging entity, where patient as well parent education plays a significant role in dealing with its aesthetic, functional, and psychosocial ramifications. Maintenance and disciplined use of conformer therapy and orbital expanders should be encouraged. Proper counseling to help the family understand precisely the prognosis of the condition should be done. The value of a regular follow-up with the surgeon, the ocularist, and the rehabilitation team, should be explained to the patient and his/her family. Even with minimal visual potential, cosmetic and visual rehabilitation is of prime importance in achieving significantly better outcomes.
