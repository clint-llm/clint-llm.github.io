As with most toxicities, the key to management is prevention. If NSAID use is required in patient case management, physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners must aid their patients through medical optimization and reduction in risk factors that contribute to the development of NSAID adverse effects. Additionally, pharmacists are an integral part of the interprofessional team involved in the care of patients with acute or chronic conditions necessitating treatment with NSAIDs. It has been argued that pharmacists within the community are uniquely equipped to educate patients on medication use.
