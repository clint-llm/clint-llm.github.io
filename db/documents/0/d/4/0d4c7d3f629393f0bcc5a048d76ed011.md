The term pelvic kidney encompasses a range of anatomical abnormalities that occur when the kidney fails to rise from the pelvis in its metanephros stage during embryogenesis. Most cases are asymptomatic, although they are generally associated with higher risks for traumatic injury, urinary tract infections, renal calculi, and other urological problems. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of pelvic kidneys and highlights the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology and epidemiology of pelvic kidney.
- Review the common presentation and physical exam findings associated with a patient with a pelvic kidney.
- Outline the management considerations for patients with pelvic kidney.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with a pelvic kidney.
