Cavum septum pellucidum will not cause symptoms. Symptoms are more likely to occur with cavum septum pellucidum cysts though most of them are incidental findings. There are mainly three mechanisms described:

- Ball-valve phenomenon - Obstruction of interventricular foramina by the cyst leading to hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure.

- Compression of the hypothalamo-septal triangle (formed by the specific septal, periseptal nuclei, and associated projection pathways) - Leading to neuropsychiatric symptoms and compression of optic chiasm and pathways

- A chronic deep venous impairment - displacement and stretching of the internal cerebral and subependymal veins may cause progressive focal deficits.

The CSP cavity may expand to form a CSP cyst, probably due to an ability to secrete fluid internally. The well-accepted definition of a CSP cyst is a cystic structure having a width of 10 mm or more in the septum's region, the walls of which exhibiting lateral bowing.

CSP cyst classifies into two categories: communicating and noncommunicating cyst, depending on whether it communicates with the ventricles or not. Noncommunicating cyst may become communicatingÂ due to spontaneous rupture or during head trauma, diagnostic procedures (ventriculography and pneumoencephalography), or surgery. The reverse is also possible if fibrosis occurs at the site of communication.

CSP cysts can also classify as symptomatic or asymptomatic.
