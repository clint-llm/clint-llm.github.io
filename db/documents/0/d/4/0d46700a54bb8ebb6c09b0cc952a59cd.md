Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) is also known as alloimmune HDFN or erythroblastosis fetalis. It is caused by the destruction of neonatal red blood cells by maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. The formation of maternal antibodies in response to a fetal antigen is called isoimmunization. These antibodies form when fetal erythrocytes expressing certain red blood cell antigens that are not expressed in the mother cross the placenta and gain access to maternal blood. This antibody response may be sufficient enough to destroy fetal red cells leading to hemolysis, the release of bilirubin, and anemia. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of erythroblastosis fetalis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in administering RhoGAM (anti-D immunoglobulin or Rhesus factor IgG) on a timely basis.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of erythroblastosis fetalis.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with erythroblastosis fetalis.
- Describe the treatment options for erythroblastosis fetalis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to optimize outcomes for patients affected by erythroblastosis fetalis.
