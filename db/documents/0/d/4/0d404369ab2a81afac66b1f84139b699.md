Fallopian tubes, otherwise called oviducts or uterine tubes, are hollow seromuscular organs that originate at the uterine horns, extend laterally within the superior edge of the mesosalpinx of the broad ligament, and terminate near the ipsilateral ovary.Â They are 11 to 12 cm in length and have a lumen diameter of less than 1 mm.
