In the United States, the prevalence ofÂ night eating syndrome is 1.5%. NES prevalence is similar to other binge eating disorders like bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa.

A prevalence between 6 to 64% of NES was found among obese individuals looking for weight loss surgery in a review conducted by de Zwaan, Mitchell, Burgard, and Schenck. A study showed up to 55% of individuals seeking bariatric surgery have reported some symptoms of NES.

Those with night eating syndrome are more likely to have another eating disorder than the rest of the non-NES population, with a 5 to 44% prevalence.
