Croup is a common respiratory illness of the trachea, larynx, and bronchi that can lead to inspiratory stridor and barking cough. It is a self-limited disease that is seen in children under the age of 5. Laryngotracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis are all included in the spectrum of croup. Uncommon complications may include bacterial tracheitis, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and rarely, death. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of croup and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of croup.
