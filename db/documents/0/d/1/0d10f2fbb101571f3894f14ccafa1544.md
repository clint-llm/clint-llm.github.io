Facial reconstruction encompasses an array of techniques used to correct both cosmetic and functional deficits of the face, a large proportion of which are secondary to cutaneous malignancy excision (e.g., Mohs micrographic surgery). This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients undergoing facial reconstruction after Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). It explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients who undergo this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of facial reconstruction after Mohs micrographic surgery.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to facial reconstruction after Mohs micrographic surgery.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of facial reconstruction after Mohs micrographic surgery.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance facial reconstruction after Mohs micrographic surgery and improve outcomes.
