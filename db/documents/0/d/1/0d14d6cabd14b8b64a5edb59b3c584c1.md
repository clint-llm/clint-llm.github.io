Patients often present with acute, sharp pain in the Achilles tendon region. On physical exam, patients with Achilles tendon rupture cannot stand on their toes or have very weak plantar flexion of the ankle. Palpation may reveal a tendon discontinuity or signs of bruising around the posterior ankle.

The examiner performs the Thompson test to assess for Achilles tendon continuity in the setting of suspected rupture. The examiner places the patient in the prone position with the ipsilateral knee flexed to about 90 degrees. The foot/ankle is in the resting position. Upon squeezing the calf, the examiner notes the presence and degree of plantarflexion at the foot/ankle. This should be compared to the contralateral side. A positive (abnormal) test is strongly associated with Achilles rupture.
