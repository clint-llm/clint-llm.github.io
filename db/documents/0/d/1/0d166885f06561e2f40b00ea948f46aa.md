During embryology, the structures in the face and neck derive from the brachial apparatus, while the arteries in the face and neck derive from the aortic arches. Mesenchymal tissue is the embryonic tissue that will differentiate into blood vessels. The first aortic arch will form the maxillary artery. The maxillary artery will continue to elongate and form branches such as the inferior alveolar artery; this makes the inferior alveolar artery a derivative of the mesenchymal tissue from the first aortic arch.
