Several clinical tools and further research have emanated from and have undergone significant influence by Erikson’s Stages of Development:

- Studying Erikson’s stages serve as a basis of treatment for different recovery stages of mental illness.

- The Erikson Psychosocial Stage Inventory (EPSI) was based on Erikson’s stages, and the modified version following it (MEPSI) is a reliable tool used to assess psychosocial development.

- A model of psychodynamic psychotherapy is based on the concept and staging of Erikson’s theory.
