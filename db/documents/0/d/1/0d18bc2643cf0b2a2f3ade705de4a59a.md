Patients with Pythium keratitis usually present with a history of pain, redness, photophobia, blurring of vision, irritation, watering, and sometimes discharge.

The anterior segment findings are the same as that of the fungal corneal ulcer, including lid edema, blepharospasm, conjunctival congestion, discharge, epithelial defect, stromal infiltrate, feathery margins, satellite lesions, and stromal edema. Other closely mimicking features may include corneal melt, descemetocele, endothelial plaque, hypopyon, anterior chamber exudates, ring infiltrate, Wesseley’s immune ring, and corneal perforation (Figure 1).Pythium from other infective keratitis are stromal infiltrate with hyphenated edges, multifocal lesion, tentacular projections, peripheral furrowing with thinning, guttering, and an early tendency to spread towards the limbus.

The rare clinical features which resemble Acanthamoeba keratitis are radial keratoneuritis with stromal infiltrates.Acanthamoeba and Pythium infection, particularly with a history of contact lens use. A few clinical features can also mimic atypical Mycobacteria in the form of epithelial breach, greyish white stromal infiltrate, which is dry looking, cracked windshield appearance of the infiltrates,  stromal edema, and Descemet membrane folds.
