Viral hepatitis is the most common cause of liver failure, thus hepatorenal-syndrome, in developing countries. Most commonly, it is caused by Hepatitis B or, less commonly, Hepatitis C. In the developed world, the most common causes are drugs/medications; most commonly acetaminophen, chronic alcoholism or any drugs that induce cytochrome p450; and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Less common causes of liver failure leading to HRS include viruses such as CMV, HHV6, and Parvovirus B19. Alternatively, vascular phenomenon like hepatic/portal vein thrombosis and metabolic causes such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
