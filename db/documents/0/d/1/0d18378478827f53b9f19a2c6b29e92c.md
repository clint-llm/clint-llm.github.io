A variety of diseases may mimic or contribute to tenosynovitis; common examples appear below.

- Cellulitis/soft tissue infection may mimic symptoms of tenosynovitis, resulting in difficulty moving the affected joint from edema and pain.

- Joint-related diseases such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, pseudogout, psoriatic arthritis, and gout

- Recent or old trauma, including osseous or tendinous pathology, can often present similar to stenosing tenosynovitis.

- Dupuytren contractures can also appear as a case of stenosing tenosynovitis and are secondary to nodularity of the fascia causing chronic locking of the digits.
