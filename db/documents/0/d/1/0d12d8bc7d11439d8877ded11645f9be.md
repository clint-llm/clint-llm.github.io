The central retinal artery is the first intraorbital branch of the ophthalmic artery. It enters the optic nerve 1 cm posterior to the globe and supplies blood to the retina. Occlusion of the central retinal artery results in retinal ischemia, vision loss, and eventual necrosis. Acutely, CRAO results in retinal edema and pyknosis of the ganglion cell nuclei. As ischemia progresses the retinal becomes opacified and yellow-white in appearance. In experimental models of complete CRAO, permanent retinal damage occurs in just over 90 minutes.

In the clinical setting where occlusion may be incomplete, the return of vision may be achieved after delays of 8 to 24 hours. Approximately 15% of the population receives significant macular collateral circulation from the cilioretinal artery. Patients with this anatomical variant typically have less severe presentations and better long-term prognoses.
