Selenium deficiency is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes dietitians and nurses.  Selenium deficiency in North America is very rare. Clinicians need to be aware that selenium deficiency can present with many varying symptoms. Selenium deficiency is also more likely to be prevalent in a community as a whole, rather than just sporadic cases. Typically if it is suspected, either serum or “scalp hair” or nail selenium levels may be checked, and there is a good correlation between the two levels. The advantage of using the latter is that in endemic regions, it is easier to collect scalp hair samples by unskilled workers, rather than to try to collect blood samples to check for selenium levels. Public health nurses should be involved in the identification of high-risk populations. Dieticians should encourage patients to eat a healthy diet rather than focus on a single supplement. When there is a severe deficiency, the dosing of supplements should be reviewed by pharmacists. [Level 5]
