Although there are multiple theories regarding the pathophysiology and development of Zenker's diverticulum, no clear consensus exists. It is understood that a Zenker diverticulum involves impaired cricopharyngeal compliance, usually due to fibrotic changes, what causes increased intrabolus pressure with swallowing. As a result of this, the hypopharyngeal pressure increases, leading to herniation at the weak point just above the cricopharyngeus. The resulting false diverticulum retains food particles and salivary secretions leading to regurgitation, halitosis, dysphagia, and aspiration.

In most cases, Zenker diverticulum extends in the left neck and this is believed to be due to the slight convexity of the cervical esophagus.

In general, manometry is not used to evaluate patient's with Zenker diverticulum because the resulting pressure measurements are often confused with pressure generated by swallowing and contractions of the upper esophageal sphincter.
