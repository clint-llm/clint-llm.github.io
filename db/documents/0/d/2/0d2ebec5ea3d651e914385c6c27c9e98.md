The kidneys are surrounded by the renal plexus, whose fibers course along with the renal artery on each side. There is also input from the sympathetic nervous system, which can cause vasoconstriction and reduce blood flow in the renal vessels. The kidneys also receive parasympathetic nerve innervation via the vagus nerve â€” the sensory output from the kidneys gets transmitted to the spinal cord at the T10-T11 level. When the kidney is inflamed, the affected individual usually feels the referred pain along the flank.
