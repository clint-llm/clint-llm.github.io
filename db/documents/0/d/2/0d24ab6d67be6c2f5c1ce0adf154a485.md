The etiologic agents causing streptococcal meningitis vary by age group. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common etiologic agent of bacterial meningitis in children above one month and adults of all ages. In the U.S., the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis decreased from 0.8 per 100000 people in 1997 to 0.3 per 100000 people in 2010 (PCV 7 was introduced in 2000).S. pneumoniae infection is also the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in children, ranging from 22.5% in Europe to 41.1% in Africa.

In neonates, S. agalactiae is one of the leading pathogens responsible for meningitis. In the U.S., from 2006 to 2015, early-onset disease (onset at 0 to 6 days of life, EOD) incidence decreased from 0.37 to 0.23 per 1000 live births, mainly due to intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Late-onset disease (LOD) rates were stable in those years.S. viridans accounts for 0.3% to 3.0% of cases of bacterial meningitis in adults and 1% in children.
