A qualitative evaluation of uterine activity can be performed by palpation and the use of monitoring tools like an external tocodynamometer. This assessment is subjective since diagnosis of hypocontractility is based on the perception that contractions are infrequent and weak with less than 3 to 4 contractions/10 minutes, and duration is less than 45 seconds.

Another qualitative evaluation of progression is the cervical assessment by digital examination. This tracks the changes in cervical dilatation, effacement, and fetal station performed at standard timed intervals from admission time through the various stages of labor. These changes may be charted on a partogram, which aids in comparison with the expected lower limit of normal labor progress. A deviation to the right of the normal labor curve on the partograph denotes slow progress.

The internal pressure catheter is a device that measures the pressure generated by each contraction, recorded quantitatively in Montevideo units (MVU). Uterine activity less than 200 to 250 MVU is considered inadequate and unlikely to affect expected cervical dilation and fetal descent. This may be a more objective assessment than external monitoring in very obese women.
