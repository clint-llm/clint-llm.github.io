The pulmonary veins' function is to transport oxygenated blood from the lung alveoli into the left atria. Another set of veins also exist in the pulmonary system. The bronchial arteries and veins are the vessels responsible for delivering oxygen and carrying away carbon dioxide to the lung tissue itself. The right and left bronchial veins flow into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, respectively. There is slight variation in the network, and some bronchial veins may flow into the pulmonary veins.Â This drainage of the bronchial veins into the pulmonary veins results in a slightly diluted blood oxygen percentage level, somewhat less than the 100% that would be expected otherwise in the left atrium.
