Lactation is the most common association with breast infections, present in 10% to 33% of these women. Lactational mastitis is present in 2% to 3% of lactating women, and 5% to 11% of these patients may develop an abscess. This is most common in women of childbearing age, with a mean age of 32 years. Nonlactating breast abscesses have a wider age range, with a peak incidence in the fourth decade of life. There is a strong association between diabetes and smoking withÂ non-lactational breast abscesses. Obese patients and African Americans have a greater incidence of breast abscess. Nipple piercings have also been associated with subareolar breast abscesses in the nonlactating population.
