Ultrasound (US) is the key modality for the evaluation of contents of the female pelvis. It allows ready (and portable) imaging of the uterus, ovaries, and other structures at a reasonable cost and without ionizing radiation. Lack of irradiation is important since the ovary is particularlyÂ sensitive to radiation in young patients and those of reproductive age.

Pelvic US is performed either via the transabdominal (TA) or transvaginal (TV) approach.

Images are obtained in the midline sagittal plane as well as parasagittal planes angled to the periphery of each hemipelvis. Similarly, transverse plane images are obtained by angling superiorly and inferiorly from a mid-bladder position. Real-time US allows the subtle angling of the transducer to obtain the best anatomic images even if the structures are not in perfect longitudinal or transverse plane alignment.
