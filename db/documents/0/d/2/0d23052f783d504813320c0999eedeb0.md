Citalopram hydrobromide is a widely prescribed antidepressant by nurse practitioners, primary care providers, psychiatrists, internists, and neurologists. While the drug is effective for depression, its use requires monitoring. Prescibers should be careful as citalopram has correlations with suicidality and worsening depression, especially in children, adolescents, and young adults (younger than 24 years old).Â  Also, clinicians should monitor electrolytes and obtain an ECG before starting treatment because of the risk of prolonged QT syndrome. Nurses and pharmacists should counsel and educate patients not to combine the drug with alcohol, sedatives, and other antidepressants. Thus, an interprofessional approach that includes prescribers, nurses, and pharmacists who operate as an integrated team with open communication and information sharing will be optimal for employing citalopram therapy and driving better patient outcomes with fewer adverse events.
