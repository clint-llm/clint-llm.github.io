History components that are helpful to relay to your local poison control center include:

- Description of the mushroom including color, texture, cap appearance (brain-like, smooth, small, large)

- How much was eaten? In theÂ evaluation of possible Coprinus consumption, was there any concomitant alcohol intake?

- The onset of symptoms after ingestion, though note that if there is more than one type of mushroom ingested, acute as well as delayed symptoms may occur.

- Location and season of collection, given that some mushrooms are preserved and eaten at a later time

- Are any additional people that consumed the mushrooms ill?

Physical examination findings are nonspecific and again, vary depending on the mushroom ingested. In addition to a thorough physical exam, evaluate for signs of:

- Dehydration secondary to gastroenteritis

- Cholinergic toxicity

- Liver dysfunction

- Systemic allergic reactions
