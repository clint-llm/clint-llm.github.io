**Continuous-wave Doppler**

Body habitus, overlying wounds, significant proximal or distal stenosis can confound results at particular levels. Venous flow can also be suspicious for monophasic arterial flow; however, distal compression of the vein that obliterates the signal is evidence that the probe is over a vein. Diabetes has not been shown to affect continuous-wave Doppler waveforms.

**Plethysmography**

Exercise increases pulse amplitude, which can affect waveform contours that had been normal at rest. Medial calcification of arteries, found in patients with diabetes, can also confound pressure measurements, though less with plethysmography. Patients with diabetes may have a regular appearing ABI but abnormal PVR or velocities from duplex imaging.

**Pulse volume recording (PVR)**

The downstream disease can affect proximal waveforms, which can be confounding.
