Approximately 70% of cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis are idiopathic. Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis is considered part of the spectrum of chronic periaortitis, a large vessel vasculitis. Ceroid, a complex polymer of oxidized proteins and lipids often found in atherosclerotic plaques, has been hypothesized as an antigen that initiates the inflammatory response

Thirty percent of retroperitoneal fibrosis cases are a result of an identifiable cause. Numerous drugs have been implicated in the development of RPF. Drugs such as methysergide (Sansert) and other ergot alkaloids are most commonly associated with this condition. Other medications that have been implicated include beta blockers, methyldopa, hydralazine, and analgesics. The biological agents etanercept and infliximab have also been identified as secondary causes. Malignancy (carcinoid, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, sarcomas), infections (TB, histoplasmosis, actinomycosis), radiation therapy for testicular seminoma, colon, and pancreatic cancer, retroperitoneal hemorrhage and surgery have also been identified as secondary causes of retroperitoneal fibrosis. Studies have demonstrated exposure to asbestos, and tobacco smoke may result in increased risk of RPF
