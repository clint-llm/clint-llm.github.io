Tocilizumab is administered intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SQ).

- Cytokine release syndrome

- > 30 kg, 8 mg/kg IV, maximum dosage of 800 mg/dose, May be used as monotherapy or combination with a glucocorticoid
- If no clinical improvement occurs after the first dose, three additional doses may be administered in at least eight-hour intervals

- Giant cell arteritis

- 162 mg SQ once every week, in combination with a tapering dose of a glucocorticoid

- Rheumatoid arthritis

- 4 mg/kg IV once every four weeks may increase to 8 mg/kg IV once every four weeks, maximum dosage of 800 mg/dose, monotherapy or with methotrexate or a nonbiologic DMARD
- > 100 kg, 162 mg SQ once every week, <100 kg, 162 mg SQ once every other week, monotherapy or with methotrexate or a nonbiologic DMARD

- Systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease

- 162 mg SQ once every week

- Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis

- < 30 kg, 10 mg/kg IV once every four weeks, > 30 kg, 8 mg/kg IV once every four weeks, maximum dosage of 800 mg/dose
- < 30 kg, 162 mg SQ once every three weeks, > 30 kg, 162 mg SQ once every two weeks

- Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis

- < 30 kg, 12 mg/kg IV once every two weeks, > 30 kg, 8 mg/kg IV once every two weeks
- < 30 kg, 162 mg SQ once every two weeks, > 30 kg, 162 mg SQ once every week

When the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <2,000/mm3, platelet count <100,000/mm3, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate (AST) >1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), the manufacturer recommends that tocilizumab not be initially given to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, giant cell arteritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease. The manufacturer recommends discontinuing tocilizumab therapy if the ALT or AST become 5x > the ULN, ANC < 500 cells/mm3, or platelets < 50,000 cells/mm3.

A clinical study by Salama C. et al. treated COVID-19 pneumonia adult patients at a dose of 8 mg/kg IV, just like the recommended dose for treating cytokine release syndrome. Seven days before or during the study, 80% of the tocilizumab cohort and 88% of the placebo cohort received a glucocorticoid, e.g., dexamethasone. Also, about 79% of the patients in the tocilizumab or placebo treatment arms received antiviral treatment, e.g., remdesivir.
