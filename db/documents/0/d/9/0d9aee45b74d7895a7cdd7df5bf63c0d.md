A motivated patient and an interprofessional team consisting of physicians, bariatric surgeons, gastroenterologists, nurses, pharmacists, physical and exercise therapists, dieticians, and psychiatrists are the only way weight loss can be achieved sustainably and maintained appropriately. Non-dieting approaches to treating obesity with drug therapy, gastrointestinal devices, and bariatric surgery should be offered early to patients, along with lifestyle modification. With interprofessional care coordination and counseling, patients will have a greater chance of achieving therapeutic success. [Level 5]

Patients and providers must consider obesity a chronic disease requiring chronic treatment. Primary care physicians must obtain a detailed history, physical examination and run basic laboratory tests to rule out other treatable causes of obesity, such as hypothyroidism and Cushing's syndrome. Family and friends must also motivate patients through their weight loss journeys, as these can sometimes be long and arduous.
