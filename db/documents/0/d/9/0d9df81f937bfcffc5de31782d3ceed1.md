Most examinations are performed with gray-scale real-time scanners using a transabdominal or transvaginal approach. The approach is influenced by gestational age, maternal habitus, and fetal positioning. Abdominal curvilinear transducer with 3 to 5 MHz provides enough penetration to achieve adequate resolution. Additionally, high-frequency probes (9Â to 12 MHz) are used for the transvaginal approach.
