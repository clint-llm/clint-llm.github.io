Cardiogenic form of pulmonary edema (pressure-induced) produces a non-inflammatory type of edema by the disturbance in Starling forces. The pulmonary capillary pressure is 10mm Hg (range: 6 to 13) in normal conditions, but any factor which increases this pressure can cause pulmonary edema.

**Increased pressure/pooling--> Increased pulmonary venous pressure--> Increased pulmonary capillary pressure--> fluid in interstitial spaces--> Increased pressure in Interstitial spaces--> fluid in alveoli (pulmonary edema).**

Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure can be measured, graded, and will produce different presentations on X-rays.
