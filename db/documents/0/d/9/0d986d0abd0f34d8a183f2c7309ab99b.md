The face is a structure in the human that is commonly affected by dermatological disease and conditions. Many dermatological disorders appear in the face, such as acne vulgaris, neoplasms, rashes, sun damage, and more. The various skin diseases in the face are treated based on the underlying etiologies.

The appearance of the face can also be used to guide treatment in patients since the face can show clinicians the patient's mood through facial expressions. For example, pain can appear as grimace in the face, and happiness present by smiling, andÂ anger can also be visible in the face. These distinctions in the human face can guide in tailoring the patient's care accordingly. Also, the face can appear flushed when the patient has an elevated temperature. The phenomenon of facial flushing is due to the dilation of blood vessels in the face. The reason for this noticeable flushing is due to the dense vascularity of the face. Many etiologies can result in a flush face, but this can be one sign that can further guide a clinician in narrowing his or her differential diagnoses.
