If the presentation is chronic back pain, considerations range from mechanical back pain to cauda equina compression and spine infection such as discitis or malignancy.

Radiologically, the diagnosis itself is usually straightforward, and no other differentials are entertained. However, in borderline cases on imaging, differentials would include the following:

- Dural ectasia - similar in presentation and associated with Marfan syndrome

- Malignancy - Metastatic deposit or nerve sheath tumors such as a schwannoma

- Spinal synovial cysts

- Meningocele (do not contain neural tissue by definition)

- Cysticercosis
