The diagnosis of nevus anemicus is not simple. Healthcare workers including the primary care provider and nurse practitioner should refer patients with skin lesions to the dermatologist. The diagnosis of nevus anemicus requires practitioners to rule out other conditions on the leukoderma differential diagnosis.  Once nevus anemicus is diagnosed, no treatment is required. Cosmetic camouflage makeups may be helpful, especially for lesions affecting the face.
