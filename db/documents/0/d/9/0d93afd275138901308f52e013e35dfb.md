An 8 to 15-year-old child will typically present with anterior knee pain with or without swelling which can be unilateral or bilateral. Pain begins as a dull ache localized over tibial tubercle gradually increasing with activity. The presentation is typical of insidious onset without preceding trauma. Pain typically improves with rest and will subside minutes to hours after the inciting activity or sport is stopped. Pain is exacerbated particularly by running, jumping, direct knee trauma, kneeling, and squatting. An enlarged prominence at the tibial tubercle is present with tenderness over the site of patellar tendon insertion. Poor flexibility of quadriceps and hamstrings may be present as predisposing factors. Pain may be reproduced by resisted knee extension and active or passive knee flexion.
