Optic nerve drusen are typically benign findings discovered on routine examinations. While superficial drusen may be diagnosed clinically, buried or deeper nerve drusen may present diagnostic uncertainty and require work up to establish and confirm the diagnosis. Imaging modalities such as ultrasound, fundus autofluorescence, and OCT with enhanced depth imaging represent premier techniques in confirming the diagnosis.

In addition to confirming the diagnosis, it is critical to rule out the concurrent presence of edema. This can be done in part through the same imaging modalities used toÂ diagnose nerve drusen.

Patients must understand that although nerve drusen are usually not vision-threatening, they can cause visual field defects and have been associated with rare, potentially visually devastating complications such as anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and retinal vascular occlusions.

It is important to refer patients suspected of having nerve drusen to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and testing to confirm the diagnosis, the patient appropriately followed, disc edema ruled out, and complications managed should they arise. Due to the complexity of diagnosis and potentially devastating consequences of disc edema, consultation with ophthalmology should be done promptly by the healthcare professional in cases of suspected optic nerve drusen.
