Usually, the patient will complain of midfoot pain with varying amounts of pain with weight-bearing, following an acute injury. The injury will often occur by one of the mechanisms described previously. The pain is classically worsened by forefoot weight bearing, and the patient may describe pain or difficulty with the push-off phases of walking and/or running. It is important to note that the severity of the injury is often underestimated at the time of initial injury and the presentation may be delayed. If there is midfoot pain beyond five days, swelling, and/or difficulty with push-off activities, then a Lisfranc injury should be highly suspected. The physical exam can be very helpful and suggestive of these injuries. Inspection of the affected foot can reveal significant swelling, ecchymosis, and although less common, obvious anatomic deformity. There is typically pain with palpation over the dorsal mid-foot, more specifically the tarsometatarsal joints. There is often pain with combined abduction and eversion of the forefoot. Pain can also commonly be reproduced with passive pronation or supination of the tarsometatarsal joint. One should also ensure the injury is closed as open fracture-dislocations are a surgical emergency.
