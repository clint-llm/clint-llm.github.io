As with any antipsychotic drug, quetiapine is associated with an increased risk of death in dementia-related psychosis in elderly patients. Alongside this risk, neuroleptic malignant syndrome should be a consideration due to its D2 receptor blockage. It is the least likely of atypical antipsychotics to cause extrapyramidal symptoms. There is an increased risk for suicidal thoughts and behavior associated with drug treatment in major depressive disorder patients. Somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, and dizziness are the most common side effects of quetiapine. Somnolence and dizziness are due to the nature of quetiapine’s antagonism of H1 receptors, while antagonism causes hypotension for alpha-1 receptors.
