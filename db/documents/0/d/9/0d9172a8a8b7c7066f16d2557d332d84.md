The presence of pericardial calcification and its extent by itself does not affect prognosis. Patients with poor cardiovascular outcomes after pericardectomy were those that developed long-term sequelae of constrictive physiology, including myocardial atrophy, or had concurrent cardiomyopathy. Prognosis is worse for patients diagnosed with NYHA Class III and IV heart failure as they have higher operative mortality.

Long-term survival after pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis depends on the underlying etiology. In a cohort of 163 patients, idiopathic CP had the best 7-year survival (88%), followed by postsurgical (66%) and post-radiation CP (27%).
