There are 29 muscles associated with the human foot: 10 originate outside the foot but cross the ankle joint to act on the foot, and 19 are intrinsic foot muscles. The foot is crucial to human locomotion and postural stability, and the muscles associated with the foot are therefore involved principally in this function. The muscles are aided by the plantar fascia, shaping the posture, shape, and strength of the foot and providingÂ the ability to transmit muscle tension not only toward the ground but also toward the whole body system.
