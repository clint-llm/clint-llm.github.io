Deterrence of hip fractures has two main strands. Firstly preventing falls in the elderly population will, in turn, reduce the rate of fractures. This is by no means an easy undertaking as falls are often multifactorial, and some of the precipitating factors cannot be modified. Clinicians, and indeed the wider interprofessional team, should be aware of the risk factors for falls, and every attempt should be made to identify and manage these risks.

The second approach to reducing hip fractures is the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis. A fracture risk assessment tool is used to assess the risk of osteoporotic fracture over 10 years.
