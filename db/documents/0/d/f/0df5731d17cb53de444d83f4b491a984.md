A thorough evaluation of interprofessional teams is mandatory. This should include a complete workup of the patient’s overall medical and social status.

**Imaging**

X-rays are the main imaging modality that allows the surgeon to trend deformity and measure angular deformity.

Early-onset scoliosis (EOS) imaging allows the clinician to understand the three-dimensional nature of the deformity with ultra-low dose radiation pulse in a standing or upright position

CT with a substantial radiation burden, this modality allows for fine detail of the bony vertebral anatomy and ribs

MRI uses magnetic imaging to determine abnormalities of the spinal cord. It can detect common co-presentations such as a Chiari, a syrinx, or tethered cord.
