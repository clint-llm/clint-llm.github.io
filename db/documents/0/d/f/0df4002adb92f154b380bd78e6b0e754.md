Electron microscopy allows for the visualization of objects at the levels of 10^-10m that are not possible with other techniques. Scanning electron microscopy has been used to study the topographical details of structures. This technique has allowed researchers to get panoramic views of the cochlea and enable studies in healthy and diseased inner ear organs. Cholesteatoma debris can be seen using this technique, and toxic damage, permitting the observation of pathological changes.
