Antihistamine medications are generally administered orally in a tablet dosage form. Intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) administration are also possible, reserved chiefly for in-patient usage for the treatment of specific conditions. Possible indications in the hospital setting may be for the treatment of an allergic reaction or for treating a dystonic reaction after administration of an antipsychotic medication.
