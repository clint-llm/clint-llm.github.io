Lumbar spine high-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA) thrusting techniques are a form of manual medicine used by osteopathic providers. As the name implies, this technique involves high-velocity thrusting techniques under controlled pressure applied in order to correct a specific osteopathic diagnosis discovered previously on an osteopathic physical exam. This activity outlines lumbar high-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA) osteopathic techniques of the lumbar spine and explains the role of the osteopathic practitioner in evaluating and treating patients who are undergoing lumbar HVLA. The views expressed are those of the author(s) and do not reflect the official policy of the Department of the Army, Department of Defense or the U.S. Government.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the indications and contraindications for high-velocity low-amplitude of the lumbar spine to improve patient selection for this technique.
- Summarize the process of developing and osteopathic diagnosis of the lumbar spine to improve technique selection for a given patient.
- Review the available techniques for high-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA) techniques for the lumbar spine to improve treatment satisfaction and patient outcomes in patients selected for treatment with HVLA.
- Identify potential pitfalls and challenges associated with high-velocity low-amplitude of the lumbar spine in order to avoid potential complications and improve outcomes for patients receiving these techniques.
