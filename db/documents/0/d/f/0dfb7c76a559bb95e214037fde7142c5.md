There are no absolute contraindications to general anesthesia other than patient refusal. However, there are many relative contraindications. Relative contraindications include patients with medical conditions that are not optimized before elective surgery, patients with a difficult airway or other significant comorbidities (severe aortic stenosis, significant pulmonary disease, CHF, etc.), undergoing procedures that could be done with a regional or neuraxial technique, therefore, avoiding airway manipulation and physiologic changes associated with general anesthesia.  The patients who plan to undergo general anesthesia should undergo preoperative evaluation by the anesthesia provider. This evaluation involves a review of the patient’s prior anesthetic history, medical comorbidities, heart/lung/kidney function, and pregnancy/smoking status. The patient’s medical condition is maximized preoperatively if at all possible. For example, a patient with unstable angina should undergo cardiac catheterization or bypass before elective surgery.
