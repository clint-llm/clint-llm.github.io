MAOIsÂ can potentially cause drug-to-drug interactions, drug-food interaction, and overdoses, of which the patient should be aware.

MAOIs prevent the breakdown of tyramine found in the body and certain foods, drinks, and other medications. Patients that take MAOIs and consume tyramine-containing foods or drinks will exhibit high serum tyramine level.

Eating foods with high tyramine can trigger a reaction that can have serious consequences.

Tramadol, meperidine, dextromethorphan, and methadone are contraindicated in patients on MAOIs as they are at high risk for causing serotonin syndrome.

In general, SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, bupropion, mirtazapine, St. John's Wort and, sympathomimetic amines, including stimulants, are contraindicated with MAOIs.
