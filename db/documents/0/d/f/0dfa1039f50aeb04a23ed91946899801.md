The veins of the anterolateral wall carry deoxygenated blood into the systemic venous circulation and back to the lungs for oxygenation. The superficial abdominal veins dilate and provide a collateral circulation when the portal vein, superior vena cava, or the inferior vena cava get obstructed. The obstruction causes dilated, distended, and tortuous veins often resembling the venomous serpents on the head of the Greek god “Medusa” giving rise to the term “Caput Medusae.”
