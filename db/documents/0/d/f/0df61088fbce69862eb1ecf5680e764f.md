Both GABA-A and glycine receptors are present in the central nervous system (CNS): their primary roles contribute to synaptic inhibitory signaling. Of the two, GABA-A has been found more extensively throughout the nervous system â€“ the main concentration of receptors found in the thalamus (specifically the reticular nucleus), hypothalamus, basal ganglia, and hippocampus.

As with GABA-A receptors, the glycine receptor plays a role in inhibitory neurotransmission. During fetal development, the original inhibitory receptor of the spinal cord is the GABA-A receptor; however, during the first postnatal week, glycine receptors cluster within the postsynaptic membranes of inhibitory neurons in the ventral horns of the spinal cord. Glycine signaling takes over as the predominant inhibitory signal in the spinal cord from GABA-A signaling and persists through adult neural development.
