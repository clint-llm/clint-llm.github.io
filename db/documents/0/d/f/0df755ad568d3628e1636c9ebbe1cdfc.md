The practical application of osteopathic manipulative treatment, in particular, high-velocity low-amplitude, into a patient treatment regimen can pose several challenges to a provider. The first such obstacle can be finding a provider proficient in the desired technique. While osteopathic physicians are a growing population of the modern health care team, not all providers retain proficiency in a wide range of osteopathic techniques. This situation is increasingly true as osteopathic providers continue to branch out into various specialties.

Even for providers who themselves feel comfortable providing osteopathic treatment to their patients, finding time in a standard visit to perform manipulation can be challenging.

This approach greatly increases the time available to the provider performing the technique, rather than rushing to fit it into an otherwise narrow time window of a regular visit. Along these lines, the provider should become aware of specialty clinics that specialize in the implementation of OMT if the provider suspects a patient may benefit from such a visit.
