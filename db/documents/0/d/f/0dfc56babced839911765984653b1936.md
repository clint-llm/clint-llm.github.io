**Quadriceps Tendon Ruptures**

Distal quadriceps tendon ruptures most commonly occur in patients over 40 years of age. Distal quadriceps tendon ruptures most commonly occur at its insertion point at the superior pole of the patella and have an incidence rate greater than that of its patellar tendon rupture counterpart.

Unless medical comorbidities preclude the overwhelming benefits and positive outcomes from primary repair, surgical intervention is recommended. Indications for nonoperative management are limited to partial tears when the patient still has an intact extensor mechanism. In the latter situation, the patient can be placed in a knee immobilizer or a hinged knee brace locked in extension for 2 to 3 weeks, depending on the degree of partial injury. After repeat clinical evaluation, the patient is immediately prescribed a rigorous physical therapy regimen to combat impending knee stiffness and quadriceps atrophy. Until the patient can demonstrate adequate quadriceps muscle control, the knee brace is to be worn during ambulation. Once the quadriceps demonstrate post-rehabilitation strength comparable to the contralateral extremity, the brace serves an assisting role in augmenting the dynamic stability of the knee joint itself. Any injuries affecting muscles, tendons, or ligaments crossing the knee joint (in this case, the quadriceps functionally crosses the knee joint via the extensor mechanism and patellar tendon) should be treated following the same rehabilitation clinical pearls and parameters.

The same rehabilitation parameters mentioned above are accurate in the postoperative period following primary repair. Immediately following the repair, patients are kept in a brace locked in extension for about two weeks and allowed to weight bear as tolerated (WBAT) with bilateral crutch assistance. Physical therapy starts at this time in the postoperative period, utilizing quad stimulation modalities to help mitigate prolonged atrophy. The therapist also should be working on aggressive patellar mobilization in all directions. Patellar mobility is imperative as this plays a critical role in preventing knee stiffness.  Keeping the actual patella itself mobile as the knee remains limited secondary to pain and immobility during the entire recovery period is crucial in giving the patient the best chance of achieving the best possible outcome. Early passive range of motion (ROM) is performed by the therapist, focusing on getting the knee "straight" to terminal extension and progressively increasing flexion goals from week to week (as defined by the surgeon). No active knee extension is allowed at least for the first four weeks to protect the surgical repair as the tendon is allowed to heal. Active flexion is again defined by the surgeon and starts early on in the rehab process.

While individual therapy protocol will vary based on the operating surgeon, most begin more aggressive increases in active and active-assist knee flexion goals by week 5, when they may institute active knee extension exercises. Aquatic therapy often allows for early active knee extension protocols. By six weeks, most surgeons aim for unlocking the knee brace progressively with ambulation. This usually begins by weeks 5 or 6, to hopefully achieve ROM 0 to 120 by weeks 6 to 8 postoperatively. A 2008 study outlined ROM goal parameters to 50 consecutive patients with either quad or patellar tendon rupture repairs. Both groups of patients hit the 0 to 120-degree ROM mark between 7 and 8 weeks postoperatively. By 12 weeks, all 50 patients achieved knee flexion equal to or within 10 degrees of the normal contralateral knee. By six months, 80% of patients demonstrated no evidence of any residual extensor lag.

Setting patient expectations with respect to the recovery process is important. According to the literature, recovery is very slow and unsatisfactory for the patient, regardless of the surgical approach. One of the causes is the pain that could persist and the presence of scar tissue and adherence to the tendinous tissue. This leads to an inability to completely use the quadriceps muscle and the partial loss of proprioceptive information useful to the muscle. Patients reporting an unsatisfactory outcome is overwhelmingly secondary to an extensor lag and knee stiffness that compromises the ability to either return to sport (at prior competition level) or return to baseline recreational activity and/or ADLs.

**Other Surgical Considerations**

**Surgical Approaches in Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)**

The most common approaches for the standard primary TKA procedure include the medial parapatellar, midvastus, and subvastus approaches.  While each approach has theoretical advantages and disadvantages, overall, the literature remains controversial concerning the best overall surgical approach for TKA.

The medial parapatellar approach is commonly utilized and entails proximal dissection through a medial cuff of the quadriceps tendon to facilitate superior tissue quality closure at the conclusion of the procedure. Distally, a meticulous, continuous medial subperiosteal dissection sleeve is performed while maintaining intimacy with the proximal tibial bone. The extent of dissection is often dictated by the anticipated amount of deformity to be corrected. In general, this medial release is aggressive in cases of severe varus deformity and most minimal in cases of moderate to advanced valgus knee deformity. The medial meniscus is also resected with this sleeve of soft tissue.

Alternatives to the standard medial parapatellar arthrotomy include the midvastus and subvastus approaches. The midvastus approach spares the quadriceps tendon. Instead, the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) muscle belly is dissected along a trajectory directed toward the superomedial aspect of the proximal pole of the patella.

The subvastus approach also spares the quadriceps tendon and lifts the muscle belly of the VMO off the intermuscular septum. The subvastus approach preserves the vascularity of the patella and requires caution as it can limit exposure in particularly challenging cases or particularly obese patients.

**Quadriceps Muscles During Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA)**

Postoperatively following THA, the majority of patients report a satisfactory outcome.

The DA approach is becoming increasingly popular among THA surgeons. The internervous interval is between the tensor fascia lata (TFL) and sartorius on the superficial end and the gluteus medius and rectus femoris (RF) on the deep side. DA THA advocates cite the theoretical decreased hip dislocation rates in the postoperative period and the avoidance of the hip abduction musculature.

The disadvantages include the learning curve associated with the approach, as the literature documents the decreased complication rates after a surgeon surpasses the 100-case mark. Other disadvantages include increased wound complications in particularly obese patients with large panni (without the use of an abdominal binder), difficult femoral exposure, the risk of lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) paresthesias, and a potentially higher rate of intra-operative femur fractures. Finally, many surgeons need access to a specialized operating table with appropriately trained personnel and surgical technicians to assist in the procedure. Although the latter is not always required, learning to do the procedure on a regular operating table also requires a substantial learning curve that must be considered.

**Reconstruction of Quadriceps Muscle**

Sarcomas are a type of cancer that may occur in the anterior compartment of the thigh. The surgeon can choose which muscle flap to remove from the lower limb to reconstruct that part of the sectioned quadriceps muscle. The decision will depend not only on the surgeon's technique but also on the size and depth of the tumor. The prognosis of recovery of the quadriceps functions is never positive because strength and muscle mass are lost, and persistent pain, scars, and adherence makes the movement of the limb more disadvantaged.

Following trauma, the need to rebuild part of the muscle may arise. The prognosis will always be negative, with a recovery that will depend on the extent of the surgery.

Another cause of quadriceps surgery is the repair of the rectus femoris. The latter vastus is rich in white fibers and can produce significant force, particularly during an eccentric contraction. In sports where movements are required, such as sudden decelerations or slowing down to counteract a critical load, the possibilities of muscle breakdown, total or parcel, increase. In those cases where the patient requires functional restoration, reconstruction surgery is used. According to the few data in the literature, the prognosis may be good, but the presence of scar and adherence could alter the original function of the rectus femoris.

**Muscle Flap**

Recent literature has shown that using the quadriceps muscle flap (vastus intermedius) is effective for reconstructing an area of the neurocranium (after trauma or resection of tumors and for aesthetic objectives). We have no data on the functional recovery of the quadriceps muscle.

The quadriceps muscle flap can be used to repair the portion of the gluteus medius.

During prosthetic hip implantation or a hip surgery for resection of tumors or the detachment of the insertion of the gluteus medius from the great trochanter, the latter muscle may be injured, compromising its function. To avoid loss of abductive function of the hip and in the active presence of the superior gluteal nerve, it is feasible to use a quadriceps muscle flap (generally the vastus lateralis) to create a useful compensation for walking.

**Other General Surgical Considerations**

Any time surgery is performed, an emphasis is placed on the recovery process. This includes more subtle examples, for example, non-extremity-based surgeries like bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery, for example, gastric bypass, although it may improve physical function in general, involves a loss of mass and strength of the quadriceps muscles. This means a loss of coordination between the different vasti, increasing possible patient falls. Muscle recovery (mass and strength) should be taken into consideration in this type of patient.

More obvious scenarios include any lower extremity surgery, including the surgeries mentioned above, and arthroscopic procedures such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction.

**ACL Reconstruction**

Following ACL reconstruction, recovery to the original function is very slow, and it is not always possible to completely recover the contractile function. Half of the athletes who undergo surgery do not return to previous performance levels; of the latter, about 20% to 30% will resort to a second operation or develop osteoarthritis problems over ten years.

Several rehabilitative approaches are used to restore the function of the quadriceps, but they are not always effective, such as isokinetic, electrostimulation, or exercises that try to segment the work on each vastus muscle.

In reality, it is necessary to perform exercises that reflect the functions of the muscle, both as a range of movements (movements capable of exhaustively exploiting shortening and full elongation) and as a usual neuromotor intervention (athletic gesture or daily gesture, without non-physiological stimuli such as isokinetic or electrostimulation).

Furthermore, the different metabolic structure of the muscle must be considered, such as red fibers and white fibers. One should include strength training exercises to recover strength, coordination, and muscle mass, while for aerobic metabolism and endurance exercises, one does not exclude the other.

**PCL Reconstruction**

After the surgical reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament, the functional recovery of the quadriceps is faster, although there is an incomplete recovery of strength and muscle mass. One theory is that the proprioceptive afferents of the injured anterior cruciate ligament cannot send adequate information to the central nervous system compared to the posterior ligament. Probably, there would be a greater receptor complexity for the anterior ligament in relation to the function of the quadriceps muscle.
