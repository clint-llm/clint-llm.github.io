Dilation and curettage (D&C) is a surgical procedure that provides an alternative for pregnant and nonpregnant patients. If the pregnant patient desires an abortion, elective or otherwise, medical and surgical options are available, depending on the estimated gestational age. In this setting, D&C can control bleeding and pain more effectively, providing a more timely therapeutic option than a medical abortion. The results are similar, but the risks and benefits depend on individual patient risks and desires.

The nonpregnant patient can alternatively have a D&C or an EMB with an associated ultrasound to evaluate the endometrial cavity and obtain tissue for histopathological evaluation.Â The risks and benefits of each approach should be discussed with the patient to determine the most appropriate course of action.
