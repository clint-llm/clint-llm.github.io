Kupffer cells have a wide range of variability in cell size and shape and have elongated cytoplasmic processes. They are found along the sinusoid on top of the endothelium. They can be seen in contact with various cells, such as endothelial cells, fat-storing cells, collagen fibers, and other Kupffer cells.
