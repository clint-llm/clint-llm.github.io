**Radiographs**are usually the mainstay of evaluating, diagnosing, and initially managing these injuries. PA and lateral views should be taken at a minimum to assess these injuries. These radiographs help distinguish the type of injury among different types of forearm fractures to narrow down and make a diagnosis.**Media 4 & 5**) for AP and lateral radiographs of a typical Colle's fracture,

T**he following radiographic parameters should be considered when assessing a wrist radiograph.**

In the posteroanterior view (PA):

**Radial height:**Normally 13 mm. A shortening of < 5 mm is acceptable. (**Media 6**)

**Radial inclination:**Normally 23 degrees. A change of < 5 degrees is acceptable. (**Media 7**)

**Articular step-off:**The articular surface should be congruous. A step off < 2 mm is acceptable.

In the lateral radiographs:

**Radial volar tilt:**Normally is 11 degrees. A dorsal angulation < 5 degrees or within 20 degrees of the contralateral side is acceptable. (**Media 8**)

**CT scan**is mainly indicated to delineate an intraarticular fracture pattern and for surgical planning.

**MRI**is not a recommended diagnostic measure as the initial evaluation; however, it may serve to assess ligamentous or soft tissue extents of these injuries, such as TFCC, scapholunate, or lunotriquetral ligament injuries.
