Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a type ofÂ microangiopathic hemolytic anemia that classically has been characterized by the pentad of fever, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, renal dysfunction, and neurologic dysfunction. TTP results from either a congenital or acquired decrease/absence of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif member 13). Low levels of ADAMTS13 result in microthrombi formation, which leads to end-organ ischemia and damage.
