Around 95% of patients who are found to have an incidental SPN found on imaging are asymptomatic. Those patients that do present with symptoms usually have symptoms related to the underlying etiology of the SPN. It is essential to evaluate patients for high-risk malignancy and obtain a detailed history and physical to help determine your management of the SPN. Obtain information on smoking status, previous malignancies, personal and family history of cancer, especially lung cancer, and current lung condition such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and interstitial lung disease to help rule out malignant SPN. Auscultate both lungs to help uncover the underlying condition. It is also essential to obtain travel history when infectious etiologies are suspected, especially if the patient has been to areas with endemic tuberculosis. Also, inquire about the history of rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or other autoimmune disorders. Most of the time, physical findings of an SPN will be absent, and one must rely on history and imaging.
