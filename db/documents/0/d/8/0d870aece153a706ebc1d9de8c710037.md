Gynecologic cancers require an interprofessional team-based approach, especially in patients with a rare disease such as vaginal cancer. Once the diagnosis is made, coordinated care should include the involvement of social workers, nurse navigators, radiation oncologists, and gynecologic oncologists.

Ideally, vaginal cancer should be reviewed at case-based conferences. Interprofessional team members can include gynecologic oncology, plastic surgery, urology, radiation oncology, and operations staff. It is essential to coordinate with outpatient nurses, clinical nurse specialists, physician assistants, administrative assistants, physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists, social workers, sexual counselors, and the cancer survivorship practice.

Clinical nurse specialists assist the team by providing psychological support to the patients living with cancer and their caregivers.

The issue of sexuality and sexual dysfunction is important, especially with treatment for vaginal cancer. Both physical and psychological issues need to be addressed; common patient complaints include lack of sexual desire, dyspareunia, decreased sensation in the genital area, and the inability to achieve orgasm.

Pain management during and after therapy is essential, especially in light of the current opioid crisis. Communication about pain in patients with vaginal cancer should be tailored to the individual patient experience.

All care team members must maintain meticulous records so that everyone on the interprofessional team has the latest and most accurate information for patient decisions as a part of team communication. The interprofessional approach to care will yield optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
