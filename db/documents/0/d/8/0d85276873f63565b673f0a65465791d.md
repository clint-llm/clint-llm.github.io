Modulation of histamineâ€™s effect occurs through four types of receptors: H1, H2, H3, and H4. Histamine receptors are G-protein coupled receptors, which are 7-transmembrane chain proteins that mediate the effect of several molecules. H1 receptors are Gq coupled receptors. Its downstream effects are mediated by increased activity of phospholipase C, increased cytoplasmic calcium, and a subsequent increase in protein kinase C activity.
