Signals from the gut and adipose tissue are important in regulating sensations of appetite and satiety, respectively. The gut produces ghrelin, while leptin derives from adipose tissue. The hypothalamus integrates the signals from these two locations to regulate the body's energy homeostasis—circulating ghrelin and leptin act on the hypothalamus, allowing the body to adapt to energy demands. Ghrelin acts on the lateral hypothalamus, while leptin acts on the arcuate nucleus within the middle (tuberal) region. The lateral hypothalamus has also been shown to form and store memories associated with predicting food availability within an environment due to its interaction with ghrelin.

Within the gut are short-acting signals such as cholecystokinin (CCK) and gut distension, promoting "fullness" and satiety.
