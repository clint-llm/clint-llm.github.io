Upper cervical spine fractures are not uncommon and are usually associated with other injuries as well. These fractures are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a trauma surgeon, orthopedic surgeon, neurosurgeon, emergency department physician, radiologist, and a neurologist. The treatment options include conservative management, cervical orthosis, halo-vest orthosis, and surgical procedures. Neurosurgery nurses usually monitor the patients in an ICU setting. Rehabilitation may include physical therapy. The outlook depends on the presence of a neurological deficit on presentation, patient age, other associated injuries, and head trauma. Isolated high cervical spine injuries that are not displaced have a good prognosis.
