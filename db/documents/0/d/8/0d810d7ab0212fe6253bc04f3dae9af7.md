Imipramine is contraindicated in hypersensitivity to the drug, especially in cross-reactivity with other dibenzodiazepines, in acute recovery from myocardial infarction, and when used concurrently with MOAI or within 14 days of discontinuing either imipramine or MOAI as this may precipitate hypertensive crisis. Contraindications to imipramine also include its use with linezolid or IV methylene blue as both have MOAI properties.
