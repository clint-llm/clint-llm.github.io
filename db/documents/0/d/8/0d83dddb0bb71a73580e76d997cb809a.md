The Bethesda system uses criteria like nuclear crowding, nuclear overlap with or without pseudo-stratification, enlarged nuclei (2-3 times the size of normal endocervical cells), variation in nuclear size and shape, hyperchromasia, chromatin irregularity, presence of nucleoli, mitoses, increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, and distinct and discernible cell borders. Atypical glandular cells – according to the Bethesda system of 2015- “should be categorized according to the site of origin as endocervical or endometrial whenever possible”. If the site of origin cannot be categorized then the general term "atypical glandular cells" can be used.

The glandular cells are classified according to the site of origin into the following subcategories (Bethesda 2015).

-  Atypical:

- Endocervical cells (NOS or specify in comments)
- Endometrial cells (NOS or specify in comments)
- Glandular cells (NOS or specify in comments)

- Atypical

- Endocervical cells, favor neoplastic
- Glandular cells, favor neoplastic

**Atypical Glandular Cells, NOS:**

**Definition:**Cells resembling endocervical cells with nuclear atypia, that exceeds a reactive or reparative process but lack unequivocal features of endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ or invasive adenocarcinoma (Bethesda 2015). Whenever possible the location of origin of cells has to be specified eg: " endocervical" or " endometrial".

**Criteria:**

- Cells occurring in sheets and strips, with crowding, overlapping nuclei, and pseudo-stratification

- Enlarged nuclei, up to about 3- 5 times the normal endocervical cells

- Minor variation in nuclear size and shape

- Mild nuclear hyperchromasia

- Mild irregularity of chromatin

- Rare nucleoli

- Rare mitotic figures

- Abundant cytoplasm with a fairly increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio

- Distinct cell borders

**Criteria for reporting Atypical Endocervical cells, Favor neoplastic:**

**Definition:**Glandular cells with morphology, either quantitatively or qualitatively falls short of interpreting as endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ or invasive adenocarcinoma (Bethesda 2015).

**Criteria:**

- Cells occurring in sheets and strips, with nuclear crowding, overlap, and/or pseudo-stratification

- Cell groups resembling rosettes/ or forming glands or feathering

- Enlarged and elongated nuclei with hyperchromasia

- Coarse chromatin with heterogeneity

- Occasional mitoses and/ or apoptotic bodies

- Increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio

- Ill-defined cell borders

**Criteria for reporting Atypical Endometrial cells:**

**DEFINITION:**The distinction of atypical endometrial cells from benign endometrial cells is mainly based on the increased nuclear size in the atypical cells. The atypical endometrial cells are not generally further classified as " favor neoplastic" as it is a tough call and often gives poorly reproducible results. ( Bethesda 2015)

**Criteria:**

- Cells in small groups, usually 5 to 10 per group

- Slightly enlarged nuclei in comparison to normal endometrial cells

- Mild hyperchromasia

- Chromatin heterogeneity

- Occasional prominent nucleoli

- Scant vacuolated cytoplasm

- Ill-defined cell borders
