Diagnosis is typically made by history and physical examination alone. If symptoms are intermittent and signs of abnormal tearing or "mattering" are not present at the time of examination, the dye disappearance test can be performed to help confirm the diagnosis. Begin by placing oneÂ drop of fluorescein-stained saline in the inferior cul-de-sac of the patient's eyes and wipe away excess tears from the eyelids. Wait 5 minutes and inspect the eyes. The fluorescein should drain completely into the nose within 5 minutes if the lacrimal drainage system has no obstruction.
