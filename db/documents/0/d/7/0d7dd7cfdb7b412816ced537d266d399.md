Patient education is crucial for the proper management of keratosis pilaris. Patients need to understand the condition is chronic, and there is no cure for keratosis pilaris. The physician should also explain to the patient that the condition often improves over time without treatment, and treatments are for cosmetic purposes. Patients need to grasp that keratosis pilaris is often refractory to the available treatment options.
