Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is a pan-arterial disease limited to the allograft. Its etiology is multifactorial in origin, with the primary cause being inflammation driven by both cellular and antibody-mediated rejection processes and anti-HLA antibodies against donor tissue. In accordance with the inflammatory burden in this disease process, elevation in serum C-reactive protein is a marker for CAV and allograft failure.
