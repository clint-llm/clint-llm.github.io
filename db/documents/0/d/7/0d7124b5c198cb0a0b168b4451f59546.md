Contraindications of extraction of lower third molars teeth are high risk of IAN damage, complex root morphology, hypercementosis, and ankylosis. In addition, third molars would not be extracted in patients with a history of intravenous bisphosphonate use or radiotherapy.

Where CBCT indicates an intimate relationship between the roots of a lower third molar and the IAN, or there are other contraindications for extraction, coronectomy serves as an alternative procedure to surgical removal. Coronectomy involves the removal of the coronal tooth structure, ensuring the elimination of all enamel while the roots are left in situ. The purpose of this procedure is to remove the source of discomfort, for instance, the bulbous crown of a partially erupted lower third molar leading to food packing and subsequent pericoronitis, while the roots are left in situ, thus reducing the risk of damage to the IAN.

Conversely, there are several instances in which coronectomy is contraindicated, including caries extending into the pulp, medical history of autoimmune conditions or reduced healing potential, such as diabetes mellitus, lower third molar impeding surgery such as orthognathic or trauma surgery, and association of the tooth with extensive cysts or neoplasms.
