The untreated coeliac disease leads to chronic ill health and complications. Secondary lactose intolerance is common. There is increased the risk of osteoporosis, epilepsy, infections and bowel cancer and jejunal lymphoma. Lack of calcium leads to problems with dentition.

Because celiac disease is an autoimmune disease, many clinicians recommend that all patients with celiac disease should also be screened for type 1 diabetes and thyroid function problems. This screening is recommended because similar autoimmune disturbances are at the root of these disorders and therefore, there is increased the risk of these disorders in people who share the common genetic background.
