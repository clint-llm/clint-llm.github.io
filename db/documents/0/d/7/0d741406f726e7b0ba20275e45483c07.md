Dental infections can be further evaluated using dental radiographs, orthopantomography, CT scans, and MRIs. Imaging studies play an essential role in recognizing the source of infection and the proportions of the disease spread and also can detect any complications.

Radiographs can show the extent of dental caries and periodontitis.

Cone-beam CT (CBCT) is useful in assessing periapical disease, pericoronitis, and osteomyelitis. CT with contrast can help in evaluating the extent and severity of fascial space infection.

MRI is useful for osteomyelitis and deep space infections of the neck. Laboratory studies, including complete blood count, may be helpful in patients with more serious presentations. Patients with facial or deep space infections may present with sepsis and warrant the addition of blood cultures and lactic acid levels
