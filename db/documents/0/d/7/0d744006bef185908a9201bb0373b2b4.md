Atherosclerotic lesions are commonly found in the arteries that arise from the aortic arch vessels. About 80% of these lesions are located at the bifurcation of the common carotid arteries.

Luminal narrowing of the carotid artery, however, is not the only cause of carotid bruit. Auscultatory sounds from cardiac valvular murmurs that radiate to the neck, cervical venous hums, and intracranial arteriovenous malformations can produce vascular sounds similar to the carotid bruit.

Arterial tortuosity and kinking and high output clinical states may generate bruit even in normal or non-stenotic arteries. For example, in patients with thyrotoxicosis, there is an increase of five-to ten-fold increase of blood flow to the enlarged thyroid gland resulting in a systolic bruit directly over the gland.

Vascular occlusion from an extrinsic compression such as carotid body tumors and carotid paraganglioma have also been reported to cause carotid bruit.

Disruption of the blood vessels can cause bruit and have presented in patients having a carotid artery dissection.

Reports of carotid bruit from inflammation of the carotid vessel due to inflammatory conditions like Takayasu arteritis are also in the literature.

Non-sclerotic and noninflammatory diseases such as fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) commonly affect the internal carotid arteries and cause carotid bruit. These can be found incidentally during the exam.  Cervical FMD is mostly asymptomatic.
