Place the child supine after administration of a general anesthetic. Prep and drape the hip utilizing a sterile technique. Use a sterile gloved fingertip to locate the hip joint. The hip joint is one fingerbreadth lateral to the femoral artery and immediately inferior to the inguinal ligament. Alternatively, the needle can be inserted medially, behind the adductor longus.

A 22-gauge spinal needle is inserted until it enters the hip joint with the assistance of fluoroscopy. As the needle passes through the joint capsule, resistance will be met. A 5 mL syringe filled with normal saline solution is then attached to the spinal needle. The saline solution is then injected into the hip joint. As the hip joint capsule becomes distended and the hip gradually flexes, injecting the saline solution will become more difficult with increased resistance felt. If the hip joint has been successfully entered, the saline solution under pressure in the hip joint reverses the plunger, and the fluid escapes into the syringe upon release of the syringe plunger.

The saline solution is aspirated from the hip joint, and the saline solution syringe is removed from the spinal needle. Hold the spinal needle in place within the hip joint capsule while removing the syringe. Fill a syringe with 5 mL of a 25% strength contrast solution and attach intravenous tubing. Confirm that all air has been bled from the contrast syringe and intravenous tubing to avoid air emboli. Hold the spinal needle in place and attach the intravenous tubing and syringe filled with contrast solution.

Using fluoroscopy, inject 1 to 3 mL of the contrast solution into the hip joint. Withdraw the needle and obtain an image of the hip using fluoroscopy while the hip remains unreduced. Gently reduce the hip and obtain a second image. Fluoroscopic images can be utilized to evaluate for adequate hip reduction and safe zone.

When arthrograms of bilateral hips are performed, insert a spinal needle into each hip joint. Confirm that both spinal needles are within each hip joint before either hip is injected with a contrast solution. Once confirmed to be within each hip joint, inject both hips as described here and obtain the necessary images using fluoroscopy.
