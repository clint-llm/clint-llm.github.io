Patients must understand the characteristics of their tumor as they are congenital, benign, and slow-growing. Many patients are observed for several years if they do not develop symptoms. Some patients are treated for long periods for trigeminal neuralgia or hemifacial spasm until a neuroimaging study is performed. The patient has to be oriented that the symptoms can improve with surgery, but certain risks exist with surgery. A subtotal resection with functional preservation is always preferable to gross total resection when there is a high risk of causing new neurological deficits. Residual tumor commits the patient to long-term surveillance imaging and follow-up.
