The exact mechanism of sulfasalazine is not fully understood. Furthermore, it is not known whether sulfasalazine or its metabolites such as sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid are responsible for its anti-inflammatory effects. The detailed description for the mode of action of sulfasalazine is still under investigation as does the immunological and pathological mechanisms involved in rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.

Sulfasalazine is a prodrug that consists of the 5-aminosalicylic acid (mesalamine or mesalazine) and sulfapyridine linked by an azo bond. Sulfasalazine is too big to be absorbed in the small intestine. Bacteria in the colon cleaves the azo bond and liberates active compound 5-aminosalicylic acid, which is believed to work locally in ulcerative colitis rather than systemically after being absorbed into the circulation.

The following immunomodulatory effects of sulfasalazine and its metabolites have been suggested as the underlying mechanisms of their action; (1) Sulfasalazine inhibits transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB), thereby suppressing the transcription of NF-kB responsive pro-inflammatory genes including TNF-alpha.
