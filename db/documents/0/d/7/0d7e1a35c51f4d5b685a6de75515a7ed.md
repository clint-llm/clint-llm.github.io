Surgical management may be needed in symptomatic patients who do not respond to initial medical treatment. Studies have shown significant improvement in dry eye symptoms and signs following conjunctival recession with amniotic grafts, thus indicating that more attention may be warranted for the early diagnosis of this condition.
