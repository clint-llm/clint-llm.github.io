Like other lung etiologies, NTM lung infection affects the host in several ways. Clinical manifestation could mimic other lung infections, such as Mycobacterial tuberculosis, atypical bacterial infections, and chronic lung diseases. Clinicians should approach the differential diagnosis of pulmonary pathologies based on the clinical manifestations and radiological characteristics.  Among the differential diagnosis infections, neoplasia, and connective tissue diseases are the most common that share similarities to NTM lung infections. Mycoplasma, chlamydia, and viral pneumonia are relevant entities to include in the differential.  Others are fungal lung infections like Aspergillus, Histoplasma, and Coccidiosis, to name a few.  Small cell and non-small cell lung cancer are important to consider, especially in patients with weight loss and lymphadenopathy.  Moreover, disorders of the connective tissue, such as rheumatoid arthritis lung disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, can represent an essential part in the differential as well. Overall, any entity that presents with respiratory manifestations, and either cavitary or bronchiectasis radiological lung pictures on images is part of the differential diagnosis and needs to be ruled out.
