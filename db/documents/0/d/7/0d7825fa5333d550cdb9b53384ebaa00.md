Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist used to treat alcohol use disorder and opioid dependence, was developed in 1963 and patented in 1967. In 1984, naltrexone received approval for medical use in the United States. While experimenting with rats at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Joseph Volpicelli first recognized naltrexone's potential to treat alcohol use disorder. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 75 million people have alcohol use disorder or dependence worldwide. Naltrexone is a mu-opioid receptor antagonist.
