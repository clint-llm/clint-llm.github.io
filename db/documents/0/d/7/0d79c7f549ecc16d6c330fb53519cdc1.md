Definitive management of acute anterior leg compartment syndrome is a subcutaneous fasciotomy. Several techniques are described in the literature including single and double incision.

Treatment of CECS can initially be conservative. This includes activity modification including discontinuing the offending activities, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), stretching, foot orthotics, physical therapy, and an alternative exercise program for 6 to 12 weeks. In patients unwilling to modify their athletic activity or refractory to conservative management, fasciotomy is indicated. This can be successful in relieving symptoms in up to 90% of patients.
