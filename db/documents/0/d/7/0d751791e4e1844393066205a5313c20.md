For ICU sedation, the typical dosage range is 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg per hour. However, the dose can increase to 1.5 mcg/kg per hour to achieve the desired sedation level. Doses as high as 2.5 mcg/kg per hour have been described, but it is unlikely that doses higher than 1.5 mcg/kg per hour achieve any further therapeutic benefit in the absence of increased side effects. Dosage adjustments for renal or hepatic impairment are not required but should be considered, especially for hepatic impairment. The manufacturer does not recommend durations longer than 24 hours; however, longer durations have been demonstrated as safe and effective. Clinicians can administer a loading dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mcg/kg; this is usually avoidable if the medication is for labile critically ill patients or those with tenuous hemodynamics.

When used in anesthesia, the typical dosing is a loading dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mcg/kg, usually followed by a continuous infusion of 0.2 to 0.7 mcg/kg per hour titrated to desired sedation goals. As mentioned, higher infusion doses can help achieve the desired effect.

When used as an adjunct for peripheral nerve block, the dose of dexmedetomidine is usually 1 mcg/kg to achieve the desired prolongation.
