Roughly 20% of labors are associated with a protraction and/or arrest abnormality. A variety of adverse fetal and maternal outcomes are associated with labor abnormalities. Infection, operative birth, low Apgar score at 5 minutes, prolonged hospitalization for both mom and baby, third and fourth-degree maternal perineal tears, above-average blood loss, and NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) admission are all increased with abnormal labor progress.

With abnormal labor being the main indication for cesarean delivery during labor, the perceived safety of the cesarean delivery must be addressed. With the increasing rate of cesarean deliveries in the United States, there has been a concomitant increase in abnormal placentation, specifically placenta accreta and placenta previa as well as cesarean scar pregnancies. Along with this comes a paralleled increase in maternal morbidity and mortality, as placenta accreta and placenta previa account for a large percentage of maternal morbidity and mortality.
