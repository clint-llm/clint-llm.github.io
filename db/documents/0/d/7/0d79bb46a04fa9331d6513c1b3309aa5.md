Sporotrichosis is found worldwide, with the majority of cases reported in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. In North America, sporotrichosis occurs most often in southern coastal regions and river valleys. Rose gardeners, farmers, miners, horticulturists, and armadillo hunters have an increased risk of infection. Patients with suggestive syndromes should be asked about occupational activities. S. schenckii can be isolated from soil, plants, or plant products. Infection may also occur during animal transmission and zoonotic transmission which is associated with scratches or bites from infected cats. Over the last two decades, Brazil has experienced an outbreak of cat-transmitted sporotrichosis in Rio de Janeiro, with 4,669 cases being reported.
