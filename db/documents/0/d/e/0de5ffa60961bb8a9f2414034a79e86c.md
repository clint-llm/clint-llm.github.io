The TPVB is a regional anesthetic procedure associated with a low overall incidence of complications thanks to ultrasound. It suppresses the neuroendocrine response to surgical stress by its somatic and sympathetic nerve blockade, allowing major thoracic surgery to be performed with optimal intraoperative and postoperative analgesia. The thoracic epidural is presented as the gold standard for analgesia during a major thoracotomy, but the TPVB, compared to the thoracic epidural in terms of analgesia, also provides effective pain relief with few side effects and should be seen as a safe alternative in case of contraindication to the thoracic epidural.

In the current literature, we can discover the publication of a whole series of studies on the impact of TPVB and its beneficial effects on the optimization of intraoperative and postoperative analgesia. These investigations include randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational trials, and numerous case reports.

In a recent study including patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing lobectomy surgery, ultrasound-guided thoracic paravertebral block (UG-TPVB) demonstrated effectiveness in reducing postoperative pain, quality of life, and improving recovery for early revalidation.

A single thoracic paravertebral injection is effective for acute pain control in the emergency room in patients with multiple post-traumatic rib fractures.

To assess the analgesic efficacy of TPVB in patients scheduled for modified radical mastectomy, a prospective randomized trial was published recently, including 90 females.  Postoperative morphine consumption during the first 48 hours has been recorded. The author concludes that the TPVB allowed a significant reduction in postoperative opioid consumption than the control group and without an increase in adverse effects.

In a recent meta-analysis (2/2020), the authors have compared the analgesic efficacy of pectoral block versus TPVB at 2 postoperative hours in patients who had undergone breast surgery. Eight trials, including 388 patients, were identified, and the authors concluded that compared to paravertebral block, there is low-quality evidence that a pectoral block provides marginal postoperative analgesic benefit after a radical mastectomy.

In another recent study, the authors evaluated retrospectively opioid consumption in patients who underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery after placing a paravertebral catheter.

In a prospective randomized and controlled study, H Hu et al. (9/2020) included 60 patients receiving single-port video-assisted pulmonary lobectomy with a paravertebral block guided by thoracoscopy at the end of the operation. The VAS (visual analog score) score of the TPVB group was significantly lower than that of the control group at all time points. The author concludes that the regional analgesic procedure chosen for these patients can effectively reduce postoperative pain while ensuring patient safety.
