In comparison to the anterior longitudinal ligament, the posterior longitudinal ligament is narrower and weaker. It has an oval structure that varies from 2 to 2.25 mm in width at the level of L5-S1. From L5 upwards, the ligament forms a narrow band, which widens symmetrically at the level of each disc. The fibers of the annulus fibrosus and the edge of the vertebral body are the sites of attachment of the ligament, but in some cases, not all, it is attached to the posterior aspect of the vertebra. The widths of the ligament at the different levels are as follows.

L5 1.4 cm, L3 1.5 " L2 1.1" L5 0.7 cm,  vertebral body level L3 0.8 L2 0.6 "

The thickness of the ligaments at different levels are as follows:

L5 1.3 mm L3 1.4 " L2 0.9 "

The posterior longitudinal ligament seems to be most developed at the level of L3 and L4, where its average thickness is 1.4 mm. From L2 upwards, the ligament thins markedly. There is a thicker middle portion approximately about 2.5-4 mm in width throughout the whole length of the ligament. The ligament in the mid-portion of each vertebral body covers the vascular foramina.
