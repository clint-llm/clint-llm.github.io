Treatment of HPIV infection is basically symptomatic in healthy children and adults. Unfortunately, no antiviral agent with proven efficacy for human parainfluenza virus infection is available.

Treatment of croup: Corticosteroids have been shown to be beneficial for mild and moderate to severe croup.

The exacerbation of chronic respiratory diseases caused by different viruses, including the HPIVs, can be potentially prevented by early treatment with some of the antivirals. Although there is no effective antiviral treatment for HPIV in clinical practice, new strategies are being developed that may be practical and available for HPIV respiratory infections. The most direct approach consists of removing the sialic acid receptors, which are necessary for the attachment and fusion by the parainfluenza's HN and F proteins, thereby inhibiting the first step in infection. It is the DAS181, a recombinant sialidase protein that has been proposed to effectively inhibit HPIV infection.

The most severe disease is found in immunocompromised patients, and treatment at present remains largely supportive.
