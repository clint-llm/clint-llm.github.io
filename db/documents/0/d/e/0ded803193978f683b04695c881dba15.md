Full radiographic assessment should be done before the procedure to assess the extent of arthritis and the residual bone stock. Additional testing may be necessary to identify the underlying pathology such as inflammatory arthritis or degenerative arthritis and also to identify other comorbidities. This procedure is usually done under general anesthesia. The anesthetic team can deliver nerve block prior to the procedure to help with analgesia in the postoperative period, and local anesthetic can be injected at the end of the procedure depending on the complexity and length of the surgery to help with postoperative pain relief. Patients are positioned supine on a standard operating table with the affected arm on a radiolucent arm table attached to the operating table. The patient's shoulder is positioned at the edge of the operating table, and tourniquets are applied at this stage if required. Depending on local hospital guidelines, prophylactic antibiotics are also indicated before the procedure, and the adequate choice of antibiotics should be verified with the local trust or hospital.
