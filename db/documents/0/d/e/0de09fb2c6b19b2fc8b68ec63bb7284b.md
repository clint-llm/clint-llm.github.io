A chest x-ray can demonstrate the trachea deviated to the left in the presence of a right aortic arch. This occurs from the aortic arch crossing over the right bronchus instead of the more common right-sided deviation from a left-sided aortic arch. A barium swallow evaluation can demonstrate a posterior esophageal indentation from the aberrant left subclavian in patients with a vascular ring. An echocardiogram evaluation will demonstrate any associated intracardiac abnormalities and can demonstrate arch sidedness, including the anatomy of the arch. By echocardiography, the first branch of the aorta defines the sidedness of the aortic arch. If the first branch of the aorta bifurcates to the left, then a right aortic arch is present. CT scans can be performed when there is a concern for a vascular ring causing important symptoms. This can be helpful in preoperative surgical planning, but it should be reserved for patients in whom vascular ring surgery is considered. CT scans can also demonstrate the airway and esophagus and yield an anatomic evaluation of narrowing or compression of these structures.
