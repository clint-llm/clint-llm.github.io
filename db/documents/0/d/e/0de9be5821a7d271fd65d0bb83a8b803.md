Herpes simplex encephalitis in adults is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The mortality is estimated to be between 20 to 30%, even with prompt diagnosis and treatment.

Significant long-term morbidity, including cognitive and behavioral abnormalities, anterograde amnesia, and features of Kl√ºver Busy Syndrome, have been well documented. Even though the standard mental status examination is within normal limits, many suffer from dysnomia and difficulty with new learning, especially via visual and verbal media. A Swedish study showed rehospitalization in 87% of patients for various indications, including seizure episodes, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and thromboembolic events.
