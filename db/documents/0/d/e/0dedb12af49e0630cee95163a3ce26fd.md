The complications of abdominal wall reconstruction are similar to any other major abdominal surgery. Adhesion lysis is often required intraoperatively, and the risk of bowel perforation should be discussed with the patient, including the very rare need for an ostomy if the bowels cannot be safely closed primarily. Since this surgery often requires extensive dissection and undermining of the skin and soft tissue, wound complications remain a real concern. These can range from simple surgical site infections to deep space infections or significant skin/subcutaneous/flap necrosis. Mesh infections are a dreaded complication of abdominal wall reconstruction, but typically can be minimized with good preoperative optimization, surgical technique, and appropriate use of mesh prosthetics and peri-operative antibiotics.
