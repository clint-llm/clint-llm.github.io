A coaxial technique of inserting a thinner sampling needle through a larger needle placed at the edge of the lesion has several theoretical advantages over tandem punctures. Several samples can be obtained without re-puncturing the pleura (until the introducer needle lumen develops a high degree of friction from the accumulation of coagulated blood). This theoretically improves speed and reduces pain and puncture-related complications.

The depth of the sampling passes can be planned, and the stiffer, larger needle can enable additional torque and better steerability during manipulation. If a pneumothorax does occur, the introducer needle often will remain lodged in the lesion, allowing further samples to be obtained. A properly selected larger-bore needle can be used to obtain a biopsy gun specimen, insert a marker into the lesion for thoracoscopic resection or radiation therapy, or deliver a substance to caulk the tract (discussed below).

Each puncture site has a certain pressure above which air will leak into the pleural space. Performing a single puncture decreases the chances that one will leak at a relatively low intrathoracic pressure and cause a pneumothorax—most small puncture wounds to the pleura leak at 10 to 40 mm Hg. A coughing fit will generate pressure over 100 mm Hg, due to which all non-patched and probably most patched punctures would leak. Visible tearing of the pleura allows leakage at a pressure of 1 to 2 mm Hg.

A single puncture non-coaxial approach should be considered for high-risk circumstances, such as for a transcaval or trans brachiocephalic vein approach for lesions known to have hemorrhaged or suspected to be at high risk for hemorrhage and lesions with an associated prominent internal air-bronchogram in which there is an increased risk of air embolism.

**Breath Holding**

Respiratory volume should remain within the range of normal, quiet breathing. A puncture during a deep inspiration or expiration results in tension on the needle when the lung returns to its more normal status. This theoretically places greater stress on the pleura at the puncture site increasing the likelihood of a pleural tear. During sampling, care should be made not to create tension on the needle; ideally, the patient holds their breath while the radiologist is sampling. Patients are better able to hold a breath in inspiration than in expiration. Once a person can no longer hold their breath, they tend to exhale if inspiration is held but to inhale if an expiration is held. The latter is more likely to cause an air embolism.

**Precautions**

**Minimizing the Time that a Needle is Crossing the Pleural Space**

If the needle is allowed to move with the motion of normal respiration, usually, no harm occurs. However, as the duration of the procedure increases, patients are eventually bound to move due to discomfort, cough, or otherwise, placing themselves at risk from needle motion. Delays, such as prolonging time to review the adequacy of tissue samples, from imaging to detect clinically silent intrathoracic complications, or from personnel in the room not having proper radiation safety equipment, should be reduced to the absolute minimum.

**Cough Suppression**

Forceful coughing is likely to tear the pleura. Dramatic negative intrathoracic pressure occurs during inspiration before a cough, and high positive intrathoracic pressure occurs during a cough. This places the patient at risk for pneumothorax and air embolism should the needle be uncovered with the tip in a vein. Procedure progress is halted during coughing episodes. Cough suppressant medication should be administered, or the irritant addressed. Otherwise, the procedure should be terminated.

**Lung/Pleural Patch Technique**

This technique entails caulking the pleural defect via the introducer needle after the procedure to prevent puncture site gas leakage. Different materials may be used, but the traditional approach involves using the patient's blood. A blood patch is unnecessary if the aerated lung has not been violated. A blood patch is theoretically less valuable if multiple punctures have been made or pneumothorax has already developed. While the technique has been effective in lung biopsy models and actual patients, no randomized trials comparing different types of blood patch techniques have been performed.

**Post Procedure**

After blood patch placement and needle removal, some physicians roll the patient into the puncture-site-down position. This initial repositioning event should be performed by as many assistants as necessary to ensure that the patient remains passive and does not strain or perform a Valsalva maneuver. A forceful Valsalva maneuver is less likely if the roll is performed while the patient lets their breath out. The needle removal and the rolling should take no more than a few seconds. Puncture-site-down positioning was first suggested by Zidulka in 1982.

It may work from a physiologic and mechanical mechanism. Physiologically, it makes the periphery of the dependent lung atelectatic, which should reduce local aeration. Mechanically, it tamponades the tract by creating visceral-parietal pleural apposition.

It is theoretically beneficial to prevent all activities that may elevate intrathoracic pressure, such as any type of breathing requiring the use of accessory muscles (e.g., laughing) or straining (e.g., sitting up in bed without assistance).

Oxygen saturation should be monitored. Supplemental oxygen interferes with this method of following the clinical impact of a small pneumothorax, so it should only be used when necessary. If a pneumothorax is known to be present, oxygen may be administered to facilitate the resorption of the existing pneumothorax. The premise for how this may help is that a higher partial pressure of oxygen speeds the diffusive resorption of trapped pleural air, which is comprised mainly of nitrogen (and carbon dioxide).

**Follow-up Imaging**

No chest radiograph must be obtained immediately after the biopsy unless symptoms or a falling oxygen saturation level suggest pneumothorax is present. Despite the best intentions of the technologist, the performance of a radiograph will probably entail at least some degree of patient straining or Valsalva maneuver. Oxygen saturation levels provide enough clinical information to delay the acquisition of the first image.

On the other hand, if an initially subclinical problem does exist, it is best to know about it before discharge. After several hours in the puncture-site-down position, the patient should be permitted to test activities similar to those they would perform at home. A chest X-ray is then obtained. Upright expiratory images in at least two views (e.g., frontal and oblique) provide the most sensitive method for detecting intrapleural air via plain film radiography. In the absence of serial images, new or continuing leakage cannot be distinguished from leakage that occurred immediately after the procedure and then stopped. Thus, follow-up imaging should be done after the initial discovery of pneumothorax to determine leak stability.

**Patient Discharge**

The decision to discharge a patient, as opposed to admitting for observation or treatment, depends on the patient's condition, home situation, and home location. In asymptomatic patients, the safety of a shortened observation approach (2 hours postprocedure) without needing a chest X-ray has been reported previously.

- Can tolerate a larger pneumothorax,

- Have a responsible family member who will be staying the night with the patient, and

- Lives within range of transport to a medical facility or arrival of an ambulance within 10 to 15 minutes of symptom onset.
