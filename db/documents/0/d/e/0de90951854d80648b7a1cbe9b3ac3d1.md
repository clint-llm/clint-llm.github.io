Syphilis can cause a gamut of systemic manifestations, and for this reason, it has been called the “great mimicker.” Despite its discovery centuries ago, it remains a significant public health problem. Because of its varied manifestations, diagnosis can be challenging. Physicians need to maintain an increased suspicion index for screening high-risk populations, such as men who have sex with men, pregnant women with syphilis, and HIV-infected patients. Penicillin remains the primary treatment based on the stage of infection and whether CNS involvement occurs. Treated patients must be followed up with non-treponemal antibody titers to evaluate treatment response.
