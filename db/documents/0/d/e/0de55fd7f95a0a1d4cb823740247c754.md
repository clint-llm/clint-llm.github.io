The most crucial aspect of acetaminophen toxicity is prevention. As part of the interprofessional healthcare team, clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), nurses, and pharmacists. Pharmacists and nurses need to emphasize the maximum dose permitted daily. Patients also need to understand how to look for acetaminophen in various medications and calculate the dose they receive when they combine products. Pharmacists need to perform medication reconciliation to look for drug interactions and verify that there are not too many acetaminophen-containing drugs in the regimen. If there are concerns, the pharmacist should report them to the nurse and prescriber. All team members must document their findings and keep the entire team in the information loop regarding the patient's case.

With the recent changes in maximum daily dosing for acetaminophen, all interprofessional team members must be aware of the new guidelines and remain current should any new guidance come out.

If toxicity occurs or there is suspicion of toxicity, management also requires an interprofessional team of clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists. Specific protocols have been designed to direct the interprofessional team when patients present to emergency departments with acute acetaminophen toxicity. Emergency physicians, nurses, toxicologists, pharmacists, and psychiatrists developed one such protocol.
