The pathogen underlying tuberculosis is Mycobacterium genus complex. There are around 60 species, among which M. tuberculosis is the most common type. These organisms are fastidious, slow-growing and aerobic bacilli. Other non-tubercular mycobacterial species affecting humans include Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium microti, and Mycobacterium africanum.

The infection results in a granulomatous inflammatory reaction, which is typically characterized by caseating necrosis, lymphocytes, epithelioid cells, and Langhans-type giant cells.

Some known risk factors for TB include prolonged exposure to infected patients, immunodeficiencies (HIV, alcohol, drug abuse), overcrowding, malnutrition, poverty, and lower socio-economic situation.
