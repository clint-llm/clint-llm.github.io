Ectropion is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the pharmacist and nurse. Treatment typically begins with aggressive lubrication of the eyes with artificial tears, gels, and ointments. If the ocular surface is protected, then there is not an urgent need to protect the eyelid. However, if the ocular surface is compromised, for example in a patient with facial palsy, then the cornea can quickly decompensate, and scarring of the cornea can develop and lead to permanent vision loss.

Surgery is often done to repair ectropion but the results are not ideal. Eye dryness and poor cosmesis remain two major post operative complications, leading to a poor quality of life.
