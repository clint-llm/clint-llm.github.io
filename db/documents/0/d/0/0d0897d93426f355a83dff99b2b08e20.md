The interprofessional health care team faces many challenges when vaccinating patients for hepatitis B. While few medical interventions have as significant an impact on health as vaccinations, and the hepatitis B vaccination is generally safe, lack of knowledge about the vaccine by healthcare team members and patient concern about adverse events can decrease coverage. Challenges on knowledge of the vaccine for healthcare team members include staying current on evolving recommendations for whom the vaccine is indicated.

Nurses should always verify the patient's vaccination status regarding hepatitis B (as well as other vaccines) and report their findings to the clinician. Many states in the USA allow pharmacists to administer the vaccine, and pharmacists should reinforce the counsel from the provider and nursing staff and update the patient's record with each dose. In this manner, the entire interprofessional team can operate from the same data regarding vaccination status, leading to better patient outcomes. [Level 5]

Of note, there is a new adjuvanted vaccination in development, now approved for adults in the United States for adults, which would reduce the time for series completion from a six-month 3-dose series to a one-month 2-dose series.
