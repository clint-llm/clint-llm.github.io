The blood supply of the mature corpus luteum is the highest per-unit tissue of any organ in the body, which is why adequate blood supply, achieved through the recruitment of blood vessels, is an essential part of corpus luteum development. This critical process involves the breakdown of the follicular basement membrane, endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and capillary lumina development. Angiogenic growth factors are vital to this process.
