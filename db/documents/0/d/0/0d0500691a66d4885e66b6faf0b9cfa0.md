The primary organ systems in which luteinizing hormone is involved are the central nervous system (hypothalamus and pituitary) and the reproductive organ systems of both males and females (See figure: Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal Axis).

The hypothalamus secretes GnRH in a pulsatile manner, which stimulates the secretion of LH. GnRH itself undergoes regulation by multiple neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, glutamate, opiate, and galanin. Kisspeptin is a crucial regulator of GnRH; it is an important GnRH secretagogue, encoded by the KISS1 gene. Gonadal steroids, estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone exert negative feedback, thus decreasing the secretion of LH
