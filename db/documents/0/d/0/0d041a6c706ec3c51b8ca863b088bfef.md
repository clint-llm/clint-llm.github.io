Tetracaine is an amino-ester class local anesthetic. Clinicians have used it for a variety of purposes since the early 1930s, but its most common use today is as a topical ophthalmic anesthetic for short procedures on the surface of the eye, as well as the ears and nose. Spinal anesthesia is also another indication. The World Health Organization (WHO) lists tetracaine as an essentialÂ drug and is relatively inexpensive compared to other local anesthetic agents.
