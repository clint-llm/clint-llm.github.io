The patients who have had surgery for the removal of rhabdomyoma have a fair to a good prognosis. The highest risk is among cardiac rhabdomyomas. They may grow and obstruct the left ventricular outflow tract, thus causing abnormalities in the flow, or may cause ventricular tachycardias or heart blocks.

The presence of fetal cardiac rhabdomyoma may be a sign of tuberous sclerosis, and thus, one should evaluate other structures i.e., the renal or brain parenchyma for tumors; this is because cardiac rhabdomyoma is often the first symptom of tuberous sclerosis, followed by neurological involvement and impairment.
