Urinary incontinence can occur after pelvic surgeries. This is a common complication, especially in prostate cancer treatment. Urethral sphincter incompetence is one of the most important contributing factors for post-radical prostatectomy urinary incontinence. Although, bladder dysfunction could also play a role in the incontinence. Rates of postoperative urinary incontinence vary widely by surgeon experience, but good results are between 4% to 8% of patients.
