In the 1970s, the polycythemia vera study group (PVSG) set the first diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera (PV). The diagnosis can be made if all three category A criteria are met, or if A1, A2, and two from category B are met.

**Category A**

- Total red blood cell mass more than or equal to 36 mL/kg in males or more than or equal to 32 mL/kg in females

- Arterial oxygen saturation more than or equal to 92%

- Splenomegaly

**Category B**

- Platelets of more than 400,000/microliter

- White blood cell count more than 12,000/microliter

- Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (ALP) more than 100 U/L

- Serum vitamin B12 more than 900 pg/mL or binding capacity more than 2200 pg/mL

Measuring the red blood cell mass requires labeling with the 51Cr isotope, which is no longer readily available. Therefore, the PVSG guidelines have fallen out of favor, and the World Health Organization (WHO) published revised guidelines for diagnosing PV in 2016. These criteria are composed of three major and one minor criterion. Diagnosis can be made if all three major or two major and minor criteria are met.

**Major**

- Hemoglobin (Hgb) more than 16.5 g/dL or hematocrit (Hct) more than 49% in men, Hgb more than 16 g/dL or Hct more than 48% in women; or red blood cell mass more than 25% above mean normal predicted

- Bone marrow biopsy showing hypercellularity for age with trilineage growth (panmyelosis) including prominent erythroid, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic proliferation with pleomorphic, mature megakaryocytes (differences in size)

- JAK2 V617For JAK2 exon 12 mutation

**Minor**

- Serum erythropoietin level below the reference range for normal

These criteria should only be applied for diagnosis after secondary causes of polycythemia have been ruled out.
