The trigeminal nerve is the fifth cranial nerve (CN V) and the largest of the cranial nerves. Its primary function is to provide sensory innervation to the face and is divided into three main branches. The different branches are the ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3) nerves. TheseÂ branches join at the trigeminal ganglia, which is located within the Meckel's cave of the middle cranial fossa.

The ophthalmic nerve is responsible for sensory innervation of the face and skull above the palpebral fissure and the eye and portions of the nasal cavity. The maxillary nerve is also a sensory branch and innervates portions of the nasal cavity, sinuses, maxillary teeth, palate, and the middle portion of the face and skull above the mouth and below the forehead. The mandibular nerve is unique in that it contains both sensory and motor fibers. It provides sensory innervation of the buccal mucosa, mandibular teeth, and the skin below the mouth. The motor portion of V3 innervates all the muscles of mastication. This article aims to review the anatomy of the trigeminal nerve, its surgical considerations, and its clinical significance for providers.
