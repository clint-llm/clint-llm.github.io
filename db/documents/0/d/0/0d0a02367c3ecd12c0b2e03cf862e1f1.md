Treatment is predominantly non-surgical. The primary motive is to stimulate the rectum or colon by using a water-soluble contrast enema. Some patients might require serial enemas, possibly using acetylcysteine.

If there is no passage of stools by 48 to 72 hours, surgical options may be a consideration. A suction rectal biopsy should be performed. Additionally, if temporary decompression of the bowel is necessary, a temporary ileostomy is performed. Additional surgical approaches include the Mikulicz double-barreled ileostomy, which has a zero risk of an intraabdominal anastomosis whereas the aesthetically pleasing option is a skin bridge temporary ileostomy.

More advanced options include a distal ileostomy with a Bishop-Koop anastomosis ( end to side ileal)- known as distal chimney enterostomy and a similar proximal chimney enterostomy called the Santulli procedure. Usually, ten days following the surgery, the enterostomies can be closed by performing an end-to-end anastomosis.
