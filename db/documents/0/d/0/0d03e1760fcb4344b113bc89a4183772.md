The diagnosis and workup consist of taking a very accurate and detailed history along with symptomatic/physical findings. Peripheral vertigo is typically episodic and acute/severe. Alternatively, central vertigo typically is over a longer duration of time, and “most” of the time, less severe symptoms occur. Peripheral vertigo usually can be made worse with head movements and typically has been associated with horizontal/rotary nystagmus, which is fatigable and unidirectional.

Central vertigo can have nystagmus in any direction is not fatigable and typically multi-directional.

The Dix Hallpike test can help aid in the diagnosis of peripheral vertigo, typically making symptoms worse and nystagmus more obvious.

Other specialized tests include:

- Electro/videonystagmography (ENG)

- Computerized dynamic posturography (CDP)

- The rotating-chair test also known as sinusoidal harmonic acceleration (SHA)

- Vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials
