Cavernous angiomas occur sporadically or in a familial pattern.  Serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals de novo lesions in families with a genetic predisposition to cavernous angiomas. The de novo development of CMs after brain biopsy and after radiosurgery also provides substantial evidence for the developmental nature of these lesions. Familial cases show an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with incomplete penetrance. There are several reports regarding the hereditary mutations linked to three genetic loci (CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3) which are responsible for familial cerebral cavernous malformations. Approximately all familial cases of cavernous cerebral malformations among Hispanic Americans and non-Hispanic Families have been linked to a founder mutation of CCM1 localized to 7q  and CCM2 at 7p and CCM3 at 3q respectively. Furthermore, there is a belief regarding a "second hit mutation" necessary for the onset of the pathology.
