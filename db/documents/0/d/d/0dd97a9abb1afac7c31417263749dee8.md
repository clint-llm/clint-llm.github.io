FEP typically presents as a single or multiple papillary or polypoid growths on the skin. The tumor may be pink, tan, brown, or skin-colored. It can be sub-divided into pigmented and non-pigmented types based upon gross coloration. There may also be some superficial excoriation or erosion, but typically not deep ulceration.
