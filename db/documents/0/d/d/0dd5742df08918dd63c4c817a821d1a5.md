Complications during treatment tend to vary depending on the lesionâ€™s location in the skeleton. As with any surgical procedure, the risk of bleeding and infection is of the utmost concern, not only for a superficial wound infection but osteomyelitis as well. Damage to the physis is possible if the lesion is near the growth plate. Pulmonary embolism is also a concern due to venous thromboembolism or fat embolism, as it is with other orthopedic surgeries.
