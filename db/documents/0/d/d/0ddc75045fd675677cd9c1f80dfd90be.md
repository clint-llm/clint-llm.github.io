Clinical and laboratory presentations of all types of acute RPGNÂ are very similar. Some patients present with signs and symptoms of renal disease such as anemia, hematuria, fluid retention, oliguria, or uremia. Weakness, nausea, and vomiting often dominate the clinical picture. Others give a history of a viral prodrome. Vague aches, frank arthritis, sinusitis, otitis, episcleritis, skin rash, neuritis, or encephalopathy are rare and are more common with multisystem disease. Oliguria, abdominal or flank pain, hemoptysis, and peripheral swelling may occur. Up to 15% of patients may be asymptomatic. Physical findings include normal or slightly elevated blood pressure, peripheral edema (10%), pallor (common), and a skin rash suggesting leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
