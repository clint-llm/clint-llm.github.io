Chorioamnionitis is an inflammatory process that ranges from mild to severe. Histopathologic findings consistent with inflammation also can be present in the placentas of women with normal pregnancy.

In chorioamnionitis, the membranes may appear normal or show evidence of infection. Fluid can be clear or cloudy. There is neutrophilic infiltration into the decidua on histologic examination, and in more severe cases, microabscesses are present. A recent study suggests that neutrophils in the amniotic cavity are mostly of fetal origin. In extreme prematurity, maternal and fetal neutrophils are more likely to be present in the amniotic cavity with chorioamnionitis.
