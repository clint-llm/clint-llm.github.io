The most common complaint in patients presenting with symptoms is epistaxis. This reflects the high incidence of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) in patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. On the physical examination of these patients, telangiectasias can be noted, most commonly in the nasal mucosa.

The second most common complaint is dyspnea on exertion, which is more common in patients with large or multiple pulmonary AVMs. Hemoptysis and rarely massive hemoptysis can occur. Less common complaints include chest pain, cough, migraine, headaches, dizziness, dysarthria, syncope, vertigo, and diplopia. The cause of these symptoms is not clear, but it may be related to hypoxemia, polycythemia, or paradoxical embolization through pulmonary AVMs.

Murmurs or bruits over the location of the pulmonary AVMs are heard in patients with large pulmonary AVMs. These murmurs are also audible during inspiration and are called machinery murmurs. Clubbing and cyanosis are less common. However, they are sometimes observed in patients with minimal shortness of breath.

Occasionally, patients complaining of dyspnea will be noted to have improvement of the peripheral oxygen saturation upon lying in the supine position, a syndrome known as platypnea-orthodeoxia.
