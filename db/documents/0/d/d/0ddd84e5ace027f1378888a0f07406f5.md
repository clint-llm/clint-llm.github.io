The etiology of CO toxicity is due to its effect on oxygen binding to the hemoglobin molecule.  CO binds to hemoglobin forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) with a 220% greater affinity to hemoglobin than oxygen. This reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin and leads to cellular hypoxia. Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) increases the affinity of unbound hemoglobin for O2 thus causing a leftward shift in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. Additionally, CO binds to the heme moiety of the cytochrome c oxidase in the electron transport chain and inhibits mitochondrial respiration. These effects cause a lower tissue and intracellular PO2 than would otherwise be expected for a given blood oxygen concentration. The hemoglobin concentration and the PO2 of blood may be normal, but the oxygen content of the blood is reduced significantly.
