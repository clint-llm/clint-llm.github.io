The hyoglossus muscle is one of the four intrinsic muscles of the tongue. It is a quadrilateral muscle that originates along the whole length of the hyoid bone and inserts into the side of the tongue. The hyoglossus acts to both depress and retract the tongue. It receives its motor innervation via the hypoglossal nerve. Its bloody supply is comprised mainly through the sublingual branch of the lingual artery with additional supply from the submental branch of the facial artery.
