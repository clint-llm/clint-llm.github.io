Meclizine is a first-generation antihistamine (non-selective H1 antagonist). It also has central anticholinergic actions.

Absorption: Meclizine is absorbed post-oral administration. The drug reaches peak plasma levels roughly 3 hours after administration.

Distribution: Meclizine's volume of distribution is unknown in humans because it has not had sufficient study.

Metabolism: The data on meclizine metabolism is limited, but according to in vitro metabolic studies, the dominant hepatic enzyme to metabolize meclizine was found to be CYP2D6.

Excretion: The drug is excreted as a metabolite in the urine and is excreted unchanged in the feces.
