The procerus muscle is a pyramidal-shaped muscle arising from the fascia of the superior nasal region, near the junction of the nasal bones, and the superolateral nasal cartilage.

The procerus muscle is located inferomedial to the frontalis muscles bilaterally. The corrugator supercilii, depressor supercilii, and orbicularis oculi muscles are in close proximity, located just lateral to the procerus muscle bilaterally. The nasalis muscle is inferior to the procerus muscle.

The procerus muscle works with other muscles part of the glabellar complex. The glabellar complex includes bilateral fibers of the procerus, frontalis, corrugator supercilii, depressor supercilii, and orbicularis oculi muscles. These muscles depress the medial eyebrow, producing transverse cutaneous furrows, and also assist nostril flaring.
