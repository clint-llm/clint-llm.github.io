Decubitus ulcers occur when there is prolonged pressure on specific areas of the body that are susceptible to friction and shear force injuries.Â Pressure ulcers vary in size, depth, and chronicity. There is a grading system in place for pressure ulcers, which helps guide treatment. Consulting with a wound care specialist and/or general surgery can also help guide treatment.
