Anodontia is the complete agenesis of the dentition. Hypodontia is defined as the agenesis of fewer than six teeth failing to develop, and oligodontia is defined as six or more teeth failing to develop. Hyperdontia is defined as supernumerary teeth or teeth that appear in addition to the regular number of teeth.

Although anodontia, hypodontia, and oligodontia have the same etiology, the phenotypic appearance of each depends on the severity of the underlying etiology. The suggested etiology for the failure of teeth to develop has been linked to 15 causative genes in non-syndromic cases.

The etiology of hyperdontia is not fully understood, and the condition has been attributed to multifactorial etiologies. When multiple unerupted supernumerary teeth are noted, syndromes such as cleidocranial dysplasia, a rare congenital skeletal dysplasia with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, should be considered.
