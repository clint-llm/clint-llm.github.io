The management of acute pancreatitis involves interprofessional teams including hospitalists, gastroenterologists, surgeons, nurses, pharmacists, addiction specialists, and dietitians. The management of acute pancreatitis should involve specific counseling geared toward the etiology of pancreatitis. If a patient is noted to have several readmissions with pancreatitis, and the cause is known to be alcohol abuse, for instance, this should be specifically targeted via intensive counseling by the healthcare team. Before the patient is discharged from the hospital, it may be beneficial for a dietitian to meet with them and recommend dietary changes (such as low-fat diet) to patients with chronic pancreatitis. Medication reconciliation on admission and discharge should be emphasized so any medications that may be the cause of pancreatitis can be changed.
