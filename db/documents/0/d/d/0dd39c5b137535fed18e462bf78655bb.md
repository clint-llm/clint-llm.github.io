Seminal vesicle development closely links with the embryological development of other mesonephric or Wolffian duct structures, namely the epididymis and vas deferens. The male gonad, the testis, initially develops under the influence of the Y-chromosome. Testis development drives gonad-derived fetal testosterone production. During the 10th week of fetal development, the seminal vesicles sprout from the distal mesonephric ducts in response to testosterone. This morphogenesis of the seminal vesicles results from an androgen-dependent interaction between embryonic mesenchyme and epithelial tissues. This process contrasts with the development of the other accessory male sex glands, the prostate, and bulbourethral glands. These structures develop from the urogenital sinus under the influence of dihydrotestosterone.
