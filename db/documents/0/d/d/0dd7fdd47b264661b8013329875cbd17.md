The prognosis depends on multiple factors:

- **Age of Onset**: High mortality rates are seen in individuals younger than five years and those older than 40 years.

- **Duration of Onset of Symptoms**: High mortality is seen in cases with onset of duration greater than four days.

- **Cardiac Involvement**: It is associated with a very poor prognosis, particularly AV and left bundle-branch blocks.

- **Systemic Disease**: High mortality rate is seen in cases of systemic involvement.
