There is limited data available for adverse effects of imdevimab, but other adverse effects may come to light in the future. Adverse effects reported include:

- Hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis (8,000 mg dose)

- Infusion-related reactions included pyrexia, chills, urticaria, pruritus, abdominal pain, and flushing (8,000 mg dose)

- Nausea and Vomiting (2,400 mg dose)

Due to the possibility of hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis and infusion-related reaction, observation in the infusion center is advised for at least an hour post-transfusion. If there is a concern for an infusion-related reaction, slow or stop the infusion and administer appropriate medications and/or supportive care.
