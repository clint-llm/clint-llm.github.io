This entity has been noted to have a male preponderance.

The insidious unilateral weakness onset usually has been reported to occur at the start of puberty, in the early to mid-teens. The peak onset age is approximately two years later than the longitudinal peak on the growth curve of juvenile males in Japan.

Most reported cases have shown more involvement of the right upper limb (2.8Â to 1 ratio), regardless of the hand dominance. However, the few described cases of bilateral upper limb involvement are seen among this same age group and are considered the most severe clinical subtypes of the entity.
