Allergic contact dermatitis represents the classic presentation of a T cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity response to exogenous agents. The initial step in the development of allergic contact dermatitis, as in nickel allergy, is hapten binding to a skin carrier protein. A hapten by itself is not immunogenic but becomes so after binding to a skin protein carrier. The hapten protein complex forms through covalent bonds between the hapten and amino acid side chains of target proteins within the skin.
