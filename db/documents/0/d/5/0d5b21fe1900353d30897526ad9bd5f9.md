There are no medications that have been proven beneficial for primary progressive aphasias. Proper treatment and management of PPA begin with a detailed history and analysis of the patient’s speech and language components. Referral to a speech and language pathologist is essential for properly diagnosing language disorders to plan the appropriate treatment regimen and strategy. Speech and language therapy is the most effective treatment of primary progressive aphasias, especially for symptoms of apraxia of speech.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)has been identified as a promising intervention to augment behavioral treatment benefits in language therapy programs. The benefits of tDCS are its low expense, high safety profile, and non-invasive nature–which justify research on its use in PPA as a possible means to augment behavioral intervention effects and reduce the rate of decline in the language.
