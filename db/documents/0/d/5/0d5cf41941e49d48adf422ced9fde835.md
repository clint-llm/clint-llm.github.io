While the most common fracture types of the upper extremity are distal radius followed by phalangeal fractures, metacarpal fractures are the third most common fracture. They are the second most common hand fractures. Metacarpal fractures account for approximately 40% of all hand injuries.

The incidence rate of fracture associated with each digit's metacarpal bone increasesÂ from the radial to the ulnar side. The incidence rate of 2nd metacarpal fractures is lower than that of 5th metacarpal fractures.
