Below is a broad differential diagnosis for WCT, which also consists of potential etiologies.

- Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with pre-existing bundle branch block (BBB)

- SVT with rate-related BBB

- SVT with aberrant conduction

- Atrial fibrillation (Afib) with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPWS)

- Ventricular tachycardia (VT)

- Ventricular fibrillation (VFib)

- Polymorphic VT (torsades de pointes)

- Pacemaker mediated tachycardia (PMT)

- Drug overdose (i.e., TCAâ€™s, digitalis, cocaine, lithium, diphenhydramine)

- Sodium channel blockers

- Hyperkalemia

- Hyper or hypo-magnesemia

- Post-resuscitation (ROSC)

- EKG artifact

- Genetic disorders

- Long QT syndrome

- Short QT syndrome

- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

- Familial dilated cardiomyopathy

- Brugada syndrome

- Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia

- Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia
