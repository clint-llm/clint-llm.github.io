When enough force is placed on the rib, the rib will fracture. Most isolated rib fractures can be managed expectantly. However, certain patterns of rib fractures are associated with higher morbidity and mortality and will need further evaluation for other underlying injuries and emergent treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of rib fractures and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of rib fractures.
- Review common presenting symptoms of rib fractures.
- Outline the appropriate management of acute rib fractures and flail chest. 
- Explain the importance of a well-integrated interprofessional and interprofessional team in optimizing the management of rib fractures and improve outcomes for affected patients.
