Penicillins had been very effective against S. aureus; in the past, however, Staphylococcus aureus has become capable of exhibiting resistance against them by producing a penicillin hydrolyzing enzyme – penicillinase. After that, ampicillin was developed to overcome this issue and extend the antimicrobial coverage of penicillins. It is also resistant to acid so it can be administered orally.

Ampicillin has effective minimum inhibitory concentration for most of medically important organisms in infectious disease like Escherichia coli: MIC = 4 mg/L, Staphylococcus aureus: MIC = 0.6-1 mg/L, Streptococcus pneumoniae: MIC = 0.03-0.06 mg/L, Hemophilus influenzae: MIC = 0.25 mg/L.

**FDA-approved Indications**

- **Respiratory tract infection:**caused by:Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillinase, and non-penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, group A beta-hemolytic Streptococci, Hemophilus influenzae.

- **Bacterial meningitis:**caused by Gram-negative bacteria:Neisseria meningitis, Escherichia coli, Gram-positive bacteria: Listeria monocytogenes, Group B Streptococci. Adding aminoglycosides increases its effectiveness against gram-negative bacteria.

- **Septicemia and endocarditis:**caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including penicillin-susceptibleStaphylococcus species, Streptococcus species, and Enterococcus species. Gram-negative bacteria include Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, and Proteus mirabilis. Endocarditis caused by enterococci usually responds to intravenous ampicillin. Adding aminoglycosides with ampicillin may increase its effectiveness when treating endocarditis caused by streptococci.

- **Genitourinary infections:**caused by sensitive strains ofEscherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. The CDC no longer recommends ampicillin as a first-line agent in treating gonorrhea.

- **Gastrointestinal infections:**caused bySalmonella typhi, Shigella species, and other Salmonella species, and usually improve with oral or intravenous therapy. Culture must be obtained for susceptibility and antimicrobial sensitivity; however, the clinician may start empiric treatment before receiving the results.

**Off-label Clinical Uses**

- **Neonatal group B Streptococcal infection********prophylaxi****s:**Administered as an alternative to intramuscular penicillin.

- **Prophylaxis in surgery: **Ampicillin is a routinely selected agent in orthopedic surgeries, especially prosthetic implants and dental surgeries.

- **Chorioamnionitis:**Ampicillin, in combination with gentamicin, is used to treat chorioamnionitis.

- **Carbapenem-resistantAcinetobacter baumannii (CRAB):**According to IDSA 2022 guidelines, ampicillin/sulbactam is the preferred agent for the infection caused by carbapenem-resistantAcinetobacter baumannii(CRAB).
