The exact etiology is not known, but many theories exist regarding the cause of frotteurism. Psychoanalysts propose that individuals with frotteurism may have unmet needs to rub themselves against the victim and cuddle, like an infant with his mother. Individuals engaging in these behaviors may fantasize that they share an exclusive and caring relationship with their non-consenting victims during the act. Freund and Seto have proposed that these individuals may also have problems with tactile interactions that may occur during normal human erotic or sexual interactions.

Though not specific for frotteurism, paraphilias, in general, have been associated with the following additional mental health diagnoses.

- Social anxiety

- Traumatic brain injury

- History of sexual abuse, in general, has been associated with a paraphilic disorder

- Intellectual disabilities

- Substance abuse

- Presence of other or more than one paraphilia, especially exhibitionism and frotteurism
