Premenstrual syndrome is a common problem among females of childbearing age. Patient education involves discussing the problem with the patient with empathic hearing, providing insight on the reasons for her problems. The involvement of the partner in understanding the problem also assists the patient in seeking help at home or seek treatment with the health care provider.

Educating patients about reproductive health helps the patient-physician relationship, which makes symptom expression and treatment-seeking easier. Equally important is educating significant others and family members about supportive behaviors, which reduces PMS symptoms. Couple-based CBT interventions have a great impact on behavioral coping with better outcomes. Because it is a common problem, mass education through radio, TV, or digital platforms regarding diagnosis and effective treatment of PMS is very helpful too.
