Provocative discography is often done by the orthopedic surgeon or the radiologist. While there are potential shortcomings to its use as a diagnostic tool, PD may still be the ideal test in the following situations.  First, when there is more than one abnormal intervertebral disc, particularly when several harbor findings on MRI that beg the question as to which might be the patient's primary pain generator; and second, when the next step in treatment holds the potential for significant morbidity such as with spinal fusion surgery, especially to determine if the disc adjacent to the proposed instrumented segment is painful or disrupted.

The primary care provider including the nurse practitioner should educate the patient on the limitations of the test. In some cases, imaging with MRI may be a better option as it is more revealing and certainly less painful.
