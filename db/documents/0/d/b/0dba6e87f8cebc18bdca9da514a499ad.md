Prognosis largely depends on the cause of hydrocephalus. Half of the patients with severe intraventricular hemorrhage may require definite treatment. In children, after posterior fossa surgery, around 20% will require permanent shunting.

There are numerous, sometimes controversial criteria trying to predict the success of shunting in cases of NPH. It is considered that if gait disorder precedes mental disturbance, the chance of improvement with shunting is more than 77%. Another criterium is the response to a single lumbar puncture or external lumbar drain. Improvement of symptoms after a single lumbar puncture with 40-50 ml of CSF drained or after the lumbar drain is considered a positive predictive value for shunt success. Persistent ventricular activity 48Â to 72 hours after isotopic cisternography gives more than a 75% chance of relieving the symptoms with shunt placement.
