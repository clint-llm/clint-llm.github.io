Historically, Frey syndrome was a clinical diagnosis based on patients' reports of symptoms. Today, objective methods, such as the Minor starch-iodine test, serve as more sensitive ways of confirming the diagnosis of Frey syndrome.

During the Minor test, the affected facial area is painted with iodine. Once dry, starch is applied over the painted area, and the patient is presented with a salivary stimulus, such as a sour candy. If the gustatory stimulus causes activation of the sweat glands, the starch will become moist and turn blue/brown in the presence of iodine.
