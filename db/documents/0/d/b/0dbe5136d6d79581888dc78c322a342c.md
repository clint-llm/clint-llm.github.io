Patient education centers around non-medication and medication-based approaches. Non-medication approaches include weight loss, orthoses/bracing to correct joint alignment, exercise and physical therapy, and support groups. Medication compliance needs to be emphasized; sometimes, patient compliance wanes as symptomatic control from the drug occurs. Patients need to understand the disease has no cure and the likely progression that can take place, particularly with non-compliance to theÂ therapeutic recommendations.
