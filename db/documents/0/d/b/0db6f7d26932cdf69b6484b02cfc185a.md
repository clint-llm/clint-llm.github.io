The genus Ehrlichia consists of several species of obligate intracellular gram-negative bacteria that infect humans and a variety of other mammals via tick bite. Clinically, Ehrlichia infections share many symptoms and geographic distribution with rickettsial infections and thus, one must also consider Ehrlichia infections when evaluating patients with flu-like illnesses in endemic areas. This activity explains when this condition should be considered on a differential diagnosis, articulates how to properly evaluate for this condition, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of ehrlichiosis.
- Describe the presentation of ehrlichiosis.
- Summarize the treatment for ehrlichiosis.
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of ehrlichiosis.
