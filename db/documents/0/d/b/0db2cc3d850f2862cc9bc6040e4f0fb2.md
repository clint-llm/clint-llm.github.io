Famotidine is a competitive histamine H-receptor antagonist (H2RA) that binds to the H-receptors locatedÂ on the basolateral membrane of the parietal cell in the stomach, effectively blocking histamine actions. Its pharmacologic activity results in the inhibition of gastric secretion by suppressing acid concentration and volume of gastric secretion. Famotidine inhibits both basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion as well as reduces gastric volume, acidity, and secretion stimulated by food, caffeine, insulin, and pentagastrin.
