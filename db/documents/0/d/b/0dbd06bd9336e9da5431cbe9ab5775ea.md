Patients should be informed about the cause of the symptoms they are experiencing and the course of management. Conservative treatment should be tried for one to two weeks, and activity can be resumed gradually as symptoms improve. Following a trial period of conservative therapy, other courses of treatment should be discussed to provide relief of symptoms. Epidural blood patch (EBP) is an effective next step in treatment, and patients should be aware of the progression to this form of treatment for ICH. The efficacy of EBP in the treatment of spontaneous ICH is lower than for post-dural puncture headache, which should be discussed with patients so that the expectations are realistic as treatment becomes more invasive with persisting symptoms.
