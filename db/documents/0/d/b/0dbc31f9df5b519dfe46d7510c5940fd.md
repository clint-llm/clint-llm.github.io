The PML/RARa protein heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), the resulting PML/RARa-RXR complex binds to retinoic acid-responsive elements in target genes, resulting in cessation of myeloid differentiation at the promyelocytic stage. The excessive promyelocytes express tissue factor (TF) which forms a complex with factor VII and activates factor X and IX and result in a pro-coagulant state. The immature promyelocytes also cannot build defenses against infections, rendering patients immunosuppressed.

There are also certain fusions that make this leukemia insensitive to retinoic acid and chemotherapy.
