Essential anatomy relevant to the aortofemoral bypass includes the aorta which bifurcates into the right and left common iliac arteries. The right and left common iliac arteries (CIA) subsequently branch into the right and left external (EIA) and internal iliac arteries (IIA). The external iliac arteries give rise to the common femoral arteries (CFA). Aortoiliac occlusive disease can occur anywhere along these arteries and vary in degree. It is important to comprehend the anatomical relationship of these structures for the disease process, procedure, and where an anastomosis might occur as well as where clamps would need to be applied.
