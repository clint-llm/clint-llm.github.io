Most Y. enterocolitica infections are self-limiting and require no treatment. Patients with more pronounced symptoms of diarrhea and dehydration should first be treated symptomatically. They will need to be resuscitated with intervenous fluids and stabilized. Appropriated lab tests and x-rays should be ordered to rule out other possible surgical etiologies of their symptoms. As this is often a self-limiting condition, antibiotics are usually not required. Still, in more advanced cases, cases that do not respond to symptomatic therapy or cases of immunocompromised patients, antibiotics should be initiated. Because this is a beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, penicillins and first and second-generation cephalosporins are ineffective and should not be used. The recommended antibiotic therapy for Y. enterocolitica is a combination of doxycycline and an aminoglycoside. Other antibiotics that have been proven effective in treating this condition are trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, and third-generation cephalosporins. Immunocompromised patients with splenic or hepatic abscesses may respond to percutaneous drainage of these abscesses. Long-term intervenous antibiotics should also be administered.
