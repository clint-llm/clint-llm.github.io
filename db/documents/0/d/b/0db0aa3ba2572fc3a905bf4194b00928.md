Scaling is the most common clinical manifestation of stratum corneum disease and represents inadequate or flawed keratinization and desquamation. Those diseases characterized by scaling, and thus stratum corneum breakdown, include dermatitis (eczema), psoriasis, and the ichthyoses. Both eczema and psoriasis result from underlying epidermal changes that cause pathology at the level of the stratum corneum. On the other hand, the ichthyoses result from underlying defects in keratinization.

Dermatitis, or eczema, is a skin reaction secondary to an underlying process such as an immune response or infection. Dermatitis is characterized by a disruption in corneocyte formation in the setting of underlying epidermal keratinocyte spongiosis. Consequently, there is keratinocyte hyperproliferation and disturbed keratinization, which both cause scaling. In psoriasis, activated lymphocytes release cytokines that trigger epidermal hyperproliferation and leukocyte infiltration that similarly causes keratinocyte hyperproliferation and disturbed keratinization, resulting in scaling. Inherited ichthyoses, such as recessive X-linked ichthyosis, result from genetic defects that phenotypically present as skin scaling and diffuse xerosis. Recessive X-linked ichthyosis results specifically from steroid sulfatase deficiency that can affect the stratum corneum and clinically manifest with very dry skinÂ and dark-colored scaling.
