The rectus capitis lateralis, levator scapulae, scalenus medius, and scalenus anterior all lie posteriorly to the internal jugular vein. The sternocleidomastoid muscle overlaps the internal jugular superficially. Additionally, the vein is crossed over by the posterior belly of the digastric and the superior belly of the omohyoid muscles. The sternocleidomastoid and infrahyoid muscles cover the internal jugular vein as it passes under the clavicle.
