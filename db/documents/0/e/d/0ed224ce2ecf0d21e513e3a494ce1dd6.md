- AIP usually has a similar presentation to ARDS.

- AIP is only diagnosed after excluding other etiologies of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.

- There is no specific treatment for AIP. Management is mostly supportive.

- Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started empirically until infection is excluded.

- A lung-protective strategy should be implemented.

- Treatment with steroids has no clear benefit in AIP.

- Mortality is high, and lung transplant should be considered for appropriate candidates.
