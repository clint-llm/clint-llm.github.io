The etiology of tufted hair folliculitis is most often unknown. This clinical aspect can be observed in association with several types of scarring alopecia. It is likely that this finding represents an ultimate stage of follicular injury which can be caused by several different mechanisms. This pattern of hair loss has been reported with scars from trauma, burn, or surgery, acne keloidalis nuchae, folliculitis decalvans, dissecting cellulitis of the scalp, tinea capitis, lichen planus, and pemphigus vulgaris. Tufted hair folliculitis has also been reported with use of some drugs, such as cyclosporin, trastuzumab, and lapatinib. Some authors think that tufted hair folliculitis is a result of preexistent folliculitis, while others believe it is a particular type of folliculitis decalvans since the two conditions share similar histopathological findings.
