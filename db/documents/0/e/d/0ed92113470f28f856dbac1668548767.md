Patients presenting with high myopia, acute angle-closure glaucoma, or spontaneously subluxated lenses should be examined carefully to rule out microspherophakia. Often, the optometrists might be the first ones to come in contact with these patients.

It is important to refer all high myopes presenting for the first time for evaluation to the ophthalmologist for detailed dilated anterior and posterior segment examination. The nursing team can help in explaining the need for regular follow-ups, preparing for any surgical intervention, and guiding the patients for postoperative medications and regular follow-up care. They also play a vital role in providing cross-referrals to low vision clinics and guiding patients for lifestyle modifications and overall psychological upliftment.

Assessment by a pediatrician or physician is necessary to rule out any systemic associations and manage the same. Thus, an interprofessional and holistic management approach can help achieve maximum success with optimal visual outcomes.
