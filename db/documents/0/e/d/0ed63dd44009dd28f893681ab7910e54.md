Absolute contraindications include pregnancy, allergy, or drug interaction. A cautious approach should be adopted when sedating patients taking psychotropics due to the synergist effect resulting in deeper sedation. Several patient groups require special consideration due to the increased risk of complications: those with significant systemic illnesses, e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, multiple co-morbidities, or conditions that cause upper airway obstruction. Common medical problems resulting in this obstruction are obesity and sleep apnea.

Inhalational sedation should be avoided in patients with upper respiratory tract infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and recent middle ear surgery or current infection.
