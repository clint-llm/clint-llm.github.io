Management of lymphoma, including diagnosis, baseline staging, treatment, and monitoring, requires an integrated interprofessional approach. Internationally followed Lugano recommendations were formulated by a leading team of international multispeciality physicians representing major lymphoma clinical trials centers and cancer institutes.

Referring medical oncologists and nuclear radiologists should be familiar with the appropriate indications and limitations of PET/CT. They should also be familiar with the Lugano classification and 5-point PET score. Reading physicians are recommended to include a 5-point PET score when reporting the PET/CT for lymphoma patients, as this information can be extremely valuable for medical oncologists treating the patient.

Open and effective communication amongst the referring clinicians and imaging physicians, as well as participation in the interprofessional tumor board conferences, is highly recommended.
