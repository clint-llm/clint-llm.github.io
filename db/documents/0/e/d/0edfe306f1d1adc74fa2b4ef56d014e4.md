Pott puffy tumor is a rare clinical entity whose incidence has significantly decreased with the use of modern broad-spectrum antibiotics. Even though it is currently rare, rapid recognition and high suspicion is required for prompt management and improved outcomes. It can present in all age groups but is more commonly seen in the pediatric and young adolescent population, as the frontal sinuses may be relatively hypoplastic. The immunocompromised population also has a higher risk for the development of PPT.

Infection can develop in the pediatric age group because the pneumatization process of the frontal and ethmoid sinus starts in early childhood, but can vary, and may not be fully pneumatized until 15 to 18 years old.
