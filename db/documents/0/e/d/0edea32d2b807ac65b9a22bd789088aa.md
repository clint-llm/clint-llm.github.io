Graft dysfunction may present as acute or chronic heart failure or arrhythmias. In such cases, it is important to distinguish cardiac allograft vasculopathy from rejection reaction (cellular or humoral) and non-specific graft dysfunction. Rejection reactions are diagnosed on endomyocardial biopsy. If CAV is suspected, coronary angiography should be performed if renal function permits. The diffuse luminal narrowing is suggestive of CAV. In contrast, focal eccentric lesions, more commonly in the proximal epicardial vessels is more suggestive of atherosclerosis, though the two may exist in tandem.
