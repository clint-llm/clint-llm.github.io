**Risk factors**

CAP is reported to be directly proportional to the complexity of coronary artery disease.

**A. Non-modifiable risk factors**

- Old age

- Female gender

- History of previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)

- Use of clopidogrel

**B. Modifiable risk factors**

- Presence of hypertension

- Presence of peripheral artery disease

- Presence of congestive heart failure

- Lower body mass index

- Lower creatinine clearance

**C. Risk factors associated with coronary anatomy and catheterization**

- Complex coronary lesions (ACC/AHA Type B2, C)

- Chronic total occlusions, heavily calcified lesions, angulated, tortuous lesions, narrow coronary arteries

- Aggressive use of oversized balloons and stents

- Use of atheroablative devices and hydrophilic guidewires
