Individuals with stable angina will often have a subacute versus chronic presentation. It is important to use history and physical as a screening tool to identify high-risk individuals.

Routine screening of blood pressure, weight, sleep habits, stress, exercise tolerance, tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use should be incorporated.

As previously mentioned, typical angina usually presents as chest discomfort or anginal equivalent that is provoked with exertion and alleviated at rest or with nitroglycerin. Anginal equivalents vary, however, commonly can be described as shortness of breath, nausea, or fatigue that is out of proportion to the activity level.

It is important to distinguish between cardiac and non-cardiac chest discomfort. Discussing the details of the patient’s symptoms will further guide this differentiation. Relevant details include the quality, location, influencing factors, timing, and duration of the pain.

Typical angina is often described as pressure-like, heaviness, tightness, or squeezing. Most commonly, it will affect a broad area of the chest rather than a specific spot. There may be radiation of the pain, depending on which dermatomes are affected.

The physical exam is most commonly unremarkable. You would not expect active ischemia in the setting of typical angina, leading to nonspecific physical exam findings.
