The definitive treatment for congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy is currently surgical, either by penetrating keratoplasty (PK) or endothelial keratoplasty (EK). PK is a full-thickness graft and has traditionally been the mainstay of treatment.

PK is technically challenging in the pediatric population, both operatively and postoperatively.

DSAEK grafting, where only the endothelium and part of the posterior stroma are transplanted, has proven to be a viable alternative to PK in CHED. Studies suggest improvement in clinical outcomes without significant complications.

However, DSAEK is not without complications. Children have a clear crystallin lens, a smaller anterior chamber, and increased difficulty to identify and strip the Descemet’s membrane, especially in infants.

Descemet’s membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) is an alternative EK procedure. The graft is prepared by manually stripping the Descemet’s membrane with fine tweezers from the donor cornea.

Some exciting studies have suggested that SLC4A11 mutations that result in impaired-folding of the BTR-1 protein being retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can be corrected nonsurgically with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS).SLC4A11 cell surface functional activity.SLC4A11.SLC4A11 mutation results in misfolded proteins that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. This is a promising treatment since the majority of CHED cases are associated with retained-ER proteins.
