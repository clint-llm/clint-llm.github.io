Imaging is effective at detecting most foreign bodies as well as aiding in their removal by clearly localizing the object of interest within the tissue. It works similar to radiography, but it has an improved ability to differentiate tissue densities, allowing for better visualization of inflammation, abscesses, and granulomas that are frequently secondary clues to a retained foreign body. It comes with the added benefit of being able to provide a more accurate three-dimensional localization of the foreign body. One study found a sensitivity of 68% and specificity of 98% for the detection of all types of foreign bodies using CT imaging. CT studies also come at an increased cost and radiation dose to the patient.
