Goblet cells are visible through laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM).

A different study examined goblet cell carcinoids through light microscopy on paraffin sections. These sections were then mounted with Entellan and not counterstained to better visualize the product. Light microscopy was able to identify goblet cells in the submucous and muscle layer of the appendix.
