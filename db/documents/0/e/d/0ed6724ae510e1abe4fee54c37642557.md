- Millard-Gubler syndrome (MGS) is one of the classical brainstem-crossed syndromes caused due to a unilateral lesion in ventral pons, manifesting as ipsilateral palsy of CN VI and VII with contralateral hemiplegia.

- Etiology varies with age. In younger people, the leading causes are tumors, infectious diseases (neurocysticercosis and tuberculosis), demyelinating disease (multiple sclerosis), and viral infection (Rhomb encephalitis). In older patients, it is more often due to hemorrhage and ischemic stroke.

- MGS clinical features are an ipsilateral weakness of eye abduction and ipsilateral facial muscle weakness along with contralateral upper and lower extremity weakness.

- Diagnosis of MGS depends on a detailed history and physical examination. Imaging studies such as CT and MRI are confirmatory.

- Other pontine-crossed brainstem syndromes include Foville syndrome, Raymond syndrome, Gasperini syndrome, Brissaud-Sicard syndrome, and Raymondâ€“Cestan syndrome.

- Classical Raymond syndrome also has the same components as Millard-Gubler syndrome, but there is ipsilateral sixth nerve palsy along with contralateral facial paresis and hemiplegia.

- Management mainly depends on the etiology of the disease.

- Patients with small lesions usually have a better prognosis. However, MGS caused due to acute basilar artery occlusion has a high mortality rate.
