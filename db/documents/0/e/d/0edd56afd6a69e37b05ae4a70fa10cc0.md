The primary differential diagnoses that should be entertained are large vessel ischemic strokes (most commonly in the middle cerebral artery territory), intracranial hemorrhages (subarachnoid bleeds, subdural bleeds, intracerebral hemorrhage), seizures, and complicated migraine events.

As described earlier in the Evaluation section, large vessel ischemic strokes and intracranial hemorrhages are ruled out by brain imaging with CT and MRI. As described earlier, a large or giant lacune is pathophysiologically not a lacuna but rather a striatocapsular infarct, as described by Dr. Caplan, resulting from atherothrombosis of the middle cerebral artery main stem.  If an acute lacunar infarction is not visible on initial DWI, seizures and complicated migraines should be entertained as possible differential diagnoses.

Seizures will present with cortical signs in addition to focal neurologic deficits. Usually, neurologic deficits will also improve 24 to 48 hours after the seizure event and post-ictal phase. Lastly, an EEG may be used to further rule out a seizure as the cause of the patient’s symptoms.
