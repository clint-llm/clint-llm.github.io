Obesity is now regarded as a full-fledged disease and has reached epidemic proportions, which seem to be increasing. The evolution of bariatric surgery and the technologic innovation that has revolutionized this field offer a potential cure to these patients. Both LSG and LRYGB are options that have been proven to get consistent results for the right patients. Not every obese patient is a good candidate for these surgeries, and a variety of factors as mentioned above should be considered before electing to proceed with weight-loss surgery. While the risk of complication does exist, the overwhelming majority of these patients do veryÂ well, and often beat the disease and its associated comorbidities. Candidates for this surgery should be educated on this subject and should be made aware by their physicians that this option exists. Overall, the progress that this area of surgery has made over the past couple of decades is encouraging.
