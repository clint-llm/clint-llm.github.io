The prognosis of acetabulum fractures has generally been poor due to the high energy and multiple associated injuries.  However, with the advent of open reduction and internal fixation, the prognosis is generally regarded as good.  The prognosis has its basis on several factors, including fracture pattern (T-type with the worst prognosis), condition of the hip at the time of injury (femoral head lesions, marginal impaction, gull sign, adequacy of hip reduction, the stability of joint after treatment).  The clinical and radiographic findings at one year are the most reliable guide to prognosis after treatment, as most hips do not improve after this time.
