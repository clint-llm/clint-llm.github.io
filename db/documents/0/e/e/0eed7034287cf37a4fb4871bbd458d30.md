The primary goal of performing an FNA of a thyroid nodule is to diagnose and/or exclude a malignant thyroid nodule. Ultrasound-guided FNA is imperative in directing the management of thyroid nodules, allowing for prompt diagnosis and treatment of thyroid malignancies. Additionally, the identification of benign thyroid nodules helps avoid unnecessary surgery and helps guide treatment and reduce the cost of care.

Papillary thyroid cancer rates have been gradually increasing in incidence.

The importance of prompt identification and diagnosis of thyroid cancer has also been demonstrated in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, where the mortality rate of localized thyroid cancer has been shown to be significantly better when compared to regional and metastatic disease
