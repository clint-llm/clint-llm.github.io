Hypergammaglobulinemia (polyclonal gammopathy) refers to the overproduction of more than one class of immunoglobulins by plasma cells. It is most commonly associated with liver disease, acute or chronic inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and some malignancies.

Hypergammaglobulinemia (polyclonal gammopathy) is generally considered a benign condition that does not progress to overt malignancy, contrary to monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).
