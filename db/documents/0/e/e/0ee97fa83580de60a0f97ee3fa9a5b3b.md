The motor and sensory innervation of pharyngeal muscles is provided primarily by the pharyngeal plexus. The motor branch of the pharyngeal plexus comes from the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerve. The glossopharyngeal nerve provides motor to the stylopharyngeus muscle. The vagus nerve and its branches provide motor innervation to all other muscles of the pharynx. The sensory fibers of the pharyngeal muscles come from the vagus, glossopharyngeal, and the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve.
