As modern women push the initial childbearing age back, age-related fertility decline is increasing among our population. This activity outlines and reviews the key elements of the pathophysiology, the course, and the key evaluation steps for age-related fertility decline. This inevitable process happens to all women as they age. As clinicians, it is critical to recognize important signs to diagnose this phenomenon correctly through history, physical exams, and laboratory exams. It is, however, even more, vital to have a strong working knowledge of the general trend of age-related fertility decline so that appropriate counseling can be undertaken with patients before they reach the point of irreversible fertility loss. This article also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in diagnosing and addressing patients with this problem.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of age-related fertility decline.
- Review the pathophysiology of fertility decline with age.
- Identify the key laboratory tests that predict disease trends.
- Summarize the conditions for identifying and treating patients with age-related processes affecting reproduction and help guide reproductive endocrinologist consultation.
