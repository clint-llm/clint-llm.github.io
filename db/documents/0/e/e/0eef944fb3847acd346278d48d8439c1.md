**Genetic Testing**

Genetic mutation testing should be done to confirm a diagnosis of HHT, including patients who meet 1-2 of the Curaçao criteria or young children with affected parents who are yet to develop the clinical manifestations.

Once the diagnosis is confirmed, additional tests can be done to evaluate for other HHT manifestations. Screening should be done, regardless of a patient’s clinical symptoms, due to the danger of undiagnosed silent AVMs.

**Ancillary Tests for Visceral AVMs**

Pulmonary AVMs are often silent but can lead to strokes, massive hemoptysis, spontaneous hemothorax, transient ischemic attacks, and brain abscesses.

Multiple cerebral AVMs are predictive of HHT.

Routine gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is not typically performed. However, patients with anemia disproportionate to the severity of epistaxis or with a history of GI bleeding should undergo an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to detect and treat GI AVMs.

Screening for asymptomatic hepatic AVMs with doppler ultrasonography is recommended because it is non-invasive and can improve patient management and outcomes. While doppler ultrasonography is ideal due to its accuracy, cost, safety, and tolerability depending on resources available and operator expertise, patients can be screened by alternate means, such as multiphase contrast CT or MRI.

**Laboratory Evaluation**

Laboratory testing should be done before all surgical interventions and includes a complete blood count and a type and screen or type and crossmatch.

**Pregnancy**

Pregnant women with HHT should have access to a multidisciplinary maternal-fetal team with knowledge on HHT, and pre-conception and prenatal diagnostic options should be discussed. Asymptomatic pregnant women should have an agitated saline transthoracic contrast echocardiography (TTCE) or a diagnostic low-dose chest CT without contrast for pulmonary AVMs. Any intervention should be delayed until the 2nd trimester.

Spinal AVMs can be detected with a spinal MRI and can be considered in pregnant women, particularly if epidural anesthesia is considered.
