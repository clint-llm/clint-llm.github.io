The pathophysiology of morphea is vague, but there is evidence supporting the role of autoimmune dysregulation with abnormal cytokine production and vascular dysfunction in morphea. Excess collagen deposition in the dermis also plays a crucial role in morphea.

Multiple external factors like trauma, environmental exposures, and radiation therapy can trigger and contribute to the onset of morphea.

The role of immune dysregulation is confirmed by the presence of inflammatory infiltrates in skin biopsies laden with eosinophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. IL-4 cytokine is detected at higher levels in patients with morphea. Also, patients with generalized morphea often test positive for ANA and other autoimmune antibodies.

There is an increased presence of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) and intracellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) in patients with morphea, which facilitate the recruitment of T lymphocytes in the acute phase.

CD-4 T helper cells play a significant role by producing IL-4 cytokine, which causes the upregulation of TGF-B. TGF-B stimulates fibroblast production of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins.
