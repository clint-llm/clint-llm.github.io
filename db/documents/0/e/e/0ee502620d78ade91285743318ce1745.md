The personnel involved in either a pulmonary artery or central venous catheterization should be trained to avoid possible complications of cannulation; this includes knowledge of proper positioning during initial cannulation as well as experience in recognizing signs of early complications that may arise after access. Also, other personnel should be prepared to identify and interpret data and waveforms obtained from monitoring hemodynamic changes. Improper or delayed interpretation of this diagnostic tool limits the application of any therapeutic regimen and may even lead to potential harm to patients.

Experience with ultrasound guidance for inserting central venous catheters (CVC) and interpretation of pressure waveform and chest radiographs will help to confirm the location of the distalÂ tip of catheters to prevent the erroneous placement of catheters.
