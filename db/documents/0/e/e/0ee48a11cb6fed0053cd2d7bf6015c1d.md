Glaucoma is an ocular disease characterized by ocular hypertension that leads to optic neuropathy and visual field loss.

Pigment dispersion glaucoma or pigmentary glaucoma (PG) is considered secondary open-angle glaucoma. PG and pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS)

An interesting triad of symptoms for PG was first reported by Sugar et al. in 1949,

Campbell reported that pigment dispersion and accumulation in PG could be caused by pigment loss (melanin granules) from constant friction and rubbing between the posterior iris pigment epithelium and the lens zonules during physiological pupil movement,

The pigment deposited in the AC contributes to chronic damage and death of TM cells over time, limiting the proper function and efficiency. Elevated IOP in PG results from aqueous buildup and reduction of TM aqueous humor outflow, leading to visual field loss associated with chronic optic neuropathy. The disease, which is typically bilateral, is prevalent in males with myopia and is typically diagnosed between 30 to 50 years.
