The gastrocolic reflex has correlations with the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome. The act of food consumption can provoke an overreaction of the gastrocolic response due to heightened visceral sensitivity seen in IBS patients, resulting in abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, bloating, and tenesmus. It is also a known fact that ondansetron decreases the tonic response to stretch, giving evidence toward its use in providing relief for patients with IBS. Commonly prescribed medications to treat overreactive gastrocolic response include antispasmodics, tricyclic antidepressants, and SSRIs.Â Antibiotics and probiotics have also been utilized to restore normal colonic flora, which in turn helps regulate the response of integral components of the reflex.

The gastrocolic reflex is most active during morning time and immediately after meals. Using this physiological reflex to our advantage helps treat constipation. For both children and geriatric patients with constipation, using the toilet immediately after having breakfast and establishing a daily routine helps to improve constipation. The use of stimulant laxatives like sennosides or bisacodyl will augment the gastrocolic reflex and helps in improved colonic contractions and defecation.
