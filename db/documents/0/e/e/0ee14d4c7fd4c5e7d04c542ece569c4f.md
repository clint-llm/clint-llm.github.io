Substances with anticholinergic activity are used and misused extensively worldwide. Toxicity typically occurs secondary to an overdose of compounds with anticholinergic properties, although mild toxicity can even be seen as a side effect when the medication is taken appropriately. The vast majority of these agents are orally ingested. The naturally occurring compounds atropine, hyoscyamine, and hyoscine are the prototypical anticholinergics from which others are synthesized. Atropine is an antidote for cholinergic toxicity from organophosphates and nerve agents and acute treatment of bradyarrhythmias.

Medications with anticholinergic properties include antidepressants, antihistamines, antiparkinson drugs, antipsychotics, antispasmodics, and mydriatics. Many medications possess anticholinergic activity as their primary pharmacologic effect, while others exhibit these properties as adverse effects. Ingestion of multiple medications with anticholinergic properties is synergistic. This is especially important for elderly patients on numerous medications.

Plants are also a common source of accidental and intentional anticholinergic ingestion.
