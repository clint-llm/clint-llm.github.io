**Caffeine**

Very high doses of caffeine can cause various supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, caffeine dosing should be optimized in patients who experience heart disease, but this is a prudent measure even in other patients.

**Acetaminophen**

Acetaminophen overdose is the leading cause of drug-induced acute liver failure in many countries. Liver intoxication initiates by metabolizing acetaminophen to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), depleting cellular glutathione and forming protein adducts on mitochondrial proteins; this leads to the activation of the apoptosis cascade. Intoxication differs between the individuals according to some factors, specifically, decreased P53 that shows a protective role in regulating the metabolism of acetaminophen, increased protein kinase (cAMP-dependent) inhibitor alpha, deficiency of interleukin 15, and deficiency of prostaglandin E2.

Also, acetaminophen stimulates Kupffer cells to form peroxynitrite, a potent oxidant, and leads to the accumulation of neutrophils.

Lower acetaminophen (150 mg/kg) causes reversible mitochondrial dysfunction and fat droplet formation in hepatocytes without ALT release or necrosis.

**Antidote**

Acetylcysteine is known as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species. It can be used with no contraindications, orally within 8 to 10 hours of the overdose, and intravenously in patients more than 10 hours after the overdose or in patients with conditions preventing taking it orally. It has a limited therapeutic window. There is a need to develop interventions for late-presenting patients.

Up to 10% of patients with acetaminophen overdose may experience acute kidney injury, and rarely, some patients may present with acute pancreatitis along with hepatic failure.

**Aspirin**

Acute ingestion of more than 150 mg/kg or 6.5 g of aspirin or ingestion of greater than a lick or taste of wintergreen (98% methyl salicylate) by children younger than the age of 6, or 4 mL of oil of wintergreen by patients who are six years of age or older warrants referral to an emergency department.

The potentially chronic clinical manifestations of salicylate toxicity include:

- Hematemesis

- Tachypnea

- Hyperpnea

- Dyspnea

- Tinnitus

- Deafness

- Lethargy

- Seizures

- Severe weakness

- Complete heart block or confusion

Patients with such symptoms and signs should receive a referral to the emergency department. Infants initially diagnosed with neonatal sepsis due to metabolic acidosis, tachypnea, and hypoglycemia who failed to respond to therapy should undergo further investigation to exclude salicylate toxicity, especially in infants whose mothers took aspirin throughout the pregnancy.

Laboratory results will show respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis, and elevated salicylate concentration. Patients may develop renal tubular acidosis during treatment, which causes normal anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Metabolic findings in salicylate toxicity may be explainable by the following:

- Stimulation of the respiratory center of the brain, leading to respiratory alkalosis

- Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, leading to an increase in glyconeogenesis and an increase in heat production

- Inhibition of Krebs cycle enzymes, leading to an increase in organic acids

- Alterations in lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism, enhancing metabolic acidosis

- Increasing fluid and electrolytes losses, leading to dehydration, depletion of sodium, potassium depletion, and loss of buffer capacity

Salicylate toxicity may be acquired in multiple ways: oral route, intravenously, or excessive application of topical agents. Methyl salicylate is absorbable through intact skin, where the scrotal skin can have up to 40-fold greater absorption compared to dermal regions.

Patients with salicylate toxicity should not have vomiting induced for acute ingestion of toxic doses. Out-of-hospital administration of activated charcoal should merit consideration in the following conditions:

- The patient is not vomiting

- No delay in transportation to administer activated charcoal

For asymptomatic patients with dermal exposures to methylsalicylate of salicylic acid, the skin should be washed with soap and water. The patient can undergo observation at home for the development of symptoms.

For chronic topical poisoning, modern high-flux, intermittent hemodialysis is an effective method for removing salicylates.

For ocular exposure, the affected eye requires irrigation with room-temperature tap water for 15 minutes and referral for an ophthalmological examination if the patient has pain, decreased visual acuity, or persistent irritation.

For oral or intravenous ingestion, fluid resuscitation and sodium bicarbonate infusion should be initiated with an administration of glucose; a patient with severe toxicity should undergo hemodialysis, and mechanical ventilation is recommended.

Complicated outcomes of salicylic poisoning are associated with the following conditions:

- Chronic poisoning

- Advanced age

- Infants younger than 12 months of age

- Concurrent medical diseases

- Neurological symptoms

- Low standard HCO3

- Increased respiratory rate

- Initial serum lactate

- Haemodialysis not performed

Initial salicylate concentration alone is not predictive.
