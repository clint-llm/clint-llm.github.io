Neurapraxia, as a complication of perioperative injuries, is usually via compression. Inappropriate perioperative position and/or poor padding are the main culprits. Examples include ulnar nerve damage in the park bench position, due to increased pressure and excessive flexion at the level of the elbow; the radial nerve suffers injury due to compression between the humerus and the edge of the operating table

Local anesthesia (LA) can cause neurapraxia through different mechanisms. One way is by causing vasoconstriction, which leads to nerve ischemia. It can also produce chemical nerve injury.
