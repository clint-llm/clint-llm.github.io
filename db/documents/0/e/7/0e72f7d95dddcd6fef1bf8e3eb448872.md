The overall prognosis is not dependent solely on one provider, but rather an interprofessional team of experts. Timely diagnosis and awareness among other physicians, family practitioners, in particular, is important. The latter group isÂ often the initial healthcare providers to diagnose BSS in a patient, especially one with non-traumatic etiology. A prompt surgical referral can allow for early decompression and stabilization if needed, which has been shown to improve outcomes in all incomplete spinal cord injuries. Patient education and setting up expectations on prognosis will help in the postoperative arena, and the prolonged rehabilitative course as recovery can progress for years after the initial injury. BSS, especially isolated and not in conjunction with other incomplete spinal cord injury patterns is rare. There are a few level three studies, but the majority of studies include case reports with level-five evidence. Therefore, further higher-quality studies need to conducted to elucidate ideal prognostic and treatment algorithms.
