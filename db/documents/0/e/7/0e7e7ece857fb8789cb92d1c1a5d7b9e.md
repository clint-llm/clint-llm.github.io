Fluorescein angiography often shows leaking from the retinal vessels and nerve head. Leakage can often produce cystoid macular edema and is thought to be the leading cause of visual loss in patients with BCR. If there is clinical suspicion for BCR, the following can help confirm the diagnosis: HLA-A29, syphilis serology, ACE level in all cases; interferon-gamma release assay and/or a Mantoux test in selected high-risk cases; chest x-ray (looking for evidence of sarcoidosis or TB) in all cases; Indocyanine green angiography (ICG), fluorescein angiography (FA), and electroretinography (ERG) in all cases.

Over the years, a number of diagnostic criteria have been proposed. Essential criteria are (1) bilateral disease; (2) three or more characteristic birdshot lesions inferior or nasal to the disk in one eye; (3) low-grade anterior chamber inflammation (no more than 1+ cells in the anterior chamber on the SUN score); (4) low-grade vitreous inflammation (no more than 2+ on the NEI/SUN vitreous haze score). Birdshot lesions are defined as being “cream-colored, irregular or elongated, choroidal lesions with indistinct borders, the long axis of which is radial to the optic disk.”
