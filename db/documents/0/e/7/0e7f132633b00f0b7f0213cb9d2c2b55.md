Due to the close relationship between the apex of the primary tooth root and the underlying permanent tooth germ, there is potential for sequelae to the permanent tooth following orofacial and primary tooth trauma.

Enamel discoloration, enamel hypoplasia, crown or root dilaceration, arrested root formation, and eruption disturbances in the developing permanent dentition are some of the potential complications following primary tooth trauma.

Intrusion and avulsion injuries are the most common type of TDI associated with complications to the permanent dentition.
