With having the best outcome of the disease as the aim, an inter-disciplinary approach is required where the physician, pathologist, and possibly the renal transplant team all collaborate. Once a patient is diagnosed with DPGN, the severity of the disease is assessed, and the need for a possible renal transplant is evaluated. Studies have shown that renal allograft transplants are associated with the recurrence of de-novo glomerulonephritis. Patients are required to be educated regarding the importance of medication compliance as well as the possible side effects of immuno-suppressant therapy. The possibility of relapse and no response to treatment should be communicated to the patient, along with the possibility of needing life-long hemodialysis.
