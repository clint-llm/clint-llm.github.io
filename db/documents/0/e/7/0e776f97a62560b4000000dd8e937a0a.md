Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is a microbial infection of the endovascular that occurs on parts of a prosthetic valve or on the reconstructed native valve of the heart.

Based on the time of the disease acquirement, this disease is classified into two types, early and late PVE. The early PVE is acquired within one year of the surgery, while the late PVE is acquired after one year.Â The clinical importance of this classification is the distinct microbiological profiles between the former and the latter.
