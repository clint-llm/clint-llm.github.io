Thyroglossal duct cysts are present in about 7% of the population worldwide. They have an equal preponderance between male and female individuals. Although they are known to be the most common pediatric mass, they also present in adults with varying frequency. These types of cysts are closely associated with the hyoid bone. They are about 20% to 25% present at the level of suprahyoid, 15% to 20% present at the level of hyoid, and 25% to 65 % present at the infrahyoid level.
