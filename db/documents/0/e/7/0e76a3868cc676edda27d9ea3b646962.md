The following are the necessary materials to perform a TAP block (Image 1):

- Sterile ultrasound probe cover sleeve

- Sterile ultrasound gel

- Sterile towels

- Sterile gloves

- Antiseptic for skin disinfection, such as chlorhexidine 2%

- Nerve block needle (50-mm to 100-mm, 20-gauge to 21-gauge needle) with tubing

- Local Anesthetic Agent: Ropivacaine, Bupivacaine or Liposomal Bupivacaine

- One 5ml syringe containing lidocaine for skin local anesthesia (if the patient is awake)
