Trauma to the coronal suture may present in various manners, from lateral blows to the head to falls and superior impacts. Trauma to the region of the coronal suture and pterion is of great concern as both displaced cranial fractures and non-displaced fractures may result in an injury to the middle meningeal artery or one of its branches.

The anterior division of the middle meningeal arch crosses or runs parallel to the coronal suture rising above the pterion. Trauma to this location is concerning for a life-threatening epidural hematoma, a bleed located between the dura mater (outer membrane covering the brain) and the inner table of the skull. An epidural hematoma may present with a “lucid interval,” during which the patient may display minimal symptoms. Diagnosis is typically made with a head CT or brain MRI. Imaging will most often reveal a convex hematoma along the inner table of the skull. The convex shape of the epidural hematoma is formed by the pressure required to strip the dura mater from the skull's inner table. This type of hematoma often requires neurosurgical consultation and intervention due to the arterial etiology.
