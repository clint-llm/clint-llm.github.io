Positron emission tomography (PET)  scanning is an imaging modality with primary use in the field of oncology. It utilizes radiotracers for measuring various metabolic processes in the body. Various changes in metabolism, blood flow, and regional chemical composition can be analyzed by it. Radio-tracers can be injected, swallowed, or inhaled depending upon the site of the body being examined, and the tracer gets trapped in various tissues of the body depending upon the affinity. Areas of higher activity show higher uptake and brighter spots on images. Unstable nuclei of radioactive-tracer emit positrons that produce gamma rays upon the combination with the neighboring electrons. The gamma rays are detected by a ring of detectors in the scanner. A computer then uses this data to create a 3D-image of the tracer in the body. Various tracers are utilized depending on the targets.
