Histopathologic findings are helpful to confirm a diagnosis and correlate with the clinical state of morphea. A punch biopsy is recommended, and it should include the subcutaneous fat for appropriate tissue diagnosis.

In new lesions, a biopsy of the inflammatory border reveals a perivascular infiltrate predominantly composed of lymphocytes and plasma cells, with some eosinophils and macrophages. Older sclerotic lesions demonstrate collagen bundles extending into the reticular dermis, enclosing the eccrine glands and blood vessels.

Eosinophilic fasciitis lesions demonstrate thickened fascia infiltrated with lymphocytes, eosinophils, and macrophages. Histopathologic findings also help to exclude other fibrosing disorders like scleromyxedema, myxedema, radiation dermatitis, amyloidosis, chronic graft-versus-host disease, lipodystrophy, sarcoidosis, and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.
