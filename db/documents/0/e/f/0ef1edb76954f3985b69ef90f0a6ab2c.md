Anal fissures are a common cause of anal pain, affecting approximately 250,000 new patients every year in the United States. Although it is difficult to measure the true prevalence of disease given reluctance of patients to discuss anorectal issues, it is purported to have equal prevalence amongst men and women. Long term recurrence is seen in patients that have typically only underwent medical therapy. It is rare to see patients who have undergone surgical treatment to have relapsing symptoms. Further investigation must be done if patient fails surgical management, as this may suggest other pathologies.
