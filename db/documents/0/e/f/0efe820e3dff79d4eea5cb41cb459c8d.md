It is essential to have a detailed discussion tailored to each patient detailing their risks and explaining the pros and cons of screening.Â In the future, the need will exist to develop better predictive tools to help localize at-risk patients and focus on those populations for screening. Ultimately, primary prevention has the most significant impact on lung cancer associated mortality, however secondary prevention is also essential. Studies have shown decreased deaths with screening, and overall the benefits of screening outweigh the risks if the correct population is selected. Clinicians must talk about smoking cessation along with screening and patients with positive LDCT must have close follow-ups.
