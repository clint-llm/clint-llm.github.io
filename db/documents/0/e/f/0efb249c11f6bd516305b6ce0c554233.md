Novel cell lineage tracking technologies have led to recent revisions in the model of hematopoiesis. Classically, the model is as described above: HSCs divide into multipotent progenitor cells that can further divide into common myeloid progenitors or common lymphoid progenitors. Revised models demonstrate fewer branch points and instead show a steady differentiation of heterogenous HSC to the final cell lines. This leads to a to a more varied pool of HSC that are partially differentiated as opposed to groups of identical precursors. Traditionally these HSC are differentiated by cell surface markers which vary between HSC, progenitor cells, and mature cells. Cell surface markers between these partially differentiated HSC do not necessarily change despite a change in gene signaling, which gave rise to the classical branching model.
