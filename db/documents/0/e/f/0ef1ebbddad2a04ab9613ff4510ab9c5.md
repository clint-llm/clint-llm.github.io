Diagnostic evaluation for hemophilia occurs in the setting of known family history, excessive bleeding out of proportion to the traumatic injury, or abnormally activated partial thromboplastin time. Normal hemogram and prothrombin time in the setting of elevated activated partial thromboplastin time heightens the suspicion of hemophilia and should prompt factor VIII and IX determination. Determining residual plasma concentration of factor VIII represents the keystone of diagnosis, classification, and treatment of hemophilia A as therapy and prognosis will vary depending on factor VIII deficiency. Most hemophilia A patients have a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time; however, a normal result does not rule out mild hemophilia. Hemorrhage severity in hemophilia A correlates scarcity of factor VIII. Factor VIII concentration, expressed in international units (IU); 1 IU is the concentration of factor VIII in 1 mL of pooled plasma or percentages of normal pooled plasma with normal levels ranging between 50% to 150%. Severe Hemophilia A will have no measurable factor VIII, less than 0.01 IU/mL or less than 1%, and will bleed spontaneously. Moderate or mild hemophilia, 0.02 to 0.05 IU/mL (2% to 5%) or 0.06 IU/mL to 0.40 IU/mL (6% to 40%) respectively, will bleed excessively after relatively insignificant trauma.
