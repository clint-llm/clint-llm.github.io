Hymenoptera stings can happen in any age group, and the insects are not selective to a particular gender. Humans are most often stung by either accidental contact with a solitary worker (single sting from a single insect) or because they are near a disrupted nest (multiple stings from multiple insects). Occupations that may increase the risk of exposure to these stings include, but are not limited to, construction workers, landscapers, entomologists, beekeepers, and exterminators, among others. Vespidae (specifically hornets and yellow jackets) are likely the culprits in most situations due to their aggressive and territorial nature. Most sting reactions are self-limited, result in a small area of local inflammation, and resolve within a few days. Other local reactions may be larger, more painful, and last longer. These are less common (less than 10%) and termed large local reactions (LLRs) and may require medical intervention. Systemic reactions are far less common but can be fatal if they occur.

Each year in the US, there are about 62 deaths associated with hymenoptera bites. Although most bites occur in children, insect bites are also common in adults who venture into the jungle or hike in forested areas.
