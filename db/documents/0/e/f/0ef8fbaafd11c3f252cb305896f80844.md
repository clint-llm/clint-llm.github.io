The American Society of Hematology defines immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) as isolated thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 100,000/microL) with normal white blood cells and normal hemoglobin in the setting of a generalized purpuric rash. ITP was previously known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or immune thrombocytopenic purpura. ITP without a secondary cause or underlying disorder is known as primary ITP and is the focus of this article. Secondary ITP is defined as ITP with an underlying cause or disorder, which includes drug-induced or systemic illness-induced (e.g., SLE, HIV, CVID, etc.). Severe ITP (generally when platelet counts are below 20,000/microL) warrants medical treatment. ITP is most commonly seen in children at any age, as well as in the adult population. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and explains the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of immune thrombocytopenic purpura.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with immune thrombocytopenic purpura.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with immune thrombocytopenic purpura.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interdisciplinary team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by immune thrombocytopenic purpura.
