The QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG) represents the duration of the ventricular action potential, and this physiologically correlates with the duration of the ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Cardiac events and fatal arrhythmias may occur when the QT interval is prolonged either congenitally or through acquired causes. This activity reviews the causes of QT prolongation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of prolonged QT syndrome.
- Review the ECG features of prolonged QT syndrome.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for prolonged QT syndrome.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of QT prolongation and improve patient outcomes.
