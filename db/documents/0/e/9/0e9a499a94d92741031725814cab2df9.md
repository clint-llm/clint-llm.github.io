Polarization of light refers to the process by which the oscillations of the electric field vector within an electromagnetic (EM) wave become restricted to a single plane.

All light possesses polarization. Light, commonly termed "unpolarized," lacks organized polarization, instead exhibiting randomized polarization. Randomly polarized light is a type of light in which the electric field vector oscillates in random directions perpendicular to the direction of the light's propagation. In other words, the light waves are not aligned in any particular direction and are constantly changing orientation.

Linearly polarized light occurs when the electric field vector oscillates in a single plane perpendicular to the direction of the light's propagation. The direction of polarization is typically denoted as either vertical or horizontal but can be at any angle relative to the viewer. Light can be linearly polarized with a polarizer that selectively transmits light waves in a desired polarization direction while blocking others.

Circularly polarized light occurs when the electric field vector rotates around the direction of the light's propagation in a circle, with a constant amplitude and frequency; it can be thought of as a combination of two linearly polarized waves of equal amplitude and perpendicular polarization directions, with a phase difference of 90 degrees between them.

Elliptically polarized light is a type in which the electric field vector traces out an ellipse as it propagates, with varying amplitude and phase. This type of polarization can be considered a combination of two linearly polarized waves of unequal amplitude and perpendicular polarization directions, with a phase difference between them that is not necessarily 90 degrees.

Polarized light is utilized in various diagnostic and therapeutic techniques in ophthalmology, such as anterior segment imaging, retinal imaging, photodynamic therapy, low-level light therapy, and laser surgery. The unique properties of polarized light offer numerous benefits for enhancing patient care, from improving visual performance to facilitating the diagnosis and management of various ocular conditions.
