Beta-lactamase inhibitors are drugs that are co-administered with beta-lactam antimicrobials to prevent antimicrobial resistance by inhibiting serine beta-lactamases, which are enzymes that inactivate the beta-lactam ring, which is a common chemical structure to all beta-lactam antimicrobials. This activity outlines the different types of beta-lactamase inhibitors. It discusses the pharmacological properties of beta-lactamase inhibitors, their medical uses, methods of administration, side effects, and other properties. It also highlights the critical role that providers play in terms of correctly administering beta-lactamase inhibitors in combination with beta-lactam antimicrobials and counseling patients regarding medication adherence.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the different forms of beta-lactamase inhibitors, their pharmacological properties, and their medical indications.

- Review the potential adverse effects of beta-lactamase inhibitors. 
- Summarize the methods of monitoring and administration of beta-lactamase inhibitor therapy. 
- Explain the importance of medication adherence and routine monitoring of patients taking beta-lactamase inhibitor therapy, as well as the importance of collaboration amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care.
