PLE is a relatively common skin disorder that is not easy to diagnose or manage. The disorder may be confused with many other skin disorders and thus is best managed by a dermatologist. However, once the diagnosis is made, the patient may be monitored by the primary care physician and nurse practitioner. These healthcare professionals should educate the patients on preventio which includes wearing appropriate garments when going outside and use ample sunscreen frequently.

The condition is benign but recurrences are common leading to emotional distress and isolation. Thus, a patient may benefit from a mental health counsultant.
