The clinical findings on the naked eye exam have been detailed above (see History and Physical section). Clinical diagnosis can be challenging due to overlapping features with benign lesions such as solar lentigo, pigmented actinic keratosis, and others. For this reason, optical imaging tools such as dermoscopy and more newly reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) have been developed to aid in diagnosis.

Dermoscopic findings for LM/LMM reveal a stepwise progression of features based on the degree of infiltration of the follicular ostia. Early lesions exhibit peppering of pigmentation around follicular ostia, known as annular-granular structures or blue-grey dots. As the lesion grows, the dots will coalesce to form short polygonal lines around and between adnexal openings. Further progression of the tumor leads to merging and darkening of the polygonal lines into polyhedral shapes known as rhomboidal structures. Eventually, the tumor obliterates the entire follicular ostia and becomes a homogeneous dark brown to black blotch.

RCM findings specific for LM/LMM are divided into major and minor criteria.
