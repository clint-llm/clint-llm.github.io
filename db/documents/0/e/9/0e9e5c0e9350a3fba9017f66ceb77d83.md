**Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and neonatal ARDS**

ARDS is a lung injury due to acute inflammation that leads to increased vascular permeability. According to the Berlin definition, the onset of respiratory distress and hypoxia should be within one week of a known clinical insult or new or worsening symptoms. Chest imaging should reveal bilateral opacities, and pulmonary edema should not be from heart failure or due to fluid overload.

Neonatal ARDS is an acute pulmonary inflammatory disease resulting from the deficiency of pulmonary surfactant. Although there is no particular treatment, supportive measures such as ventilatory support, surfactant replacement, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), nutritional support, and liquid management are the cornerstones of management.

While the pathogenesis of these two conditions differs, the pathophysiological result and concepts are very similar. There is a loss of surfactant, which causes an imposing increase in alveolar surface tension, pressure, and resistance, which prevent lung expansion. As a result of an increase in alveolar pressure within the lung due to either fluid accumulation or inflammation, there becomes a net increase in transpulmonary pressure, which prevents airflow and lung expansion during inspiration.
