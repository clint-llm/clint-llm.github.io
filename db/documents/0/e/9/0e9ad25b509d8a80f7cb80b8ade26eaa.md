Thorough anamnesis and clinical findings are crucial in distinguishing between other oral pathologies.

Periapical abscess: a history of trauma, tooth wear, fracture, caries, or deep restoration may indicate pulpal damage. Vitality testing with electric or thermal stimulation will either provide a negative or inconclusive response. Radiographically, a periapical radiolucency may be evident if the patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation of a chronic periapical lesion.

Combined periodontic-endodontic abscesses: can be categorized according to the origin of the infection into primary endodontic abscess with secondary periodontal involvement, primary periodontal abscess with secondary endodontic involvement, or a true combined periodontal-endodontic abscess. Correct diagnosis relies on collaborating the history, clinical examination, and pulp testing, and intraoral radiographs.

Pericoronal abscess: abscesses from a partially erupted tooth can often mimic a periodontal abscess. Clinicians should look out for vital adjacent teeth with no increased periodontal pocketing.

Partial root fracture: fractures are detectable through visual inspection, increased mobility, and tenderness. Taking radiographs from different angles can help to detect fractures. Similarly, endodontic perforations or perforations resulting from posts are also detectable through intraoral radiographs of alternative angulations.

Squamous cell carcinoma: clinicians should be vigilant when assessing and treating recurrent periodontal abscesses as literature reveals cases of gingival squamous cell carcinomas mimicking periodontal disease and their associated abscesses.

Self-inflicted gingival injuries: habits such as nail-biting and trauma due to objects, e.g., pens and pins, can cause similar-looking lesions. These can be ruled out through taking a complete history, and there should be considerations regarding habit dissuasion methods.

Other less common differentials include lateral periapical cyst, postoperative infection, odontogenic myxoma, metastatic carcinoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, pyogenic granuloma, osteomyelitis, odontogenic keratocyst, eosinophilic granuloma, and post-surgical abscess.
