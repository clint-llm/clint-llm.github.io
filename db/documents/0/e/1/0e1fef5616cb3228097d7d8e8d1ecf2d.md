**Quantitative Olfactory Function and Dysfunction**

Normosmia: olfactory function is normal, compared to age- and sex-matched normative olfactory test values

Hyposmia: the score on olfactory tests is lower than the normal range, but the olfactory ability present is of some use for the patient in daily life (such as the ability to defect the fumes of fire and the odor of natural gas)

Hyperosmia: olfactory ability falls abnormally above the normal range.

Anosmia: no olfactory functioning is present

Functional Anosmia: the score on olfactory tests falls markedly below the normal range, but the olfactory function of the patient is not useful for daily life.

**Qualitative Olfactory Function and Dysfunction**

Parosmia: the perception of an odor when an odorâ€™s stimulus is present, but the perception is distorted (for instance, the odor of a rose is perceived as the sulfurous odor of a rotten egg).

Phantosmia: the perception of an odor when no odorous stimulus is present (for instance, the perception of a flower fragrance but no odor stimulus such as a flower is present).

Cacosmia: when the perception of an unpleasant odor without the presence of an odor stimulus.
