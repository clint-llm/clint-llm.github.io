The diagnosis and evaluation of AKU can be established based on the severity scoring system.

**AKU Severity Score Index (AKUSSI):**is a clinical scoring system of an objective measurement of severity. It is based on a quantitative validated multidisciplinary assessment.

system.

The clinical objectives include,

- Pigmentation of eye and ear

- Prostate and salivary stone

- Osteopenia

- stroke

- Aortic valvular heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation

**Laboratory Diagnosis**

- The urine test for HGA is the gold-standard test to diagnose alkaptonuria. The amount of homogentisic acid in the 24-hour urine is detected via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The amount of HGA excreted each day in patients with AKU is usually between 1 and 8 grams. The change in urine color is non-specific.

- Molecular genetic testing can identify the biallelic abnormalities in HGD and other mutations that can help in family counseling.

- Various imaging modalities like CT scan or MRI help in assessing the severity of joint involvement.

- 2D-Echocardiography can detect valvular abnormalities.

- CT Angiogram can detect calcification of coronary vessels.
