The majority of biotransformation takes place within the liver in cells called hepatocytes. However, several of the enzymes for phase I, phase II, and phase III reactions can also occur in extrahepatic tissues, such as adipose, intestine, kidney, lung, and skin. The transformation process takes place as a result of the interaction between the substrate and enzymes found primarily in these cells' cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria.
