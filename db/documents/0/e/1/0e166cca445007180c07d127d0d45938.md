Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is the most common form of dermatitis. Genetic as well as environmental factors are thought to play a part in the pathogenesis. Eczema is most commonly seen in children but can be seen in adults. People with the disease tend to have dry, itchy skin that is prone to infection. Eczema is commonly known as the "itch that rashes" due to dry skin that leads to a rash as a result of scratching or rubbing. The most important treatment of eczema is skin hydration followed by topical steroids for flare-ups.
