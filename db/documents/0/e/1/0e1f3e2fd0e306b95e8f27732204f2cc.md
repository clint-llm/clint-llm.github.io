In the early stage of the disease, skin lesions often serve as an indicator for a symptomless internal malignancy. Whereas the skin lesions improve significantly after adequate tumor therapy, the nail changes often remain. The original nail growth is often reduced, and a complete remission is absent. If the tumor reoccurs or if there are metastases present, the skin lesions usually worsen again. The management of these patients should involve an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals due to the varied types of cancers that can be involved. Once the diagnosis is made, there should be no delay in ruling out a malignancy. [Level 5]
