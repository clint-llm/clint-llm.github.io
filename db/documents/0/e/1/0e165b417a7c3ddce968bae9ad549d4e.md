Conservative treatment options depend on the severity of the injury and the patient's symptoms. They include:

- Analgesic medications, including oral or topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

- Corticosteroid injections andÂ steroids can help decrease any inflammation contributing to the process.

- Physical therapy

- Immobilization with proper splints for at least 2 to 4 weeks, or until the symptoms have resolved

Patients typically recover 4 months after starting treatment as long as the nerve is not lacerated or torn. The prognosis for patients with acute compressive radial nerve injuries is good.

Some radial nerve injuries end up requiring more aggressive management. If the radial nerve is entrapped and symptoms last for several months, surgery is indicated to relieve the pressure on the nerve. This should always be the last option for the patient.
