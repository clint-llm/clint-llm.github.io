**Indications**

Osteoporosis is defined as low bone mineral density caused by altered bone microstructure, leading to increased fracture risk. Bone mineral density is commonly measured utilizing a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA or DXA) scan to assess bone mineral density.

A DEXA scan reports the t-score, measured in standard deviations, and reflects the difference between the patient's measured bone mineral density and the mean value of bone mineral density.

- A t-score between -1 and +1 reflects healthy bone.

- A t-score between -1.0 and -2.5 reflects the diagnosis of osteopenia.

- A t-score below -2.5 reflects a diagnosis of osteoporosis.

- The lower the bone density is, the greater the fracture risk.

Abaloparatide is a synthetic peptide analog of human parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). In 2017, the FDA approved its use in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.

In the abaloparatide Comparator Trial In Vertebral Endpoints (ACTIVE), subcutaneous abaloparatide reduced the risk of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures, along with clinical and major osteoporotic fractures, significantly, compared to placebo.

Traditional therapy for osteoporosis includes bisphosphonates and teriparatide. Studies have compared the efficacy of traditional therapy to abaloparatide. In a phase II double-blind randomized control trial, the safety and efficacy of abaloparatide were assessed by comparison to teriparatide and placebo. Among these treatment groups, abaloparatide was superior in increasing total bone mineral density.

A comparative study comparing two sequential therapies (2 years of initial teriparatide followed by alendronate therapy and two years of abaloparatide followed by alendronate therapy) demonstrated that abaloparatide followed by alendronate has a greater treatment efficacy.

Abaloparatide This drug has an off-label use for symptomatic pseudarthrosis patients with metabolic syndromes.

Abaloparatide is not recommended in pediatric patients with open epiphyses or genetic predispositions to bone malignancies.[20] The effects of abaloparatide on pregnancy, breastfeeding mothers, breastfed infants, milk production, and the pediatric population are unknown.
