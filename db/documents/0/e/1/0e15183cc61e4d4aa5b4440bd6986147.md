Despite advances in cross-sectional imaging and endovascular techniques, the prognosis for those that develop an AEF remains profoundly poor. In one review of those treated for aortoduodenal fistula in the 1980s, overall survival was an abysmal 14%, with 36% of patients undergoing treatment dying in the immediate perioperative period.

More recent analyses have shown some improvement in mortality, with one report demonstrating a 50% mortality rate of those patients undergoing treatment for AEF within 60 days of repair while another, slightly larger series reported a 30-day all-cause mortality rate of 43% for those who underwent repair.

Overall, the mortality rate for those who develop AEFs is not totally known. It is certainly underestimated here as the aforementioned survival rates include only those patients for whom a diagnosis was made, and surgical repair attempted. Many patients die before a correct diagnosis can be made, excluding them from the studies presented here.
