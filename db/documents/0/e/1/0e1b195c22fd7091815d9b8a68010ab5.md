Safety and optimal treatment areÂ vital to patient health. Patients with a history of seizures or epilepsy should avoid MAOIs; these medications can increase the occurrence of seizures. Also, people with a history of alcoholism, angina, severe headaches, blood vessel disease, diabetes, kidney or liver disease, history of a recent heart attack or stroke, overactive thyroid, and pheochromocytoma should not receive MAOI therapy; since this may cause a hypertensive crisis.

Ads with other illnesses, depression, and other psychiatric treatment plans pose multiple dilemmas for physicians.
