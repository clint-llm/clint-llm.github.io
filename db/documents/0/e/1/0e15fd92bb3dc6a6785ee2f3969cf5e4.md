The interprofessional team caring for patients requiring suprapubic aspiration must have a basic knowledge of this procedure and how to handle the specimen collected. Once the urine sample has been obtained, it must be placed in a sterile collection container and remain sterile for laboratory analysis. Nurses, pharmacists, and clinicians should all be aware of the patient’s allergies as this procedure requires local anesthesia as well as possible pain control medications after the procedure. Nurses should be instructed to note and notify the clinician if they notice worsening abdominal pain or continued bleeding at the procedure site. Nurses should also perform abdominal exams as they evaluate the patient and alert the clinician if they note any severe abdominal tenderness or distention.
