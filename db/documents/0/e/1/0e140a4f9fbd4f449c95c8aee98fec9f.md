VATS has progressively replaced open thoracotomies in most thoracic surgery centers around the world because of its safety profile in elderly patients, better pain control, faster recovery times, and easier control of bleeding. It has been shown to decrease the length of hospital stay compared to open thoracotomy. Most of this could be attributed to the shorter chest tube duration as reported by some in studies with removal rates of 54% in the VATS group on day 1 as compared to 21% in open thoracotomies.

Authors have reported significantly lower rates of blood transfusions in the VATS groups when compared to the open thoracotomy groups. They also demonstrate lesser postoperative pain and a better quality of life when compared with traditional thoracotomies.

Long-term survival comparisons in studies have shown no statistical difference in overall 3-year survival in patients undergoing thoracoscopic lobectomy compared with patients undergoing open lobectomy.

The advantages offered by VATS over conventional thoracotomy are:

- Decreased surgery time

- Easier control of bleeding

- Decreased postoperative pain including opioid usage

- Decreased chest tube duration

- Decreased length of hospital stay

- Decreased inflammatory response

- Cosmesis
