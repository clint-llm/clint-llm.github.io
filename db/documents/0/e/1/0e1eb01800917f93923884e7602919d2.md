Throughout pregnancy, multiple physiologic changes contribute to fluctuating levels of thyroid hormones. Due to increased circulating estrogens, pregnancy brings a 50% increase in thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), which binds circulating T4, causing a decrease in free T4 levels. To compensate, the thyroid grows in size and increases the production of T4 and T3 by 50%.

Conversely, the developing placenta contains deiodinase type 3 (DIO3), which deactivates T4 and T3. Excessive function by this enzyme can lead to hypothyroidism. Typically, this effect is outweighed by increased hCG production in early pregnancy, leading to a net increase in free T4 with a decreased median TSH and reference range.

There is also an increased dietary iodine requirement, from 150 micrograms to 250 micrograms daily, due to increased thyroid hormone synthesis during pregnancy. There is also an appreciable loss of iodine in urine due to the increased glomerular filtration rate in pregnancy.

Grave disease involvesÂ TRAbs that bind the TSH receptor and impact the production of thyroid hormones. These antibodies can be stimulatory or inhibitory. In Grave disease, the net effect of TRAbs is stimulatory, causing a pathologic increase in free T4 that usually requires medical management.

Pregnancy results in a period of immunosuppression to avoid rejection of the developing fetus.
