The finding of xanthochromia on a spinal tap can be the only evidence to suggest the presence of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Traditionally, xanthochromia is detected by visualizing the supernatant CSF under incandescent light for the presence of a yellow color. Multiple studies have shown the superiority of using spectrophotometry instead of visualization. Spectrophotometry can detect the presence of xanthochromia at smaller concentrations than the naked eye and is more specific as it relies on the detection of a certain wavelength of emitted light that corresponds to xanthochromia itself.

Standard practice in the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage with a negative head CT still includes the use of lumbar puncture to detect the presence of xanthochromia. This test is more cost effective and may reduce the need for CT angiography with contrast in many patients.
