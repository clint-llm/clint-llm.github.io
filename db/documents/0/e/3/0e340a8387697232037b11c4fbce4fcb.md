The ED50 is the dose of a medication that produces a desired pharmacologic effect in 50% of the studied patient population that takes the medication. This metric is derived from clinical studies. This number helps clinicians decide the initial drug dose in patients. Clinicians may need to adjust the dose based on potential changing patient factors, e.g., renal function, hepatic function, disease state, drug interactions, etc. The healthcare team (e.g., physicians, pharmacists, nurses, etc.) need to work together and monitor drug efficacy and safety in order to improve patient outcomes.
