There are two major etiologies of thymic hyperplasia. It could be congenital or acquired. The congenital thymic hyperplasia can be hypo functioning or hyperfunctioning and is found to be the result of neuroendocrine disturbances, usually within the hypothalamic-hypophyseal system. Thymic hyperplasia with hypo functioning thymus would lead to immune deficiency. Hyperfunctioning thymic hyperplasia could lead to autoimmune diseases, most commonly myasthenia gravis, but the relationship has also been found with graves' disease and collagen vascular disorders. Acquired thymic hyperplasia can also result in hypo functioning or hyperfunctioning thymus.

Acquired thymic hyperplasia is usually a rebound phenomenon in patients who have undergone chemotherapy, have had thermal burns, cardiac surgery, or after discontinuation of oral steroids as the thymus is susceptible to fluctuations in corticosteroids.
