There are some prominent differences in EEG recording methods in the neonate as compared to adults. These differences are primarily because neonates have a smaller head size and there is a relative lack of EEG activity noted in the extreme frontopolar head regions. Because of these differences, the international 10-20 system of electrode placement has undergone modification for neonatal EEG recordings.

The standard neonatal montage includes eight scalp electrodes (FP2, C4, T4, O2, FP1, C3, T3, O1), EKG, and respiration. Additional three electrodes (Fz, Cz, Pz) may be added to improve coverage. Other additional electrodes to monitor eye movements and EMG.
