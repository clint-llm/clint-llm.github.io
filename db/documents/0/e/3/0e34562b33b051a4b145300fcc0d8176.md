- Substernal goiter can compromise trachea, venous vasculature, and other surrounding intrathoracic anatomical structures.

- Substernal goiter may cause life-threatening respiratory compromise if there is sudden enlargement. Hemorrhage into substernal goiter may cause acute enlargement of thyroid tissue and airway compression. An upper respiratory tract infection may increase the symptoms of upper airway obstruction.

- Thyroid cancer: A study reported that 72% of papillary thyroid cancer foci were intrathoracic, and 28% were cervical in patients operated for substernal goiter. When evaluated based on per nodule rather than per subject in statistical analysis, incidental foci of papillary carcinoma was significantly more common in substernal goiter than cervical goiter (31 versus 19%, p<0.01)
