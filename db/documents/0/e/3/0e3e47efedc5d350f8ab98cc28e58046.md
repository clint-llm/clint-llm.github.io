Wound irrigation is readily performable by a single person. For large or difficult to reach wounds, a second person may be necessary to help position the patient or manipulate the wound for better visualization. Medics, nurses, medical students, mid-level providers, and physicians can all successfully perform wound irrigation. Wounds with fistulas or wound tracts of unknown depth or course should be evaluated and irrigated by advanced providers.
