In discussing SVG, it is essential to distinguish the GSV from the short saphenous vein (SSV).Â In most saphenous vein grafts the GSV is utilized, however, in select circumstances, the SSV may also be a suitable option.

The GSV exists as the prominent superficial lower extremity vein emptying into the common femoral vein. Bounded between a layer of muscular fascia and dermis, the GSV begins its course anterior to the medial malleolus, crosses the tibia, and traverses medial to the knee and ascends in the medial-posterior aspect of the thigh as it passes into the groin. It receives tributaries from accessory saphenous veins and enters the fossa ovalis 4 cm inferolateral to the pubic tubercle, at which point it joins the superficial circumflex iliac, superficial epigastric and external pudendal veins to create the saphenofemoral junction along the anterior surface of the common femoral vein.

The SSV forms initially at the confluence of the lateral aspect of the dorsal venous network of the foot, passes behind the lateral malleolus of the foot and proceeds superiorly in the subcutaneous tissue of the calf. After passing through the calf, it perforates the fascia lata and drains into the popliteal vein at the popliteal fossa. During its course, it has small communicating branches with the GSV and the deep venous system via numerous perforating branches.
