1) Infants with certain single ventricle defects (i.e., double inlet left ventricle or tricuspid atresia with TGA where there exists a potential future risk of subaortic obstruction) or with aortic arch anomalies:

2) Patients with pressure gradient across the systemic outflow tract/subaortic region >15-20 mmHg: This may create a scenario of "double banding" where both the systemic and pulmonary outflow tracts have significant outflow gradients and therefore impose a pressure overload on both ventricles.

3) Severe AV valve regurgitation of the pulmonary ventricle (or of the systemic AV valve in single-ventricle patients): The increased afterload imposed by the band in this scenario may worsen the AV valve regurgitation and is generally considered a relative contraindication.

4) Truncus arteriosus: The short MPA in type 1 truncus arteriosus may be difficult to the band and may impinge onto the right PA. Furthermore, patients with Type 2 & 3 truncus arteriosus would require bilateral PAB, balancing blood flow to bilateral lungs remains extremely challenging. Finally, PAB placement in scenarios of both systolic and diastolic pulmonary flow, such as truncus arteriosus, may be less effective in limiting pulmonary flow due to the continuous nature of flow (as opposed to purely systolic flow in patients with a VSD). Thus, for several anatomic and physiology reasons, PAB is generally avoided in these patients.
