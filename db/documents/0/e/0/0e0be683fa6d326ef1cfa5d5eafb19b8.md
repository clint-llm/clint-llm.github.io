The blood flow in the cerebrum of humans is essential for survival. Regulation of cerebral blood flow is vital because it allows the brain to get its nutrients and oxygen even when the blood pressure in the body changes. To obtain a better understanding of the blood flow in the brain, we need a general comprehension of the blood supply and its branches as well as the physiological mechanism behind different flow rates. We will review the blood supply, some of the mechanisms of flow rate, and how they might change in the brain.
