**Macroscopic Appearance**

The inspection of the area around the minor papilla is essential for diagnosis.

There are two pathological subtypes of groove pancreatitis, cystic and solid type. The cystic type is characterized by multiple cysts emerging from the mucosa, ranging in size from 1 to 10 cm, leading to the formation of para-duodenal wall cysts that simulate intestinal duplication.

The solid type is identified by significant thickening of the duodenal wall and smaller cysts, less than 1 cm. Other macroscopic findings include thickened mucosal folds, ulceration, retraction of the duodenal mucosa, and lymph node enlargement in the pancreatic head.

**Microscopic Appearance**

The duodenal wall shows myeloid cell proliferation in the submucosal muscles of the minor papilla.

In addition, the extravasation of mucopurulent material from the ducts can present as giant cells infiltration along with eosinophils. Other common findings are Brunner's gland hyperplasia and neural inflammation into the proliferating islets causing pseudo infiltration.
