The prognosis of babesiosis depends on the type of symptoms. Most patients remain asymptomatic and have a good outcome. Others may have a flu-like infection, which is also associated with a good outcome. However, those with severe disease can have a long course complicated with multiorgan dysfunction and death. Fatalities are most common in patients without a spleen

The symptoms of babesiosis may last for 6-8 weeks and asymptomatic patients may remain silent for years. All patients with positive smears three months after the initial treatment must be re-treated, even in the absence of seizures.

About 1/5th of patients with babesiosis may be co-infected with Lyme disease. These patients tend to have a more prolonged course.
