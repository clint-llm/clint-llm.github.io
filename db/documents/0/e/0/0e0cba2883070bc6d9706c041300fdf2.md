The A-a gradient has clinical utility in patients with hypoxemia of undetermined etiology. The A-a gradient can be broken down categorically as either elevated or normal. Causes of hypoxemia will fall into either category. To better understand which etiologies of hypoxemia fall in either category, I will use a simple analogy. Think of the oxygen's journey through the body like a river. The respiratory system will serve as the first part of the river. Then imagine a waterfall from that point leading to the second part of the river. The waterfall represents the alveolar and capillary walls, and the second part of the river represents the arterial system. The river empties into a lake, which can represent end-organ perfusion.

When a patient is hypoxemic, there is a pathologically low partial pressure of oxygen in their body resulting in tissue hypoxia leading to cell injury and eventually cell death and necrosis. Using our analogy, decreasing the flow through the river will ultimately result in the lake drying out, this can represent the phenomenon of hypoxemia. The A-a gradient helps to determine where there is flow obstruction.

For example, consider hypoventilation. Patients can exhibit hypoventilation for various reasons; some include CNS depression, neuromuscular diseases such as myasthenia gravis, poor chest elasticity, as seen in kyphoscoliosis, or patients with vertebral fractures, and many others. Patients with poor ventilation lack oxygen tension throughout their arterial system in addition to the respiratory system. Thus, the river will have decreased flow throughout both parts. Since both the "A" and the "a" decrease in concert, the gradient between the two will remain within normal limits (even though both values will decrease). Thus patients with hypoxemia due to hypoventilation will have an A-a gradient within normal limits.

Now let us consider pneumonia. Patients with pneumonia have a physical barrier within the alveoli, limiting the diffusion of oxygen into the capillaries.

Applying this analogy to different causes of hypoxemia should help determine whether to expect an elevated or normal A-a gradient. As a general rule of thumb, any pathology of the alveolar-capillary unit will result in a high A-a gradient.
