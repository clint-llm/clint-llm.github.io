Special considerations must take place for the parturient with MG. These patients are prone to exacerbations and can show increased weakness in the last trimester to the early postpartum period. They are at increased risk of respiratory compromise, similar to other MG patients. Of the options available, epidural anesthesia is deemed relatively safe and may be preferred over spinal or general anesthesia. The maternal antibodies are passed through the placenta to the neonate. This causes neonatal MG and may present as feeding difficulties with respiratory dysfunction. The disease is transient in nature and usually lasts only a few weeks; however, it may necessitate intubation and mechanical ventilation to support the neonate early on.
