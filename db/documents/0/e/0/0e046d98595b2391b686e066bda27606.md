Uveitic macular edema is mostly seen with posterior uveitis, panuveitis, and intermediate uveitis and less frequently with anterior uveitis. The frequency of ME in patients with anterior uveitis is between 9% and 28%, most commonly associated with HLAB27 anterior uveitis. Intermediate uveitis is most commonly associated with UME found in 20 to 75% of cases. In cases with posterior uveitis, the reported incidence of UME ranges from 19 to 34%. Panuveitis cases have a reported incidence of 18 to 66%.

In non-infective cases, UME is the commonest sight-threatening complication, as noted in around one-tenth of the patients. This is followed by epiretinal membrane and glaucoma.
