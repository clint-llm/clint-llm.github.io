Like all limb muscles, the gluteus maximus develops from the somites; these are bilaterally paired blocks of the paraxial mesoderm. The myoblasts migrate into the limb buds during the fifth week of development. There, these cells condense into either the dorsal or ventral limb bud. The dorsal limb buds of the lower extremity compose the extensors and abductors, which include the gluteus maximus.
