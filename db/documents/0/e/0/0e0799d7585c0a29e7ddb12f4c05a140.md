The fascia has multiple important roles in the foot. These roles, in general, can be extrapolated from all other regions of the body

The fascial elements in the foot separate the various muscles into organized compartments that optimize static and dynamic function. The fascial compartments also influence the shape of the muscles, optimize movement, and function the regional nerves and blood vessels, ultimately influencing the overall physiologic function in the foot.  Mechanically, the fascia provides the ideal shock-absorbing characteristics to help provide a soft, yet supportive, balanced cushion of support to allow for pedal movement.

**Windlass mechanism**

The "windlass mechanism" is a well-known mechanical model described throughout the literature to depict the plantar fascia's critical role in providing dynamic support to the foot during weight-bearing activities. The term "windlass" refers to the tightening of a rope or cable

Originally described by Hicks in the 1950s
