Glenolabral articular disruption (GLAD) lesions are a form of traumatic combined glenoid cartilage and labral injury that may present with anterior or global shoulder discomfort. They occur relatively infrequently but are an important differential diagnosis in managing persistent non-specific shoulder pain following trauma. The extent and type of underlying damage to the glenoid cartilage vary; it can be anything from more minor fibrillation to complete cartilage loss. This activity covers the presentation, examination, diagnosis, and management of GLAD lesions of the shoulder.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical history and clinical exam findings of a GLAD lesion.
- Explain the recognized pathognomonic features of a GLAD lesion on MR Arthrography and at arthroscopy.
- Review the pathogenesis of the GLAD lesion following a typical mechanism of injury. 
- Summarize the typical treatment options for GLAD lesions.
