Cardiac computed tomography is the test of choice for quantifying size and morphology of sinus of Valsalva aneurysm. Echocardiography, usually transesophageal, will demonstrate flow and hemodynamic significance if rupture is suspected. Cardiac MRI will demonstrate anatomy as well as hemodynamic significance as well. Cine Cardiac MRI is considered the gold standard for diagnosis but is not required if other imaging modalities sufficiently give the diagnosis as well as pertinent anatomic and physiologic details. Patients will undergo coronary angiography before cardiac surgery to assess coronary anatomy. Patients with low risk of coronary disease may have an evaluation of coronary anatomy using cardiac computed tomography, and may not need to undergo cardiac catheterization. Patients with intermediate or high risk for coronary artery disease will usually undergo cardiac catheterization for assessment of possible bypass grafting at the time of cardiac surgery.
