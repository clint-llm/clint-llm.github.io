Professionals still do not understand the natural history of syringomyelia; it is unpredictable and highly variable which makes its prognostication very difficult. Although prognosis depends on the etiology, the degree of neurological deficit and the site and size of the syrinx cavity, syrinx diameter of more than 5 mm, and associated edema predict a rapid deterioration. The rarity of the condition, variable natural history, and short follow-up make treatment results assessment difficult.
