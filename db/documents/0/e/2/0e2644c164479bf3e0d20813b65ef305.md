Four major ligaments help to stabilize the knee joint. These include the anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate, medial collateral, and lateral collateral ligaments. A knee dislocation would be expected to disrupt several or all ofÂ these structures potentially. As far as vascular structures are concerned, the popliteal artery is at the highest risk of sustaining insult due to a tibiofemoral dislocation. The artery stretches across the popliteal space and gives off several branches in a collateral system around the knee. Given its position in the popliteal space and the mechanism of knee dislocation, up to 40% of patients with a tibiofemoral disruption will sustain an associated vascular injury. Peroneal nerve injuries can also occur in greater than 20% of knee dislocation patients, given the anatomic location of this nerve at the fibular neck.
