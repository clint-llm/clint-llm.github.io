The clinical significance of understanding the physiology of the biliary tract is seen in the numerous pathologies associated with bile and the biliary system. Biliary tract disorders can give rise to additional sequelae, including vitamin deficiencies, jaundice, liver cirrhosis, and more. For example, one of the most prevalent causes of vitamin K deficiency deals with the failure of the liver to release bile into the GI tract. This occurs as a result of obstruction of the bile ducts or due to liver disease. This lack of bile will prevent adequate fat digestion and absorption, thereby causing depressed vitamin K absorption.

In addition, a clinically important idea to understand in the physiology of the biliary tract is the four leading causes of gallstones which include (1) too much absorption of water from bile, (2) too much cholesterol in bile, (3) too much absorption of bile acids from bile, and (4) inflammation of the epithelium of the gallbladder.
