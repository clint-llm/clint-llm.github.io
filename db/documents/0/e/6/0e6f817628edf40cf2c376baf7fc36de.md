It is impossible to overstate the clinical significance of the middle cranial fossa due to its contents and the numerous pathologies associated with these structures. In this section, some of the most common pathologies will get brief coverage. Cavernous sinus syndrome is characterized by ophthalmoplegia and cranial sensory deficits due to the involvement of multiple cranial nerves in the cavernous sinus. The pathologies that can cause cavernous sinus syndrome vary widely, but can include malignancy, infectious, inflammatory, granulomatous, or vascular etiologies. Regarding malignancy, head and neck tumors are the most likely to metastasize to the cavernous sinus. However, breast, lung, and prostate cancers have also been reported to metastasize to this area.

Since the pituitary gland lies within the middle cranial fossa, many endocrine pathologies have associations with the middle cranial fossa. In the case of a pituitary microadenoma, excess hormone production is common, causing systemic symptoms associated with hormone hypersecretion. In the case of a pituitary macroadenoma, a majority of the symptoms have correlations with compression of nearby structures such as the optic chiasm, leading to bitemporal hemianopsia.
