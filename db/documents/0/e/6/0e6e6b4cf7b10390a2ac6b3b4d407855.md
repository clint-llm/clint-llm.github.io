In developed countries, it is seen sporadically. Currently, it is endemic in 69 countries including Asia, Africa, and the Americas with 1.3 billion people at risk, Sub-Sahara Africa being the worst.V. cholerae originated in the Indian subcontinent and caused six pandemics from 1827 through 1923. The seventh pandemic has been ongoing since 1961, reaching South America and most of the Western Hemisphere in 1991.V. cholerae strains, ease of travel and constant migration of possibly infected individuals have raised serious public health concerns.
