The gluteus medius and its supplying artery and nerve suffer damage due to hip fracture, hip dislocation, and hip arthroplasty. In a direct lateral approach during hip arthroplasty, the gluteus medius is surgically divided to gain access to the hip joint; therefore, this approach has the highest chance of nerve damage.

Gluteus medius tears can present as chronic trochanteric bursitis resistant to medical treatment, requiring surgical management. Identification of this pathology is in the first instance, typically following clinical examination, but MR imaging is also of value, demonstrating a high-intensity T2 signal secondary to the inflammation of the affected area.
