A multidisciplinary and interprofessional approach is essential in managing postoperative seroma to ensure positive patient outcomes and minimize risks of complications. Clinical nurse specialists (CNS) play a key role in postoperative follow-up and monitoring. In breast cancer surgery, on-demand nurse-led follow-up in suitable patients has shown to be safe and effective with high patient satisfaction. A CNS follow-up service provides a more accessible, consistent means for patients to be reviewed and educated in the postoperative period.

Protocols have been developed for trained CNS-led aspiration of seromas with appropriate escalation for medical input when required.

This allows for improved reallocation of time for the surgeon to focus on diagnosing and treating the underlying condition and reviewing complicated seromas. Symptomatic seromas refractory to aspiration or complicated by infection or wound dehiscence will be reviewed by the physician as different management strategies are likely to be required. This includes incision & drainage with antibiotics for abscess formation and surgical excision of pseudocysts.

The radiologist can aid the diagnostic process by interpreting ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) imaging. They can also offer ultrasound-guided aspiration for periprosthetic breast seromas.
