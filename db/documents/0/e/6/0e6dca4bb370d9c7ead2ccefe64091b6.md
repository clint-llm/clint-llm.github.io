**Neuroimaging**

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the main investigation performed for Chiari type I malformation, providing a depiction of craniocervical junction anatomy with identification of secondary complications such as hydrocephalus or syringomyelia.

When the patient is unable to undergo MRI scanning, other methods investigations to explore include CT myelography, non-contrast CT, and radiographs of the head and neck.

On MRI, as well as tonsillar descent, there may be an appearance of ‘peg-like’ or pointed tonsils, seen in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.

Patients who have incidental tonsillar ectopia without symptoms may benefit from MRI cine CSF flow studies. Positive findings on CSF flow include pulsatile systolic tonsillar descent and CSF flow obstruction at the level of the foramen magnum. These findings can provide further information to help assess whether the patient may benefit from surgery.

**Laboratory Studies**

Laboratory studies are not used for the diagnosis of Chiari I. However, any preoperative workup requires appropriate baseline investigations including full blood counts, electrolytes and metabolites; alongside a chest radiograph and electrocardiogram (ECG).

Other useful tests may include:

- **Sleep study:**Involves sleeping overnight in a room where they can monitor breathing, snoring, oxygenation, and seizure activity to determine if there is any evidence of sleep apnea.

- **Swallowing study:**Fluoroscopy used to watch the internal swallowing process to determine if there is an abnormality suggestive of lower brainstem dysfunction.

- **Brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAER):**It is an electrical test to examine the function of the hearing apparatus and brainstem connections. This is used to determine if the brainstem is working properly.

- **Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP):**An electrical test of the nerves involved in sensation, which gives some information about peripheral nerve, spinal cord, and brain function.

Prenatal diagnosis of Chiari type I malformation, and syringomyelia has also been described.
