Erythrasma is a common skin disorder caused by bacteria. It was first described in 1859 by Burchardt, who thought the etiology was fungal. In 1862, Burchardt's teacher, Von Barensprung coined the term erythrasma and named the bacteria Microsporum minutissimum. Today, erythrasma is known to be caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum, which is a gram-positive, catalase-positive, non-spore-forming organism.

Erythrasma usually causes infection of the intertriginous parts of the body and causes itching, scaling, and erythema. It is often asymptomatic.
