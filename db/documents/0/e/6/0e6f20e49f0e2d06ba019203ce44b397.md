Echinococcosis (Echinococcus granulosis) is a zoonotic larval infection that infects humans globally. Patients with this condition may be asymptomatic for years and only present symptoms when the liver cysts (hydatid cysts) rupture. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of echinococcosis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Echinococcus granulosus infection.
- Outline the ultrasound classification used in the evaluation of Echinococcus granulosus infection.
- Review the use of PAIR in the management of Echinococcus granulosus infection.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team in enhancing the delivery of care for patients affected by Echinococcus granulosus infections.
