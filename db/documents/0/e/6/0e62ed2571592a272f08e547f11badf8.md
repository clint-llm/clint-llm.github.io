The capillary anatomy described above can be better appreciated with the assistance of histological staining and microscopic analysis. In review, the basic structure of a capillary a single layer of simple squamous epithelium, a basement membrane, and few pericytes. One method used to appreciate the features is with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) tissue staining and a light microscope. The Hematoxylin component binds nucleic acids found in the cell nucleus and reflects a basophilic color. On the other hand, the eosin component binds to proteins primarily present in the cytoplasm and extracellular matrix and reflects an eosinophilic color.
