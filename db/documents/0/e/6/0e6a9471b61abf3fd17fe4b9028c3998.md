Suprapubic catheterization can be performed with local or general anesthetic depending on the situation. The lower abdomen is shaved and prepped with standard surgical prep. If the technique will involve entrance via the urethra, the genitals are prepped and draped accordingly. If rigid cystoscopy is required, the patient should be positioned in dorsal lithotomy. Flexible cystoscopy can easily be performed supine in most cases. The patient should always be placed in Trendelenburg position is help minimize the risk of bowel injury.Â  Having an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan is helpful, especially in patients with prior abdominal surgical procedures, to make certain there are no bowel loops between the distended bladder and the abdominal wall that could be inadvertently injured during suprapubic tube placement.
