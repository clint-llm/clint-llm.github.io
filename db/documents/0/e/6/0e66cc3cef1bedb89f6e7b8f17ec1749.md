The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends administering the DTaP five-dose vaccine series for children six weeks continuing through to six years of age.

- Two months: minimum age of six weeks

- Four months: the second dose should be given at least four weeks after the first

- Six months: the third dose should be given at least four weeks after the second

- Fifteen through eighteen months: the minimum age for the fourth dose is 12 months, and should be given at a minimum of six months after the third dose. It may be counted as valid if given at least four months after the third dose, and the child was at least 12 months old.

- Four through six years: the minimum age for the fifth dose is four years old. The dose should be given at least six months after the fourth dose.

The DTaP dose is 0.5 mL and given intramuscularly. The preferred intramuscular injection site for infants to two years of age is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. For children three years of age and older, the preferred site is the deltoid muscle.

Children unimmunized or incompletely immunized should receive catch-up immunizations. This process is possible with minimal intervals between doses.

- Dose 1 to dose 2 - four weeks

- Dose 2 to dose 3 - four weeks

- Dose 3 to dose 4 - six months; the minimum age for dose 4 is 12 months.

- Dose 4 to dose 5 - six months

DTaP is approved during the last 3 months of pregnancy to prevent pertussis in infants under 2 months old.
