The management of pediatric head trauma is performed by an interprofessional healthcare team that includes a combination of a pediatric neurosurgeon, emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, pediatrician, trauma physician, radiologist, and others. Most children with mild head trauma are discharged from the emergency department. However, patients discharged after a head injury, or concussion should be instructed to return to physical activities in a step-wise approach. The initial step is a period of physical and cognitive rest, followed by scheduled increases in activities with close monitoring for the recurrence of symptoms. Any recurrence of symptoms indicates the need for further limitation of activities. Recommendations for return-to-activities continue to change as new studies are published, and the center for disease control (CDC) website is a helpful source for up-to-date guidelines.
