Both the primary care provider and specialists often need to review previous records related to the patient's pain complaint in detail. Records usually include imaging, mental healthcare-related therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapies, past surgical history, and previous medications used. For example, if a patient with neuropathic pain secondary to diabetic peripheral neuropathy had failed gabapentin therapy, the reason for the medication failure must be noted. Inquire if it was due to the side effect profile. Ask if gabapentin had caused too much sedation or if the medication failed to provide the expected pain relief. If the drug did not work, determine the dose before stopping. If the patient with diabetic peripheral neuropathy was on 300 mg twice a day of gabapentin, then the patient was only on a fraction of the maximal dose before stopping. Gabapentin's failure in the treatment of neuropathic pain usually is concluded after 1800 mg daily, not 600 mg in tolerating patients.

Furthermore, nonpharmacological therapies such as virtual reality, acupuncture, physical therapy, and invasive treatment modalities such as neuromodulation can be utilized. The patient'sÂ records need to be obtained. Failures and success of these various treatment modalities must be defined.
