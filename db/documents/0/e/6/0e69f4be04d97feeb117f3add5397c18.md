The prognosis of oral lesions is reasonably good for patients who seek care immediately. Without the proper treatment, such oral lesions could become recurrent, take longer to heal, or even progress to precancerous or cancerous lesions. The discussed diseases can present with oral manifestations as either initial symptoms or in later stages of the disease. Dentists and other health care professionals must be capable of recognizing these lesions since early diagnosis and treatment can minimize the risks of transmission and further complications.
