Amniotic fluid is a transparent fluid with a light yellowish color. It is present in the amniotic sac. It creates a space for the fetus to grow and survive. It helps permit fetal movements, which are necessary for the effective musculoskeletal development of the fetus. It helps in fetal swallowing and fetal breathing.

**Development**

On the 8th day, the trophoblast changes. Bilaminar germ disc formation occurs after the differentiation of embryoblast. On the dorsal aspect of the bilaminar germ disc, there is the presence of tall columnar cells. They are ectodermal in origin.

On the ventral aspect of the bilaminar germ disc, flattened polyhedral endodermal cells are present. Connecting stalk forms the umbilical cord later; it connects the bilaminar germ disc with the trophoblast.

There is the appearance of 2 cavities on either side of the germ disc:

- Amniotic cavity

- Yolk sac

**Physiology of Amniotic Fluid**

Maternal and fetal compartments are essential in forming amniotic fluid in the first trimester of pregnancy. Fetal skin is non-keratinized in earlier weeks, allowing free transfer of water and other small molecules and solutes through the amnion and chorionic.

During the second trimester of pregnancy, the diffusion process ceases as keratinization of fetal skin occurs, making the fetal skin impervious to water and other solutes.

On transvaginal ultrasonography, urine is observed at nine weeks in the fetal bladder, and on transabdominal sonography, urine is seen at 11 weeks of gestation.

The average amniotic fluid volume at 12 weeks of gestation is 60 mo.
