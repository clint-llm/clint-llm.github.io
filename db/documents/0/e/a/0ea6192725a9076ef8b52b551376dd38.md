When one studies the cell, each one is surrounded by a fragile plasma membrane that separates the cell and its contents from the surrounding. Each cell has a protoplasm, which is a combination of cytoplasm and the nucleus. The cytoplasm consists of the cytosol (hyaloplasm) and the organelles. The cell membrane acts as a fencing material.

A cell is a combination of different structures:

**Cell Organelle:**

Just like our bodies need different specialized types of organs and tissues to function properly, the cells also have specialized parts called organelles. Each of these performs a different function.  Each organelle has a specific and unique job without which the cell will not be able to survive. A few examples of these being, Golgi bodies, mitochondria, ribosomes, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, etc.

**Cell inclusions****:**These are small non-living structures which are within the cell cytoplasm. A few examples being, melanin, glycogen, enzymes, etc.

The cytosol present in the cytoplasm is watery, but the cytoplasm is gel-like because of the presence of organelles. The cytoplasm consists of hundreds or even thousands of little organs or organelles. The cytosol also has within itself cytoskeleton entirely made up of microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments. This cytoskeleton gives a definite shape to the cell and also helps in maintaining the same.
