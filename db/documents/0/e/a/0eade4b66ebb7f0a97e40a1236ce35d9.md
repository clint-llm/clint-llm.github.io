The first line of treatment is the discontinuation of the offending drug to prevent any further damage until further investigations are completed to rule out other causes of nephropathy. Adequate hydration is essential in the early stages of the disease to achieve restoration of blood perfusion even in normotensive patients. Treatment of infections is necessary to prevent any further deterioration, especially pyelonephritis.

Urinary catheterization has been discouraged in such patients to decrease infection risk.

Overall, the clinical course of this is variable and depends mainly on the extent of renal damage, scarring, and fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, along with the reversibility of the parenchymal injury.

Unfortunately, even after stopping the offending drug, recovery may not occur, and sometimes the disease might progress further.
