Patients with SCI should be immediately referred to a bone metabolic center, clinic, or establish early and regular care with an experienced physician capable of treating osteoporosis. Historically, follow-up rates for osteoporosis patients are notoriously low given the lack of a standardized care pathway. Treating physicians can include but are not limited to general practitioners, internists, endocrinologists, and/or some orthopedic surgeons.
