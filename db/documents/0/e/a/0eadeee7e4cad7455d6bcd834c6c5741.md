For an ultrasound-guided radial nerve block, the practitioner will need the following:

- Ultrasound machine with a high-frequency linear array transducer (10 to 15 MHz).

- Ultrasound probe cover (sterile) or appropriate Tegaderm dressing.

- Ultrasound gel (sterile).

- Skin preparation (sterile) (2% chlorhexidine or appropriate disinfectant).

- A 22-G to 25-G, 38-mm to 50-mm, short-bevel block needle.

- Appropriate sterile gloves.

- Local anesthetic: A volume of 3 to 5 ml suffices for each nerve. The goal is a circumferential spread of anesthetic around the nerve sheath. The use of anesthetic concentration versus duration must be made before starting the procedure to choose the most suitable anesthetic for the block.

- Ergonomics: Recommendation is for the individual doing the anesthetic block to stand on the ipsilateral side as the block with the ultrasound on the contralateral side.
