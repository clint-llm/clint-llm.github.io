Epinastine is contraindicated in patients who have allergy/sensitivity to epinastine. Epinastine should be administered only after a test dose.

Use in specific cases:

- Pregnancy

Epinastine is a pregnancy category C drug. However, it should be used in pregnant patients judiciously.

- Breastfeeding Mothers

Studies have shown that epinastine gets transferred into breastmilk, but the resulting infant serum levels are minimal. Nonetheless, breastfeeding mothers must consult a physician before administering epinastine.

- Pediatric Population

The safety of the drug has not been established in patients below two years of age. The medication should have the dose adjusted according to the patient's body weight in the pediatric age group above two years.

- Geriatric Population

No such difference in the dose has been reported for geriatric patients. However, the clinician should obtain thorough liver function and kidney function tests before prescribing epinastine.
