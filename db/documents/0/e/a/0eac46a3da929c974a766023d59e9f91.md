Carcinoid tumor refers to a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (NET) that originates commonly in the gastrointestinal tract (about 55%) or in other locations such as the lung, kidneys, or ovaries. The exception to this includes pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors which are a separate entity called PNET. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and presentation of intestinal carcinoids and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of carcinoids.
- Review the presentation of an intestinal carcinoid.
- Summarize the treatment for intestinal carcinoid.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by intestinal carcinoid.
