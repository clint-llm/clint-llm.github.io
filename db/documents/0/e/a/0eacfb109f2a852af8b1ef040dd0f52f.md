The etiology of this disease has been studied as multifactorial with both intrinsic and extrinsic components. The literature review states the following main causative factors:

- Repetitive activity

- Mechanical overload

- Altered cellular response/failed healing

- Training errors: high-intensity training, high mileage

- Sedentary lifestyle

- Increased adiposity

- Scoliosis

- Leg length discrepancy

Cited in a Journal of Sports Medicine, it is believed that the evolution of tendinopathy is caused by repetitive microtrauma, especially when an abnormal pelvic width is present.
