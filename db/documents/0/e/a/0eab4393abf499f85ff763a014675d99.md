Patients should be monitored for anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions for 1 hour following the administration of a 25 mg (0.5 mL) test dose. Test doses should be administered over 1 to 2 minutes. Other adverse reactions must also require monitoring throughout dose administration. Patients who do not experience an anaphylactoid reaction during the test dose may still be at risk for developing adverse drug reactions during the administration of the remainder of the calculated required dose. Anemia-related parameters including hematocrit, reticulocyte count, serum ferritin, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and hemoglobin should be monitored following administration. TIBC, serum iron, transferrin saturation, and ferritin require monitoring for cancer or chemotherapy-related anemia.
