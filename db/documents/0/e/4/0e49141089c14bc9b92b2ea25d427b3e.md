Pulmonary hypoplasia is a rare disease that has varied presentations. Diagnosis and management begin prenatally and extend into the postnatal period. Prenatal counseling should effectively be conducted upon the initial diagnosis of the illness and repeated at every subsequent visit. The prenatal counseling would facilitate the caregivers to make ethically informed decisions and build an understanding of the family's needs.

While the neonatologist will be inherently involved in the care of patients with pulmonary hypoplasia, it is essential to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include obstetrician, cardiothoracic surgery, nephrology, and pulmonary care. The nurses and respiratory therapists are also vital members of the interprofessional group as they will monitor the patient's vitals and assist with the education of the patient and family.

Radiology will play an essential role in supporting the interpretation of imaging studies, while pathology will assist with tissue evaluation. The pharmacy will also play an interval role in determining the dosage and correct form of additional medications that may have assistance with management. The outcome depends on the cause of the hypoplastic lungs and associated fetal anomalies.
