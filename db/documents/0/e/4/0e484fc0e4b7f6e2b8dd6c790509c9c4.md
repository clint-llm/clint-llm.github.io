Hyperlipidemia is often a life-long disease process, but one that is typically quite manageable. However, if hyperlipidemia is left untreated, the disease is progressive and will often lead to severe underlying vascular disease processes, which can prove fatal. Ongoing persistent exposure to high serum lipid levels throughout early adulthood increases the person's subsequent risk of coronary heart disease in a dose-dependent fashion.

Adults with ongoing exposure to moderate or severe elevations in non-HDL cholesterol levels have concurrent elevated risks for developing coronary heart disease and would likely benefit from aggressive medical treatment modalities, including, which includes high-intensity statin therapy in addition to diet and lifestyle modifications. Based on a 20 year follow up of the "West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study," the researchers noted that patients who received statin therapy for five years had improved survival rates and a clinically significant reduction in cardiovascular disease over the 20 years. This data supports the numerous other studies and trials that also reveal a significant cardiovascular risk reduction when using statin therapy appropriately, and there was the implementation of a proactive treatment approach.
