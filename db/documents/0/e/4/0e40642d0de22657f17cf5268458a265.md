The etiology and pathogenesis of this disease are unknown.Â Some believe that granuloma annulare is caused by a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, more specifically a Th1 reaction involving IFN-gamma stimulating macrophages to release matrix metalloproteinases. This ultimately results in connective tissue degradation. Some studies provide support for this theory. For example, helper T cells have been found in samples of granuloma annulare lesions. Another study showed that a significant number of T cells in these lesions were CD3+ and had interferon-gamma receptors. It was also found that macrophages found in the lesions were differentiated to effector cells that expressed matrix metalloproteinases and tumor necrosis factor-alfa.

Impaired neutrophil chemotaxis has been found in patients with granuloma annulare. The authors of this study postulated that macrophages take over an inflammatory site because of the impaired neutrophil response, which leads to the granulomatous inflammation seen in granuloma annulare as opposed to a suppurative neutrophil type inflammation.
