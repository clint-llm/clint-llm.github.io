Diaper dermatitis is an inflammatory reaction of the skin around the diaper area. It results due to a combination of multiple factors such as increased moisture, prolonged contact with urine or feces, and other irritants like detergents.

The second most common cause of diaper dermatitis is infection. Fungal infection, especially by Candida albicans,Â is the most common infectious cause. Candida infection can be a primary cause of diaper dermatitis and can also result as a superimposed infection to chronic irritation. Other mycoses that can be associated with diaper dermatitis include dermatophytosis, exacerbation of seborrheic dermatitis by Malassezia, and other pseudomycotic conditions like erythrasma.

Bacterial infections follow fungal as the second most common cause of infectious diaper dermatitis. Staphylococcus aureus infection can occur in newborns, secondary to colonization from the umbilical cord. Streptococcus pyogenes is also seen as an etiologic agent causing the condition.
