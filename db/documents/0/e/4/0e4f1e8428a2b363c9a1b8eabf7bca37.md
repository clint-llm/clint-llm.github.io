The management of congenital HSV is by an interprofessional team because of multi-system involvement. The best outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality are observed among infants with SEM disease. Approximately 50% of infants surviving neonatal HSV experience cutaneous recurrences, with the first skin recurrence often occurring within 1 to 2 weeks of stopping parenteral acyclovir treatment.

All infants with neonatal HSV disease regardless of disease classification should have an ophthalmologic examination and neuroimaging to establish baseline brain anatomy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive neuroradiologic imaging modality but also may require sedation, so computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography of the head are acceptable alternatives. Presentation with seizures should be evalauted with an electroencephalogram (EEG) which may show periodic epileptiform discahrges (PEDs).

Routine audiology screening should occur for all infants infected with HSV.

In addition, infants with CNS involvement should have a repeat lumbar puncture performed near the end of therapy to document that the CSF is negative for HSV DNA on PCR assay. Consultation with an infectious diseases specialist is warranted in these cases.
