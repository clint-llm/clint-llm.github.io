The histologic findings are disease specific. However, in general, in hepatocellular causes of cholestasis, histology shows the presence of bile within hepatocytes and canaliculi spaces along with diffuse cholestatic injury pattern. While in the obstructive cholestatic pattern, histology shows bile plugging of interlobular bile ducts, portal expansion, and bile duct proliferation with mainly a centrilobular pattern of cholestatic injury. Retention of bilirubin (bilirubinostasis) can lead to stagnation of bile and bilirubin along cytoplasmic, canalicular, ductular or ductal regions, depending on the severity and duration of biliary obstruction. Cholate stasis corresponds to the peculiar changes in the periportal hepatocytes due to stagnation of bile acids and their detergent effects. There is hydropic swelling of hepatocytes with a clearing of their cytoplasm, and the concentration of the remaining cytoplasm in the perinuclear region with the formation of Mallory bodies and accumulation of copper-binding proteins (stained by orcein) in autophagic vacuoles
