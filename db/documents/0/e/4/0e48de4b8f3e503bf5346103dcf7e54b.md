Aphthous stomatitis affects approximately 20% of the general population. ItÂ is slightly more common in girls and women as well as among affluent socioeconomic classes and countries. Race does not appear to be a factor in the disease. Age of onset may be during childhood, but more commonly in the second and third decade of life, becoming less common with advancing age. Aphthous stomatitis can be a manifestation of Behcet syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, reactive arthritis, or inflammatory bowel disease (especially Crohn disease). These disorders may be excluded based on systemic signs and symptoms.
