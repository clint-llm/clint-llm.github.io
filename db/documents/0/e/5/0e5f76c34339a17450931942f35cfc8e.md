Exertional dyspnea is the most common symptom. Nonspecific presentation leads to a delay in diagnosis. As the disease advances, other symptoms such as fatigue, near syncope, syncope, palpitations, chest pain or angina (due to right ventricle ischemia), and peripheral edema occur. More severe symptoms are due to a failing right heart.

The physical exam includes findings related to back pressure due to pulmonary vasculature resistance. There is jugular venous distention, increased second heart sound due to theÂ pulmonic component. There may be a right-sided fourth heart sound and tricuspid regurgitation murmur.
