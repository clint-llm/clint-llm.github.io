On histopathology, spiradenomas show one or more large, sharply demarcated basophilic nodules of the dermis. Two types of cells are seen in the nodules. These cells are eitherÂ small, dark, basaloid cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, or larger, pale, and with ovoid nuclei. These lighter cells tend to be toward the center of the lesion. Duct-like structures of uninterpretable differentiation and cystic cavities filled with finely granular eosinophilic material may be seen.

Malignant spiradenomas demonstrate increased mitotic rates, necrosis, nuclear atypia, pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, loss of nested growth patterns, and loss of the dual cell population. In histologic studies, two patterns of malignant spiradenomas were observed. One was an abrupt transition between a benign spiradenoma and high-grade carcinoma, while the second showed contiguity between the benign and malignant areas.
