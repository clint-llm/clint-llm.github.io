In patients who have had a pneumonectomy, acute findings of tension pneumothorax are essentially pathognomonic for bronchopleural fistula (BPF). Although other conditions such as postoperative tension chylothorax or hemorrhage into the pleural space may also cause the findings of tension pneumothorax, the affected hemithorax should fill with fluid rather than air. Tension pneumothorax may also be due to a displaced or obstructed chest tube; ensuring a patent chest tube while imaging is being obtained may distinguish this phenomenon from true BPF. In patients who present with empyema, BPF is likely if the effusion contains air, and there is an air leak after chest tube placement. The culture of the effusion may help distinguish anaerobic infection from BPF. Bronchoscopic findings of a bronchial defect will distinguish BPF from other etiologies.
