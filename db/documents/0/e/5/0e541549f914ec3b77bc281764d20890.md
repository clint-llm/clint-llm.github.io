Insufficient sleep is defined as a shorter duration of sleep than required to maintain daytime wakefulness. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) and the Sleep Research Society consensus recommends a minimum of 9 hours for children 6 to 12 years of age, 8 hours for adolescents, and at least 7 hours for adults.

A sleep duration shorter than recommended for age is classified as insufficient sleep duration.
