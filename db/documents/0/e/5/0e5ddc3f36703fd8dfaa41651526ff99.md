Patients should be educated on the risk factors for the development of salivary gland tumors and counseled to avoid exposure to these risks as much as possible. Patients and their families should be educated on the different treatment options and timeline, including surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Patients and parents should be counseled on the possible risks and complications of all treatment modalities and their comorbidities fully assessed by their primary care physicians to determine if they will be candidates for surgical resection. The importance of long-term follow up is crucial for salivary malignancies and must be emphasized to patients, given the indolent growth pattern of certain pathologies such as adenoid cystic carcinoma.
