The key to proper recovery from obstetrical foot drop involves obtaining an accurate neurological diagnosis supplemented as necessary by an MRI and accurate documentation of the injury by electrophysiological analysis. MR neurography can be helpful in cases in which the diagnosis is in doubt.

The role of the L5 nerve root and its dermatome/myotome is a key to understanding foot drop. This can be injured by a herniated L4/L5 lumbar disc, a lesion of the lumbosacral plexus, the lumbosacral trunk, the common fibular nerve, and the deep fibular nerve, all of which carry the L5 nerve root.

Learning to walk with an obstetrical foot drop is a skill not easily mastered. Falling while trying to walk with a foot drop is an important concern in the recovery process. Physical therapy teaching the patient how to walk with her condition is essential. Orthotics and possibly the use of a walker can be helpful.

Physical therapy should be directed towards lengthening the plantar flexor muscles, so they do not worsen the foot drop because they are now much stronger relative to the dorsiflexors.

Make sure that the patient never again sits with her legs crossed. Sitting with the legs crossed for a number of years can cause a foot drop.

Reassure the patient that if she follows the treatment protocol and avoids falling, she should recover within a year or so.

Patients with a foot drop will have difficulty walking on their heels.
