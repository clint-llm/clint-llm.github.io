The main etiology of PBK is due to endothelial loss post-surgical trauma, especially in older patients. The other main causes are endothelial burns secondary high energy use during phacoemulsification. High irrigation and aspiration can also result in endothelial damage during cataract surgery and manifest as striate keratopathy post-cataract surgery. The other etiologies linked with PBK are all diseases affecting corneal endothelium like:

- Fuchs endothelial dystrophy

- Posterior polymorphous endothelial dystrophy

- Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy

- Iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome-Chandler syndrome

- Essential/progressive iris atrophy

- Iris nevus / Cogan-Reese syndrome

- Herpetic disciform keratitis

- Diabetes mellitus

- Pseudoexfoliation syndrome

- Narrow-angle glaucoma

- Blunt trauma

- Endothelitis, uveitis, keratitis

- Surgical trauma during any intraocular surgery

- Toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS)

- Silicon oil in the anterior chamber

- Implantable collamer lens

- Vitreous touch syndrome

- Vitreous wick syndrome

The intraoperative etiology is linked to closed-loop anterior chamber intraocular lens (ACIOL) > open-loop ACIOL> iris fixated IOL> posterior chamber IOL.
