There are several main mechanisms of manganese toxicity.  Manganism was first described in the 19th and 20th centuries in several studies of miners by Couper and Rodier, respectively.

The physiology of absorption of metals via inhalation has been postulated to occur via three routes:

- Retrograde axonal transport of Mn particles via olfactory and trigeminal nerve endings

- Direct transport across the pulmonary epithelium for absorption into the circulatory or lymphatic system

- Ingestion via mucociliary clearance and swallowing of respiratory secretions

The size of the particulate matter inhaled also appears to play a role, with medium-size molecules depositing in the lower airways contributing the most to respiratory absorption.

Ingested Mn from plant sources is normally filtered through the liver, and the excess is removed to avoid toxicity. In individuals with hepatic dysfunction, patients are at higher risk of Mn toxic accumulation in the bloodstream.

Another common source of concern for manganism is drinking water. Well-water specifically can accrue excessive amounts of the metal via breakdown from adjacent rock beds. Postulated means of Mn excess include the presence of anoxic water tables, carbon-rich soil, agricultural fertilizers, and run-off from sites of human deposition of materials rich in Mn (incorrectly disposed batteries, waste from mining facilities, sewer water).

Infants who are breastfed obtain their necessary nutritional requirements of Mn without risk for toxicity. Those who obtain their main dietary intake from infant formulas may receive higher concentrations of the metal beyond that of typically accepted values. This is based on variability in formula ingredients and the reconstitution of formula with potentially Mn-toxic water sources.

Although not much has been published with regards to chronic TPN use, case reports in children and data with respect to safe intravenous dosages of daily Mn suggest intravenous TPN as a potential etiology for manganism.
