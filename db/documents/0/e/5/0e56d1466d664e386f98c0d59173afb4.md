The lumbosacral plexus, and consequently the tibial and posterior tibial nerves, are of ectodermal origin while the muscles, blood vessels, and bones of the limbs they supply are of mesodermal derivation. The sacral plexus consists of the sacral spinal nerves S1 through S4 and their respective anterior rami along with branches from spinal roots L4 and L5. The anterior rami of L1 through L4 nerve roots along with contributions from T12 collect to form the lumbar plexus. The and femoral nerves arise from the lumbar plexus while the sciatic nerve arises from the sacral plexus and carries fibers from L4 to S3.
