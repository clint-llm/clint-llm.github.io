an interprofessional approach to black widow spider envenomation

Envenomation by a black widow spider is rare in the US and it has a varied presentation. Because of the morbidity of the bite, healthcare workers including the triage nurses must be aware of the signs and symptoms of this particular spider bite. The vast majority of patients present to the emergency department and the quicker the care provided, the better the outcome. Most patients have an eventful outcome. After discharge, the patient should be encouraged to keep pesticides in the home and/or have the home inspected for any more spiders.
