The Koebner phenomenon is something that dermatologists will often test for as part of a complete physical exam. However, by the time a patient reaches a dermatologist, it is almost certain that they received a referral from other providers because they have an underlying cutaneous disease. As a result, awareness of the Koebner phenomenon by other health professionals is likely to help patients in faster time to diagnosis and referral.

Primary care providers and emergency medicine physicians may often be the first group of health care professionals to encounter a patient with cutaneous disease. It may be helpful for these specialties to incorporate testing for Koebnerization (with a scratch test) into their physical exam to aid in building their differential diagnosis. Additionally, nurses may be the first to notice when minimal trauma induces a cutaneous response in a patient (i.e., a patient develops psoriasiform plaques along venipuncture sites or tape lines). Nurses may thus help the interprofessional team by reporting such findings. [Level 5]
