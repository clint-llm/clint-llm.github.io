Grief, when permitted, helps process the pain of loss and allows for the pain to heal.

Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross first identified the five stages of grief in her 1969 book Death and Dying. Later, she co-authored On Grief and Grieving: Finding the Meaning of Grief through the Five Stages of Loss with David Kressler, an expert on death and grieving. Their explanations of the stages of grief are widely accepted and taught throughout the world. Initially, they explained five stages of grief, but more recently, David Kressler has discussed an additional two stages (* denotes the additional two stages). They are as follows:

- **Shock***– A person may react to the learning of a loss with numbed disbelief. Shock may provide an emotional buffer and can protect an individual from being overwhelmed all at once.

- **Denial**– This stage continues to help survive the loss. An individual may feel like the world around them is meaningless or overwhelming, and their life may make no sense. They may have a feeling or sense that everything feels numb. Shock and denial help a person cope with loss and make their own survival possible. Denial allows an individual to pace their feelings of grief. This is the beauty of denial; it is nature’s way of dealing with only what can be handled. Denial does not just mean denying that a loss has happened; although this may occur, denial often is in regards to denying the experience of all the feelings. As an individual is able to accept that this loss is their reality, they will be able to move into the healing process and denial will begin to diminish.

- **Anger**– Anger is a necessary stage of the healing process. Before the anger stage, an individual who is experiencing grief may feel like they have been abandoned or may feel no connection to anything. Experiencing anger allows for a connection; it allows for something to hold on to. Anger may be directed at the thing or person that was lost, the doctors, friends, family, God, etc. Under the anger is the individual’s pain. Anger provides structure, and that is better than the preceding numbness. It can be a challenge for some to feel the anger; sometimes it is easier to try and suppress the anger. Feeling the anger and addressing the anger is part of the grieving process. Being aware that this is a step in the process is important, not only for the person experiencing grief but also for any caretaker involved. Do not take any outbursts personally as they are most likely a sign of a person in grief.

- **Bargaining**– This is the step in the grieving process where one may think “If this __, then this__.” For example: “I will do anything if you take the hurt away” or “I will never sin again if my loved one will be spared.” Bargaining may come in the form of “what if” statements. For example, “What if we found the cancer sooner?” or “What if this accident never happened?” These “what ifs” are a way to negotiate the fact that an individual wants life to go back to how it once was. Guilt will often accompany this frame of thinking. This stage may be experienced at any point in the grieving process and really exhibits the point that an individual can move through the different stages throughout their own healing process in a number of ways. There is no set linear path in grief. As a healthcare worker, it is important to be able to assess this stage of grief and listen. Provide empathy and compassion and educate them that this is a normal thought process if they question it. Provide resources if appropriate.

- **Depression**– After the thoughts of the past in bargaining, thoughts of the present flood in. They realize that the situation is real. Empty feelings come forward, and one’s grief moves in on a deeper level than before. This type of depression is not a sign of mental illness; although, reaching out for help may be the right step. It is an appropriate response to a great loss. An individual may withdraw from their daily life activities, and they may feel a fog of intense sadness. To not experience any depression after the loss of a loved one would be unusual. The stage of depression is a necessary step in the healing process that is grieving. As a healthcare worker, it is imperative to be able to discern normal signs of depression due to grief and someone who is struggling with complicated grief and depression. Be able to assess for signs of suicidal ideations and when in doubt, ask. Provide appropriate resources as needed.

- **Testing***– An individual may try to find realistic solutions for dealing with and living with this loss. This is the process of rebuilding their life in their new reality. The individual may require further resources during this stage as they are trying out what works for their new way of life. It is possible to flow in and out of other stages during the testing phase as well. Providing resources that may be appropriate during this phase can be very helpful for the individual to try out as they may feel ready for that experience.

- **Acceptance**– Acceptance does not have to mean one is “alright with what has happened.” An individual may never be the same as before after a loss. They may never feel “OK” about the loss. Acceptance, as a stage, is about accepting that this is their new reality, and it is permanent. Life cannot go on as it once did, but through acceptance, life can and will go on. Roles will reorganize. New connections and relationships will be made. Individuals experiencing acceptance understand that they must listen to their needs and evolve. There may be days that are harder than others but an individual who has given their grief the time it has needed to heal will begin to live again.
