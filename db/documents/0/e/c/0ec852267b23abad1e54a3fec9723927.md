When thiamine stores are depleted (which takes about 4 weeks after stopping intake), symptoms start to appear.

Dry beriberi occurs when the CNS is involved. This condition is usually due to poor intake. The neurological features include impaired reflexes and symmetrical motor and sensory deficits in the extremities. Loss of myelin is seen without any acute inflammation.

Another variation of dry beriberi is Wernicke encephalopathy. This condition presents in well-defined steps starting with nausea and vomiting, followed by horizontal nystagmus, ocular nerve palsy, fever, ataxia, and progressive mental impairment, eventually leading to the Korsakoff syndrome. Improvement is only possible if the patient has not developed the Korsakoff syndrome. Less than 50% of patients show significant recovery after treatment.

Wet beriberi is present when the cardiovascular system is involved. The heart fails to function, leading to edema and fluid retention. The key reason for heart dysfunction is an overuse injury. Wet beriberi is a medical emergency and, without treatment, can lead to death within days. Thiamine can slowly help with recovery, but most patients require intense supportive measures in an ICU setting.
