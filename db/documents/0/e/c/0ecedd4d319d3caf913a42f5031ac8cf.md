It is essential to inform the patient that while apocrine chromhidrosis is benign, it is considered chronic and may be present for many years, if not forever.  The treatment options are symptomatic, and when discontinued, the disease will likely recur.  Educating the patient regarding stressors and physical activity, which can increase the appearance of chromhidrosis, can be beneficial.

Patients with eccrine chromhidrosis and pseudochromhidrosis need to be informed of the responsible cause and recommend avoidance.  If the cause remains undetermined, a diary of ingested substances and a list of chemical contacts can be helpful.
