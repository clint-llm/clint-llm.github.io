ELP cannot be measured, but it can be predicted. The IOL manufacturer predicts the form of the A-constant.

All these factors, when taken into account, can predict the accurate IOL power for the desired refraction for a specific eye. As these various vergence formulae use up to 6 biometry parameters, the accuracy of these formulae depends on accurate biometry. All the biometry measurements can now be obtained in a single biometry machine which simplifies the IOL calculation and selection. Furthermore, newer imaging modalities, such as swept-source optical coherence tomography, have improved the repeatability of biometry measurements.

Over time, regression-based derivations have been incorporated into each new generation of formulae to predict the refractive behavior and outcomes of IOLs in eyes with different anatomical dimensions.

Based on these variables, the IOL formulae can also be categorized as the following:

1) First-generation formula. 2) Second generation formula 3) Third generation formula 4) Fourth generation formula

**First-generation**

In 1967, Fyodorov developed his theoretical formula based on keratometry and axial length. Soon many authors devised their theoretical formula. In 1980 multiple papers were published on large IOL series. All authors found that axial length and keratometry were the most important parameters. Thus the SRK formula was devised, which was P= A - 2.5L - 0.9K.

**Second-generation**The first-generation formulae were quite accurate in regular eyes. But it did not work in extremely long or short eyes. Thus there was a need to adjust the formula for the axial length to be accurately factored. The second generation regression formula, the SRK II, was developed by adding a C-value to the original SRK formula: P= A - 2.5L - 0.9K + C.

If the axial length is 10 to 20 mm, the C value is 3. If the axial length is 20 to 21 mm, the C value is 2.0. IF 21 to 22 mm, the C value is 1. For 22 to 24.5 mm, it is 0. If the axial length is more than 24.5, the C value is -0.5. Other formulae, such as Hoffer's adjustment of ACD and the modified Binkhorst Formula, used the measured axial length.

**Third-generation**

The first generation of IOL formulae had a fixed constant for all axial lengths, such as the A constant in the SRK formula.

Holladay 1 formula divided the ACD into corneal thickness, the distance between the endothelium and iris, plus the distance between the iris and the lens. The last measurement was known as the surgeon factor, which varied according to the lens type. This factor required optimization.

Hoffer Q formula recommended a personalized ACD.

**Fourth-generation**

The third-generation formulae were fair in the IOL power calculations. But still, they needed refinement. More studies were going on that incorporated more patient parameters to further decrease postoperative refractive errors. The Haigis formula introduced three A constants such as a0, a1, and a2. All three constants can be personalized to refine the IOL power.

The Barrett formula was introduced, which was based on a model eye. It incorporated the final plane of the position of the IOL, which increased its accuracy.

Newer technologies are evolving to refine these formulae further. It is difficult to calculate the exact IOL power in high myopes. A Wang-Koch (WK) adjustment has been suggested to some third- and fourth-generation formulae to optimize the calculation for AL >25 mm.

Apart from the vergence and regression-based formulae, newer techniques have evolved in the last few years for IOL power calculation with increased accuracy.

**Ray tracing method**: The Olsen formula is based on studying axial and paraxial light through the eye with a particular IOL.

**Artificial intelligence**: The Hill-radial basis function (RBF) calculator combines artificial intelligence with regression analysis of a large postsurgical patient to calculate the IOL power.

Then there is Ladas formula, also known as the super formula.

**Optimization**

In the SRK formula, P=A-(2.5xAL)-(0.9xK). A is the lens constant. Its value depends upon the lens design, its make, haptic angulation, surgeon, and surgery method. The A constant can vary between individual surgeons for a particular cataract surgery technique. The A constant can vary for different IOL and surgical methods for a particular surgeon. The manufacturer provides the value of A constant, but every surgeon should optimize this value according to his surgical technique and IOL used. This is known as the optimization of the lens constant. Optimization is the process of finding the specific value of a lens constant, which, when used for that particular IOL type, will result in exact IOL power calculations.

The SRK formula can also be expressed as A= P+(2.5xAL)+(0.9xK). To know the A constant, one must know the ideal IOL power of that patient. That will depend upon the stable postoperative refractive error. This value will tell us how much deviation there is from the actual IOL power. Suppose a patient has a postoperative refractive error of +2.0D, and the IOL power implanted was 20.0D. It would be incorrect to assume that the ideal IOL power would be 22.0D because the refractive error at the spectacle plane is not the same as that at the IOL plane. To calculate the ideal IOL power using spectacle plane refraction, a Refractive Factor (RF) is needed. The RF is a value that needs to be multiplied by the refractive error to give us an estimate of the error at the IOL plane. Modern estimates of this RF value are in the range of 1.3 to 1.8.

If one takes RF as 1.5, in this example, the ideal power, Power (ideal)= Power (implanted)+ Refractive error X RF. Power (ideal)= 20.0+ (2x1.5)=23.0D. For myopic errors, the minus sign of the error would result in a lower actual IOL power. This process of back-calculation of the A-constant has to be repeated for several cases involving the same IOL model and surgery type. In each case, the A-constant is likely to be different, all these values are then averaged, and the resultant value is the optimized A-constant. This can be used for prospective calculations in place of the A-constant provided by the manufacturer.

There are two components to accurate IOL power calculation – precise biometry and accurate IOL power calculation formulae.

**Biometry**

Biometry is the process of determining the ideal intraocular lens power by measuring the corneal power and the axial length of the eye. Earlier ultrasound was used to measure the axial length. It required contact with the ocular surface. This applanation A-scan caused variable corneal compression and was prone to error.

In 1998 optical biometry was introduced, which used infrared light. It was a non-contact instrument, and the measurement did not alter the axial length; thus, it was quite accurate.

**PCI**: This technology was developed in 1986 by Fercher and Roth. It utilizes infrared light, which is directed inside the eye. The different tissue planes reflect this light. Interferometric techniques are then applied to measure the axial length.**OLCR**:  It uses the principle of a Michealson interferometer. A superluminescent diode produces a low-coherence infrared light which is then split into double beams by a coupler. One beam is directed into the eye, and the other is projected to a scanning reference mirror. The various tissue planes then reflect this light. The emitted and reflected lights form an interference pattern detected by a detector and analyzed.

**SSOCT**: This technology uses a swift, sweeping laser as the light source. The interference pattern captured undergoes Fourier transformation.

**Optical Biometers**

**IOL Master 500**: This machine from Carl Zeiss uses an infrared laser of 780nm wavelength and is based on PCI technology. It is highly accurate, up to 0.02 mm.**Nidek's AL-Scan**: It uses PCI technology to measure axial length, ACD, WTW, pupil size, central corneal thickness (CCT), keratometry, and corneal topography. It also comes with an ultrasound pachymeter and A-scan.

**Lenstar LS-900:**This machine uses OLCR technology. A superluminescent diode produces an 820 nm low-coherent beam of light. It can measure lens thickness, axial length, ACD, keratometry, anterior corneal topography, WTW, and pupil diameter. The corneal topography is useful in planning toric IOL cases. All IOL calculation formulae are incorporated, including Barrett Suite, Hill-radial basis function (RBF), Masket, Modified Masket, and Shammas. It was one of the first devices to measure lens thickness (LT).

**IOL Master 700:**This device is based on SS-OCT technology. It has a scan speed of 2000 scans per second. The inbuilt OCT scans the different ocular structures. The OCT image of the fovea allows the clinician to determine whether the fixation is central or not. It can measure both the anterior and posterior corneal curvature. It can take measurements in dense cataracts and opaque media. All the modern IOL power calculation formulae, including the Barret suite consisting of the Barret Universal 2, the Barrett True K, and the Barrett Toric, are available. It can also link with the Callisto eye system for toric IOL implantation.

**Tomey's OA 2000**: This instrument uses a Placido disc-based topographer with an SS-OCT-based biometer. It measures keratometry, CCT, ACD, AL, LT, WTW, pupillometry, and corneal topography. All modern IOL power calculation formulae, including ones based on ray tracing, are available on board.

**Eyestar 900**(Haag-Streit): It is an SS-OCT-based device. It can do elevation-based corneal topography, intraoperative aberrometry, and wavefront aberrometry during cataract surgery. This can make aphakic and pseudophakic refractive measurements. Real-time information on the toric IOL axis placement and position of limbal relaxing incisions can be taken by attaching it to the surgical microscope. Intraoperative aberrometry is useful in toric IOL, multifocal IOL, accommodative IOL, and post-refractive surgery cataract patients.

**Pentacam-AXL:**The Oculus Pentacam-AXL combines an elevation-based tomographer and a PCI-based optical biometer. A rotating Scheimpflug camera maps the corneal tomography, and PCI technology is used to determine the axial length. It also measures CCT and WTW. The advantage of Pentacam AXL is the ability to measure posterior corneal astigmatism, which is useful in toric IOL planning. It is also helpful in calculating IOL power in eyes with post-refractive surgery. This device can also perform wavefront analysis. It has all the popular IOL power calculation formulae in it.
