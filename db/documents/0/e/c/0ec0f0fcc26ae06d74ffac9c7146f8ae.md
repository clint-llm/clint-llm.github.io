Vertebrobasilar strokes can be mistaken for another disease, given its nonspecific initial symptoms. Depending on the affected vessel, different brainstem stroke syndromes may be produced, which can cause new neurological deficits causing weakness, diminished vision, vertigo, confusion, or cranial nerve palsy. These red flag symptoms should raise the suspicion of an acute intracranial process, and these patients should be evaluated by a team that specializes in treating strokes as soon as the diagnosis is considered. Stroke evaluation includes a standardized screening method such as the NIH Stroke Scale, head imaging to evaluate for hemorrhage, and stenosed or occluded intracranial arteries, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Secondary stroke workup includes evaluating for diabetes, hyperlipidemia, screening for a thrombus in the heart, and arrhythmia. Treatment with TPA should be offered as soon as possible after completing a contraindication standardized checklist discussed above.
