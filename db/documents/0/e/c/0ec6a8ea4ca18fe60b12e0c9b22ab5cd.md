2-octyl cyanoacrylate comes in gel form, and more recent iterations of the product include a high viscosity form, a mini-applicator, and a combination mesh/glue system. The high viscosity form has similar indications as the original adhesive but is marketed as a complement to deep dermal sutures and as reducing unintended migration of the gel during application due to the higher viscosity. The newest evolution of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate is a system of serial administration of self-adhering mesh to the wound, followed by the application of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate on top of the mesh. Proper local anesthesia, wound irrigation, and antiseptic technique are all necessary before closure with 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, with petroleum jelly easily accessible for adhesive removal if needed. The wound edges should be approximated and slightly everted manually. The maximal bonding strength occurs within 2.5 minutes, and three layers should be applied to the wound. If the repair is to the facial region, care should be taken not to allow the gel to drip near or into the eyes, ears, or nose. Caution should be taken to avoid letting the gel dry, thereby gluing the practitioner’s hand or glove to the patient.
