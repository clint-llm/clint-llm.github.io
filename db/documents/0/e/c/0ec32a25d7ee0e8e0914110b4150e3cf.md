Encephalopathy is commonly described as an alteration of consciousness or attention ranging from mild to severe. Severe cases may be associated with poor prognosis and even death. It is secondary to various etiologies and can manifest in acute and chronic forms. EEG is usually requested to assess for pattern and rhythm abnormality, which may or may not be associated with ictal states. Continuous monitoring is also used to assess for progression and response to treatment.

**EEG in Common Acute Encephalopathies**

**Hepatic Encephalopathy**

- Encountered in patients with liver failure or insufficiency from any cause.

- The EEG changes in the beginning commonly include slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm, followed by a gradual slowing of the background with the appearance of theta and delta activity.****The frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) can appear even in the presence of the posterior dominant rhythm.

- The classic triphasic waves are best viewed with worsening of the encephalopathy and higher ammonia levels. As the severity worsens, sleep architecture is sparse.

**Renal or Uremic Encephalopathy**

- Encountered in patients with renal dysfunction of any cause with increased blood urea nitrogen level.

- These patients' EEGs are also similar to hepatic encephalopathic EEGs characterized by triphasic waveforms and slow background.

- Often high-voltage rhythmic delta activity with bilateral spike-slow-wave complexes is seen in patients with dialysis disequilibrium syndrome associated with obtundation after a dialysis session.

- These events may or may not be associated with clinical seizures.

**Hypocalcemia**

- Hypocalcemia is, by definition, a corrected total serum calcium level below 2.2 mmol/L. It is most commonly associated with vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism, among several other etiologies.

- Initially, the most common EEG change is progressive slowing through theta and delta frequency activity dominance. There is also an association with generalized spikes and sharp waves with a burst of delta activity. A 3 to 4 Hz spike and wave discharges have been reported in neonatal EEG records.

**Hypercalcemia**

- Hypercalcemia is, by definition, encountered when the serum calcium levels are above 10.5 mg/dL.

- The EEG background changes with an increase in theta activity and delta activity are seen when serum calcium levels reach over 13 mg/dL.****The EEG can be associated with spikes and sharp waves as well. With an even further increase in calcium levels, the background slowing increases mostly in the frontal regions with the appearance of a paroxysmal burst of theta and delta activity along with triphasic waves.

- Association with diffuse and more posterior occipital spike and slow-wave activity has also been reported suggesting a posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome-like presentation with hypercalcemia.

**Hypoglycemia**

- A blood glucose level below 70 mg/dL is usually defined as hypoglycemia. The correlation between blood glucose level, consciousness or attention level, and EEG changes are associated with a marked variation among individuals.

- The lowest blood glucose level where detectable EEG changes may be seen is between 29 to 40 mg/dl.

- The blood glucose level threshold is slightly higher in hypoglycemic individuals with diabetes, where EEG changes can be seen.

- The common finding associated with a lower glucose level is slowing of the background, mostly in the theta frequency range. This is noted in both adults and children.

**Hyperglycemia**

- There may be no or little slowing of the EEG background activity with a milder degree of hyperglycemia. As glucose levels increase, the diffuse delta slowing increases, and when a level of about 400 mg/dL is crossed, a sporadic spike can be seen.

- Epilepsia partialis continua (EPC), clinically defined as a syndrome with continuous jerking of a body part, commonly a limb, is well associated with non-ketotic hyperglycemia and EEG focal spikes and focal slow waves in addition to a slower background.

**Hypernatremia**

- EEG changes in hypernatremia are characterized by diffuse slowing of the background activity.

**Hyponatremia**

- EEG changes in hyponatremia are associated with background slowing in theta to delta range frequencies as serum sodium levels fall, typically below 116 mg/dL.

- The EEG may be associated with a stimulus-induced paroxysm of delta activity and central high-voltage theta activity between 6 to 7 Hz.

- Absence status epilepticus with focal EEG discharge activity have also been reported to be associated with hyponatremia.

**Hypothyroidism**

- EEG in hypothyroid states is commonly associated with a low voltage activity, predominantly in the theta frequency range. Comatose individuals in this condition may show diffuse suppression with minimal activity. Sporadically, periodic sharp waves may be encountered.

**Hyperthyroidism**

- EEG changes in hyperthyroidism include an increased alpha activity with prominent central beta activity. A sporadic burst of theta or delta activity anteriorly has been described.

- In acute thyrotoxicosis cases, EEG characterized by spikes and sharps with paroxysmal delta activity often associated with clinical seizures has been described.

**Hashimoto's Encephalopathy**

- This is a chronic, relapsing autoimmune thyroid disorder associated with antithyroid antibodies. It is usually associated with other autoimmune disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, which are usually steroid responsive.

- EEG is associated with generalized slowing and frontally intermittent rhythmic delta activity in these patients. Often triphasic waves are also seen.

**Hypoxic (anoxic) Encephalopathy**

- Anoxic or hypoxic injury is encountered in cardiac arrest, and the extent of brain injury correlates with the severity of anoxia. This includes a wide spectrum from mild, slowing to severe suppression. Poor prognostic EEG findings include alpha or spindle coma with poor reactivity, burst suppression pattern with longer interburst intervals, and electrocerebral inactivity or silence.

- Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in neonates is associated with a favorable outcome if the EEG performed within the first 8 hours after birth shows an active, normal background and portends a poorer outcome if the background activity is grossly abnormal or inactive.

**Infections Associated with the Central Nervous System (CNS)**

- CNS infections such as encephalitis, cerebral abscess, meningoencephalitis, or meningitis can manifest with diffuse changes and focal findings on the EEG. These can be associated with both generalized and focal epileptiform discharges with corresponding slowing.

- A commonly encountered example is herpes simplex encephalitis, typically associated with lateralized periodic discharges over the affected temporal lobe.

**Trauma and Intracranial Hemorrhage**

- Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) can be associated with focal and diffuse changes based on the injury's extent and the affected intracranial structures. Global damages like diffuse axonal injury are typically associated with diffuse slowing, whereas contusion and hemorrhages are associated with focal slowing and epileptiform discharges.

- In extreme TBI cases, different EEG patterns can be encountered, including alpha or spindle coma due to brainstem injury, burst suppression, and even electrocerebral inactivity.

**Drug-induced or Toxic Encephalopathy**

- The etiology of this type of encephalopathy is numerous. The EEG changes in this setting can range from the diffuse slowing of the background in theta and delta frequency activity along with an abundance of superimposed beta activity, especially with benzodiazepine and barbiturate overdoses. Some drugs are associated with focal, multifocal, or diffuse epileptic activity and seizures as well (ex: lithium). Triphasic waves are also seen in drug-induced encephalopathies.
