A pragmatic approach should be adopted while investigating pregnancies with the finding of fetal echogenic bowel in the second trimester.

A detailed ultrasound evaluation should be performed to assess for additional markers or features suggesting chromosome abnormalities (e.g., nuchal translucency, cardiac anomalies). Further genetic screening, including cell-free fetal DNA testing or a quad screen, should be offered. In pregnancies with additional risk factors (high risk based on risk stratification, other soft markers, positive screening testing), amniocentesis and chromosomal microarray analysis may be offered.

Serological testing for infections such as toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus helps detect recent or past infections. Cystic fibrosis screening should be performed if not already done as a part of routine screening.

Serial sonographic monitoring is important even in pregnancies with normal screening test results to detect the progression as well as additional abnormalities. For example, in cases of intestinal obstruction, fetal echogenic bowel may be the initial sonographic finding. On serial sonographic screening, other markers such as dilated bowel loops and abnormal peristalsis will be detected.
