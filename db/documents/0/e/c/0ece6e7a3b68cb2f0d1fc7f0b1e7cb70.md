The complications of suture hypersensitivity depend on the type of suture material used and the tissue being sutured. In general, the extent of inflammation, congestion, and foreign body reaction may complicate wound healing in any tissue. Amongst the complications are the following: postoperative adhesions, wound dehiscence, infection, and intestinal obstruction along the line of suture material to which the patient had been sensitized during a previous surgery. Suture materials increase the potential of bacterial colonization with low degrees of virulence in sites they occupy and may lead to infections, like Staphylococcus epidermidis infection.

In the urinary system, this reaction may serve as a lithogenic nidus, which may be further complicated by obstruction and infection.

In vascular and gastrointestinal anastomosis, suture hypersensitivity may be the cause of the breakdown of such anastomoses.
