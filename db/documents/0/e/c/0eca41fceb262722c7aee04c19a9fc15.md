The follow up for a woman after management for a stillbirth includes counseling on the risk of recurrence. After experiencing a stillbirth, the risk of recurrence isÂ nearly twice that of women who had a live birth. This risk is impacted by multiple factors, including maternal risks, gestational age, and identified cause(s) for the stillbirth.
