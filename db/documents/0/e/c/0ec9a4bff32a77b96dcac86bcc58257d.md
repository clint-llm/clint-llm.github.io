The urinary bladder is designed both to facilitate low-pressure filling and to efficiently expel urine using coordinated contractions. As the bladder is the most common site for malignancy within the urinary tract, its surgical removal may be necessary for the treatment of muscle-invasive cancer. When reconstructing the urinary tract following bladder removal, the continent or incontinent diversions are available. The choice of bowel segments and diversion type carries unique risks and benefits to the patient. This activity reviews the characteristics of the bladder and different approaches to urinary diversion. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in choosing and performing appropriate urinary diversions.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the anatomical structures of the urinary bladder and of bowel used in the creation of urinary diversions and neobladders.
- Describe the different urinary diversions and the surgical technique used for creating urinary diversions and neobladders.
- Summarize appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and their clinical significance in bladder removal, urinary diversion, and neobladder.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the delivery of care for patients with bladder pathology requiring urinary diversion or neobladder creation and improve outcomes.
