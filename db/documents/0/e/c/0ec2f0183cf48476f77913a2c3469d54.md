Heart failure is a growing public health problem and is now the most common cause of hospitalizations in the U.S. among patients 65 years and older. The increasing prevalence of heart failure in the population is most likely secondary to the aging of the population, increased risk factors, better outcomes for acute coronary syndrome survivors, and a reduction in mortality from other chronic conditions. Healthcare providers should be familiar with the pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment of heart failure because of the morbidity, mortality, and projected increased prevalence of the condition. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and management of heart failure and pulmonary edema. This activity also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of heart failure.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with heart failure.
- Review the management considerations for patients with heart failure.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment and management of heart failure to improve patient outcomes.
