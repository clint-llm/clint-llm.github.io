Erythrasma is a common skin disorder caused by bacteria. It was first described in 1859 by Burchardt. He thought the etiology was fungal. In 1862, Burchardt's teacher, Von Barensprung coined the term erythrasma and named the bacteria Microsporum minutissimum. Today, it is known to be caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum. This activity describes the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of erythrasma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.
