Solar urticaria is an enigmatic disorder that is not well understood. While the diagnosis is simple, its management is difficult. The condition is often encountered by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, dermatologist, and internist. However, because the condition can be difficult to distinguish from other itching disorders, a referral to a dermatologist is recommended.

There are no guidelines for the treatment of solar urticaria. Different treatments have been used with variable success. Currently, high-dose second generation antihistamines, sun exposure avoidance, use of broad-spectrum sunscreens, and dark clothing photoprotection are considered first-line.

Those who fail conservative treatment may be managed with phototherapy and biological agents. Overall, the prognosis for patients with severe urticaria is poor. Many patients are restricted indoors and lead a poor quality of life.
