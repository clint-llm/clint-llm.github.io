Humans are the only hosts of the organism, and there is no animal reservoir of Treponema pallidum, so the disease only spreads via human to human transmission. Initial infection with the spirochete evokes both a humoral and cellular immune response in the body. Its limited outer membrane polysaccharides and few surface proteins make it difficult for the immune system to identify and fight the infection quickly. Its incubation period is long, about 4 weeks to three months. The infection leads to the formation of an erythematous papule at the inoculation site, and later the lesion erodes to form a painless ulcer. These lesions are often associated with local lymphadenopathy, which may be tender. Hematogenous spread from the primary site then leads to the involvement of multiple organs, including eyes.

The disease is highly infectious in patients with primary, secondary syphilis or early latent syphilis with mucocutaneous involvement. Late latent syphilis and tertiary syphilis are considered to be non-infectious stages of the disease. The transplacental spread of the spirochete leads to congenital syphilis.
