The left main coronary artery (LCA) classically arises from the ascending aorta just above the left cusp of the aortic valve. However, as with many of the coronary arteries, anomalies of the origin of the LCA have been well described. We will focus on two main anomalies: anomalous left main coronary artery with its origin from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) and anomalous left coronary artery origin from the right coronary sinus (ALCA-R). An LCA origin from the right coronary artery (RCA) has also been described.
