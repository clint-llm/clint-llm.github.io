Prevention of atelectasis is vital to improving patient outcomes in the postoperative period. Despite employing these strategies, atelectasis is not always preventable and, therefore, early recognition and treatment are equally important. Ultimately, this will decrease the length of hospital stay, cost, and improve patient outcomes.

Both prevention and treatment of atelectasis need to be an interprofessional team effort. Physicians, and especially surgeons and anesthesiologists, need to be aware of the role of anesthesia in atelectasis. Nursing will be monitoring the patient both during and after the procedure. In the event of medical management, the pharmacist can provide recommendations on opioids and mucolytics. The nursing staff will be administering these and can report to the physicians on the effectiveness of therapy as well as any adverse events, which may lead to dose or agent changes, or other interventions. The nursing staff should assist the clinicians in the education of the patient and family in incentive spirometry and other techniques to minimize risk. In summary, atelectasis management needs to be an interprofessional team collaboration to optimize patient outcomes. [Level V]
