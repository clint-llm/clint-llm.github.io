The hypothalamus is a structure of the human brain that governs a wide range of physiological processes, including circadian rhythm, homeostasis, and stress response, as well as growth and development. Regulation of these activities is achieved, in part, via the activities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). The supraoptic nucleus is a collection of magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) located within the anterior hypothalamus that participate in the HPA axis. The primary function of these cells is to produce and secrete the peptide hormone vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin. Vasopressin serves to maintain the body's osmotic balance and regulate the body's blood pressure by instigating aquaporin expression in the kidney's distal tubule and collecting duct to increase water absorption. Oxytocin is a neuropeptide that is well known for its importance in lactation and parturition.
