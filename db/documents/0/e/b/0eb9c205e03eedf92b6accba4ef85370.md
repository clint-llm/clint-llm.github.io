A hallux valgus is a complex deformity of the first ray of the forefoot. This deformity is, at times, red and painful and can disrupt daily activities. If correctly identified and treated, the symptoms will vastly improve. Hallux valgus deformity is typically diagnosable through a physical exam, and imaging is important as it can evaluate whether there is damage to the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. Treatment centers upon first trialing non-surgical approaches such as wider shoes, orthotics, and night splinting. If conservative treatment proves ineffective, surgical management is the next recommended course of action. Patients tolerate the surgery well, with bony union usually occurring around 6 to 7 weeks postoperatively. This article highlights the role of the multidisciplinary team in evaluating and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of hallux valgus.
- Identify the components of an appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of hallux valgus.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for hallux valgus.
- Review the importance of the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by hallux valgus.
