The clinical workup, management, and follow-up of patients with supernumerary digits require an interprofessional team approach. Typically the diagnosis is made early in life by a primary clinician. Prompt referral to an orthopedic specialist can allow for early intervention when necessary. If surgical intervention is pursued, one of many specialists may be involved, including orthopedic surgeons, plastic surgeons, and anesthesiologists. All medical professionals involved should be aware that polydactyly may present as part of a syndrome, and referral to a genetic specialist may be necessary. In addition, other team members can include occupational therapists and physical therapists for strengthening and development of motor skills. As in all areas of interprofessional management, communication between team members is important to optimize outcomes for patients.
