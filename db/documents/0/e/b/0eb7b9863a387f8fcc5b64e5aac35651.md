BSS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient who presents with a prolonged bleeding history, especially if the bleeding history started from early childhood.

Most patients with BSS have platelet count between 20 to 100 billion/L. However, a count as low as 10 x 10^9/L has been reported.

The platelet aggregation studies (also called light transmission aggregometry) demonstrate a reduced response to ristocetin that is not corrected by the addition of normal plasma. This feature helps to distinguish BSS from von Willebrand disease (VWD). The responses to ADP, collagen, and arachidonic acid are normal. However, in a few patients, platelet aggregation in response to thrombin is reduced.

Flow cytometry of platelet glycoprotein is a confirmatory test. It demonstrates marked reduction of CD42a (GPIX) and CD42b (GPIb-alpha). Since flow cytometry requires only small volumes of blood, this is an appropriate test for neonates, infants, and young children.

In patients with mBSS, specifically, in those with Bolzano mutation or other similar mutations, the GPIb-IX-V complex is present in normal numbers, albeit is defective and cannot bind to VWF. In such patients, the near absent ristocetin induced platelet aggregation serves as a good diagnostic tool.
