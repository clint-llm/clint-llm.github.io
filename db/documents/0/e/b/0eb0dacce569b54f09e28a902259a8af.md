Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO), known as Ogilvie syndrome, is a distinct form of colonic dilatation occurring in the absence of underlying mechanical or anatomic etiology. Dilatation of the bowel is classically confined to the cecum and ascending colon with transition near the splenic flexure. It is most commonly encountered in older adults with multiple underlying comorbidities but may also develop in otherwise healthy patients after a traumatic injury or following a surgical operation. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of Ogilvie syndrome and reviews the role of interprofessional team members in managing those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of Ogilvie syndrome.
- Review the presentation of Ogilvie syndrome.
- Explain how Ogilvie syndrome is diagnosed.
- Describe how an optimally functioning interprofessional team would coordinate care to enhance outcomes for patients with Ogilvie syndrome.
