The diagnosis and management of CMV colitis are complex. They require an interprofessional team that includes gastroenterologists, internists, infectious disease specialists, pathologists, clinical pharmacists, specialized nurses, and in some cases, transplant physicians. A collaborative approach to patients at high risk of disease can help diagnose this infection early and allow for timely treatment. Specialty-trained nurses can assist the clinical care team by educating the patient on symptom monitoring as well as compliance with clinical/serologic monitoring after solid-organ transplantation to help identify potential infections early. The clinical pharmacist can assist in drug monitoring and identifying potential drug-drug interactions to minimize adverse outcomes. A well-coordinated and collaborative interprofessional team can ensure that patients at the highest risk of this disease receive optimal prophylaxis, monitoring, and treatment. This, in turn, will improve clinical outcomes for these patients.[Level 5]
