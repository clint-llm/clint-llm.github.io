The vasculature of the navicular bone primarily comes from the dorsalis pedis artery and medial plantar artery. Dorsalis pedis artery vascular branches supply blood to the dorsum of the navicular, which is divided into three to five branches when it crosses upon the dorsal aspect of the bone. The medial plantar artery is the terminal branch of the posterior tibial artery after it passes behind the medial malleolus. It is responsible for the plantar vascularization. The lateral and medial aspect, including the navicular tuberosity, receives vessels from an anastomotic network that builds up from the dorsalis pedis and the medial plantar artery. This vascular network provides a rich vascularization to the medial and lateral superficial portion of the navicular, but it lacks bone penetration causingÂ a low level of blood supply in the central part. Increasing age results in the reduction of supplementary arteries that supply the navicular bone. It leads to a higher risk of osteonecrosis or stress fracture in the middle third of the bone.

The lymphatic flows go along with the vasculature. It runs up the leg through the popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes, and eventually reaches the thoracic duct.
