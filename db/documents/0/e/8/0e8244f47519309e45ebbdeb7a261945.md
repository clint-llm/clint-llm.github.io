Schizencephaly results from abnormal neuronal migration a few weeks after gestation.

There are a few hypotheses that try to explain the pathogenesis of schizencephaly.

- In-utero exposure to CMV results in an inflammatory process that leads to a middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. This is supported by the fact that the majority of schizencephaly lesions occur in the MCA territory.

- Environmental factors like maternal age (below 20 years), no first-trimester antenatal medical care, and drug or alcohol abuse can contribute to the maldevelopment of the brain in schizencephaly.

- Genetic factors can also contribute to the development of schizencephaly and other associated anomalies like polymicrogyria, septum pellucidum and/or corpus callosum agenesis, optic nerve atrophy, arachnoid cysts, and cerebellar anomalies. EMX2 gene regulates the structural development of the prosencephalon. Patients with a heterozygotic mutation of this are prone to develop this condition, even though such a cause is rare.

Schizencephaly has also been described as a part of genetic syndromes like Vici syndrome (corpus callosum agenesis, albinism, immune deficiency, cardiomyopathy), which occurs due to EPG5 gene mutation.
