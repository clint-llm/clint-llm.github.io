The most important prognostic factor remains the duration of ischemia which goes on to determine whether the cellular injury is reversible or irreversible. In addition, the presence of other co-morbid as well as the history of prior ischemic insult to the same organ is associated with a worse prognosis. These risk factors include stenosis of >80%, pre-morbid hypertension, and poor collaterals.

In patients with ischemic stroke and embolism, endarterectomy can be used as a modality to restore blood flow. After blood flow restoration these people are at a danger of developing hyperperfusion or reperfusion injury. The potential risk of developing this can be estimated by transcranial doppler USG (TCD) or by estimating the cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 by giving acetazolamide. Use TCD both post and pre-op to regulate cerebral blood flow.
