Tinea manuum might be asymptomatic, or patients can complain of thickened skin or pruritis. Infection is usually unilateral, but it can also affect both hands. The dorsum of the hand will show a similar morphology as in tinea corporis, characterized by a red plaque with an active vesicular and scaly border and a centrifugal growth. Several concentric rings might be seen (fig 1) (fig 2). Palmar surfaces usually have a dry, scaling appearance (fig 3).

The most common clinical presentation is an entity known as “two-foot, one hand syndrome.” In this case, both feet are affected, and one hand presents with scaly patches or moderate to severe, diffuse dryness. In some patients, onychomycosis can be present in the same hand or even in both hands.

Zoophilic dermatophyte infections must be suspected when inflammatory lesions with pustular or vesicular plaques on a highly erythematous base are seen, especially if the lesions are localized to one hand. Patients can describe pain, itch, and swelling, and rare cases might include local lymphangitis.
