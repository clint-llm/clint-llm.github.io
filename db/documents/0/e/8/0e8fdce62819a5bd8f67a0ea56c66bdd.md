Mild PR on echocardiography will not require a follow-up unless the patient becomes symptomatic or if the initial echocardiogram showed signs of early RV dysfunction. Moderate to severe PR needs regular follow-up with history, physical exam, and echocardiography to assess the disease progression and the need for surgery.

As per adult congenital heart disease guidelines by AHA/ACC, patients who underwent TOF repair should have an annual check-up with a cardiologist with expertise in that area.
