Actinic cheilitis is a diagnosis made from clinical and histopathology evaluation. It is essential to distinguish between cheilitis (benign inflammation),  premalignant actinic cheilitis, and squamous cell carcinoma. Skin biopsy is the golden standard regarding the evaluation of a persistent suspicious lesion on the lip. Many lesions initially thought to be premalignant actinic cheilitis on exam were found to be SCC upon histological evaluation, which indicates providers are not able to entirely make the diagnosis clinically, and biopsy is helpful when evaluating these lesions. While not required to make a diagnosis, one article suggests evaluating patients with electron microscopy helps to assess further the ultrastructural changes found in AC lesions, their potential for malignant transformation, and ensure they are diagnosed and managed correctly.

- Physical exam: persistent white/erythematous thickening sandpapery skin on the lower lip

- Labwork: for lesions that are new, symmetric, in young patients, found in patient's with darker skin types, or individuals without a history of chronic sun exposure where skin cancer is less likely, consider first ruling out reversible causes such as those with a vitamin deficiency/infectious/contact/irritant etiology (Chart 1)

- Skin biopsy: skin biopsy is recommended for persistent lesions

- Electron Microscopy: hyperkeratosis, mild acanthosis, Perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate around glandular ducts
