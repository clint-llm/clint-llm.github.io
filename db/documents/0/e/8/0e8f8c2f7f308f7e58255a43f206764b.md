HLA antigens, particularly the A, B, and C loci, are highly variable, especially in the extracellular domains, as evidenced by the over 300 class I alleles that researchers have identified.

In addition to their variability and function as peptide receptors, they act at different sites with beta-2-microglobulin, an alpha-beta T-cell receptor, and inhibitory molecules.
