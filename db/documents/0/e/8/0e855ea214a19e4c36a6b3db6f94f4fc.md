Specific contraindications depend upon the type of angiography being performed. In general, angiography is contraindicated if the diagnostic information obtained will not alter clinical management or obtainable information via a less invasive procedure. Contrast sensitivity, hypotension, coagulopathy, renal disease, and heart failure are relative contraindications that should be considered before the intervention.
