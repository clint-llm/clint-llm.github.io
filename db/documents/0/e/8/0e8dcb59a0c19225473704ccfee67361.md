The volume of amniotic fluid in the gestational sac is a result of a balance between fluid production and fluid movement out of the sac. In the first 20 weeks, lung secretions, along with hydrostatic and osmotic transport of maternal plasma through the fetal membranes, make up the majority of amniotic fluid production. At around week 16, the fetal kidneys begin to function, and the production of fetal urine steadily increases, taking over the majority of amniotic fluid production until the gestation is at term.

Fetal genitourinary abnormalities can, therefore, result in a diagnosis of oligohydramnios after 16Â to 20 weeks gestation. Examples include bladder outlet obstruction, dysplastic kidneys, and renal agenesis. Fetal swallowing and intramembranous absorption, thought to occur by osmotic absorption of fluid directly across the amnion and into fetal blood vessels, are the primary routes of amniotic resorption. Therefore, fetal gastrointestinal anomalies, such as tracheoesophageal fistula (incidence rate of approximately 1 in 3500 live births), can result in excess fluid volume, or polyhydramnios.
