By the midpoint of pregnancy, the woman and provider should discuss what the woman may experience during the remainder of the pregnancy. Braxton Hicks contractions are one of the normal events a woman may experience. Teaching her about Braxton Hicks contractions will help her to be informed and to decrease her anxiety if they occur.

There is no medical treatment for Braxton Hicks contractions. However, taking action to change the situation that triggered the Braxton Hicks contractions is warranted. Some actions to ease Braxton Hicks contractions include:

- Changing position or activity level: if the woman has been very active, lie down; if the woman has been sitting for an extended time, go for a walk.

- Relaxing: take a warm bath, get a massage, read a book, listen to music, or take a nap.

- Drinking water to rehydrate.

If these actions do not lessen the Braxton Hicks contractions or if the contractions continue and are becoming more frequent or more intense, the patient's healthcare provider should be contacted.

Also, if any of the following are present the healthcare provider should be contacted immediately:

- Vaginal bleeding

- Leaking of fluid from the vagina

- Strong contractions every 5-minutes for an hour

- Contractions that the woman is unable to "walk through"

- A noticeable change in fetal movement, or if there are less than ten movements every 2 hours.
