Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome was first described in cases of Neisseria meningitidis sepsis. Over the years, several bacterial and viral causes have correlated, which include and are not limited to, Streptococcus pneumonia,Hemophilus influenzae,Escherichia coli,Staphylococcus aureus,Capnocytophaga canimorsus,Enterobacter cloacae,Pasteurella multocida,Plesiomonas shigelloides,Neisseria gonorrhoeae,Moraxella duplex.Rickettsia rickettsii,Bacillus anthracis,Treponema pallidum,Legionella pneumophila,Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common pathogen identified.N. meningitidis as the most common bacteria associated with adrenal hemorrhage.

In a 25-year-study done at Mayo Clinic, trauma was the reported cause of adrenal hemorrhage in 4 out of 141 cases (2.8%). The hemorrhage was bilateral in 2 cases.

3 (2.1%) patients experienced AH associated with anticoagulant therapy in the 25-year study.

In the same 25-year-study, hemorrhage associated with heparin associated thrombocytopenia (HAT) and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome was present in 20 patients (14.2%). Twelve patients were shown to have a circulating lupus anticoagulant. Ten patients had heparin associated thrombocytopenia, and 2 of them had lupus anticoagulant as well.
