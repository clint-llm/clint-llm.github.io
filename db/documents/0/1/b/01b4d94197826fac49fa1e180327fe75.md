Histopathologic examination reveals hypertrophic sebaceous glands and thickened dermis containing fibrovascular myxoid stroma and lymphatic cells. Expansion of the sebaceous unit leads to sebum plugging. In observed cases of severe rhinophyma, sebaceous glands become destroyed by edema and fibrosis, producing a lymphoedema-type histologic picture.
