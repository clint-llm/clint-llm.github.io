Prognosis appears to be good in patients with Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome. While patients with LGL patterns are typically asymptomatic due to a propensity to develop atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, AVRT, or another tachyarrhythmia, these patients have been known to report palpitations or other associated symptoms. As a result, they are often considered to be at similar risk for stroke or other associated complications as patients with these tachyarrhythmias. In rare cases, there have been suggestions regarding the development of more concerning rhythms, such as ventricular tachycardia.
