Perhaps the most important alternative diagnosis to be considered when a patient presents with hypercalcemia is a malignancy. Hyperparathyroid and malignancy combined account for 90% of cases of hypercalcemia. However, hypercalcemia of malignancy tends to present with much higher concentrations of the ion than a benign parathyroid disease.

Another differential diagnosis is familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH). Up to 20% of patients with this disease will also have an elevated PTH level, which can make differentiation difficult. However, patients with FHH characteristically have a low urine calcium excretion and calcium/creatinine (Ca/Cr) clearance ratio, which is not a feature of parathyroid adenomas.

Two medications that can cause elevated calcium levels are thiazide diuretics and lithium. The medication history of any patient presenting with elevated calcium should first be checked for either of these medications.
