The exact mechanisms causing the periodic change in the diameter of the hair in monilethrix are still not clear.

Mutations in hair keratins genes KRT81, KRT83, or KRT86 most likely disrupt the keratin intermediate filaments formation in the hair shaft cortex.

The hair breakage usually occurs in the internodal area where the medulla is absent. The thin hairs can sometimes break even inside the scalp. The consequence is that the broken hair shafts are caught in the infundibulum, causing a disruption of the outer root sheath and, thus, a constitution of a foreign body granuloma (clinically represented by red occipital papules).

Monilethrix shows considerable variation in presentation, severity, and course, even within a single family. These phenotype variations have not been proved to correlate with the different genotypes of the disease
