The glucocorticoid producing adrenal tumors can present with the symptoms and signs of Cushing syndrome including obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, fatigue, depression, menstrual irregularities, proximal muscle weakness, acne, facial plethora, striae, fractures, and osteopenia. Aldosterone-secreting tumors may present with hypertension that is quite frequently resistant hypertension with uncontrolled blood pressure despite the use of three or moreÂ antihypertensive medications of different classes. Other symptoms can include muscle weakness, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypernatremia.
