**Clinical Differential**

The clinical differential diagnosis for granular cell tumors is extensive and varies by the location of the tumor. It may include alveolar soft parts sarcoma, adnexal tumors, apocrine carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, colonic adenoma, cystic lesions, dermatofibroma, dermoid cyst, desmoid tumor, duct ectasia, fat necrosis, fibroadenoma, fibrosarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, granulomatous mastitis, hidradenoma, hypertrophic scar, invasive mammary carcinoma, irritation fibroma, keloid, leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma, lipoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, neurofibroma, nodular fasciitis, oncocytic renal cell carcinoma, prurigo nodularis, regressing verruca, rhabdomyosarcoma, sclerosing adenosis, schwannoma, steatoma, and traumatic neuroma.

**Histologic Differential**

The histologic differential largely includes tumors that have similar morphologic findings and those with granular variants. It includes alveolar soft parts sarcoma, ameloblastoma, angiosarcoma, atypical fibroxanthoma, basal cell carcinoma, congenital granular cell epulis, dermatofibroma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, epithelioid histiocytoma, fibroxanthoma, granular cell dermatofibroma, hibernoma, leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma, lobomycosis, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, melanocytic nevus, melanoma, neurofibroma, non-neural granular cell tumor, primitive polypoid granular cell tumor, reactive granular cell change, reticulohistiocytoma, rhabdomyoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, schwannoma, squamous cell carcinoma, trichoblastoma, and xanthoma.
