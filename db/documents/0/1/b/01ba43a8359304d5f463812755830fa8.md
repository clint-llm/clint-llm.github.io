Trastuzumab is a biologic antineoplastic agent that, at the time of its FDA approval in 1998, was among the first available targeted chemotherapies. In the United States, it has FDA-approval for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer as adjuvant therapy in combination with anthracycline- or taxane-based chemotherapy, metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer as monotherapy, or for combination use with paclitaxel, and HER2-positive gastric cancer in combination with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. It also has off-label use in other HER2-positive cancers. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring, of trastuzumab so providers can direct patient therapy where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of trastuzumab.
- Outline the possible combination therapies approved for trastuzumab.
- Review the potential adverse effects of therapy with trastuzumab.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to properly use trastuzumab to improve patient outcomes when necessary for therapy.
