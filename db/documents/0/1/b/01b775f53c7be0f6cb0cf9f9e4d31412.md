AAT deficiency occurs worldwide, but its prevalence varies by population. This disorder affects about one in 1500 to 3500 individuals with European ancestry. It is uncommon in people of Asian descent.

Although AAT deficiency is considered to be rare, estimates that 80,000 to 100,000 individuals in the United States have a severe deficiency of AAT suggest that the disease is under-recognized. It is estimated that more than three million people worldwide have allele combinations associated with severe deficiency of AAT.
