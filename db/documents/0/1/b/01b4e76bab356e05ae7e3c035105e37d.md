Patients frequently present to the emergency department with an acute abdomen. The symptoms are similar to those of recurrent biliary colic incomplete torsion, but in the presence of complete torsion, there is a short history of sudden-onset of severe upper-right quadrant pain and associated vomiting. A palpable abdominal is sometimes present. There are usually no associated signs of toxemia or jaundice. The preoperative diagnosis of gallbladder torsion remains difficult because the nonspecific symptoms and signs which may be similar to those of acute infective pathology. At times, the findings on clinical examination are similar to that of acute appendicitis or ischaemic bowel. Regardless of rotational direction, blood supply is ultimately compromised, leading to infarction and gangrene. Usually, the patient is admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of infectious etiology requiring resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic therapy. Â When symptoms are unremitting in spite of adequate treatment for an acute right-sided abdominal pathology, the index of suspicion in support of volvulus of the gallbladder needs to be high.
