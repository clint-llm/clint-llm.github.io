The identification of patients at risk for neonatal lupus and adequate screening for pregnant women with risk factors is an interprofessional work that involves obstetricians, pediatricians, a pediatric cardiologist, neonatologist, nurses and staff involved in the care of these patients. Patient-tailored and integral application of a treatment plan must be a priority in pregnant women with systemic lupus erythematosus. The current recommendations for antenatal surveillance highlight the relevance of adequate screening to identify promptly affected population that will benefit from therapeutic strategies. The American Heart Association suggest screening at 16 weeks of gestation then every week or every other week until 28 weeks of gestation in women with positive SSA/SSB autoantibodies and for women who have had a previously affected child at least every week during the same time frame (16 to 20 weeks), with a level of evidence IIa/B and IB.
