Hypoalphalipoproteinemia (HA) is classified as a low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level. Contemporary literature has also reported HA as HDL levels below the 10th percentile for patients of the same age and gender without any other lipoprotein abnormalities.

Metabolic syndrome constitutes the combination of abnormalities in HDL, triglycerides, abdominal waist circumference, blood pressure, and glucose levels. The ATP III criteria designated for HDL cholesterol levels that contribute to metabolic syndrome are sex-specific. For example, in men, the cutoff is <40mg/dL, but for women, the high-risk HDL cholesterol level is <50 mg/dL.

Familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. As a result of low levels of alpha-lipoproteins, patients have a higher prevalence of premature coronary heart disease and stroke.
