Solitary CHRPE and GPR do not require treatment and may be observed periodically. Solitary lesions should be closely examined for the rare instance of nodule development and associated complications or malignant transformation (see section "Prognosis"). The lesion may be measured, and fundus photography may be employed to monitor for changes in lesion size/characteristics.

Patients with PO-FLs should undergo routine endoscopies with their gastroenterologist to assess for the presence of polyps within the colon and rectum. Genetic screening should be performed in patients with a family history of adenomatous polyposis syndrome or patients with ten or more polyps regardless of family history.
