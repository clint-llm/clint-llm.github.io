Thoracic spine herniated disc usually presents with radiculopathy symptoms or myelopathic symptoms depending on the compression of the nerve roots or spinal cord, respectively.

Patients may complain of burning pain, numbness and tingling, sensation changes, or weakness.

The vast majority of cases resolved with conservative management.

In the cervical (neck) and lumbar (low back) spine, patients initially are managed conservatively with over-the-counter pain medications, home exercises, heat, ice, and activity as tolerated.

The time of recovery often depends on the mechanism of injury, as well as the severity of disc herniation. On average, most cases of disc herniation resolve between two to twelve weeks following injury.

Since many cases improve within two to three weeks following injury, physical therapy is not recommended until three weeks after the onset of symptoms.

Similarly, given that most cases resolve within six weeks of symptoms. An MRI is not recommended until at least six weeks of persistent symptoms, symptoms of severe radiculopathy, or rapidly worsening neurological changes associated with a suspected disc herniation.

A patient who has progressive myelopathic symptoms or does not respond to conservative treatment can be managed with an epidural steroid injection or radiofrequency ablative techniques.

The surgical approach for the thoracic spine includes the transthoracic or costotransversectomy approach for discectomies and fusion.
