Kienböck disease is a clinical and imaging diagnosis. Both radiography/computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are highly specific. However, MRI is the most sensitive and detects radiographically occult cases.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging:**Diffuse decrease in lunate bone marrow signal on T1-weighted images is a hallmark of the disease. Signal changes on T2-weighted images or short-TI inversion recovery (STIR, which nullifies signal from fat) images vary with progression and extent of osteonecrosis. MRI also assesses the integrity of the articular cartilage.

**Radiography:**Normal early in the disease. Findings, when present, depend on the morphological stage and include diffuse lunate sclerosis, cystic changes, articular surface collapse, carpal collapse, mid-carpal and/or radio-carpal secondary arthrosis. Coronal fractures may occur in lunates with a type I morphology.

**Computed Tomography:******Is useful for surgical planning. It is also more sensitive than radiography for detecting subtle subchondral fractures, coronal lunate fractures, fragmentation, carpal instability, and the degree of trabecular disruption. Patients are frequently re-staged after CT imaging.

**Nuclear Scintigraphy:**Findings are non-specific. It previously found use as an adjunct for diagnosing early-stage disease. It has fallen out of favor since introducing MRI.
