Heat illness is a common issue experienced worldwide. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have found it to be the number one cause of weather-related fatalities year after year. This data also has support from data published by the Centers for Disease Control.

Risk factors for the development of heat-related illness include:

- High temperatures and humidity

- Heatwave (greater-than-or-equal to three days of temperature more than 32.2°C (90.0°F))

- Age (older and young patients)

- Obesity

- Concurrent infection

- Hydration status

- Alcohol consumption

- Drugs including but not limited to: diuretics, anticholinergics, beta- or calcium-channel blockers, antihistamines, amphetamines

- Comorbid medical conditions including diabetes mellitus, infections, skin disorders, sickle cell trait, and cardiovascular disease

In addition to older patients who have many of the risk factors presented above, specific population groups that are susceptible to heat-related injuries include adolescents and athletes.

Younger children are at particular risk for developing heat-related injury due to multiple factors, including:

- An increased surface area to body mass ratio

- Decreased blood volume

- Immature thermoregulatory mechanisms

- A higher set point for sweat-inducing temperature compensation in addition to less sweat volume

- Slower ability to acclimatize to hotter environments

Modifiable risk factors for the development of heat illness include obese body habitus, alcohol use, medication use, illicit stimulant drug use, hydration status, and avoidance of exertion in hot and humid environments.
