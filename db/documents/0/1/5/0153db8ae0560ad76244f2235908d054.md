Undiagnosed PG can lead to irreversible functional visual field loss, glaucomatous optic neuropathy, and progressive retinal nerve layer thinning, with possible central visual loss arising in the late stages of the disease. Early diagnosis in patients with PDS can help identify patients at risk of developing elevated IOP that may require more stringent management. The ophthalmologist needs to collaborate with other healthcare professionals within the hospital and community setting.

Routine eye examinations that include tonometry, slit-lamp examination, and fundus examination, coupled with visual field testing and optical coherence tomography (OCT), can provide the proper tools to manage patients with PDS at risk of developing elevated IOP. In patients on therapy for PG, primary and secondary care is necessary to ensure periodic assessments to control and limit glaucoma progression.[Level 5]
