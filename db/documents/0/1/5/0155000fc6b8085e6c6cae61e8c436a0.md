Multiple myeloma is a complex disease that often involves numerous systems. Given this fact, treating multiple myeloma frequently requires an interdisciplinary approach. While the oncologist will certainly be involved, several other individualsâ€™ aid and expertise will be needed.

From a diagnostic standpoint, pathology will provide critical diagnostic information and interpretation of serum protein electrophoresis and bone marrow biopsy evaluation and quantification of plasma cell involvement. Radiology will help determine the presence of any lytic lesions. Nephrologists may be required to aid in the management of any new or worsening renal dysfunction. Radiation oncology input may be necessary to address any symptomatic bony lesions. Orthopedic or neurosurgery can help address pathologic fractures or lesions, causing impending progression. In addition, many orthopedists see patients before an actual diagnosis of MM for pain, so assuring this is in their differential is critical in earlier diagnosis.

Finally, another consideration for improving outcomes is that of a second opinion. Studies have demonstrated decreased mortality risk when a patient is evaluated and treated at a National Cancer Institute Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCI CCC).

While every case is unique in its presentation and progression, without a doubt, a multidisciplinary approach helps improve results.
