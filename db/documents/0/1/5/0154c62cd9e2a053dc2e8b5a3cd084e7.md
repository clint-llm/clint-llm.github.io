SCI and spinal shock are life-changing events for patients. Patient education regarding the disease process, potential complications, and prophylactic measures to prevent these complications should be essential for the treatment plan. Occupational and physical therapy focusing on strengthening exercises, mobility, and fall prevention must be incorporated to optimize clinical outcomes for these patients. Skincare, VTE prophylaxis, and maintaining the regular function of the urinary system and the bowels are essential to prevent the complications of urinary infections, bowel obstruction, and sepsis. Moreover, irregularities of these systems often trigger the dreaded autonomic dysreflexia, which may be a preventable condition if these noxious stimuli can be prevented.
