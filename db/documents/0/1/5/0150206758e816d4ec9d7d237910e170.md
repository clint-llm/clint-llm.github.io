Acute asthma exacerbation, bronchiolitis, and anaphylaxis are a few of the most common causes of bronchospasm in the pediatric population. There are a wide variety of other disease processes that can cause bronchospasm and present with wheezing on physical exam.

The differential diagnosis in these cases should include, but not be limited to, the following:

- Foreign body aspiration
