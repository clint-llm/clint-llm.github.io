Prompt recognition and subsequent intervention are paramount in the setting of tardive dystonia. Proper evaluation begins with reviewing the primary diagnosis, describing the precipitating motor abnormalities, assessing symptom severity, and finally, by developing a treatment plan based upon the specific phenomenology. It is important that the clinician review the full medical profile, as alternative dopaminergic antagonizing medications have been known to induce tardive syndromes. Such inciting agents include dopamine receptor blocking anti-emetics, including prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, and promethazine.
