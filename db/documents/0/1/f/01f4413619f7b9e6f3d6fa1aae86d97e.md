Interprofessional monitoring is crucial to not only the success of the operation but to the overall outcomes of the patient's entire hospital course. To prevent any complications from occurring during the Manougian procedure, all team members must be monitoring the patient. The anesthesia and perfusion teams are responsible for close-knit communication and keeping the patient stable throughout the procedure. This entails an adequate amount of sedation while maintaining stable perfusing vitals while on cardio-pulmonary bypass. The OR staff helps by obtaining the correct surgical supplies, prepping, positioning the patient, and helping throughout the operative case. While all team members have specific physical responsibilities, they are all responsible for monitoring the patient. Any complication may occur at any point in time. Having multiple people prepared for any event to occur helps to decrease poor outcomes.
