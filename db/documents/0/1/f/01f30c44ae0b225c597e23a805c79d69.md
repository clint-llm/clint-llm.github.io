The wide distribution of cholinergic receptors in the peripheral nervous system mediating the activity of visceral organs and skeletal muscle creates a unique pharmacologic niche. When activated, muscarinic receptors can produce bradycardia, bronchoconstriction, increased GI motility, emptying of the bladder, gland secretion, and pupillary constriction for near vision.

At the neuromuscular junction, nicotinic receptor agonists are used to induceÂ a state of paralysis. Nicotinic agonists do this by binding to the receptor, occupying the acetylcholine binding domain. Two popular classes of drugs are succinylcholine and tubocurarine. Both of these drugs exhibit specificity for nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction but differ in their mechanism for receptor inactivation. Succinylcholine binds and activates the nicotinic receptor but remains bound to the active site of the recept.
