The basis for diagnosis and workup of seborrheic keratosis are generally on their overall appearance. If the tumors are dark, uniform, slow-growing, and have the typical “stuck on” verrucous appearance, there is a high probability that they are benign, and further workup is not necessary. Examination with a dermatoscope would further help differentiate benign features from dysplastic or malignant tumors. Dermatoscope findings for seborrheic keratosis generally show milia cysts, comedo-like openings, fissures, and ridges. Overlapping lesions or high numbers of seborrheic keratosis can make the diagnosis and workup of these lesions more difficult. Patients with high numbers of seborrheic keratoses should receive careful screening, as there can be an increased chance of missing co-existing melanoma or pigmented basal cell carcinoma.

Additionally, seborrheic keratosis is slow-growing and can become larger and thicker over time. There have been cases of a secondary tumor growing adjacent to or within a pre-existing seborrheic keratosis. A dermatologist referral should be a consideration in patients with a high number of lesions and high clinical suspicion of malignancy for a more thorough and team-oriented approach.

If there is uncertainty with the diagnosis or if there are other concerns for malignancy such as ulcerated lesions, rapid change in size, or overall very large lesions, a skin biopsy would be recommended to get a definitive answer.
