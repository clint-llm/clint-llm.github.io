Sinus bradycardia, as any of the other bradyarrhythmias, is caused by a multitude of intrinsic and extrinsic factors which may compromise the integrity of the sinus node. These factors can cause failure of the impulse formation at the sinus node, impulse conduction at the atrioventricular node, or bundle of His-Purkinje fibers.

Sinus bradycardia is an incidental finding in many healthy adults. This is common in athletes and during sleep.

Physiological causes that increase vagal tone are more common in athletes. Pathological causes are stated in the etiology.

Sinus bradycardia is a common occurrence in sick sinus syndrome. In this disorder, there is dysfunction of the SA node. The condition is most common in elderly patients with concomitant heart disease.
