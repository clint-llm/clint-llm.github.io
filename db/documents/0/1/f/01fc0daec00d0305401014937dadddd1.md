Since adenoid cystic carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor, it has the most prognostic data of the lacrimal gland carcinomas. Overall, the prognosis is poor, and ACC has often been referred to as the "slow killer" since recurrences and metastasis can occur years after treatment, with most patients dying within ten years of diagnosis. Several prognostic factors have been identified in the literature, including tumor size, histologic subtype, perineural invasion, and the stage at diagnosis.

Tumor size is one of the more important factors, with a better prognosis for tumors that are less than 2.5 cm in greatest diameter.

For carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, the prognosis depends on the identity and behavior of the malignant component of the tumor that has spread beyond the capsule of the original tumor. If the tumor is non- or minimally invasive, the prognosis is excellent. Otherwise, most patients die within a few years due to intracranial spread and metastases to the lungs, chest, and bone.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is organized into low, intermediate, and high-grade tumors. The low and intermediate tumors carry a good prognosis, but high-grade tumors have a poor survival rate.

Ductal carcinoma is an aggressive neoplasm that usually presents as locally advanced disease that is difficult to control, with a mortality rate of over 40%. Metastases develop in more than 50% of cases.

The prognosis for lymphoma overall is good, though it depends on the extent of systemic involvement. For extranodal marginal zone lymphoma localized to just the orbit is very good, as it is usually sensitive to radiation therapy. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma has three subtypes, with the ABC subtype having the poorest prognosis.
