Superior homonymous quadrantanopia is not a disease; rather, a clinical finding that points towards a lesion of the optic radiations coursing through the temporal lobe. Scarce information is available regarding the frequency of this visual defect in the general population. However, studies documenting the frequency of a superior quadrantanopia following temporal lobe injury have been published.

The presence of aÂ mild visual field deficit may go unnoticed in a patient. However, severe superior quadrantanopia can cause significant loss of peripheral vision and can impede activities such as driving. The incidence of a visual field defect increases with age as the older population has an increased incidence of strokes and traumatic injuries. The prevalence of a visual field defect in the Australian population 49 years or older is 0.8%.
