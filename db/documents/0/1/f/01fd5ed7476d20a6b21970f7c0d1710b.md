The differential diagnosis of AI is key to the clinical decision-making processes regarding management and evaluation.

Pseudo-CI is a key differential diagnosis to actual CI. This is often considered an AI with a secondary CI finding. In true CI, the NPC is receded. However, measures of accommodation, such as the AoA, are within normal limits. In cases of CI, when an accommodative anomaly exists, there tends to be an accommodative excess. From a clinical perspective, repetition of the NPC with +0.75 or +1.00 lenses may improve performance in pseudo-CI cases. In contrast to just AI, high plus lenses tend to increase exophoria, thus making it more difficult for the patients to converge (while worsening symptoms). In such cases, tailored vision therapy can be of great value.

Certain ocular diseases like Adie's tonic pupil can present symptoms mimicking AI. Infective conditions that produce neuropathological sequelae like syphilis and meningitis may also affect accommodative ability by disrupting the parasympathetic pathway.
