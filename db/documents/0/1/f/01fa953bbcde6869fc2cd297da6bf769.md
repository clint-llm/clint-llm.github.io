At the top of the differential for SCID are other forms of combined immunodeficiency.  These patients have several characteristics that overlap in their clinical presentation.  Patients with agenesis of the thymus or T cell deficiency (such as in DiGeorge syndrome or CHARGE syndrome) may present with opportunistic infections similar to SCID.

Additional immunodeficiencies that merit consideration in the differential include the following:

- Calcium channel deficiencies

- Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome

- NF-kappa-B essential modifier (NEMO) deficiency

- Zeta-chain-associated protein 70 deficiency

- HIV/AIDS

Malabsorption syndromes that cause extreme malnutrition may also have similar presentations to SCID.
