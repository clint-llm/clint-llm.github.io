Elevated hemidiaphragm is more common than bilateral diaphragm weakness. The causes of both elevated hemidiaphragm and bilateral diaphragm paralysis are similar, with the significant difference being the rate of incidence. The exact frequency of diaphragmatic disorders is not known and is difficult to estimate. It is likely that diaphragmatic disorders are under-diagnosed due to subtle clinical findings and varying etiologies. However, the incidence of many specific causes of diaphragmatic disorders is known.

Coronary artery bypass grafting surgery is associated with lesions of the phrenic nerves resulting in postoperative diaphragmatic paralysis, with a reported incidence varying from 1% to 5%, with some reports as high as 60%. Internal mammary artery harvesting and the use of frozen slurry during cardiac surgery increase the risk of phrenic nerve injury.
