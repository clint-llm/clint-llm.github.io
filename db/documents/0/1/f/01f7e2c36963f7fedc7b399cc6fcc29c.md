Opportunistic infections (OI) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with HIV/AIDS. Although the incidence of OI has reduced since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 1995, it continues to add to the burden of HIV-related hospitalizations and deaths in patients. This is particularly true in patients who have not received HAART therapy or who have been non-compliant to it.

There is a progressive decrease in CD4+ counts in HIV/AIDS when left untreated. CD4+ cells play an important role in mounting an immune response against infections. These cells release cytokines that lead to the activation of antigen-presenting cells, phagocytic cells, natural killer cells, and cytotoxic T cells.  They also support the conversion of B-lymphocytes into long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells. A decrease in CD4+ T cell count thus leads to a decline in both humoral and cell-mediated immunity. Ultimately it predisposes patients to a higher risk of contracting opportunistic diseases due to viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa.
