Carcinoid syndrome refers to a number of symptoms caused by the release of humoral factors such as polypeptides, prostaglandins, and biogenic amines. These are mostly released from neuroendocrine tumors that are well-differentiated and were previously known as carcinoid tumors. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of carcinoid syndrome and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of carcinoid syndrome.
- Outline the typical patient history and physical examination in those with carcinoid syndrome.
- Summarize the use of biochemical markers in the evaluation of carcinoid syndrome.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by carcinoid syndrome.
