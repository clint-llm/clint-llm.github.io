Dupilumab is a human monoclonal antibody administered subcutaneously to inhibit the interleukin-4 receptor subunit α (IL-4R α).

Since the incidence of AD has been consistently rising, especially in the developed and industrialized parts of the world, dermatologists must prescribe treatment regimens that are both efficacious and safe to use in the long-term management of this chronic skin condition.

Currently, no specific guidelines deem the drug safe for children under six years of age to treat atopic dermatitis.

Dupilumab has shown to enhance lung function and reduce severe exacerbations in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma, irrespective of baseline eosinophil count, and when used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-2 (β2) agonists, as compared to standard asthma therapy.

**Non-FDA Approved Indications**
