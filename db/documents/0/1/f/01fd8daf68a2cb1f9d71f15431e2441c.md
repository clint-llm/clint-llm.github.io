Follicular lymphoma is an indolent lymphoma with chronic and variable clinical course. Its optimal management requires an interprofessional approach involving a team consisting of medical oncologists or hematologists, stem cell transplant physicians, radiation oncologists, primary care physicians, a palliative care team, psychiatrists, psychologists, infectious disease physicians, pharmacists, registered dieticians, social workers, and case managers.

Interpersonal communication and updates regarding treatment plans can significantly alleviate patients' and patients' families' concerns and bring all care team members together. Because cancer diagnosis and recurrence frequently cause psychological distress, prompt identification and referral to a psychiatrist or psychologist can improve overall treatment adherence and outcomes. This interprofessional team approach will yield optimal patient results. [Level 5]
