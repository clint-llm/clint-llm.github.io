There are potential maternal and fetal consequences following shoulder dystocia. Maternal consequences include postpartum hemorrhage and an increased risk of third or fourth-degree lacerations. Certain "heroic maneuvers" such as the Zavanelli maneuver is associated with significant maternal morbidity. Fetal consequences include fetal brachial plexus injuries, fetal clavicular or humeral fracture, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy syndrome, and even fetal death. Most brachial plexus injuries are transient and resolve with time and physical therapy. Fetal fractures typically heal without consequences.

The anterior fetal shoulder may become impacted behind the maternal pubic symphysis. Rarely, the posterior fetal shoulder may be obstructed on the sacral promontory.

During a 2 year prospective study by Lagerkvist et al., obstetric plexopathies occurred in 2.9 per 1000 births in total and 3.6 per 1000 vaginal births. Of the 114 infants included, 70 were males, and 44 were females (p ~0.015).
