Orbital cellulitis is defined as a serious infection that involves the muscle and fat located within the orbit. It is also sometimes referred to as postseptal cellulitis. Orbital cellulitis does not involve the globe itself. Although orbital cellulitis can occur at any age, it is more common in the pediatric population.The causative organisms of orbital cellulitis are commonly bacterial but can also be polymicrobial, often including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and even fungal or mycobacteria. Orbital cellulitis is primarily diagnosed clinically by objective findings on physical examination combined with presenting signs and symptoms. The most important distinguishing feature of orbital cellulitis is the presence of ophthalmoplegia, the presence of pain with eye movement, and/or proptosis. Orbital cellulitis also typically cause eyelid swelling with or without erythema; however, these findings are also seen in another less serious condition called preseptal cellulitis. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology and presentation of orbital cellulitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of orbital cellulitis
- Recall the causes of orbital cellulitis
- List the treatment and management options available for orbital cellulitis
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of orbital cellulitis and improve outcomes.
