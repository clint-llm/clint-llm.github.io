A variety of conditions can be assessed using brain PET scans:

- Differentiating frontotemporal dementia from Alzheimer's disease (AD)

- Differentiating several neurodegenerative conditions by molecularly phenotyping patients using a combination of radiotracers

- Differentiating tremors related to parkinsonian versus non-parkinsonian syndromes

- Evaluating the severity of disease in neurodegenerative conditions and movement disorders

- Evaluating the seizure onset zone in medically refractory epilepsy

- Diagnosing encephalitis

- Localizing the site of infection such as in the setting of encephalitis

- Evaluating brain tumor prognosis

- Defining the optimal site in preparation of biopsy (e.g., site of maximum tracer uptake)

- Delineating tumor extent for surgery and radiotherapy planning

- Differentiating glioma recurrence from treatment-induced changes, e.g., pseudoprogression, radionecrosis

- Differentiating tumor response from the pseudo-response during antiangiogenic therapy

- Intraoperative navigation for brain tumor resection
