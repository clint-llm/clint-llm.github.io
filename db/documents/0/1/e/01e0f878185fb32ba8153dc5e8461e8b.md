The most common etiology for isthmic spondylolisthesis is instability of unilateral or bilateral pars interarticularis. The pars interarticularis, or pars, is the bony structure which connects the lamina, pedicle, and transverse processes of the vertebral bodies. Importantly, the facet joints of the superior and inferior vertebrae also are connected by the pars. Thus, a defect in this structure would effectively “disconnect” the vertebral body above from the vertebral body below. This disconnection allows the anterior subluxation seen in spondylolisthesis. Many biomechanical studies indicate that the pars is subjected to the greatest force of any structure in the lumbar spine; therefore, it is susceptible to stress fractures which may heal and fracture repeatedly over time. These injuries can induce non-healing fractures or an elongated pars without a defect which likely indicates repeated fracture healing. Pars fractures are believed to be the result of repetitive motion. Thus, risks associated with pars defects include activities associated with repetitive flexion/extension, axial loading, and rotational loading (i.e., golfers, weight lifers, baseball and football players, gymnasts).
