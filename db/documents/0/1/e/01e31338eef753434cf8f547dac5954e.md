The following are some conditions that have overlapping presentations with hamartoma and require evaluation.

- **Hypothalamic-chiasmatic******glioma****

- **Craniopharyngioma:**It is a suprasellar tumor that arises from a remnant of Rathke's pouch. It has bimodal distribution: one mode from 5 to 14 years; and a second peak at 50 to 75 years. Due to the mass effect, it can cause compression of the optic pathway leading to  visual symptoms

- **Rathke's Cleft Cyst:**Usually asymptomatic but can manifest with headache, visual disturbances, and hypopituitarism.

- **Pituitary macroadenoma:**Mass symptoms and increased hormonal side effects, such as nausea, headache, vomiting, gigantism, and visual disturbances

- **Meylolipoma:**Usually presenting as an asymptomatic pulmonary nodule.

- **Pulmonary Chondroma:**Pulmonary chondromas are usually associated with Carney's triad. On CT scan, chondromas appear as smoothly marginated, round, or slightly lobulated, small fat-containing areas. Pulmonary chondromas are common in adolescents or young adults.
