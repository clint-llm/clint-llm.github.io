# Continuing Education Activity

Prochlorperazine is a first-generation antipsychotic. FDA indications include schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and other conditions presenting with symptoms of psychosis, as well as nausea and vomiting (post-chemotherapy, post-radiation therapy, pre- and post-operative setting, and other conditions). Non-FDA Indications include migraine headaches. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of prochlorperazine, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating conditions for which it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of prochlorperazine.
- Identify the indications for initiating therapy with prochlorperazine.
- Review the potential adverse event profile of prochlorperazine.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who can benefit from therapy with prochlorperazine.

# Indications

**FDA Indications**

- It is for schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and other conditions presenting with symptoms of psychosis. Prochlorperazine can be used to treat both acute psychotic episodes and chronic mental illnesses. As a first-generation antipsychotic, the drug is better at treating positive symptoms than negative ones, including delusions, hallucinations, agitation, and disorganized speech and behavior.

- To treat nausea and vomiting (Post-chemotherapy, post-radiation therapy, pre- and post-operative setting, and other conditions). One review concluded that prochlorperazine was equally as effective as metoclopramide, ondansetron, promethazine, and droperidol in the emergency department (ED). Side effects for all the medications studied were generally mild.

**Non-FDA Indications**

- Migraine

- For adult migraines, the American Headache Society recommended prochlorperazine as well as metoclopramide and sumatriptan as first-line medications in the ED for treating migraines.
- For pediatric migraines, ED physicians often prescribe a combination of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and a dopamine antagonist.

# Mechanism of Action

As a first-generation antipsychotic, prochlorperazine mainly blocks D2 dopamine receptors in the brain. It can also block histaminergic, cholinergic, and noradrenergic receptors.

# Administration

Prochlorperazine administration can be oral, parenteral, intramuscular, and rectal.

Adult dosing by condition and formulation is as follows:

**Oral Formulation (5 or 10 mg tablets)**

- For severe nausea and vomiting (including migraine-associated): 5 to 10 mg orally every 6 to 8 hours; max dose is 40 mg per day. (Note - migraine dosing is off-label.)

- Non-psychotic anxiety: 5 to 10 mg orally every 6 to 8 hours. Max dose is 20 mg daily for 12 weeks.

- Schizophrenia: 5 to 10 mg orally every 6 to 8 hours. The dose may be increased 5 to 10 mg every 2 or 3 days. Max dose 150 mg daily.

**Injectable Formulation (5 mg/ml)**

- Severe nausea and vomiting: 5 to 10 mg IM every 3 to 4 hours; max dose 40 mg daily.

- Migraine-associated nausea and vomiting (off label): 5 to 10 mg IM or IV once.

- Nausea/vomiting - postoperative prophylaxis: 5 to 10 mg IM or IV once. Give IM dose 1 to 2 hours and IV 15 to 30 minutes before induction.

- Schizophrenia: 5 to 10 mg IM daily every 6 to 8 hours. The dose may be increased 5 to 10 mg every 2 or 3 days. Max dose 150 mg daily.

**Rectal (25 mg suppositories)**

- Severe nausea and vomiting: 25 mg rectally every 12 hours.

- Migraine-associated nausea and vomiting (off label): 25 mg rectally every 12 hours as needed.

Clinicians should discontinue the drug if ANC < 1000, and consider discontinuing if the patient exhibits an unexplained drop in WBC count.

# Adverse Effects

As a first-generation antipsychotic, prochlorperazine can cause a variety of adverse effects.

Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, cholestatic jaundice, and fatty liver are other possible but rare side effects. A rare but very severe condition that can result from any antipsychotic use is neuroleptic syndrome. Symptoms occur over 24 to 72 hours and present with elevated vitals, agitation, confusion, severe muscle rigidity, increased white blood cell count, increased creatinine phosphokinase concentrations, abnormal liver function tests, myoglobinuria, and acute renal failure.

Prochlorperazine may also exert negative effects on melanocytes. In one in-vitro study, the presence of the drug correlated with decreased cell viability as well as reduced melanin content and tyrosinase activity.

Prochlorperazine may have significant adverse effects on children. One study from 2009, examining treatment modalities for pediatric nausea and vomiting, noted that side effects of prochlorperazine are high in children; therefore, patients under two years of age should not use it, and patients over two years old should consider alternatives such as ondansetron (5-HT3 receptor antagonist).

# Contraindications

It is important to note that geriatric patients with dementia have a higher risk of death when treated with an antipsychotic, including prochlorperazine.

The following lists contraindications for prochlorperazine

- History of allergy to prochlorperazine or the phenothiazine drug class

- Concomitant use of CNS depressants (opioids, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates) leading to sedation

- Concomitant use of anticholinergic medications (scopolamine, atropine, etc.)

- Pre-existing cardiac conduction abnormalities

- History of seizure/epilepsy (prochlorperazine lowers seizure threshold)

- Narrow-angle glaucoma

- Prostatic hypertrophy

- Past or current history of tardive dyskinesia

- Patients under two years of age

It is not a recommended agent for patients who are pregnant. Antipsychotics are generally not recommended in pregnant patients.

# Monitoring

For patients who take prochlorperazine on a short-term basis, there are no recommendations for monitoring. However, some monitoring parameters are recommended for patients with chronic mental illnesses who take the drug long-term.

The concentration of prochlorperazine in the blood is not typically measured. When performed in cases such as suspected overdose, high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry may be performed. The limit for quantifying the metabolite in the plasma is estimated to be around 0.20 ng/ml.

The cytochrome P450 system metabolizes oral prochlorperazine, so monitoring a patient's full list of medications is essential.

# Toxicity

There are varying treatments available for extrapyramidal symptoms. Parkinsonism is treatable with benztropine or amantadine. Benztropine or diphenhydramine can treat acute dystonia. Akathisia is treatable with beta-blockers, benztropine, or benzodiazepines. Tardive dyskinesia is treatable by switching to atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine. Tetrabenazine is another option. For neuroleptic malignant syndrome, the healthcare provider should immediately discontinue prochlorperazine and give dantrolene (0.8 to 2.5 mg/kg given four times per day; up to 10 mg/day may be provided).

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Prochlorperazine is a medication that can produce numerous side effects and drug-drug interactions. Therefore, close interprofessional coordination amongst clinicians (Mds, DOs, NPs, PAs), nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare providers is necessary to monitor for signs and symptoms related to the above. Working together with team members and the patient is also essential to determine if prochlorperazine is the optimal therapeutic choice and increase medication adherence. As referenced above, prescribers should investigate cytochrome P450 enzyme status. Nurses can provide patient counsel on dosing, potential adverse events to watch for and answer patient questions. Pharmacists can perform medication reconciliation, paying particular attention to CYP450 inducers and inhibitors. This interprofessional team approach will drive better patient outcomes and preclude more serious adverse events. [Level 5]
