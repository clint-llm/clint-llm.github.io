American Indians and Alaska Natives, also known as Native Americans and Indigenous Americans, represent 574 federally recognized Indian Nations, also called First Nations and sometimes referred to as tribes. Each Nation is unique with its own history, culture, and spiritual and traditional practices.

It is important to address the barriers to adequate health and social care that have led to lower life expectancy rates and devasting disparities in health and health care delivery. This article will use a framework of structural competency to identify root causes of health disparities and discuss potential opportunities for targeted interventions to effectively and appropriately evaluate and treat AIAN patients.
