Complications related to saphenous nerve block may include pain on injection, infection at injection site, bleeding, nerve injury, allergic reaction, and local anesthetic systemic toxicity. There is some controversy as toÂ whether or not adductor canal blocks may result in quadriceps muscle weakness as a result of secondary blockade of the vastus medialis nerve.

Complications must be recognized and treated early to avoid long-term morbidity. Patients with suspected systemic toxicity should immediately receive intravenous lipid emulsion (Intralipid) therapy. The dose is 20% lipid emulsion as a 1.5 mL/kg bolus over 2 to 3 minutes, followed by a 0.25 mL/kg/min infusion. Consider consulting your poison control center for guidance.
