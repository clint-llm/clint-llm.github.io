HLHS presents in a familial pattern and is frequently picked up during screening for congenital bicuspid aortic valve through the use of echocardiography.

The extent of malformations do not stay in the left heart; there are reports of associated conotruncal abnormalities as well as thoracic aortic aneurysms in probands with congenital left heart disease. A screening study in 2015 found an over 20% incidence of other congenital malformations such as bicuspid aortic valve and coarctation of the aorta in relatives of patients with HLHS. Occasionally the condition does occur with Turner syndrome, which is itself associated with bicuspid aortic valve and coarctation of the aorta. Additionally, it can be associated with dextrocardia, mesocardia, and there have also been reports of association with DiGeorge syndrome and chromosome 22-q11 deletion.
