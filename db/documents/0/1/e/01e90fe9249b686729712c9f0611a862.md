Limited information is available about toxicity in human patients treated with vericiguat. In the clinical trial, doses up to 10 mg have been investigated. In a study of patients with HFpEF, multiple doses of vericiguat 15 mg were investigated without toxicity. However, in the event of an overdose, hypotension may occur. There is no specific antidote for vericiguat toxicity. Symptomatic treatment should be provided. Vericiguat is not removed by hemodialysis due to the high plasma protein binding(98%).
