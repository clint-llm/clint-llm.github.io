Flaps may be classified in several ways, depending upon blood supply, tissue type, and distance of the harvest site from the tissue defect. Each of these schemes has its own set of anatomical and physiological implications.

When classified according to blood supply, flaps are generally divided into "random" and "axial" categories. So-called "axial" flaps are flaps in which the blood supply is based upon a named artery that courses longitudinally within the flap; venous drainage occurs primarily through the veins that correspond to the named artery. To improve survivability, an axial flap will typically include tissue from a single angiosome only, which is a region of tissue supplied predominantly by a single named blood vessel. In some cases, a flap may include tissue from more than one angiosome despite having only one named artery within the vascular pedicle (the base of the flap that contains the arterial supply and venous drainage). In these cases, the reliability of the flap may be questionable unless the flap is delayed prior to inset. Delaying a flap is the practice of elevating it by incising around it and lifting it away from the surrounding tissue, but then replacing it into its native position rather than transferring it into a defect.

This approach permits choke vessels between angiosomes to open, thereby improving the blood flow throughout the flap before stressing its vascular supply by twisting and stretching the pedicle, which frequently happens when the flap is inset into ta defect. The classic example of a flap that includes multiple angiosomes is the deltopectoral flap, which is based upon intercostal perforating arteries branching off the internal mammary artery.

Flaps may also be described according to tissue type involved, with the tissue types incorporated in the flap typically corresponding to the tissue types missing from the defect, following Sir Harold Delf Gillies' injunction to "replace like with like." Most smaller flaps will be of the cutaneous variety, but mucosal, bony, muscle, and fascia-only flaps are also common. Larger defects often require "composite" reconstruction (multiple tissue types together), potentially including fasciocutaneous, myocutaneous, and osteocutaneous flap transfers. Classic examples of composite tissue transfer include the radial forearm free flap, the pectoralis major flap, and the fibula free flap, respectively. Human composite tissue allograft transfer, such as hand or face transplant, also falls into this category.

Perhaps most practically, flaps are often categorized by the distance between the donor site and the tissue defect. Flaps harvested from distant sites removed entirely from the body, inset into their defects, and then have their vascular supplies reconstituted via microsurgery are referred to as "free" or "microvascular" flaps. These are frequently composite flaps with more than one tissue type, and they are always axial in design. Common examples include the anterolateral thigh flap, the iliac crest flap, and the gracilis flap. When flaps are harvested from the same region as the defect, such as the same limb or elsewhere in the head and neck, but the donor site does not directly border the defect, and the flap does not need to be entirely removed from the body, the flaps are known as "regional." Regional flaps are also generally axial in design but may or may not contain composite tissue.

Classic examples include the paramedian forehead flap, the temporoparietal fascia flap, and the gracilis flap. It is worth mentioning that several flaps, particularly muscular flaps like the trapezius and latissimus dorsi flaps, can be transferred as either free flaps or as regional flaps, depending upon the configuration and location of the defect relative to the flap harvest site. While free flaps tend to be employed for the closure of larger defects (approximately 30 cm^2 or greater), regional flaps may cover large or small defects.

Lastly, a local flap is a flap whose donor site lies immediately adjacent to the tissue defect and therefore becomes a part of the defect during closure. For this reason, an additional consideration when transferring local flaps is the anticipated configuration of the final scar and the optimal means of hiding it in aesthetic subunit boundaries, such as the nasolabial fold or the hairline, or aligning it within relaxed skin tension lines or wrinkles. Local flaps generally rely on random pattern blood supplies, and they tend to be employed for smaller defects; they most often contain cutaneous or mucosal tissue only. These flaps are further categorized based on the type of movement the flap in question must undergo to close the defect. The four types of movement are advancement, rotation, transposition (in which the flap and other normal tissue adjacent to the defect trade places), and interpolation (in which the flap traverses either over or under normal tissue to reach the defect). In practice, interpolation is more frequently used in regional flaps than in local flaps, and rotation is commonly employed along with rotation to effect the closure of many defects.
