The World Health Organization and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics developed the following staging system for choriocarcinoma:

- Stage I: Disease confined to the uterus

- Stage II: Disease extending beyond the uterus, but confined to genital structures

- Stage III: Disease extending to the lungs

- Stage IV: Disease invading other metastatic sites

**Criteria**

Furthermore, the patients are then stratified into low- and high-risk groups to determine treatment based on the following criteria:

**Age**

- 0: Younger than 39 years old

- 1: Greater than 39 years old

**Antecedent Pregnancy**

- 0: Mole

- 1: Abortion

- 2: Term

**Pregnancy Event to Treatment Interval**

- 0: Less than 4 months

- 1: 4 to 6 months

- 2: 7 to 12 months

- 4: Greater than 1 year

**Pretreatment** **hCG**(mIU/ml)

- 0: Less than 10^3

- 1: 10^3 to 10^4

- 2: 10^4 to 10^5

- 4: Greater than 10^5

**Largest Tumor Mass**

- 0: Less than 3 cm

- 1: 3 to 4 cm

- 2: Greater than 5 cm

**Site of Metastases**

- 0: None

- 1: Spleen, kidney

- 2: GI tract

- 4: Brain, liver

**Number of Metastases**

- 0: None

- 1: 1 to 4

- 2: 5 to 8

- 4: Greater than 8

**Previous Failed Chemotherapy**

- 0: None

- 2: Single-drug

- 4: Greater than 2 drugs

**Cumulative Score**

- Low-risk: Less than 7

- High-risk: Greater than 7
