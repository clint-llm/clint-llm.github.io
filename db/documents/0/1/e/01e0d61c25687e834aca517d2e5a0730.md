Left ventricular (LV) rupture is a catastrophic but a common occurrence with acute myocardial infarction patients. The incidence of LV free-wall rupture post-acute myocardial infarction is less than 1%, but mortality is extremely high without prompt surgical intervention. It can also occur in trauma, infections, and malignancies. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of rupture and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of left ventricular rupture emergencies.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of left ventricular rupture.
- Outline the management options available for left ventricular rupture.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team collaboration and communication to improve patient outcomes in patients with left ventricular rupture.
