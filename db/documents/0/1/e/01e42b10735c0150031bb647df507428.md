**Malignant Hyperthermia:Â **This is a unique and life-threatening myopathy that can occur in genetically susceptive individuals following exposure to triggering factors, usually halogenated anesthetic gases like halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane.

Patients with dystrophinopathies produce rhabdomyolysis if exposed to those agents, and many scholars consider it reasonable to utilize non-triggering agents exclusively. Malignant hyperthermia happens because of the irregular calcium control correlated with dytrohpinopathies.

Dysregulated calcium release of the sarcoplasmic reticulum mixed with anesthetic-induced interference of calcium reuptake ends in constant muscle contraction, prolonged aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, driving up carbon dioxide production, elevated end-tidal carbon dioxide, and tachycardia in these individuals who are unable to raise their alveolar minute volume properly. This hypermetabolism generates an exponentially dangerous amount of heat. So much so that the amount of heat appearing overwhelms the body's capacity to dissipate this heat.
