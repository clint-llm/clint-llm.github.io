Adrenal hypoplasia is a condition in which there is underdevelopment or hypotrophy of the adrenal cortex due to several clinical conditions. It can divide into two categories: primary adrenal hypoplasia and secondary adrenal hypoplasia. Primary adrenal hypoplasia is caused by the adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) orÂ intrinsic defect during adrenal gland development. Adrenal hypoplasia congenita involves hypofunctional and hypertrophic adrenal glands, which are caused by defects during differentiation of the fetal adrenal glands. It occurs in many forms. Secondary adrenal hypoplasia results from pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction. These conditions cause a decreased synthesis and secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), leading to inadequate adrenal development and adrenal dysfunction because of the reduced adrenal stimulus.
