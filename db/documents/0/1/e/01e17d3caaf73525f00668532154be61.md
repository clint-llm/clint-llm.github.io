Autoimmune encephalitis refers to acute to subacute, progressive inflammation of the brain associated with antibodies against neuronal cell surface and synaptic protein, most commonly being anti - NMDA receptor encephalitis. It is frequently associated with underlying malignancy and needs appropriate screening. This condition is usually treatment responsive with immunotherapy and has better outcomes if initiated early in the clinical course. This activity outlines the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of autoimmune encephalitis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of autoimmune encephalitis.
- Explain the pathophysiology of autoimmune encephalitis.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with autoimmune encephalitis.
- Summarize the management considerations for patients with autoimmune encephalitis.
