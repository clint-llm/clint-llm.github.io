Sensory neurons are classified based on axon diameter, cell body size, axonal conduction velocities, and degree of myelination.

There are two major types of mammalian skin; glabrous (non-hairy) and hairy skin. Glabrous skin is specific for discriminative touch and is present in the hands and feet. This skin gives proper grip control and can determine texture and shape. Hairy skin covers the other 90% of our body and is closely related to both pleasurable sensations, like stroking, and pain, such as hair pulling.
