In utero, stem cells from the neuroectoderm migrate to the skin as melanoblasts, which later on differentiate into melanocytes. Mutations arising in these cells can lead to mosaicisms. When these mutations take place early on in the embryogenesis, multipotent progenitor cells can be affected, leading to the presence of multiple CMN and extracutaneous involvement. The same mutations have been found to be present in different lesions of a single patient.
