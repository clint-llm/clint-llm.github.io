Heinz body formation, precipitation, and resulting cellular membrane damage is an etiology of hemolytic anemia. In addition, Heinz body hemolytic anemia may be associated with exposure to toxins such as propylene glycol, brassica species, and henna

Cases of Heinz body hemolytic anemia may also result from genetic defects in the molecular milieu that acts to protect erythrocytes from oxidative damage. Heinz bodies may be present in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and those with methemoglobinemia.

Erythrocyte oxidative damage with resulting Heinz body formation can occur in various clinical conditions, especially in patients experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis.

The presence of Heinz bodies can ultimately result in hemolytic anemia, and the ability to recognize signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia is the best way to maximize patient-centered care. Although hemolytic anemia is often diagnosed through laboratory assessment, it is crucial to recognize classic signs of anemia: fatigue, dyspnea, pallor, jaundice, and organomegaly. Being well-versed in identifying these clinical presentations maximizes patient safety and quality of care.

There is no treatment for oxidation-induced erythrocyte damage beyond the removal of the offending agent and supportive care. If chronic hemolysis is present, bilirubin gallstones and iron overload may be present; splenectomy is the treatment of choice for some causes of hemolytic anemia.
