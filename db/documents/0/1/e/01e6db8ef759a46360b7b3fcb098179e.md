It is important to differentiate acanthocytes from echinocytes, which have smaller and more uniform projections and present in patients with end-stage renal disease, liver disease, pyruvate kinase deficiency, etc. The spiculated appearance of RBCs can also result from an ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) artifact after a delay of more than 6 hours between storage and smear preparation. Therefore for accuracy, it is crucial to ensure that the peripheral blood smear is fresh when read. Spiculated RBCs from EDTA artifact have more uniformly distributed spicules and affect almost all of the RBCs in the film.

In addition, the detection of spiculated red blood cells and hemolysis during the neonatal period shall raise the possibility of a hereditary disorder such as infantile pyknocytosis berfore considering an acquired causes of acanthocytosis.
