**Etiology/Pathophysiology**

Several studies have implicated environmental factors in the malformation of the central nervous system of an embryo. These include folate deficiency, illicit drug use, and prescribe medications that affect folate metabolism in the body.

**Cellular/Biochemical/Molecular Mechanism**

**The PI3K-AKT3-TSC2-mTOR Pathway**

Both genetic and molecular factors may disrupt the normal development of the cerebral cortex. Any form of alteration in the genes that control growth and metabolic pathways leads to cortical development malformation. Generally, the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been strongly recognized in these malformations. The inhibition of TSC or activation of PIK3CA or AKT3 hyperactivates the mTOR pathway leads to dysregulated cell growth.

The majority of neural tube defects are sporadic. Genetic factors remain strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of NTDs, and the usual form of inheritance is multifactorial or polygenic. Maternal folate deficiency may contribute to NTD development in genetically susceptible individuals. Studies have shown that mutations in the genes involved in mitochondrial folate metabolism increase the risk. The 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and its variant form (C677T genotype) (MTHFR C677T) is associated with the risk for NTDs.
