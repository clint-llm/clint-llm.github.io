Following a detailed history and physical exam, patients who present with signs and symptoms of preeclampsia should undergo timely diagnostic testing. This includes pregnancy-induced hypertension laboratory testing, consisting of a urinalysis to evaluate the presence of proteinuria (either with a urine dipstick result of 2+ or greater if other methods are not readily available, a 24-hour urine collection sample significant for 300mg or greater, or a urine protein to creatinine ratio significant for 0.3 or greater), complete blood count to evaluation for thrombocytopenia (defined as a platelet count of less than 100 K/mm), a complete metabolic panel to assess for impaired liver function (with liver enzymes greater than two times the upper limit of normal), and renal insufficiency (defined as a serum concentration of 1.1 mg/dL or greater, or levels two times greater than baseline). All abnormal laboratory findings must exclude any preexisting aberrations or secondary causes for abnormalities in order to be significant for diagnosis.

Although elevated blood pressure with companying proteinuria is typically thought to be required for the diagnosis of preeclampsia, it may not be present in every case. In such cases, where the absence of proteinuria and new-onset hypertension is discovered, other new-onset symptoms such as thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, pulmonary edema, impaired liver function, or new-onset headache with or without visual disturbance may be used for diagnosis. This typically is referred to as preeclampsia without severe features, including new-onset severe range blood pressures (systolic pressure of 160 mmHg or greater, diastolic pressure of 110 mmHg or greater on two readings at least 4 hours apart), without the findings previously mentioned.
