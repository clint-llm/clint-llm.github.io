In his initial paper, Georges Gilles de la Tourette reported that the condition aggregated in families. Since then, researchers have learned that children with GTS have a family history 52% of the time. They have a first-degree relative with GTS at a rate 10 times the general population, and the ratio of concordance in monozygotic twins is 5:1 compared to dizygotic twins. Tourette syndrome has demonstrated to be one of the most heritable, non-Mendelian, neuropsychiatric disorders. However, multiple large studies have yet to identify a causal gene. GTS appears to be highly polygenic with environmental factors affecting ideographic phenotype. There have been some replicated studies identifying gene abnormalities that lead to disruption of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits. Mounting evidence also points to significant environmental contributors such as infection, autoimmunity, or perinatal injury.
