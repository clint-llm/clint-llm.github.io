Contrecoup injuries classically occur when the moving head (brain) strikes a stationary object; whereas, a coup injury is associated with a moving object impacting a stationary head. Classic evidence of both coup and contrecoup injury is an intracerebral hemorrhage or contusion in a focal area noted on computed tomographic (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Contrecoup lesions arise from forces within the intracranial cavity, which are not directly related to the site of the focal blow but instead is related to stress on the brain and its structure caused by the force of the blow on an already moving head. After the head receives an impact, the floating brain rebounds in the opposite direction.

There are four theories for the development of contrecoup injury.

The difference in the density of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been implicated as another mechanism for contrecoup injury.
