Desvenlafaxine is an antidepressant medication that belongs to a category of drugs that inhibits the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, known as SNRIs. Desvenlafaxine is the primary active metabolite of venlafaxine. Therefore, the two agents are structurally similar in that they both contain two chemical rings that are not next to each other.

**Metabolism**

The half-life of desvenlafaxine is 11 hours, and it metabolizes through the liver with a small amount broken down via the cytochrome P450 system. Since CYP enzymes are not significantly involved in its metabolism, there is not as large of a concern for drug-drug interaction as compared to its counterparts. Renal excretion is a major route of desvenlafaxine elimination. Nearly 45% of the medication is unchanged when eliminated in the urine. It is important to consider treating with a lower dose when dealing with patients who have moderate to severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease.
