Adult patients using calcium carbonate as a supplemental therapy should have their serum phosphate and calcium levels periodically monitored to prevent adverse reactions and electrolyte imbalances. If patients continually return to using calcium carbonate, their symptoms require investigation to determine the root cause. Importantly, any patients using calcium carbonate for any reason should never be prescribed ceftriaxone to prevent end-organ failure.

Administration of calcium carbonate should be separated from the administration of all medications that have drug interactions mentioned above, apart from vitamin D. Patients with hyperphosphatemia should have their serum calcium routinely monitored to prevent hypercalcemia and other sequelae, including myocardial infarction, vascular calcification, and death.

Pediatric and elderly patients should be routinely monitored if using calcium carbonate and advised against long-term use.
