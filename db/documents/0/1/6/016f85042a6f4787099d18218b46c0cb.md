Parent and caregiver education must include positive reinforcement techniques, including praising the child when they do not suck their thumb. Parents can try to find alternative ways that are soothing and comforting for children, give reminders for thumb sucking, and involve older kids or family members in ways they can support the affected child to stop sucking their thumb.
