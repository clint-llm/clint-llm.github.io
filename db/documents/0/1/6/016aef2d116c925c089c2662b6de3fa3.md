Carukia
barnesi is a small jellyfish (cnidarian) with an approximate 2 cm diameter and 4 tentacles.Carybdeida, including but not limited to Alatina mordens, Malo maxima, Carybdea alata, Carybdea xaymacana, and Carybdea rastonii.

Although C. barnesi and its related species are of the same class as the cubozoan Chironex fleckeri, commonly known as “the box jellyfish” or “the sea wasp,” one should not confuse these different groups of species, as they cause very different clinical syndromes with highly differing prognoses.
