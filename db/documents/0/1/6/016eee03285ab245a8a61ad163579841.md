The role of CPB could thus be summarized as follows:

- Empty the heart. Drain all the blood out (achieved via venous cannulas).

- Oxygenate the blood. Thus stop the lungs via oxygenators.

- Adjust its chemical and electrolyte contents via a reservoir container.

- Adjust its temperature via the heat exchanger machine.****

- Return it to the patient via arterial cannulas**.**

Also, provide means to ensure the following:

- Save blood lost during surgery and return it to the patient via cardiotomy suckers.

- Prevent distention of the heart during surgery via cardiac vents.

- Deliver cardioplegia and provide myocardial protection (discussed separately).

- Provide safety nets and standby pathways (safety adjuncts). This is all achieved via a closed circuit driven by pumps and connected by tubes.
