Patients should be counseled on the behavioral and lifestyle factors likely resulting in insufficient sleep. The fundamental physiological processes involved in sleep, including circadian rhythm and the homeostatic build-up of sleep pressure, should be explained to patients during the clinic visit. This information can provide patients insight into theÂ need for adequate quality and duration of sleep. Educational handouts about good sleep habits may be provided in the clinic or electronically. These educational measures may help patients prevent and treat insufficient sleep syndrome.

Insufficient sleep is common in school-aged children, and counseling at an early age may assist the patients and their families in establishing good sleep habits.
