Due to the excellent safety profile of rifaximin, there are very few contraindications.

- Patients with hypersensitivity to the rifaximin, rifamycins, or excipients should avoid this medication as hypersensitivity reactions like exfoliative dermatitis, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylaxis have been reported.

- Concomitant administration of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors such as cyclosporine with rifaximin can substantially augment the systemic exposure to rifaximin and can lead to toxicity.

- Severe Hepatic Impairment: There is increased systemic exposure to rifaximin in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The clinical trials were conducted only on patients with MELD scores <25. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering rifaximin in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).
