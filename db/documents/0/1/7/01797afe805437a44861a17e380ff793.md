Patients on fenofibrate should undergo monitoring for the effectiveness of treating a medical condition and any adverse effects pertaining to the medication. A complete list of patient medications should be reviewed before initiating drug therapy. The clinician should discontinue treatment if an inadequate response is not seen within two to three months of beginning the fenofibrate therapy. Kidney function labs such as uric acid (UA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatine clearance (CrCl) should have regular monitoring in individuals with renal impairment, and dosing should be adjusted as needed. The hepatic function is crucial to monitor to avoid administering the medication to individuals with an active hepatic disorder or persistently elevated serum transaminases.
