Cancer-associated thrombosis increases mortality in cancer patients. In a review of 8 million Medicare patients admitted for VTE, the probability of death within six months of admission for cancer patients was 94% compared to 29% with non-cancer patients.

The majority of deaths in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis were related to arterial thrombosis (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke) rather than VTE. In a review of 4466 ambulatory patients, thromboembolic disease accounted for 9.2% of deaths. 5.6% were related to arterial thrombosis.
