Clindamycin prevents peptide bond formation, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis by reversibly binding to 50S ribosomal subunits. Depending on the organism, infection site, and drug concentration, clindamycin may be a bacteriostatic or bactericidal antibiotic. When taken orally, absorption cannot occur until clindamycin palmitate becomes hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It then distributes across the body in tissue and other regions containing blood. Clindamycin cannot efficiently penetrate meninges very well and is therefore not an antibiotic of choice for infections of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). As it travels through the bloodstream, clindamycin is primarily bound to protein. Clindamycin is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP 3A4 (major) and CYP 3A5, which oxidizes the antibiotic into clindamycin sulfoxide (primary metabolite) and N-desmethyl clindamycin, respectively. When administered orally, the antibiotic peaks within 60 minutes. When given intramuscularly (IM), the drug achieves peak concentrations in 1 to 3 hours. The half-life of clindamycin is approximately 3 hours in adults and approximately 2.5 hours in children. At this point, it is excreted in the urine (major) and feces (minor) as active and inactive metabolites.
