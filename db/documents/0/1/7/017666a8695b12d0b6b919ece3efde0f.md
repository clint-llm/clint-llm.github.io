Patients can present with pubic symphysis diastasis before delivery, during delivery, or most commonly postpartum. The postpartum presentation is most common, and presentation can encounter delay as spinal epidural anesthesia administered during the birthing process can mask the symptoms. The typical presentation involving pubic symphysis diastasis following pregnancy is unrelenting pain in the anterior pelvis and suprapubic region, with or without pain localized over the sacroiliac joints from associated posterior pelvic ring ligamentous injury. Pain from the anterior pelvis can radiate and manifest in the hip joints and radiate down the legs. Patients will often have extreme difficulty with weight-bearing and can retain urine often requiring the use of an indwelling Foley catheter.

Patients will have difficulty with both active and passive straight leg raise and changes in bed positioning. On physical examination, patients will often present in distress secondary to pain, pain with palpation or attempted manipulation of the pelvic girdle, and pain with attempted weight-bearing or ambulation. The literature describes soft tissue edema or hematoma on the pubis and perineum,
