# Continuing Education Activity

Nivolumab is a medication used to manage and treat metastatic melanoma and several other tumors. It is a monoclonal antibody that targets the anti-PD1 receptor, an immune checkpoint. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, and administration for nivolumab to manage advanced cancers. This activity will also highlight the dosing, monitoring, and adverse event profile, factor of paramount importance for the multidisciplinary healthcare team in treating patients with metastatic melanoma and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of nivolumab in the immune-checkpoint blockade.
- Outline the indications for oncologic therapy with nivolumab. 
- Identify the most common adverse events associated with nivolumab therapy.
- Summarize some interprofessional team strategies that can be employed to ensure optimal outcomes for patients who can benefit from medication therapy using nivolumab.

# Indications

Nivolumab is an oncologic drug that belongs to the immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) class. Depending on the indication, it can be given as a single agent or in combination with ipilimumab (anti-CTL4 immune checkpoint inhibitor). Nivolumab is currently FDA-approved for the treatment of:

- As an adjuvant therapy in lymph node involvement or metastatic disease after complete resection.

- 
**Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)**

- 
              
- Metastatic, with progression during or after platinum-based chemotherapy (and after progression under targeted therapies for EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations in case these aberrations are present).
              
              
- As first-line therapy combined with ipilimumab in metastatic or recurrent NSCLC with a PD-L1 expression equal or higher to 1% with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.

# Mechanism of Action

Nivolumab is a fully human, monoclonal IgG4 antibody which binds to programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor with high specificity and affinity. PD-1 is expressed on T cells and dampens their immune response upon binding ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 on APCs. This mechanism is pivotal to regulating central and peripheral tolerance.

However, in cancer, aberrant PD-L1 expression by tumor cells or immune cells in the tumor microenvironment deactivate PD-1 expressing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, thereby allowing tumor cells to escape immune recognition and elimination.

# Administration

Nivolumab is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. The most common dosing regimens are 240 mg every two weeks or 480 mg every four weeks. Dosing depends on the indication. Nivolumab can be diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution or in 50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection. Regardless of the diluent used, immediate use after solution preparation is advised. Nivolumab may be given as a combination therapy with Ipilimumab for unresectable or metastatic melanoma, advanced RCC, and metastatic CRC (MSI-H or dMMR).

When given in combination, nivolumab must precede the Ipilimumab infusion, and separate infusion bags must be used. In general, nivolumab should not be mixed with or given on the same intravenous line as another drug. Until its administration, nivolumab should be stored under refrigeration at 2 to 8 degrees C (36 F to 46 F), protected from light (in its original packaging). It should not be frozen nor shaken.

# Adverse Effects

There are reports of severe infusion reactions to Nivolumab. These are, however, uncommon. In the case of an infusion reaction, therapy must be immediately stopped and symptom-oriented care provided.

Some of the adverse effects are transitory and manageable. However, others are life-threatening and require aggressive immunosuppressive therapy and the permanent cessation of the drug.

Immune-mediated pneumonitis is a rare adverse effect associated with severe manifestations.

There have been reports that the occurrence of irAEs in patients receiving ICIs correlates with a better outcome.

The therapy of choice for severe and life-threatening irAEs consists of systemic corticosteroids. Prednisolone is given 1 to 2 mg/kg or intravenously, if necessary, along with prophylaxis for gastric ulcers and osteoporosis.

# Contraindications

There are no contraindications for therapy with nivolumab. It is important to note that some important settings have not been addressed in clinical studies, such as drug interaction, use in pregnancy, and breastfeeding.

Contraception for at least five months after the last dose of nivolumab is strongly advised. Breastfeeding concomitantly to receiving nivolumab therapy is discouraged as antibodies might be passed onto the breast milk. Studies evaluating the fertility of patients receiving nivolumab have not yet been published. It remains unknown whether nivolumab affects either female or male fertility. Patients should be thoroughly informed on this matter, and reproductive counseling should be offered to patients in reproductive age groups. Although preexisting conditions of autoimmune or inflammatory nature are not a contraindication for nivolumab therapy, it has been reported that such patients have increased rates of immunosuppressive therapy and hospitalization after ICIs treatment.

# Monitoring

Work-up before nivolumab therapy consists of extensive clinical history and physical examination. This includes a thorough baseline clinical assessment of all organ systems. Of particular relevance are a complete dermatologic assessment as well as assessing gastrointestinal habits and complaints. A recent imaging study to monitor therapy efficacy is necessary before treatment. Acute and subclinical infections should be ruled out via serologic tests (M. tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C Virus, human-immunodeficiency virus, Cytomegalovirus). Laboratory tests required before and during nivolumab therapy include complete blood counts with differential, and clinical chemistry, including liver function tests and an endocrine panel.

Monitoring cardiac markers such as troponin I or T is relevant as it can be the only alteration in asymptomatic patients with myocarditis, which carries a high lethality.

# Toxicity

An overdose with nivolumab is unlikely and has not been described in the clinical trials. There is no specific treatment for the overdose of nivolumab. It is, therefore, of paramount importance to ensure proper dosage and administration intervals of this drug. In case of an overdose, the patient should be placed under strict monitoring, and immediate symptomatic treatment should be provided as soon as signs of adverse reactions occur.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

The logistics of advanced cancer therapies are complex. There are multiple players within the health care system, and every one of them has a decisive role in the course of treatment with nivolumab. The prescription of nivolumab results from interdisciplinary interaction between clinical oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, radiation oncologists, and interprofessional tumor boards. Finally, appropriate communication with the general physician must be warranted, especially if there should be a need to treat mild complications. Proper documentation (i.e., medical history, clinical inspection, complimentary test, informed consent) is vital for a reliable interaction between multiple health care professionals in the long run. Drug preparation and coordination of transport according to schedule, appropriate labeling, and dosage are essential safety tasks the pharmacy team performs. Nurses and physician assistants administer the intravenous infusion and monitor the patient and are experts in identifying slight clinical deterioration signs.

For patients receiving nivolumab or other ICIs, the periodical treatment appointments to the oncologic center become embedded in their life routine. Therefore, an oncologic center delivering nivolumab should ensure a safe, comfortable, and hygienic environment. The physicians and nurses inform and train the patient to recognize symptoms that could hide developing side effects. It is good to provide the patient with an identification card listing the drug, underlying condition, and contact numbers of the treating physicians. A good relationship between the patient and the healthcare team fosters patient compliance. Showing up to appointments promptly and according to schedule ensures safe and effective drug concentrations. Patients undergoing nivolumab treatment may profit from psychological support and nutritional counseling regardless of the tumor entity.
