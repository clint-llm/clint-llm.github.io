All healthcare professionals, including clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists whose patients use insulin aspart should be familiar with its indications and adverse effects. Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting, human insulin analog that is FDA approved for the treatment of type-1 and type-2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycemic control in adults and children. Insulin aspart may also be used to treat diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), though this is not an FDA-approved indication. Insulin aspart should be used in addition to a long-acting (basal) insulin for complete therapy unless used in a continuous subcutaneous (insulin pump) or intravenous insulin infusion. All interprofessional healthcare team members need to educate the patient regarding proper dosing and usage of insulin aspart and engage in open communication regarding any potential dosing adjustments to prevent possible hypoglycemia.

Rapid-acting insulin products target controlling post-prandial blood glucose concentrations, or reducing blood glucose in response to an elevated blood glucose measurement, as in a correctional scale. It is crucial for healthcare professionals to monitor glucose concentrations closely when administering insulin aspart as it can induce hypoglycemia. Thus, it is always important to have some type of glucose-containing fluid or a meal ready in case hypoglycemia develops.
