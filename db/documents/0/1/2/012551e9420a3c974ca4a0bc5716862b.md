Chimeric antigen receptors usually consist of an extracellular domain that binds to a specific antigen on tumor cells, a transmembrane domain and intracellular domains that provide signals for T-cell activation to attack tumor cells. Tisagenlecleucel is a cluster of differentiation (CD) 19-directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy which involves reprogramming a patient’s own T-cells with a transgene encoding a CAR to identify and eliminate CD19-expressing cells, both malignant and normal. The CAR is made up of a murine single-chain antibody fragment; this recognizes CD19 and fuses to intracellular signaling domains from 4-1BB (CD137) and CD3 zeta. The CD3 zeta component is critical for initiating T-cell activation and anti-tumor activity, while 4-1BB enhances the expansion and persistence of tisagenlecleucel. Upon binding to CD19-expressing cells, the CAR transmits a signal to promote T-cell expansion, activation, target cell elimination, and persistence of the tisagenlecleucel cells. Axicabtagene ciloleucel is another CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy which binds to CD19-expressing cancer cells and normal B cells. Following anti-CD19 CAR T-cell engagement with CD19-expressing target cells, the CD28 and CD3-zeta co-stimulatory domains activate downstream signaling cascades that lead to T-cell activation, proliferation, acquisition of effector functions and secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This sequence of events leads to the killing of CD19-expressing cells.

Besides the two approved medications targeting CD19 on B lymphocytic cells treating B-cell malignancies, multiple tumor-associated antigens have been under investigation in targeting various types of cancer, especially in solid tumors. The following is a summary of reported tumor-associated antigens from a recent review, listing first the target and then the associated tumor(s)

- Variant III of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII) - glioblastoma

- Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2) - ovarian cancer, breast cancer, glioblastoma, colon cancer, osteosarcoma, and medulloblastoma

- Mesothelin - mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma

- Prostate-specific membrane antigen(PSMA) - prostate cancer;

- Carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA) - pancreatic adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, and colorectal carcinoma

- Disialoganglioside 2(GD2) - neuroblastoma and melanoma;

- Interleukin-13Ra2 - glioma

- Glypican-3 - hepatocellular carcinoma

- Carbonic anhydrase IX(CAIX) - renal cell carcinoma
