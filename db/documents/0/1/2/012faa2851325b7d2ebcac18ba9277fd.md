Most patients are asymptomatic until the pseudoaneurysm ruptures. Often, patients have nonspecific symptoms before a bleed. A high index of suspicion is necessary especially in patients with backgrounds of pancreatitis, alcoholism, or pancreaticobiliary surgery. When a patient experiences recurrent hematemesis or hematochezia, a pancreatic pseudoaneurysm should be ruled out. When a patient complains of a sudden increase in abdominal pain associated with falling hematocrit or becoming hemodynamically unstable postoperatively following pancreaticobiliary surgery, bleeding pseudoaneurysm should be ruled out.

At times the earliest warning postoperatively is minimal intermittent bleeding from an abdominal drain placed intraoperatively, before a catastrophic bleed. This initial bleed is known as sentinel bleed. A patient who is documented to have a pseudocyst, when there is a rapid enlargement of the cyst with the appearance of a pulsatile mass, strongly suggests a bleeding pseudoaneurysm. Apart from all the signs mentioned above the patient will present with obvious physical evidence of significant blood loss such as pallor, tachycardia, and hypotension.

A bruit is very rare but may be heard when there is a large pseudoaneurysm.
