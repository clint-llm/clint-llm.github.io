The purpose of the evaluation is to determine other causes of chest pain. There is not a test to diagnose costochondritis.

**Laboratory**

Consider a workup for acute coronary syndrome, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, among others if the patient's history and physical exam warrant this workup.

No laboratory evaluation is necessarily required to diagnose costochondritis. It is important to use the laboratory evaluation to evaluate for other diagnoses that are in your differential.

**Radiology**

A chest x-ray should be considered in all patients with chest wall pain or chest pain to rule out pneumonia, spontaneous pneumothorax, lung mass, among others.

A normal chest x-ray will be seen with costochondritis.

**Other Tests**

An electrocardiogram (ECG) should also be considered in all patients with chest wall pain or chest pain to rule out abnormalities associated with infectious causes of chest pain, ischemia, among others.

A normal electrocardiogram will be seen with costochondritis.
