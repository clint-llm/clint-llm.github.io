Dental infection is the most common cause of cutaneous fistulas of the face.

In the series of Guevara-Gutierrez et al., the authors found that the more frequent locations of odontogenic cutaneous fistula were the mandibular angle (36%), the chin (28%), and the cheeks (24%).

The clinical aspect of the odontogenic cutaneous fistula on the skin varies but most commonly appears as a nodule.

Although rare, in some cases, the origin of the oral cutaneous fistula is not odontogenic. In chronic osteomyelitis with drainage, pain may not be a symptom. An intraoral sinus tract may be raised or appear as a red-to-yellow ulcer that bleeds easily and exudes pus. In some cases of actinomycosis, yellow granules are observable at clinical examination. Signs of salivary gland infections include swelling, pain, and trismus if the parotid gland is involved.
