The anterolateral aspect of the abdominal cavity, which holds multiple vital organs, is surrounded by an abdominal wall. This wall is made up of different layers that serve to protect the organs of the digestive system. These layers, from superficial to deep, include skin, Camper fascia, Scarpa fascia, external oblique muscle, internal oblique muscle, transversus abdominis muscle, transversalis fascia, and parietal peritoneum.

Linea semilunaris, sometimes referred to as the semilunar line or Spigelian line, makes the set of visibly well-developed abdominal muscles (also called as "six-pack") that athletes desire possible. This fibrous, pearly-white connective tissue is a type of aponeurosis that can function as fascia, which envelopes muscles and organs. It also binds the muscles in the anterolateral abdominal wall together.
