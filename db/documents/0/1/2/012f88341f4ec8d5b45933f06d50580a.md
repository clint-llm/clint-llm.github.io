Pars interarticularis defects also referred to as spondylolysis, are a common cause of axial back pain in adolescents, especially young athletes. The pars interarticularis (pars) lies between the superior and inferior articular process bilaterally at each zygapophyseal joint. A pars interarticularis defect is a unilateral or bilateral fracture involving the pars interarticularis of the posterior vertebral arch. This injury occurs almost exclusively in the lower lumbar region, most often at L5. This activity highlights the interprofessional management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review typical presenting symptoms of pars interarticularis defects. 
- Describe the evaluation of pars interarticularis defects. 
- Outline the complications associated with untreated pars interarticularis defects. 
- Describe the need for a well-integrated, interprofessional team approach to improve care for patients with pars interarticularis defects.
