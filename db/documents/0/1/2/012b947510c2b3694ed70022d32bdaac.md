Phthalates have received significant attention due to their ubiquitous nature in industrial products and their potential for toxicity in the human body.

Food groups shown to contain the highest levels of phthalates through measuring urine metabolite levels include beverages, bread, meat, and dairy products.

Issues of concern related to phthalate toxicity have led to legislation banning various phthalates in consumer products. The European Union temporarily banned six phthalates found in childrenâ€™s toys in 1999, which prompted the United States to do the same in 2008 by passing the Consumer Products Safety Improvement Act.

In addition to human toxicity, an abundance of phthalates has been detected in various ecosystems, mainly aquatic environments.

Another issue of concern related to public health includes the replacement of phthalates known to cause harm with other hazardous chemicals that are structurally similar with unknown long-term health effects. An example of this consists of the replacement of DEHP with diisonyl ester (DINCH) and bis(2-Ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHTP) in adhesives, polymers, and packaging products.
