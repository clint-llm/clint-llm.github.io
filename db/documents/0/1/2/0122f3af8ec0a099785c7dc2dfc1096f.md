Coordination among emergency medicine, cardiology, and cardiac surgery is vital in order to follow patients with incidental findings of a thoracic aortic aneurysm. Those patients who do not require surgery urgently should be managed by primary care and cardiology to maintain adequate control of their blood pressure and lipid levels. All these specialties should coordinate as an interprofessional team. Cardiovascular nurses coordinate the care of patients and provide education. Pharmacists review medications, check for interactions, and inform patients about side effects. In cases where patients present with tearing chest pain to the emergency department, physicians should have a high suspicion for aortic dissection or rupture and should notify cardiac surgery immediately. Preliminary misdiagnosis in a health facility is serious, and around 40% hence there should be routine training on early diagnosis and management of the complications of an aortic aneurysm.
