Aside from clinical diagnosis, other diagnostic modalities include imaging studies. Ultrasound is the initial diagnostic study of choice as it is the least invasive. Ultrasound may be performed endoscopically if gastrointestinal venous malformations are suspected. Ultrasound should be performed by a radiologist or ultrasound technician who is experienced in vascular anomalies. Since the radiologist reading the study may not have the clinical history or benefit of seeing the patient in real-time, it is recommended by some sources to send the patient for anÂ ultrasound at the vascular anomalies center. If ultrasound is inconclusive or not possible, then magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with intravenous contrast, arterial and venous phases, and fat suppression is indicated. Other diagnostic modalities include computed tomography (CT), barium studies, and skin biopsy. Technetium Tc-99m-labeled red blood cell imaging may help localize the source and extent of blood loss.

Blue rubber bleb nevi can be examined under dermoscopy with features of superficial, light red arborizing veins, maculae with undefined borders on the palms and soles, and blue-purple nodules with lacunae divided by white linear structures.

Other laboratory studies that may be helpful in evaluation and management include fecal occult blood tests, complete blood counts, iron panels, and urinalysis to screen for hematuria and bladder involvement.
