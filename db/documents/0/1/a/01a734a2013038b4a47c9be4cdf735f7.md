With rapid changes in the ethnic diversities and multicultural and linguistic groups in the population, clinicians need to develop awareness and knowledge about different attitudes and beliefs that can influence their psychological thought processes. In assessing a patient who speaks a different language other than English and may hold beliefs that are different from the mainstream culture, every clinician has to be knowledgeable about the complex processes that facilitate adjustment and conflict resolution among members of that culture. Every cultural group defines what they consider a spectrum of "normal behaviors" within their ethnic or cultural group. They also have various thresholds of tolerance for "abnormal behaviors." Behavior that may be unacceptable in Western society can lead to a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder for a clinician who is raised and trained in the same society. However, the same behavior in other subcultures or ethnic groups can be indicative of a normal adaptive response to a stressful situation. In understanding a patient's cultural identity, the clinician should make a note of the patient's age, gender, race, ethnicity, language, sexual orientation, socioeconomic class, education level, and religious and spiritual beliefs. For immigrants and ethnic minorities, it is crucial to understand the degree of acculturation and capacity to adapt to the host culture.
