- Acute pancreatitis is a response to injury to the pancreas and results in inflammation of the pancreas. Chronic pancreatitis results in chronic changes within the pancreas including a mononuclear infiltrate and fibrosis of the pancreas.

- Abdominal pain is the most common presenting complaint of AP and can occur with nausea and vomiting. Chronic pancreatitis can present with or without abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting. Patients with chronic pancreatitis can present with steatorrhea and weight loss.

- The diagnosis of AP involves two of the following three: abdominal pain characteristic of pancreatitis, lipase greater than two-thirds of the upper limit of normal and imaging findings of acute pancreatitis. In chronic pancreatitis, patients can have a normal lipase and amylase level. Calcifications within the pancreas can point towards chronic pancreatitis.

- Early aggressive intravenous hydration is the cornerstone of therapy for acute pancreatitis. Early enteral feeding can also be encouraged, and antibiotics in the absence of infectious complications should be avoided.

- Complications of AP may be local such as peripancreatic fluid collection, pseudocyst or necrosis. Systemic complications may also occur such as ARDS, AKI, and DIC. Complications of chronic pancreatitis involve pseudocyst formation, diabetes, pseudoaneurysms, splenic vein thrombosis, and recurrent attacks.
