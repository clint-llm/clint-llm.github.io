Surgically managed nPHPT patients generally do well. The newer minimally invasive procedures are less intrusive with shorter operating times and fewer complications. Intraoperative monitoring of serum PTH levels has yielded better outcomes. However, even with experienced surgeons, operative failure or early recurrence does occur, given the difficulty in localizing the smaller adenomas and the higher involvement of multiple parathyroids. Follow-up with serial PTH levels is mandatory as per the guidelines of the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES). A PTH drop of more than 50% from baseline is usually a reliable indicator of surgical success.

Patients with nPHPT undergoing parathyroid surgery tended to have an increased rate of reoperation that was more than double the rate of hypercalcemia hyperparathyroid patients. They also were much more likely to develop permanent hypocalcemia postoperatively (11.4% vs. 1.4%).

For nPHPT patients managed medically, serial monitoring with yearly calcium, PO4, PTH, eGFR, and DEXA scans every 1-2 years is recommended. It is virtually impossible at the present level of understanding to confidently and correctly predict which patient with nPHPT will progress to develop hypercalcemia and hence the need for regular monitoring. High normal serum calcium, high urinary calcium, and advanced age have been shown to favor progression to hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism.
