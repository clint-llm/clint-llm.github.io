Superior oblique myokymia is an uncommon condition that is often misdiagnosed. The patient will present with double vision and a "jumping image." It affects one eye, requires one to take a careful history, and requires close examination. It mostly affects young adults. The movement of the eye tends to be of high frequency and low amplitude.
