It is essential to identify the patients with a high risk of aspiration, and putting them on strict aspiration precautions given inhalation of oropharyngeal contents is the most crucial risk factor for the development of lung abscess. Prompt identification and treatment of aspiration pneumonia are essential as undertreatment and unrecognition lead to lung abscess and its complications. Patients who are bedbound like CVA with hemiplegia, severe Parkinson disease, severe Alzheimer disease, postoperative patients who are at risk for aspiration should be thoroughly monitored. Patients with prolonged hospital stay should get adequate physical therapy to avoid bedbound status, respiratory muscle fatigue, and to prevent the ultimate aspiration of oropharyngeal contents.
