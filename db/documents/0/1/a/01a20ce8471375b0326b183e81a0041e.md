Ankle arthrocentesis requires an interprofessional team effort involving a variety of physician specialties (emergency medicine, hospitalist, orthopedist, etc.) in addition to laboratory personnel and nursing staff. All of these individuals are essential in helping to obtain, maintain, and evaluate the synovial samples to make the appropriate diagnosis. As with any other procedure that violates the skin and/or synovial capsule, the risk of seeding infection is always present, so care should be made to thoroughly evaluate the overlying cutaneous skin for the presence of skin and soft tissue infections. Meticulous records of the procedure and/or administered medications are requisite. The performing physician should work with nursing staff to coordinate obtaining the proper supplies, recording of the steps performed, and transportation of the obtained samples to the laboratory for analysis. Physicians should be cognizant of contraindications that may exist to the administration of some medications commonly used with this procedure (e.g., corticosteroids not routinely recommended for use in patients with uncontrolled diabetes). A system for prompt reporting of critical, abnormal laboratory results by pathology should be in place. Prompt consultation to surgical specialists for any diagnosis necessitating urgent/emergent intervention should be the norm. An interprofessional approach will help obtain the desired outcomes of this procedure.[Level 5]
