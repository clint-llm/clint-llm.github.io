Traumatic injuries of the spleen are either penetrating or blunt. In children with splenic trauma, non-accidental trauma must be a consideration. Preexisting splenomegaly makes the spleen capsule weaker and easy to injure, and the inferior portion of the spleen is more caudal and less protected by the ribs. In the United States, most spleen trauma is due to blunt injury, usually from motor vehicle accidents. Less frequently, spleen trauma is penetrating via a variety of mechanisms, either intentional or accidental. In penetrating trauma, the wound can be very small and still cause significant spleen trauma.
