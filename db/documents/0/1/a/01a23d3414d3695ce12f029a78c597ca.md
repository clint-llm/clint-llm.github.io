Optical aniseikonia generally has an excellent prognosis as most refractive conditions can be treated with surgery or contact lenses. If neither surgery nor contact lenses are an option, then aniseikonic spectacles are also available.

Retinal aniseikonia has a good prognosis in most cases. In the case of retinal edema, central serous chorioretinopathy is generally a self-limited condition that reverses without treatment. Other causes of edema are generally treated successfully with medication or surgery. In the case of macula shrinking, such as can be caused by a staphyloma, there is no medical treatment. While macropsia can be treated with aniseikonic spectacles, the associated barrel distortion can not be treated.

Amblyopia: If aniseikonia has resulted in amblyopia and the patient is under nine years of age, then treatment for amblyopia according to the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group guidelines will significantly improve visual outcomes. If aniseikonia has caused amblyopia and suppression of one eye and the patient is older than nine years, the prognosis is considerably worse.
