The clinical presentation of mycosis fungoides varies with the stage of the disease.

- **Patch stage:**The earliest lesion seen in mycosis fungoides is an erythematous, or brownish scaly patch, which may show slight atrophy. Single or multiple lesions of variable diameters and locations develop, often in covered areas and particularly in the gluteal region and on the proximal thighs. The term sometimes given to them of "plaque parapsoriasis" is a misnomer because the lesions are actually patches. "Small-plaque" parapsoriasis and "large-plaque" parapsoriasis are set apart based on the clinical and histopathological correlation.Small plaque parapsoriasis lesions are 2 to 6 cm in diameter, located on the trunk, and do not present atrophy or telangiectasia. Small-plaque parapsoriasis shows minimum potential to become infiltrated or tumoral.Large-plaque parapsoriasis presents with lesions that are larger than 6 cm in diameter, with signs of atrophy and poikiloderma. They are seen on the trunk, gluteal region, proximal extremities and mammary region. The histopathological picture may resemble mycosis fungoides, in fact, large-plaque parapsoriasis does progress to frank mycosis fungoides (i.e infiltrated and/or tumoral lesions) in around 7.5% to 14% of cases.

- **Plaque stage:**In the plaque stage, lesions now appear larger with evident infiltration, along with the appearance of new lesions. The lesions are annular or horseshoe-shaped with an infiltrated base, raised, well-defined edges and asymmetrical distribution. They may also affect the face and the scalp.

- **Tumor stage:**In the tumor stage, erythematous-purplish papules or nodules of larger diameter are seen.

The frequency of lymph nodal or visceral dissemination increases as the lesions progress from the patch stage to the plaque stage and finally the tumor stage.

**Less Common or Rare Clinical Variants**

- Bullous/vesicular lesions

- Purpuric lesions

- Poikilodermatous

- Syringotropic

- Hypopigmented lesions (mainly in children)

**Clinical Variants**(as described in the WHO-EORTC Classification for Cutaneous Lymphomas)

- Follicular or folliculotropic mycosis fungoides

- Pagetoid reticulosis or Woringer- Kolopp type

- Granulomatous slack skin

**Sezary syndrome:**

Sezary syndrome constitutes 3% of all cutaneous lymphomas and is characterized by a triad of manifestations: erythroderma with pruritus, lymphadenopathy, and atypical circulating lymphocytes (referred to as Sezary or Lutzner cells). The syndrome is understood as a leukemic phase of T-cell cutaneous lymphomas and bone marrow compromise is rarely found in advanced forms of the disease only. Associated clinical manifestations include lagophthalmos, alopecia, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and onycodystrophy. Sezary Syndrome must be differentiated from erythroderma in mycosis fungoides progression. In the WHO-EORTC classification, MF and SS are listed as seperate diseases.
