While AVFs may be unavoidable for patients with end-stage renal disease, the best way to prevent the development of an AVF is to avoid unnecessary trauma or procedures that may lead to their development. Congenital AVF etiology is poorly understood, and thus, there is little to do in terms of prevention.

Patients who are diagnosed with an AVF or who think they may have an AVF should see their primary care provider first. After a thorough work-up, these patients may be referred to see one of the specialists mentioned above for management and potential repair of the fistula. Important things to write down before any appointment include any symptoms experienced, any changes in the extremity or area of concern, and any significant history, such as trauma or procedures in the same area. A fistula can arise from prior injury at any point in your lifetime.

Expectations from your provider can include further labs and imaging, including an ultrasound, a CT, or MRI. Your provider will look at, listen to, and feel the area to start the evaluation. In addition to your questions and the provision of symptoms, your provider will likely ask you further questions to help with the diagnosis of this problem.
