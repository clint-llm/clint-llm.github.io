Non-surgical rhinoplasty is indicated for the correction of mild cosmetic deficits of the nose in patients either not medically able to undergo surgery or those patients looking to avoid the cost, downtime, and risks associated with traditional surgical rhinoplasty. From a logical standpoint, patients who benefit from nonsurgical rhinoplasty are similar to those patients who would benefit from specific cartilage grafts placed during surgical rhinoplasty (e.g., shield grafts, tip grafts, radix grafts, onlay grafts, rim grafts). With that in mind, non-surgical rhinoplasty using fillers may be useful in addressing the following

- Low and/or deep radix

- Dorsal convexity (i.e., hump)

- Dorsal concavity or shallow dorsum (e.g., patients of African or Asian descent)

- Upper and middle third contour irregularities or asymmetries (e.g., crooked nose)

- Decreased tip projection

- Decreased tip refinement

- Decreased tip rotation

- Alar rim irregularities

- Alar base deficiency

- Minor asymmetries or irregularities after primary rhinoplasty

Of note, some propose that strategically placed filler may provide functional improvements as well (i.e., filler simulates spreader, butterfly, or batten grafts), though this remains controversial.

NOTE: The patient should understand that while non-surgical rhinoplasty has its appeal, there exists an equally safe, reliable, yet permanent alternative in a properly executed surgical rhinoplasty. Thus, all patients seeking non-surgical rhinoplasty should receive an offer for surgical rhinoplasty as well.
