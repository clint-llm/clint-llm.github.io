A Galeazzi fracture is a fracture of the middle to distal third of the radius associated with dislocation or subluxation of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). Advances in radiography and fracture research have helped define, classify, and guide operative management. Galeazzi fractures remain difficult to diagnose clinically, and debilitating complications can occur if proper treatment is not implemented. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Galeazzi fractures and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify common physical exam findings of a Galeazzi fracture.
- Describe the typical imaging findings associated with a Galeazzi fracture.
- Explain the treatment and management options available for Galeazzi fracture.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis and management of Galleazzi fractures.
