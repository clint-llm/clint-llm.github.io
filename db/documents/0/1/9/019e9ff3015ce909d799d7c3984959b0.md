Some disease processes consisting of abnormalities of the pectoral muscles should merit consideration when assessing patients with musculoskeletal limitations. Poland syndrome is a congenital unilateral deficiency in the pectoralis major muscle. Though most commonly arises for cosmetic or aesthetic complaints, there are some cases of Poland syndrome presenting with cardiopulmonary issues as well as dextroposition and lung herniation.

On physical exam, patients will also demonstrate osseous and cartilaginous irregularities of the rib cage, nipple absence or hypoplasia, breast asymmetry in females, and concomitant hypoplasia of the pectoralis minor, serratus anterior, latissimus dorsi, and trapezius muscles as well. If necessary, surgical intervention can be used to treat severe cases; however, virtually all cases are asymptomatic, and invasive measures are only for cosmetic indications.

We must remember that the pectoral muscles influence the mobility and functionality of the shoulder. Dysfunction of these muscles could cause defects and shoulder pain.

The pectoralis minor muscle creates a passage between the ribs for the transit of the vascular-nerve brachial system. Its abnormal tension, as well as negatively affecting the position of the scapula (upwards) and the movement of the shoulder, can cause thoracic outlet syndrome.
