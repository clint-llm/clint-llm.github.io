There is good evidence to support the use of an opioid for chronic pain but only with careful monitoring and education of the patient. For all patients, nurses are in the prime position to educate patients about the potential toxicity of opioids and the risk of addiction. Data show that in the short term, education and restriction of opioid prescriptions may be helping to avert the crises but the long-term data on whether it solves the addiction and physical dependence remain unknown.
