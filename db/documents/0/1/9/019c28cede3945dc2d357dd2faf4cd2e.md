An interdisciplinaryÂ approach to managing diabetic foot and its possible complications can reduce amputations up to 85%. Endocrinology, diabetology, vascular surgery, podiatry, orthotics, prosthetics, wound care nursing, and educators are crucial to caring for the diabetic foot. Other specialties that may play roles in diabetic foot care depending on medical issues and infection include infectious disease, nephrology, cardiology, dermatology, and others. Goals should be to medically optimize comorbidities, prevent pedal issues, and treat pedal complications.
