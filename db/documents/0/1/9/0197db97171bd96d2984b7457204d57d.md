An insult during the sensitive stages of the embryological development is thought to cause this heart defect. However, the precise abnormality that leads to PA-IVS remains unclear. Few theories postulated to explain the pathogenesis of this disorder include the primary insult to the pulmonary valve leading toÂ an atretic valve, abnormal venous valve limiting the flow of the flow through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, or as a result of abnormal coronary arterial development.
