None of the PDE5 inhibitors are genuinely selective for the receptor PDE5, and most of the harmful effects occur due to cross-reactivity with other PDE isoenzymes. These effects are usually dose-dependent. Some of the common adverse effects encountered with the administration of PDE5Is are:

- Mild headache

- Flushing - experienced more with sildenafil

- Dyspepsia

- Altered color vision presenting as a slight and transient blue tinge to the vision - the presence of a high concentration of PDE6 enzyme in rods and cones of retina makes these cells a susceptible target for PDE5 inhibitors, especially with sildenafil which has a high affinity for inhibiting PDE6 in addition to PDE5. This effect has not been shown to be accompanied by any structural and functional changes in the retina.

- Back pain and myalgias - due to a high concentration of PDE 11 enzyme in skeletal muscle, which shows significant cross-reactivity with tadalafil.

- Hypotension and dizziness

- Rhinitis

Nevertheless, the adverse outcomes encountered with PDE5 inhibitors rarely lead to their discontinuation.

PDE5Is use has also correlated with specific less known, rarely encountered side effects, and the low frequency of the occurrence of these adverse effects does not necessitate the withdrawal of the drugs from the market-

- NAION (Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy) and painless decrease in vision in one eye, which is usually irreversible. Its pathophysiology is unknown, but it shows an increased incidence in patients with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular disease.

- Hearing loss - Sensorineural hearing loss due to unclear pathophysiology has been observed in a few case studies, prompting the FDA to issue a warning about hearing loss from using PDE5I.

- Priapism occurs infrequently, but the risk increases if concomitantly used with other ED meds. Some recent studies have documented using PDE5 inhibitors daily to prevent the development of this rare occurrence of priapism.

- Melanoma - Emerging studies have focused interest on the risk of melanoma with chronic administration of PDE5Is.

- Prostate cancer

- In some recent studies, researchers have noted an incidence of prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy, but the data is not substantial enough to require their discontinuation in these patients.
