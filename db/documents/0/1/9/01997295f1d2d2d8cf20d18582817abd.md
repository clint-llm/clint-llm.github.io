The external jugular vein is frequently utilized in head and neck microvascular surgery as both a recipient vessel for free tissue transfer and as a source of vein grafts.  It is essential to understand the anatomy of this vein during dissection, even in non-microvascular operations, to avoid excessive intra-operative bleeding given its superficial location to many important structures.  Understanding the structural variants of the external jugular vein is also important for head and neck surgeons.

Additionally, given its superficial location, the external jugular vein can be damaged in penetrating trauma, leading to impressive bleeding.  The management is often uncomplicated as the vein can undergo ligation without neurologic significance.
