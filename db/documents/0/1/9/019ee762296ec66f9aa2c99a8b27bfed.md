Characteristic features of uric acid nephrolithiasis include:

- Abdominal pain

- Flank pain with radiation towards the groin

- Nausea and/or emesis

- High purine (meat) diet

- Gout

- Obesity

- Diabetes or metabolic syndrome

- Personal or family history of nephrolithiasis

**Physical Examination**

- Costovertebral angle tenderness

- Presence of urinary crystals

- Hematuria (gross or microscopic). However, 15% of all patients with stones may not demonstrate even microscopic hematuria.

- Physical examination findings associated with certain specific conditions like cancer or various metabolic syndromes can be seen.

These clinical features are 80% sensitive and 99% specific in determining urinary stones but are not specific for uric acid calculi.
