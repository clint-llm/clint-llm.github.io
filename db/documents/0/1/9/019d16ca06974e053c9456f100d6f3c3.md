Although the underlying mechanism has not been proved yet, several theories about HPNS pathophysiology exist.

One of the general assumptions is about the compression effect of pressure, possibly in the lipid component of cell membranes of the CNS.

The roles of neurotransmitters in the pathogenesis of HPNS have also been studied, for example, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, serotonin (5-HT), acetylcholine, and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA).

Also, alterations in neuronal calcium ions are another mechanism that has been postulated for HPNS pathophysiology.

On the other hand, intraspecies and interspecies variations of HPNS exist. Some individuals are more susceptible to HPNS than others.
