Imaging can be obtained in either planar and/or single-photon emission computed tomography. Intravenous injection with an indwelling catheter or butterfly needle of 20 to 30 mCi of technetium 99m into a vein of the upper extremity should be contralateral to the breast of concern. If there are suspicious bilateral findings, the lower extremity is then injected. Approximately 10 mL of saline flush should follow.

Prone positioning is appropriate with the non-pathological breast compressed against the table to prevent the dependent breast from artifacts from the contralateral breast. The arms are raised over the head with the head turned away from the detector to minimize artifacts. The detector is placed against the patient.

The patient should be imaged 5 to 10 minutes after injection. Planar images to be obtained include prone lateral (including the breast, axilla, and anterior chest wall), prone posterior oblique, and anterior upright/supine chest (includes bilateral breasts and axillae). If a marker is desired, it should be placed once the breast is in the proper position; otherwise, the abnormality could change relative to the marker.

The breast tissue is near myocardial tissue, which is an organ that takes up technetium 99m, so post-procession count subtraction should be obtained.
