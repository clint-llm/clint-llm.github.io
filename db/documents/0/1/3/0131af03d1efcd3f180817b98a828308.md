Anterior eye segment dysgenesis may present as an isolated finding in some patients or as part of various syndromes. As previously discussed, Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome encompasses a broad spectrum of phenotypes with substantial clinical overlap. Suspicion of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is warranted in patients who present with posterior embryotoxon with attached iris strands, or patients with various iris changes including various degrees of stroma hypoplasia, corectopia, and polycoria. Other key clinical features for ARS are extraocular anomalies such as facial dysmorphism, dental dysplasia, maxillary hypoplasia, hearing loss, redundant periumbilical skin, and cardiac anomalies.
