The finding of a reddish discoloration in a patient with hearing loss may suggest otosclerosis, especially of the sensorineural (cochlear) area, but there have been no studies about the sensitivity and the specificity of the symptom. A reddish discoloration of outer and middle ear structures, mimicking the Schwartze sign, may result from a variety of different otologic diseases. Some authors, therefore, question the clinical significance of the finding and advocate not to use it in clinical decision making.
