Key complications of hearing loss in the elderly relate to the proper identification and workup of the underlying etiology. Perhaps most important is the possibility of a missed or delayed diagnosis. Hearing loss in the elderly has a significant prognostic impact on patients, and without proper identification and management, the risk of adverse outcomes such as social withdrawal increases.

Due to the gradual and sometimes difficult-to-diagnose nature of hearing loss, many elderly patients go untreated or undiagnosed.
