Controlled substances are an important asset in the toolkit of a healthcare provider in any practice setting, primarily because these medications act quickly and potently. Schedule II opioids (oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, etc.) are among the top drugs administered in the clinical setting as well as misused outside of the medical purview. Because of this, opioids contribute a significant portion to drug overdose, the top cause of unintentional death in the United States.

Common misused controlled substance practices include obtaining medications from multiple sources. To obtain multiple prescriptions for controlled medications, patients visit different healthcare providers.

Diversion refers to the illegal distribution of regulated medications to other sources which have not prescribed these drugs. Diversion, or the redirection of legally prescribed controlled medications for unlawful use, is an ongoing regulatory battle undertaken by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and other federal organizations.

However, a lack of guidelines can lead to serious adverse events, including patient harm and exposure to bacteria and infections, while also causing risks to the provider.

Due to the uptick in drug overdoses and addiction, many states have also implemented drug monitoring programs. These programs enable a more effective and efficient way to track prescription drugs and prevent drug abuse. In 2012, New York State created a monitoring system known as the Internet System for Tracking Over-Prescribing (I-STOP), which requires physicians and pharmacists to consult a prescription monitoring program before prescribing scheduled controlled substances.

With the help of the DEA, numerous registries are available to help prescribers properly monitor patterns among their patients before dispensing the scheduled substance.

The increase in controlled substance abuse can correlate to a lack of proper education, socioeconomic disparities, provider education, and varying laws that have created significant challenges in regulating controlled medications. However, adequate training and education can tremendously help resolve this issue.
