A correct histologic diagnosis is becoming increasingly important because it may predict response and toxicity to therapies.

In 2015, the World Health Organization revised the classification to recognize three variants of SCC based on histological examination.

- Keratinizing

- Non-keratinizing

- Basaloid: basaloid component is greater than 50% of the tissue with minimal areas of squamous differentiation
