Patients should receive clear and concise postoperative care instructions. Understanding, on the patient's part, of the condition is imperative for a smooth recovery. The patient should understand that the maintenance and care of the foley catheter are of paramount importance. The clinical team should advise the patient that the foley will be in place for at least four weeks to prevent or protect any urethral injury. Additionally, the patient will need instruction for wound care regarding the penile incision. Wounds should be kept clean and free of contaminants. The patient should not attempt shaving around the wounds. Preference for removal of sutures will be provider dependant.
