The laryngeal nerves have various anatomical variants. One crucial known variant is the lack of the recurrent laryngeal nerve being "recurrent" around the subclavian or aorta and instead arising from the vagal truck in the neck and traversing with the inferior thyroid artery to the larynx. It is imperative to be aware of this variation, especially when performing surgical interventions in the neck, particularly thyroid or parathyroid procedures.
