There are several causes of hernias. A hernia can be caused by congenital predispositions or acquired from the weakening of the abdominal wall secondary to an incision or trauma. Umbilical and inguinal hernias are often present at birth and can enlarge over time. Incisional hernias can form from an iatrogenic weakness of the abdominal wall from previous surgeries. These can develop at any incision, including trocar sites over 5 mm from laparoscopic surgery.
