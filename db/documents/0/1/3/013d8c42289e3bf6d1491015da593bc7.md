Popliteal artery aneurysms are the most common aneurysms of the peripheral artery. They are true aneurysms, and their pathogenesis is related to the mechanical degradation of the tunica media by immune cells and the anatomic location of the popliteal artery at a high flexion point behind the knee. This activity reviews popliteal artery aneurysms, including anatomy, physiology, indications, and contraindications to repair. It goes over equipment and technique needed to perform both an open and endovascular repair. It also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating patients who undergo either open or endovascular popliteal artery aneurysm repair.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for performing popliteal aneurysm repair.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to popliteal aneurysm repair.
- Explain the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of popliteal aneurysm repair.
- Review the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance popliteal artery aneurysm repair and improve outcomes.
