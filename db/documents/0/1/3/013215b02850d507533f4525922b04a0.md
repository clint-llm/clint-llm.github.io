Real pathogenetic mechanisms of symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema are still unclear, but it has been suspected to develop as a result of a type IV delayed hypersensitivity immune response.

According to some authors, SDRIFE likely involves both a type IVa reaction involving CD4+ Th1 cells, macrophages, and also a type of IVc reaction with cytotoxic CD4 and CD8 T cells.

Nevertheless, this does not explain the occurrence of SDRIFE after the first exposure to a given drug without prior sensitization.

Pathophysiological mechanisms might also include a recall phenomenon due to the reactivation of tissue toxicity at the intertriginous predilection sites, direct interactions of the drugs with immunoreceptors, and anatomical particularities of the large folds (the abundance of eccrine sweat glands, the occlusion).
