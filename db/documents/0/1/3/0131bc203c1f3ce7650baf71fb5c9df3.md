During embryologic development, there is an overgrowth of axons distributed throughout the cortex, which incorporate into the corticospinal tract, and as development progresses, many of these axons are eliminated. Gray matter development begins a few weeks after the corticospinal tract axons reach the spinal cord. As growth continues, the corticospinal tract axons will reach the lower part of the cervical spinal cord by 24 weeks gestation.
