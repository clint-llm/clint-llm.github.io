No laboratory investigations are required to diagnose pinguecula. Recently optical coherence tomography-angiography has been used for visualizing the anterior segment of the eye. It has been seen that changes in the vascularization of pinguecula conjunctiva were not obvious. There was no significant difference in blood vessel density between the normal conjunctiva and the pinguecula.
