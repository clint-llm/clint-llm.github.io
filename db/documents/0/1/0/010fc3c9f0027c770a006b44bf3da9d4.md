Histologically granuloma annulare is characterized by focal collagen degeneration, inflammation with interstitial histiocytes, and mucin deposition. Four different histopathological patterns are observed; interstitial (57.9%), palisaded granulomatous (26.3%), sarcoidal granulomatous, and mixed. The palisading pattern consists of a rim of histiocytes and lymphocytes that surround an area of necrobiotic collagen. The interstitial pattern consists of histiocytes scattered among bundles of collagen and blood vessels in the dermis. A patient may have more than one of the histopathologic subtypes.
