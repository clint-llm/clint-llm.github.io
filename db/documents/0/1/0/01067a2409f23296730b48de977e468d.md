The etiology of pleomorphic adenoma is unknown, but the incidence of this tumor has been increasing in the last 15-20 years in relation to the exposure of radiation. One study suggests that oncogenic simian virus (SV40) may play a role in the onset or progression of pleomorphic adenoma.Â  Prior head and neck irradiation is also a risk factor for the development of these tumors.
