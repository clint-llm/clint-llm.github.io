Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) develop as a direct extension of cancer into the pleural space, or they are due to inflammation induced by malignancy. MPEsÂ are most commonly secondary to lung cancer, with adenocarcinoma type most frequently associated with the development of pleural effusion. Breast cancer is the second most common cause of MPE. Lung cancer and breast cancer account for more than half of cases of MPE.
