Procainamide is given IV or PO with the onset of action in 10 to 30 minutes. The loading dose is of IV procainamide is 10 to 17 mg/kg and administered at a rate of 20 to 50 mg/min. Alternatively, this may be dosed at 100 mg every 5 minutes in adult patients. The administration of this maintenance dose is from 1 to 4 mg/minute; however, the manufacturer labeling recommends 2 to 6 mg/minute.

Administration of oral procainamide dosing for supraventricular arrhythmia is at 50 mg/kg/24 hours divided into doses every 6 hours.

In the pediatric population, dosing divides into those less than 12 months in which a bolus dose of 7 to 10 mg/kg given over 15 to 30 minutes and those older than 12 months in which a bolus dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg is the regimen. An infusion rate of 20 to 50 mcg/kg/min follows the initial bolus.

Procainamide is metabolized hepatically via acetylation to form N-acetyl procainamide (NAPA) via a substrate of CYP2D6. This compound is then excreted as NAPA. The half-life of procainamide is 2.5 to 5 hrs, and the maximum dose in current recommendations is 17 mg/kg. As such, clinicians may consider decreasing the dosing or frequency of procainamide in cases of hepatic impairment.
