However, not all Amanita species have this toxin, and other mushroom species besides Amanita have the amatoxin. (Table) Ninety-five percent of deaths from mushroom ingestions worldwide are from amatoxin-containing mushrooms. This activity highlights the pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis of amatoxin mushroom toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of amatoxin mushroom poisoning.
- Describe the clinical presentation of a patient having amatoxin mushroom poisoning.
- Illustrate the treatment and management options available for amatoxin mushroom poisoning.
