Radiation therapy-induced syndromes are time-dependent and can be divided into acute encephalopathy which occurs within 1 month after therapy and early delayed complications which occur between 1 to 4 months after therapy. The acute phase results in cerebral edema; damage to DNA; damage to vascular structures, especially the smaller arterioles; and damage to progenitor cells, especially oligodendrocytes which lead to demyelination. Endothelial cells are especially prone to damage from radiation therapy. The acute vasogenic edema that develops from radiation therapy is a reversible problem. Also, early delayed damage can be due to neural progenitor cells in the temporal lobe which may be the mechanism that leads to memory problems.

Pathologically, radiation necrosis primarily affects the smaller arterioles and arteries which initially causes coagulative necrosis and then endothelial thickening and infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages. The inflammation that develops from the infiltration of these immune cells triggers off a whole host of cytokine activity, activation of fibroblasts, and hyalinization of the tissue.  Immune-mediated mechanisms that contribute to neurotoxicity have been hypothesized but have not been fully explained.

The vascular injury stimulates the formation of new microvessels mediated in part through vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF), a key player in this mechanism. The disorganized vascular growth can lead to telangiectasia formations which are prone to bleeding and thrombotic events which can lead to further tissue necrosis. Recent studies using bevacizumab and MRI imaging showed decreased vascular permeability, but, although promising, the efficacy and longer-term risk versus the benefit of this therapy remains to be determined.
