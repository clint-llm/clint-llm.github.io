The brachial plexus is a nerve network comprised of the anterior rami from the lower 4 cervical spinal nerves and first upper thoracic spinal nerve (C5, C6, C7, C8, T1). The spinal nerves of the brachial plexus then continue to form the roots, trunks, divisions, cords, and branches. As the 5 roots give rise to the 3 trunks (superior, middle, and inferior), they emerge between the anterior and middle scalene muscles. Each trunk then divides anteriorly and posteriorly behind the clavicle at the apex of the axilla forming a total of 6 divisions. The 6 divisions then combine to make 3 cords (lateral, median, and posterior), which then split into 5 terminal nerve branches (musculocutaneous, axillary, radial, median, and ulnar nerves).
