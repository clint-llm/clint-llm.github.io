Western surgical and medicinal interventions are effective in pain management for TMJ-related disorders; however, both DOs and MDs undermine OMT's pain-free application in clinical practice and pain management relating to TMJ dysfunctions. There are a few significant reasons why DOs (osteopathic physicians) less-frequently practice OMT after medical school graduation and residency completion:

- Lack of conjoining between osteopathic principles and clinical concepts in the medical, educational process.

- Extended periods of graduate medical training that fissions students from the traditional classroom-based OMT experience.

Despite an official merger between osteopathic (DO) and allopathic (MD) graduate medical education, no official steps integrate OMT practice in the form of a rotation across ACGME-accredited residency programs. DOs and MDs both learn Western, allopathic medicine and surgery to graduate medical school; yet, MDs have traditionally stayed away from practicing OMT, the only skill that differentiates an MD and a DO. Understanding and implementing the side-effect-free analgesic benefit of the OMT would allow for a broader approach to clinical practice and offer the patients various treatment options.
