There are multiple adverse effects that mannitol can cause, including:

- Masking or worsening dehydration as it causes diuresis

- Precipitate heart failure due to the rapid fluid shifts as water enters the intravascular compartment

- Cause or worsen electrolyte abnormalities due to the shift of free water into the intravascular space. Electrolyte abnormalities may include but are not limited to hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia.

- Precipitate into crystals at low temperatures, which can cause vascular and end-organ damage

- Worsen cerebral edema. Although mannitol poorly crosses the vessel wall, it does cross to some degree, and mannitol more easily crosses injured vessels such as patients with intracranial hemorrhage. Frequent doses of mannitol can cause mannitol to leach across the blood-brain barrier and worsen cerebral edema as the mannitol, which has leached into the brain, draws water into instead of out of the brain. Patients, especially children with cerebral hyperemia, may have worsening cerebral edema with mannitol administration.
