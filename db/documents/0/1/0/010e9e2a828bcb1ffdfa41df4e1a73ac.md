The **Benchmark Registry**reports an incidence of 2.6% for major complications (major complications include severe limb ischemia, severe bleeding, balloon leak, or death due to IABP insertion or failure) with 21.2% in-hospital mortality, and only 0.05 % of in-hospital mortality was directly attributable to IABP.

Complications of the IABP in 5495 patients with acute myocardial infarction reported in the Benchmark registry are:

**All Complications 8.1%**

- Major complication 2.7%

- Minor complication 5.4%

**Bleeding Complication**

- Any access site bleeding 4.3%

- Severe access site bleeding 1.4%

- Transfusion 1.4%

**Vascular Complications and Limb Ischemia**

- Any limb ischemia 2.3%

- Visceral ischemia 0.1%

- Major limb ischemia (loss of pulse, loss of sensation, or abnormal temperature or pallor limb necessitating intervention, arterial repair or amputation) 0.5%

- Amputation 0.1%

- Vascular surgery 0.7%

- Deep venous thrombosis 0.1%

- Superficial vein thrombosis 0.1%

**Infection**0.1%

**Stroke**0.1%

**IABP Related Mortality**0.05%

**Others**

- IABP leak 0.8%

- Poor inflation 0.6%

- Difficult insertion of IABP 0.1%

- Poor augmentation 1.1%

Independent risk factors for major complications identified in the Benchmark Registry were female gender, peripheral vascular disease, body surface area less than 1.65 m, and age greater than or equal to 75 years. However, additional risk factors leading to ischemic vascular complications areÂ the duration of IABP support, catheter size, diabetes, and cardiac index less than 2.2 L/min/m. Diabetes and hypertension are known risk factors of developing peripheral arterial disease and may indirectly predispose to risk of vascular complication due to a higher prevalence of PAD in this group of patients.

**In the IABP SHOCK II Trial**, researchers observed no significantly higher risk of complication in the IABP group as compared with the control group.

Various complication observed in IABP vs control group are as follows:

- Major bleeding risk (3.3 % in IABP group vs 4.4 % in control group, p value = 0.51)

- Peripheral ischemia complications (3.3 % in IABP group vs 4.4 % in control group, p value = 0.51)

- Sepsis (3.3 % in IABP group vs 4.4 % in control group, p value = 0.51)

- Stroke (0.7% in IABP vs 1.7% in control, P = 0.28)
