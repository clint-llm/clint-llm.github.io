The tectospinal tract is a bilateral, descending motor pathway that begins in the deep layers of the contralateral superior colliculus. The long descending motor tract divides into both medial and lateral systems; the tectospinal tract is part of the medial system, which also includes the vestibulospinal and reticulospinal tracts. The cell bodies of the tectospinal tract project caudally from the superior colliculus to cross at the dorsal tegmental decussation.
