Multiple theories have been suggested as to why some people develop alcohol use disorders. Some of the more evidence-supported theories include positive-effect regulation, negative-effect regulation, pharmacological vulnerability, and deviance proneness. Positive-effect regulation results in drinking for positive rewards (such as feelings of euphoria). Negative-effect regulation is seen when one drinks to cope with feelings of a negative nature, such as depression, anxiety, or feelings of worthlessness. Pharmacological vulnerability makes a note of an individual's varied response to both acute and chronic effects of alcohol intake and the individual differences in the body's ability to metabolize the alcohol. Deviance proneness speaks more to an individual's tendency towards deviant behavior established during childhood, often due to a deficiency in socialization at an early age.
