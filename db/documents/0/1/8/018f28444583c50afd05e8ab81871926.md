Factors that predispose the mesenteric vessels to atherosclerosis include the following:

- Diabetes

- Hypertension

- Smoking

- Hyperlipidemia

When the arterial lumen narrows secondary to atherosclerosis, any demand in blood supply that occurs during eating can result in severe abdominal pain and even mesenteric ischemia.
