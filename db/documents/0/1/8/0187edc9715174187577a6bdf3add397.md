In patients with traumatic fat embolism syndrome, the prognosis depends on early open reduction and internal fixation of the long bone fracture. Most patients with adequate support therapy can recover from the neurological, respiratory, and retinal changes associated with fat embolism syndrome. The most recent studies approximate mortality between 7% to 10%.

The most common cause of morbidity or mortality include:

- Acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS

- Cerebral edema
