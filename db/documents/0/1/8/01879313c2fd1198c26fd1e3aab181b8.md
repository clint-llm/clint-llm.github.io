Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. With chronic and/or severe vitamin D deficiency, a decline in intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption leads to hypocalcemia leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism. This secondary hyperparathyroidism then leads to phosphaturia and accelerated bone demineralization.  This can further results in osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults and osteomalacia and rickets in children.
