Intrapleural catheters may be inserted by the anesthesiologist/radiologist for pain management and by the pulmonologist or thoracic surgeon for drainage of pleural fluid. These catheters are usually attached to a drainage system which also requires monitoring. Nurses are usually in charge of managing the catheters for drainage. Intrapleural catheters do work as long as the pleural fluid is clear. But because of the small lumen, they can get plugged with debris. However, they cause less pain and are much better tolerated than the older chest tubes.
