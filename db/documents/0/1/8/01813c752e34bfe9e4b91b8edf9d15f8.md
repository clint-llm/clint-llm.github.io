**Cerebral Circulation: Arterial System and Venous System**

The arterial blood flow to the brain is through two major sources: the anterior source is provided by internal carotid arteries, and the posterior source originates in vertebral arteries. Internal carotid and vertebral arteries confluence at the circle of Willis, and from there, all the major cerebral arteries arise. Thus, arteries supplying brain tissue are the anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, anterior choroidal artery, posterior cerebral artery, anterior inferior cerebellar artery, posterior inferior cerebellar artery, basilar artery.

Cerebral venous system: superficial dural venous sinuses and deep cerebral veins.

Acute Ischemic stroke (AIS) is caused by deficient blood and oxygen supply to the brain; hemorrhagic stroke is caused by bleeding or leaky blood vessels.

**Pathophysiology**

In ischemic stroke, acute occlusion of blood vessels is most commonly embolic, while rupture of atherosclerotic plaque is a less common cause.

Approximately 10 to 15% of all strokes are hemorrhagic in nature (caused by ruptured blood vessels) and are associated with high mortality.

After an acute stroke, the area of ischemic brain tissue (core) is surrounded by reversibly damaged tissue called the penumbra.
