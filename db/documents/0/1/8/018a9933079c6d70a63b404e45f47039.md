Glomangiomas, or glomuvenous malformations (GVM), are rare cutaneous venous malformations that show glomus cells (undifferentiated smooth muscle cells, which are thermoregulatory units), along with the venous system in histology.

-  Solid: mainly glomus cells.

-  Glomangioma: mainly blood vessels.

-  Glomangiomyoma: mainly smooth muscle cells.

Glomangiomas usually present in multiples, often at birth or during childhood, and they do not involve the subungual region. A majority of glomangiomas are benign, although malignant cases have also been reported.
