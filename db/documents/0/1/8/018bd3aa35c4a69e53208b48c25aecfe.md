The term "Achilles tendinopathy" refers to tendinitis (acute inflammation) and tendinosis (chronic inflammation). It is a condition characterized by pain, inflammation, and stiffness of the Achilles tendon. The inflammation limits lower extremity functionality. Achilles tendinopathy takes a long time to heal; over time there is thickening of the tendon and loss of elasticity. The pain is related to an alteration of the mechanical properties of tension and rigidity of the aponeurosis of the Achilles tendon.
