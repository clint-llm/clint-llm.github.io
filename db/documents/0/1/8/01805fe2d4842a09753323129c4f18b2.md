Aflatoxins are metabolites produced by toxigenic strains of molds, mainly Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus, which grow in soil, hay, decaying vegetation, and grains. Aflatoxin is produced by fungal action during food production, harvest, storage, and processing. Dietary exposure to aflatoxins may result in severe toxic and carcinogenic outcomes in humans and animals. Aflatoxin toxicity may result in nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, convulsions, and other signs of acute liver injury. Long-term exposure also leads to various complications like growth retardation, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. This activity describes the evaluation and management of aflatoxin toxicity and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of aflatoxin toxicity.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with aflatoxin toxicity.
- Explain the treatment options for patients with aflatoxin toxicity.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients affected by aflatoxin toxicity.
