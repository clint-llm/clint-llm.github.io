**Stillbirth/Abortion Risk**

One population-based study found increased THC use among women with stillbirth, but another study by Warshak et al. did not find any association.

**Fetal Growth**

Fetal exposure to THC is associated with decreased birth weight but not birth length or head circumference. The decrease in birth weight ranges from 84 g to 109 g.

**Congenital Malformation**

Few studies have examined the correlation between THC exposure and congenital disabilities. These studies suggest that maternal marijuana use during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of anencephaly, esophageal atresia, diaphragmatic hernia, gastroschisis, and ventricular septal defect.

**Neonatal Outcomes**

Some studies have identified an association between maternal THC use and a decrease in gestational age.

**Childhood Outcomes**

Effects of perinatal THC exposure start getting noticeable as early as four years of age. Young children are likely to show lower scores on verbal reasoning and memory tasks, poor language comprehension, visual and perceptual functions. These effects are found to be dose-dependent. Deficits are seen in impulse control, problem-solving, attention span, and analytical skills among older-age children. Lower global achievement, reading, spelling and, math scores are also seen in this age group.
