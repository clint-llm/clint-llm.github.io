The key differential diagnosis for atypical moles is melanoma (often the superficial spreading subtype). While dermoscopy is considered a useful tool to differentiate superficial spreading melanoma and atypical moles, where there is clinical concern or uncertainty in the differential diagnosis, lesions must be managed in line with guidelines for the treatment of melanomas.

Congenital nevi usually present with a larger diameter and prominent hairs which are absent in atypical moles. Although seborrheic keratosis may cause some confusion during the diagnosis, the dull surface and hyperkeratosis should facilitate clinical differentiation in the vast majority of cases.
