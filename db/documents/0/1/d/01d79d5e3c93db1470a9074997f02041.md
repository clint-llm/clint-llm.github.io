Imaging of the cervical spine is not sensitive enough for diagnosing a cervicogenic headache. No specific radiologic abnormalities were found in recent studies such as Pfaffenrath et al. and Fredriksen et al. The most frequent findings in the literature were a rectilinearization of the cervical spine and/or disc protrusions. Although not widely used in the clinical world, functional imaging shows hypomobility or hypermobility at a certain level of the cervical spine.

Imaging like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and/or CT myelography may be ordered to help rule out Chiari malformations, nerve root pathology assessment, or identify spinal cord pathology (e.g., asymmetric facet arthropathy or rheumatoid changes around the atlantoaxial joint).

The ICHD-3 criteria for cervicogenic headache are as follows:

- Any headache fulfilling criterion C

- Clinical and/or imaging evidence of a lesion or disorder in the cervical spine or soft tissues of the neck that can cause headache

- Evidence of cause of headache demonstrated by at least two of these:

- Headache has developed in temporal relation to the appearance of the lesion or the onset of the cervical disorder
- Headache has significantly improved or resolved in unison with improvement in or the resolution of the cervical lesion or disorder
- Cervical range of motion is reduced, and provocative maneuvers may significantly worsen the headache
- Headache is abolished following diagnostic blockade of a cervical structure or its nerve supply

- Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis

Diagnostic anesthetic blocks can sometimes be utilized to confirm the diagnosis but require specialized skills and are not routinely performed.
