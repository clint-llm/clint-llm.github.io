Typically, a biopsy is unnecessary for the diagnosis because clinical history and physical exam provide enough to confirm the diagnosis. However, when a lesion is biopsied, specimens of piezogenicÂ papules typically demonstrate hyperkeratosis, degeneration of the thin fibrous septa between fat lobules, and subsequent coalescence of fat. Of note, hyperkeratosis is more prominent in painful lesions and likely less prominent or absent in asymptomatic lesions. Some studies have also noted a thickened and dense dermis and/or loss of the normal small fat globules in the lower dermis, subcutis, and periadinexally. Occasionally, overt protrusion of enlarged fat lobules into the dermis has been noted.

In contrast, infantile pedal papules appear as well-defined lobules of mature fat in the mid and deep dermis. Frequently, these fat lobules will be encased in collagen, especially the periadinexally around the eccrine glands.
