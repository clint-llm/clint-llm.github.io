Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is a rare channelopathy caused by the skeletal muscle ion channel mutations, commonly calcium channel and less commonly sodium channels. The patients characteristically present with sudden onset of generalized or focal flaccid paralysis associated with hypokalemia, which persists for several hours before it resolves spontaneously. To avoid the morbidity associated with the condition, it should be diagnosed and treated with prophylactic therapy. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of hypokalemic periodic paralysis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of muscle weakness in hypokalemic periodic paralysis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of hypokalemic periodic paralysis.
- Explain the role of oral potassium supplementation and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in the treatment of hypokalemic periodic paralysis.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by hypokalemic periodic paralysis.
