Although transesophageal echocardiography is a relatively safe modality, it is an invasive procedure and does carry the risk of infrequent but potentially life-threatening complications. Therefore, it should only be performed by qualified, trained physicians. Cardiologists, anesthesiologists and critical care physicians who demonstrate their competence in echocardiography by completion of a training program and achieving a passing score on a certifying exam, can safely perform the procedure. Improving health professional understanding of how to utilize TEE to evaluate and treat patients can lead to better patient outcomes.
