The craniocervical junction is comprised of C1 (atlas) and C2 (axis). The occipito-atlantal and atlantoaxial articulations provide 50% of the flexion and rotation in the cervical spine, respectively. Due to their high degree of motion, these bony segments are also the most often injured in adults. C1 fractures should be promptly identified and treated in all patients, although they rarely require surgery. Any bony fracture of the atlas merits a thorough examination of the ligamentous structures between O-C1 and C1-C2, which in comparison, often confer a poor prognosis. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of C1 vertebral fractures and examines the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the unique vertebral anatomy of the first cervical vertebra (atlas).
- Discuss the components of a proper evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with a potential first cervical vertebra fracture, including any indicated imaging studies.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for first cervical vertebra fractures based on the specific fracture type.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in prompt diagnosis of C1 vertebral fracture and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
