The purpose of screening for a disease is not just to detect an illness, and there should also be processes in place to treat the detected illness. The harm of detecting the illness should not overwhelm the benefits of its detection. There is a paucity of clinical trials that directly evaluate whether screening for MDD leads to improvement in clinical outcomes. Time constraints, provider inexperience and lack of training, lack of resources for mental health are some of the cited barriers for screening.

Some pediatricians express discomfort in universal screening for suicidal behavior in children as they perceive that bringing up the topic may lead to suicidal behavior or mental health problems. However, there is no evidence behind that. The optimal interval for screening childhood depression and suicide is unknown. Also, some providers are concerned with overdiagnosis and overtreatment with false-positive screening results. This is especially important since there are scarce community resources for mental health. One study found that more than half of children identified with mental health problems do not receive appropriate treatment or follow-up.

In the future, well-designed trials to evaluate the benefits of depression and suicide screening will be helpful. Healthcare professionals should receive training to identify and manage children with depression and suicidal behavior.Â When a child goes through depression, the whole family gets affected. When an affected child is treated appropriately, we are treating the child and the whole family.
