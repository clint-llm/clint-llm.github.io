Since the first publicly performed anesthetic procedure at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1846,Â vaporizers have been an essential component of anesthesia equipment.

The functioning of vaporizers is complex; and requires an in-depth understanding of thermodynamics, gases, and physics. While engineering may not be the forte of many anesthesiologists, familiarity with the proper functioning of the anesthetic equipment and the ability to recognize equipment failures are essential to decrease the potential for patient hazards.
