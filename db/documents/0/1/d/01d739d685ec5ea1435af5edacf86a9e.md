Cogan syndrome is a rare multisystem autoimmune disease affecting the ocular and audiovestibular system with unknown pathogenesis. It occurs mainly in young white adults in the third decade of life as they present with interstitial keratitis and hearing loss. The autoimmune hypothesis is proposed due to the detection of different autoantibodies and the association with vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa, and collagen vascular disease. Diagnosis requires a multidisciplinary approach based on audio-vestibular symptoms, ocular inflammation, and laboratory findings such as nonreactive serological tests for syphilis. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with Conan syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology and histopathology of Cogan syndrome.
- Summarize the clinical evaluation of Cogan syndrome, including the differential diagnoses.
- Review the differential diagnoses of Cogan syndrome.
- Summarize the appropriate management of Cogan syndrome with prognosis.
