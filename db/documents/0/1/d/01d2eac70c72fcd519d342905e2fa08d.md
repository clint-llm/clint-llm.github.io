Teratoma typically visualized as a mixed echogenic and cystic intracranial mass on antenatal ultrasound during the second and third trimester.

Glioblastoma multiforme is a high-grade astrocytoma, typically presents as a large, ill-defined, intracranial mass occupying most of one hemisphere or spread through the corpus callosum into the other hemisphere. It appears as an echogenic heterogeneous mass on ultrasonography and commonly shows intralesional hemorrhage and necrosis.

Choroid plexus papilloma typically presents as enhancing intraventricular mass on CT,  and iso-hypo intense on T1 and iso-hyperintense on T2 MRI.

Medulloblastoma typically presents as a midline posterior fossa tumor growing into the fourth ventricle. It appears hyperdense on CT-scan, has variable intensity on T1/T2 MRI with diffusion restriction and varying contrast enhancement.

Scanning the whole neural axis is mandatory to look for CSF seeding and spinal drop metastasis.
