It is common in developing countries and results from contaminated food, poor sanitation conditions, or direct person to person contact. Shigella can cause infection in all age groups. High-risk group include very young, elderly, and immunocompromised person. Shigella species is relatively resistant to acid in the stomach, and few organisms are required to cause the disease.
