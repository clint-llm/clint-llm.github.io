The 5 types of urinary incontinence and their causes are listed below:

- Stress urinary incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine that occurs with increases in intraabdominal pressure (e.g., with exertion, effort, sneezing, or coughing) due to urethral sphincter and/or pelvic floor weakness. Young women active in sports may experience this type of incontinence.

- Urge urinary incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine that may be preceded or accompanied by a sense of urinary urgency (but can be asymptomatic as well) due to detrusor overactivity. The contractions may be caused by bladder irritation or loss of neurologic control.

- Mixed urinary incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine caused by a combination of stress and urge urinary incontinence as described above.

- Overflow urinary incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine from an overdistended bladder due to impaired detrusor contractility and/or bladder outlet obstruction. Neurologic diseases such as spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, and diabetes can impair detrusor function. Bladder outlet obstruction can be caused by external compression by abdominal or pelvic masses and pelvic organ prolapse, among other causes. A common cause in men is benign prostatic hyperplasia.

- Functional urinary incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine due to environmental or physical barriers to toileting. This type of incontinence is sometimes referred to as toileting difficulty.
