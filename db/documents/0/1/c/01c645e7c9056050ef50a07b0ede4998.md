Multifocal motor neuropathy is considered immune-mediated motor neuropathy. A high prevalence of serum IgM anti-GM1 antibodies in these patients and a favorable response to IVIG support this consideration. The abundance of GM1 in the myelin of motor nerves as compared to sensory nerves can explain the characteristic motor involvement in MMN.

Earlier it was believed that the conduction block seen on electrophysiological studies in MMN is due to severe focal demyelination, but increasing evidence suggests that anti-GM1 antibodies cause sodium and potassium channel dysfunction at or around the node of Ranvier of myelinated motor axons that play an important part in the conduction block. Hence the term ‘nodo-paranodopathy’ is also sometimes used.
