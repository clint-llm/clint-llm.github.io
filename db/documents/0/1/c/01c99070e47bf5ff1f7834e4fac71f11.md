Croup is characterized by a "seal-like barking" cough, stridor, hoarseness, and difficulty breathing, which typically becomes worse at night. Agitation worsens the stridor, and it can be heard at rest. Other symptoms include fever and dyspnea, but the absence of fever should not reduce suspicion for croup. Respiratory rate and heart rate may also be increased with a normal respiratory rate being between 20 to 30 breaths per minute. Visual inspection of nasal flaring, retraction, and rarely cyanosis increases suspicion for croup.

**Typical Presentation**

- One to 2 days of upper respiratory infection (URI) followed by barking cough and stridor

- Low-grade fever

- No drooling or dysphagia

- Duration is 3 to 7 days with the most severe symptoms on days 3 or 4
