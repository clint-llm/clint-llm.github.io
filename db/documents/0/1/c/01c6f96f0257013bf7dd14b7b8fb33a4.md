- Tracheal trauma may result from penetrating, inhalation or blunt mechanisms

- A salient iatrogenic cause of tracheal trauma is endotracheal damage from an overinflated ETT cuff

- The potential for tracheal trauma should be investigated early, as delays in diagnosis and treatment worsen prognosis

- Tracheal trauma may be associated with trauma to nearby structures including bony disruptions of the cervical spine, vascular injury or digestive tract involvement

- Securing and protecting the airway early is of paramount importance

- Potential complications include pneumothorax, aspiration, and infections, as well as delayed airway stenosis or vocal cord dysfunction from scar tissue formation
