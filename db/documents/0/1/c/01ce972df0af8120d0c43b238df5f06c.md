Symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema is not very common, and the literature documents a limited number of SDRIFE cases. However, since 1984, over 100 cases of drug-related baboon syndrome or SDRIFE have been reported.

SDRIFE affects patients of any age. According to reported cases, it can present at ageÂ 18 months to 84 years.
