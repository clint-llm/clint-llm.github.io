**Sodium-glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors**

The sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) is found in the proximal tubule of the kidney and functions to reabsorb filtered glucose. It is responsible for 90% of filtered glucose reabsorption. SGLT2 inhibitors block this reabsorption and lead to renal excretion of glucose with glucosuria.

**Glucagon-like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1RA)**

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is secreted in response to oral glucose in the gastrointestinal tract and binds to a specific GLP-1 receptor to stimulate insulin secretion. GLP-1 receptors are found in pancreatic beta cells, gastric mucosa, kidney, lung, heart, and the hypothalamus.
