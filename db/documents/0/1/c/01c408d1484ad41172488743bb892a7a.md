For many years, the retrobulbar block was considered the "gold standard" technique for ocular anesthesia. However, its use has declined since the introduction of newer techniques with similar efficacy in anesthesia and akinesia, yet lower rates of complications. The physician must recognize the potential usefulness of the retrobulbar block and its advantages in generating faster pain relief and akinesia over other techniques. Equally important is an understanding of the basic anatomy of the orbital space, to facilitate comprehension of the risks associated with any regional anesthesia technique.
