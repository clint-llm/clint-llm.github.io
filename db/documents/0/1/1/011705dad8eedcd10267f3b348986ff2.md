The patient will often describe a sudden onset of vomiting. Abdominal pain is a common complaint as well. Many describe nausea, anorexia, and fatigue prior to the onset of vomiting. These episodes may last hours to days. In between episodes, patients describe pain-free and symptom-free intervals that last weeks to months. The hallmark of this disease is the recurrence of vomiting cycles, so patients will often report multiple visits to multiple providers in search of a diagnosis and symptom relief. Patients may report previous surgeries such as cholecystectomy without improvement of symptoms. Exam findings are nonspecific but often reflect dehydration. Findings such as dry mucous membranes, tachycardia, and possible abdominal tenderness may be present but are nondiagnostic for CVS.
