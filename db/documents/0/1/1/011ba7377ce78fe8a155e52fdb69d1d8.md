Despite the current focus on minimally-invasive approaches to facial aesthetic surgery, more traditional open techniques remain viable options for many patients. Pretrichial brow lifting is beneficial when patients require both brow elevation and adjustment of the frontal hairline; this approach is frequently employed for female transgender patients, who often desire elevation of the hair-bearing brow with concomitant reduction of the bony supraorbital ridges and reshaping of the hairline, all of which are easily performed through a pretrichial incision.

When neither the hairline nor the brow position is important, as, in cases of frontal sinus fractures, NOE fractures, and anterior skull base tumors, a pretrichial approach may still be preferable to a traditional coronal incision if the patient keeps his or her hair short and would prefer to avoid an obvious scar across the vertex of the scalp. Coronal-type brow lift approaches may be more time-consuming and more liable to leave a visible scar than minimally-invasive approaches, but they provide a similar degree of elevation and far better exposure of the fontal calvarium; pretrichial brow lifting, therefore, remains an important part of the facial surgeon's armamentarium.
