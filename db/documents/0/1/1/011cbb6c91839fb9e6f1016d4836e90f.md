Like many diseases, the incidence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is significantly impacted by geographical region, gender, race, and age. Globally, CLL is estimated to comprise 191,000 cases and 61,000 deaths.

More specifically, the incidence in Asia compared to Europe and the United States is 0.01% and 0.06%, respectively.Â Further global differences are also seen, with CLL incidence being higher in African countries than in Asian countries but not in their U.S. or European counterparts.

In the Western world, CLL is considered the most common type of leukemia, with the United States alone accounting for roughly 25 to 35% of all leukemia cases.

This male predilection is further supported, with European male-to-female annual incidence rates being 5.87 and 4.01 cases per 100,000 population, respectively.

In addition to gender, CLL also has a predilection for older individuals, with the median age at diagnosis being around 70 years old.
