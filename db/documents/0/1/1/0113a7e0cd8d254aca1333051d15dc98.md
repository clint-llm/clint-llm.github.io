Seromas can form in any surgical wound where extensive soft tissue dissection and dead space creation occur. Patients often present 7 to 10 days following wound closure or wound drain removal with a fluctuant collection near the operative site. This can be asymptomatic or associated with pain, a functional deficit of the affected area, and/or wound dehiscence.

**Common Differentials**

- Hematoma: An abnormal collection of blood; this is often associated with bruising.

- Abscess: A collection of pus in a cavity surrounded by epithelium. This is associated with overlying erythema and a warm surface. The patient may become systemically unwell with pyrexia and raised inflammatory markers. Definitive management includes incision and drainage and antibiotic administration.

- Lymphedema: Tissue swelling caused by disruption to the lymphatic systems. It can occur following procedures where significant lymphatic resection occurs, such as axillary node clearance for breast cancer with nodal disease. Swelling can be localized or generalized to an entire limb.

Patients presenting with suspected seroma in the early postoperative period should be thoroughly evaluated with history and examination to rule out other differentials. Blood tests, including a complete blood count and c-reactive protein (CRP), may also aid in the diagnostic process, but results should be considered in the clinical context of the patient's presentation.

Ultrasonography is indicated in patients whose diagnosis is uncertain or whose multiple aspirations have failed to resolve the collection to investigate for pseudocyst formation.

As previously discussed, aspiration provides therapeutic relief for large-volume, symptomatic seromas. Moreover, examining the appearance of the fluid aspirated can be useful in confirming the diagnosis. This would be clear/straw-colored fluid in a seroma, blood in a hematoma, and pus in an abscess.

**Breast Cancer Surgery**

Due to its high incidence following mastectomy and axillary surgery, in the literature, seroma is occasionally regarded as an adverse effect of the surgery as opposed to a complication. Current research focuses on prevention through different flap fixation techniques, using chemical agents, and intra-operative drain insertion, with conflicting evidence in different patient groups.

However, in the context of breast reconstruction, the management of seroma can become more difficult due to the risk of implant loss and skin flap ischemia. Implant loss rates due to seroma formation have been reported to be between 2 to 8%.

The decision to drain a seroma in the context of breast reconstructive surgery can be difficult for the surgeon, and the risks of introducing infection with subsequent implant loss must be weighed up against the patient's symptoms, risk of skin dehiscence/necrosis, and the degree of aesthetic effect on the reconstruction.

**Hernia Repair**

Seroma formation is common following hernia repair surgery, with an incidence between 8 to 12.5% for open hernia repair and 5.4% for laparoscopic repair.

Studies have been performed to investigate the role of mesh repair on the incidence of seroma formation. A Cochrane review found that repair with mesh is more likely to be complicated by seroma compared to the non-mesh repair, likely due to a more significant local reaction to the prosthesis. A meta-analysis by Fang et al. found higher rates of seroma formation with biologic mesh compared to those made of synthetic materials.

The decision to aspirate seromas in patients following hernia repair with mesh should be carefully considered as it carries a risk of introducing infection to the underlying prosthesis. This significant complication is likely to require further revision surgery to remove the infected implant.

Seroma following laparoscopic hernia repair should be considered an expected outcome rather than a complication, with studies showing 95 to 100% of patients having early postoperative seroma formation on USS/CT imaging. The seroma did not resolve spontaneously in only 3 or 4% of patients.

**Abdominoplasty**

Abdominoplasty is one of the most common plastic surgery procedures, with seroma being the most common complication post-operatively; however, their incidence is decreasing, likely due to the wider use of successful intra-operative preventative measures.

The use of tissue adhesives does not seem to reduce the incidence of seroma but rather reduces their volume.
