Interprofessional healthcare teams are often made up of many members from different disciplines and can include, but are not limited to, a physician (MD, DO), nurse practitioner or physician assistant, pharmacist, and nurse.

The clinician (MD, DO, NP, PA) will evaluate and decide whether supplemental iron is needed. The pharmacist can consult with various dose formulations available and recommended doses and perform medication reconciliation. Nursing can counsel on proper administration (e.g., avoid taking calcium-rich foods within 2 hours of supplemental iron, etc.) and verify patient compliance. A dietitian or nutritionist can also educate the patient regarding improving their diet and iron-rich foods. All these providers on the interprofessional healthcare team must report back to the treating clinician should they encounter any concerns.

All such team members treating iron-deficient patients must be able to recognize indications for the administration of iron and be familiar with contraindications, adverse effects, monitoring, and toxicity, and practice interprofessional communication to ensure all healthcare team members are in synch. Increasing the knowledge of iron therapy for each team member will improve implementation and, by extension, improve patient outcomes. [Level 5]
