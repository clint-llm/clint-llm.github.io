As the pathophysiology of fetal echogenic bowel is multifactorial, complications are mainly attributed to the underlying pathology. In pregnancies associated with IUGR or elevated AFP, complications may arise from underlying placental-fetal bleeding or congenital anomalies.

The association between echogenic bowel and Intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) may be related to underlying uteroplacental insufficiency.
