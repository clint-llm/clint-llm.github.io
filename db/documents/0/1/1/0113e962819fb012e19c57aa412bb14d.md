The definitive hosts of Onchocerca volvulus are humans, while the larval stages grow exclusively in the Simulium black fly, of which there are several cyto-species based on their flying characteristics and chromosomal banding patterns.

Further classifications into savanna, rainforest, and transitional zone clades are done based on their habitats and mitochondrial gene sequencing. These show different biting characteristics and propensity towards causing blinding disease.

Infective microfilariae larvae (L3 stage) are injected into a host during the blood meal of the female black fly. For 6 to 12 months, these larvae would develop into adult worms (microfilariae) that reside in fibrous sub-cutaneous nodules, located commonly around the iliac crest, the head, and torso [see figures]. Each nodule may contain one or two female worms and a single male that is usually smaller in size. Fertilized adult worms produce about 1000 to 1,500 microfilariae (L1 stages) daily and have a life span of 10 to 15 years.

These baby worms measure 250 to 300 microns and 8 microns in cross-section and live for 1 to 2 years.

At any given time, millions of microfilariae are moving through subcutaneous tissues and, to a lesser extent, the lymphatic system of an affected patient.
