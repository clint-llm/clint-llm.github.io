The sphenoid bone is a complicated structure in terms of its embryologic origin. This bone forms by the joining together of different primordia whose embryonic origins are dissimilar. The sphenoid bone has two distinct components. The cephalic mesoderm forms the basi-post-sphenoid and the orbitosphenoid, whereas the basi-pre-sphenoid and the alisphenoid have a neural crest cell origin. Several developmental diseases have links to the sphenoid bone, such as chordomas and trans-sphenoidal encephaloceles caused by the persistence of the craniopharyngeal canal. The first centers of ossification of the sphenoid appear in the eighth week of fetal life. These alae arise from the lateral walls of the skull. Later, the basisphenoid nuclei appear on the floor of the pituitary fossa while the lingulae appear between these two.
