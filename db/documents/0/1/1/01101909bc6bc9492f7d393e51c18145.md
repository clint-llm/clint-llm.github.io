**Adequacy of Informed Consent**

The required standard for informed consent is determined by the state. The three acceptable legal approaches to adequate informed consent are (1) Subjective standard: What would this patient need to know and understand to make an informed decision? (2) Reasonable patient standard: What would the average patient need to know to be an informed participant in the decision? (3) Reasonable physician standard: What would a typical physician say about this procedure?

Many states use the "reasonable patient standard" because it focuses on what a typical patient would need to know to understand the decision at hand. However, it is the sole obligation of the provider to determine which approach is appropriate for a given situation.

**Exceptions to Informed Consent**

Several exceptions to the requirement for informed consent include (1) the patient is incapacitated, (2) life-threatening emergencies with inadequate time to obtain consent, and (3) voluntary waived consent.  If the patient's ability to make decisions is questioned or unclear, an evaluation by a psychiatrist to determine competency may be requested. A situation may arise in which a patient cannot make decisions independently but has not designated a decision-maker. In this instance, the hierarchy of decision-makers, which is determined by each state's laws, must be sought to determine the next legal surrogate decision-maker. If this is unsuccessful, a legal guardian may need to be appointed by the court.

**Children and Informed Consent**

Children (typically under 17) cannot provide informed consent.  As such, parents must permit treatments or interventions. In this case, it not termed "informed consent" but "informed permission."  An exception to this rule is a legally emancipated child who may provide informed consent for himself. Some, but not all, examples of an emancipated minor include minors who are (1) under 18 and married, (2) serving in the military, (3) able to prove financial independence or (4) mothers of children (married or not). Legislation regarding minors and informed consent is state-based as well. It is important to understand the state laws.

**Informed Consent for Blood Transfusion**

Informed consent is essential to patient autonomy. Informed consent requires a thorough understanding of transfusions and the ability to convey this information to a patient in a way that they can understand it. However, obtaining consent often has deficiencies in the explanation where benefits may not be entirely true and risks related are omitted.

The types of transfusions and their indications are:

- Red blood cells

- Acute blood loss of greater than 1,500 mL or 30% of blood volume or acute blood loss causing hemodynamic instability
- Symptomatic anemia (myocardial ischemia, orthostatic hypotension, dyspnea at rest, tachycardia that is not responsive to fluid resuscitation) when hemoglobin is less than 10 g/dL
- Hemoglobin of less than 7 g/dL in asymptomatic patients, hemodynamically stable patients in intensive care, and patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery
- Hemoglobin of less than 8 g/dL in patients with cardiovascular disease or postoperatively

- Fresh frozen plasma

- Can be used for apheresis in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic uremic syndrome
- Acute disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with active bleeding
- Emergent reversal of warfarin in major or intracranial hemorrhage, prophylactically in an emergent surgical procedure
- An International Normalized Ratio > 1.6 in hereditary clotting factor deficiencies, preventing active bleeding in a patient on anticoagulants prior to an invasive procedure, or with active bleeding

- Platelets

- Platelet count of < 10,000/mL in stable patients without active bleeding
- < 20,000/mL stable patients without active bleeding with fever or are undergoing an invasive procedure
- < 50,000/mL in surgery with active bleeding
- ≤ 50,000/mL in major surgery or invasive procedure without active bleeding
- ≤ 100,000/mL in ocular surgery or neurosurgery without active bleeding

- Cryoprecipitate

- Hemorrhage after cardiac surgery
- Surgical bleeding
- Massive transfusion

- Massive transfusion protocol

Adverse effects of transfusions

- Acute hemolytic reaction

- The recipient's antibodies attack transfused red blood cells whether caused by a reaction to the ABO blood group or antibodies produced from previous transfusions. Acute hemolytic transfusions occur within 24 hours of transfusion. Symptoms include fever, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, hypotension, bleeding, pain at the infusion site, oliguria, anuria, dyspnea, or chest or back pain.

- Allergic reaction

- It can present ranging from mild to life-threatening allergic reactions. Patients with mild symptoms may present with hives. More severe reactions will present with hypotension, angioedema, stridor, respiratory distress, or shock. These symptoms usually present within seconds to minutes of beginning a transfusion.

- Febrile nonhemolytic reaction

- A febrile nonhemolytic reaction is an increase in temperature of at least 1° Celcius during or shortly after a transfusion. It is caused by an inflammatory response to cytokines from the donor.

- Mistransfusion

- This can occur if blood products are labeled incorrectly. This can be avoided by making sure the blood bank and the health care worker initiating the transfusion check the blood product to assure it is for the correct patient.

- Transfusion-associated circulatory overload

- Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) is caused by the rapid infusion of blood products which overwhelms the recipient's circulatory system. Patients may present with tachycardia, hypertension, dyspnea, and cough. Patients will have pulmonary edema on chest radiography as well as elevated brain natriuretic peptide levels.

- Transfusion-related acute lung injury

- Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is caused by an activation of the recipient's immune system causing massive noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that causes hypoxemia. TRALI occurs within 6 hours of a transfusion. Patients will present with respiratory distress, usually within 1 to 2 hours of initiating a transfusion. Patients will have pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography.

- Delayed hemolytic reaction

- Delayed hemolytic reactions occur more than 24 hours after a transfusion is completed. They usually occur days to weeks after the transfusion. The symptoms of a delayed hemolytic reaction are often gradual and less severe compared to an acute reaction.

- Over and under transfusion

- Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease

- Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is caused by donor lymphocytes in blood products proliferating and mounting an attack against the recipient's tissues and organs. It is most common in immunocompromised or in patients receiving a transfusion with shared HLA haplotypes. Symptoms of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease are fever, diarrhea, rash, liver dysfunction, and pancytopenia. Transfusion-associated GVHD has a mortality rate of 90%.

- Transfusion-related immunomodulation

- Transfusion-related immunomodulation is the immunosuppressive effect of transfused blood products leading to postoperative infection, tumor recurrence, and nosocomial infection in critically ill patients.

- Infection or contamination
