Otosclerosis (oto, “of the ear,” and sclerosis, “abnormal hardening of body tissue”), also known as otospongiosis, is an abnormal bone remodeling in the middle ear. The normal dense endochondral layer of the bony otic capsule in the labyrinth is replaced by irregularly laid spongy bone leading to the fixation of the stapes.
