Injury from mechanical ventilation and reactive oxygen species to premature lungs in the presence of antenatal factors predisposing the lungs to BPD form the basis of pathogenesis of BPD in preterm neonates. This myriad of events leads to an exaggerated inflammatory response with an increase in proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin(IL)-6, IL 8, tumor necrosis factor alpha etc along with growth factors (transforming growth factor ) and angiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin 2) which ultimately results in aberrant tissue repair and arrest in lung development. Dysregulated vascular and arrested alveolar development form the basis of the pathology seen in “new BPD.”
