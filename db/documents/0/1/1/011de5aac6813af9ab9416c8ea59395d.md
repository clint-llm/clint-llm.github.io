**Preoperative Evaluation:**Coagulation indices, including prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), platelet counts should be evaluated before the procedure. Patients with pre-procedure platelet counts of less than 100 000/m and an APPT ratio or PT ratio of more than 1.4 need a hematologist consultation and is a relative contraindication for the procedure. Oral anticoagulants must be stopped before the procedure in the case of PTLB as per the guidelines for perioperative anticoagulation.

For patients with FEV, less than 35% predicted on recent spirometry should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team with a radiologist and pulmonologist as a minimum should be consulted to assess the risk vs. benefit of going ahead with the procedure. Recent as well as previous radiographs must be available to decide if the procedure is beneficial. In the case of a bronchoscopic biopsy, the procedure should not be performed within six weeks of myocardial infarction.

The details of the procedure must be explained to the patient and be provided in written form. Written informed consent before the procedure must be obtained. Adequate staff should be arranged to monitor the patient before, during, and after the procedure.
