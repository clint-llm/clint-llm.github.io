Hearing loss in the elderly is extremely common. Overall, hearing loss in the elderly has a large impact on the quality of life in the elderly. The WHO ranks hearing loss as the second-largest handicap among the elderly with a considerable impact on quality of life. The burden of hearing loss in the elderly creates a significant financial burden. It is estimated to account for more than three billion dollars in excess medical expenditures per year in the United States alone.

Hearing loss in the elderly has independently shown an increased correlation with multiple co-morbidities. In particular, the relationship that appears between ARHL and dementia is of significant prognostic impact. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that ARHL and dementia had the highest population attributable fraction or risk attributed to hearing loss.

To date, no treatment reverses ARHL. However, management of hearing loss is correlated with improved quality of life and social functioning, thereby demonstrating the importance of proper early diagnosis and management. Since many causes of hearing loss in the elderly, including ARHL, are often irreversible, early diagnosis, treatment, and education are critical to best help patients with hearing loss.
