**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of hemifacial microsomia.
- Review the classification and stratification of hemifacial microsomia.
- Outline the anesthetic considerations based on the extent of the disease.
- Summarize peri-operative considerations taken by the interprofessional team for hemifacial microsomia.
