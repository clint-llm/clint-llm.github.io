When patients present to the emergency department physician, primary care provider and nurse practitioner with gallstones, they should be educated about the options of treatment. While laparoscopic cholecystectomy is now the standard of care, patients should be informed about the possibility of conversion to an open procedure. The risk of injury to the bile duct is always a possibility depending on the experience of the surgeon. For those patients who are asymptomatic, it is important to recommend a healthy low-fat diet, maintenance of low body weight and regular exercise.
