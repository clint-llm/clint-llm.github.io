Surgery consultation should be utilized without delay, as many small bowel obstruction patients require surgical management. Initial treatment of small bowel obstruction involves fluid resuscitation, pain control, antibiotics, and, often, nasogastric decompression. Antibiotics of choice for small bowel obstruction should target gut flora and cover both gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.

Ileus and partial small bowel obstructions can often be treated conservatively with nasogastric decompression. Surgical consultation should still be sought, but surgical intervention may not be required.
