The gracilis is a spiral unipennate muscle in the medial thigh compartment. It is innervated by the anterior branch of the obturator nerve. It receives its vascular supply from the medial circumflex, superficial femoral, deep femoral, descending genicular, and the anterior branch of the obturator artery.
