A complete blood count (CBC) and an antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer should be obtained prior to initiating therapy and periodically during therapy. In 95-100% of HILS, the serum ANA titer is positive. Abnormal hematologic findings to be aware of in HILS includes anemia, leukopenia, and/or agranulocytosis.

If the patient develops arthralgias, fever, chest pain, continued malaise, hematologic findings mentioned above, or other unexplained signs or symptoms related to DILE, the drug should be discontinued immediately, and corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive therapy should be considered in life-threatening cases.
