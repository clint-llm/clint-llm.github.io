The most common complication of autotransfusion is blood loss if not properly connected. A common finding is chest tube placement, in which blood is found to be expressed and then wasted. The more serious complication includes blood contamination resulting in infection.

Other less common complications that merit consideration include hemodilution, hemolysis due to suction or degradation, air embolism, contamination of activated leukocytes, and thrombocytopenia.
