The best thing to minimize the damage caused by the burn is to properly manage the burn wound while at the incident site and on the way to the hospital. The following measures should be taken to lessen the damage:

- Stop the burning process.

- Remove all burned clothes. Hot clothing may cause a deeper injury. If clothing sticks to the skin, cut or tear around it.

- Pour cool water over burned areas. Do this for 3 to 5 minutes (30 to 40 minutes for a chemical burn).

- Do not pack the burned areas in ice. This may cause more damage and hypothermia.

- Remove all jewelry, belts, and tight clothing. Burned areas will swell immediately. If the victim’s neck is burned, make sure nothing is around it.

- Do not apply ointments or other home remedies to bad burns. These may cause serious infections.

- Cover burns with a clean, dry bandage or sheet.

- Keep the victim warm.

- Seek medical attention immediately.
