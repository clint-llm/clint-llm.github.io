Initial management of thyroid nodules depends on the type of lesion found, US characteristics, and whether it is functional or not. FNA results will ultimately guide treatment.

FNA cytology results provide 6 major diagnostic categories (Bethesda classification), all of which indicate different subsequent management.

- Non-diagnostic: Cancer risk 5% to 10%

- Benign: Cancer risk 0% to 3%

- Atypia of undetermined significance or follicular lesion of undetermined significance: Cancer risk 10 to 30%

- Follicular neoplasm (or suspicious for follicular neoplasm): Cancer risk 25% to 40%

- Suspicious for malignancy: Cancer risk 50% to 75%

- Malignant: Cancer risk 97% to 99%

Non-diagnostic biopsies (Bethesda I) are considered cytologically inadequate. The absence of malignant cells should not be interpreted as a negative biopsy if scant follicular tissue is obtained. FNA is usually repeated in 4 to 6 weeks.

Patients with benign nodules (Bethesda II), such as macrofollicular, colloid adenomas, nodular goiter, and Hashimoto thyroiditis, are usually followed without surgery. Periodic US monitoring initially at 12 to 24 months, with increasing intervals, is preferred. If the US shows highly suspicious findings, then FNA should be repeated within 12 months despite a benign initial biopsy.

For nodules with indeterminate cytology (Bethesda III and IV), the approach varies with institutional practices. Some institutions obtain an additional FNA sample for molecular testing, while other centers repeat the FNA after 6 to 12 weeks. A radionuclide scan may also be obtained if repeat aspirates show only architectural atypia.

For nodules that fall within the category of Bethesda V, suspicious for malignancy, treatment should include surgery. Molecular markers should not be used. Bethesda VI includes papillary cancer, MTC, thyroid lymphoma, anaplastic cancer, and cancer metastatic to the thyroid. These patients should also be referred for surgery.
