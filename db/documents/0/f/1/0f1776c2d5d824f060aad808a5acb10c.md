The precise dose of colchicine that results in significant toxicity is unknown. Toxicity has occurred after the ingestion of a dose as low as 7 mg over four days, while other patients survived after taking more than 60 mg. In a review of 150 patients with a colchicine overdose, there was 100% mortality in those who ingested over 0.8 mg/kg.

Acute colchicine toxicity usually begins within 24 hours of ingestion and includes gastrointestinal symptoms, eventually leading to significant fluid loss and volume depletion. In this initial phase, peripheral leukocytosis may also be present. Life-threatening complications often occur 24 to 72 hours after drug administration and are usually attributed to multi-organ failure. Death is typically a result of respiratory depression and cardiovascular collapse.

Treatment of colchicine poisoning should start with gastric lavage and measures to prevent shock.Â  Otherwise, treatment is symptomatic and supportive. There is no known specific antidote, and colchicine is not effectively removed by dialysis.
