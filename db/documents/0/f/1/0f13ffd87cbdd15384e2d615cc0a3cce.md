Treatment objectives are to prevent morbidity and mortality by killing the bacilli and interrupt transmission.

**Antitubercular Therapy**

Antitubercular therapy is the treatment of choice against mycobacterial tuberculosis in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Treatment modality may be different for HIV positive patients because HIV infected patients have more bacteria resistant to isoniazid and streptomycin.

HIV-infected patients should have a longer duration of antitubercular therapy along with antiretroviral therapy addressing the drug interaction and adverse effects. Monitoring of treatment responses and drug toxicity should be done regularly to make complete and effective therapy.

**Surgical Aspiration, Incision and Drainage, and Excision**

Excision and removal of affected lymph nodes may be sufficient to treat scrofula in immunocompetent patients if no concomitant pulmonary TB and other associated extrapulmonary TB, especially in immunocompetent children infected by atypical mycobacteria.

**Corticosteroid**

The benefits of steroids in TB lymphadenitis are unknown, but double-blind controlled trials revealed improvements in those receiving a 37-day tapering dose of steroid. Steroids are used selectively in discomfort and are not widely recommended.

**BCG Vaccination and Prevention**

The best way to prevent TB is to rapidly diagnose and isolate cases and administer appropriate therapy until patients become noninfectious and completely cured. Additional strategies include Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination. BCG is a live attenuated vaccine that was first administered in 1921. In addition, providing protection against tuberculosis, it also modulates immune responses to other vaccines.
