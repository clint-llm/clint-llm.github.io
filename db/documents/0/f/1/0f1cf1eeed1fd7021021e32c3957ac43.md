Dextrocardia is a clinical condition characterized by the location of the heart on the right side of the chest cavity. Though isolated dextrocardia is a benign condition, it can often be associated with other congenital anomalies, which can lead to several problems such as failure to thrive, recurrent infections, and breathing difficulties in newborn and neonates. Adults with dextrocardia might also have accompanying infertility. Upon suspicion, a thorough evaluation that involves imaging and genetic analysisÂ is necessary to assess for other accompanying abnormalities.
