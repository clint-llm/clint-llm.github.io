If a thoracic procedure, such as VATS or lobectomy was done, then stapling the lung or pneumopexy of the lobe should beÂ considered to prevent lung torsion. Lung torsion is a diagnosis that must be made in a timely manner, classically done through radiologic imaging. Once a diagnosis is made, it is imperative to contact the thoracic surgical team to salvage the lung. Coordination and rapid, effective communication between interprofessional care team members is essential to ensure a timely diagnosis and correction of this potentially fatal disease.
