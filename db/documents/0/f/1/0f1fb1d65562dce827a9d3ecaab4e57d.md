The pathways of biotransformation are divided into phase I, phase II, and phase III. These reactions may occur simultaneously or sequentially.

**Phase I**: Yields a polar, water-soluble, metabolite that is often still active. Many of the products in this phase can also become substrates for phase II.

- Oxidation with cytochrome P450 (most common)

- Reduction

- Hydrolysis

**Phase II**: Yields a large polar metabolite by adding endogenous hydrophilic groups to form water-soluble inactive compounds that can be excreted by the body.

- Methylation

- Glucuronidation (most common)

- Acetylation

- Sulfation

- Conjugation with glutathione

- Conjugation with amino acids (glycine, taurine, and glutamic acid)

**Phase III:**Occurs post-phase II, where a chemical substance can undergo further metabolism and excretion.Â It classifies into the following superfamilies:

- ATP-binding cassette (ABC)

- Solute carrier (SLC) transporters
