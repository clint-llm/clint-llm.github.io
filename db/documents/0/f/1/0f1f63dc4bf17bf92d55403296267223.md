At this time, limited data provide direct indications; however, CCT/CCTA has been shown beneficial in the following scenarios.

- CCT - Evaluating an asymptomatic patient with a low-intermediate risk for stable ischemic heart disease.

- CCT - Evaluating an asymptomatic patient with an intermediate Framingham risk for aspirin, statin therapy.

- CCT - Evaluating for a degree of coronary arterial stenosis.

- CCTA - Prosthetic valve interrogation, pre-procedural risk stratification.

- CCTA - Evaluating an intermediate-risk patient for ACS.

- CCTA - Noninvasive view of a coronary stent, coronary bypass graft patency.

- CCTA - Noninvasive approach to rule out congenital coronary anomalies.
