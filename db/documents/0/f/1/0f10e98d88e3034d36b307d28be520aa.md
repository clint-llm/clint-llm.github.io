Risk factors for disease progression include clinical factors such as hypertension, reduced glomerular filtration rate at the time of renal biopsy, or persistent proteinuria on follow-up) and pathological risk factors as based on the Oxford classification. According to Oxford classification, the following parameters provide prognostic information: mesangial hypercellularity, endocapillary hypercellularity, segmental glomerulosclerosis, and tubular atrophy. Poor prognosis is associated with a glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL per minute, proteinuria greater than 0.5 g per day, hypertension greater than 140/90 mm Hg, more than 50% glomeruli affected by mesangial hypercellularity. Other prognostic histologic factors indicative of progression to end-stage renal disease are the presence ofÂ segmental glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and endocapillary proliferation. It is estimated that about half of all patients eventually develop end-stage renal disease within 20 years after diagnosis. IgA nephropathy is the main cause of end-stage renal disease secondary to primary glomerular disease.
