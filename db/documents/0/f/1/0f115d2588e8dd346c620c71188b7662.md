Patient education about the proper care of wounds and the risk of recurrence is necessary to improve the quality of life of the patients. Reducing hospital visits and increasing the ulcer-free duration is the goal. Long term surveillance and information sharing can maximize the results of the care provided. Sharing articles written in plain and easy to understand language is the key to successful communication. Health care providers should be encouraged to provide necessary information available on various platforms.
