A significant function of the cardiovascular system is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues via arteries and their branches. Subsequently, the venous system receives carbon dioxide and other waste products expelled by the tissues. A vital transition point exists between the arterioles and the venules known as the capillary, which is ultimately where the exchange occurs. In short, capillaries are thin-walled vessels that allow for the transportation of nutrients and metabolites from the vasculature and into the interstitium to be taken up by cells. Capillaries are ubiquitously organized throughout the human body and exert their function in every tissue. This article strives to illustrate the anatomical characteristics of the capillary and its function in meeting the metabolic demands of tissues and demonstrate features that are evident upon histological staining.
