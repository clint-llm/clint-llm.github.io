It is essential to educate the patient about the possible side effect of using pertechnetate and the need for a retest in case of a negative result, especially in situations with high suspicion of Meckel's diverticulum. Epinephrine administration can be via subcutaneous, intramuscular, or in severe conditions, intravenous, in case of anaphylaxis. In the case of inadequate response to antihistamine, aminophylline is an option. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommends interruption of breastfeeding for 12 h after administration of 99mTc-pertechnetate.
