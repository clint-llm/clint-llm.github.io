Acute interstitial nephritis typically presents with non-oliguric acute kidney injury, but oliguria can be present. The latent period between drug exposure and renal failure onset could be several weeks to months (e.g., NSAIDs) if the patient were naive to the drug. In contrast, a second exposure to the drug can lead to renal manifestations within a matter of a few days.

Patients may remain asymptomatic or have non-specific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, malaise, and flank pain. In a case series of 121 patients with AIN, 40% developed dialysis requiring renal failure. The other specific clinical features may be related to the AIN's underlying etiology, such as sarcoidosis or SLE. Drug-induced AIN typically presents with an allergic-type reaction with a skin rash, low-grade fever, and eosinophilia, though all three manifestations are infrequently present in a patient.

The extrarenal manifestations of infection-associated AIN are mostly specific to infectious disease. Similarly, AIN's clinical features associated with systemic disorders correlate with the spectrum of that particular disorder (e.g., SLE, sarcoidosis, or Sjogrens). TINU is associated with bilateral uveitis and renal failure in young children and adolescents.
