Organophosphates (OP) are chemical substances produced by the process of esterification between phosphoric acid and alcohol. Organophosphates can undergo hydrolysis with the liberation of alcohol from the ester bond. These chemicals are the main components of herbicides, pesticides, and insecticides. OPs are also the main components of nerve gas. Acute or chronic exposure to organophosphates can produce varying toxicity levels in humans, animals, plants, and insects. Organophosphates also are widely used in the production of plastics and solvents.

From the clinical perspective, OPs are of interest because of the toxicity produced from exposure. Nerve gas and organophosphate pesticides (OPP) are particularly important from a clinical standpoint because of the cholinergic symptoms produced from exposure.
