Plasma cells are differentiated B-lymphocyte white blood cells capable of secreting immunoglobulin or antibodies. These cells play a significant role in the adaptive immune response, namely, being the main cells responsible for humoral immunity. Without their presence, an individual is said to have agammaglobulinemia and is highly susceptible to recurrent infection. Here the hematopoietic lineage, structure, and function of plasma cells are reviewed, along with the clinical presentations arising from improper plasma cell growth and development.
