Fibric acids are FDA indicated to treat patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. In adults, they reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Fibric acids should be used in conjunction with restricting cholesterol and fat intake and exercise if the response to diet and nonpharmacological interventions alone has been inadequate. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of fibrate drugs so that providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the indications for using fibric acid derivatives.
- Outline the mechanism of action of fibric acid derivatives.
- Review the potential adverse events and contraindications when initiating therapy with fibric acid derivatives.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients receiving a fibric acid derivative drug.
