Both zero and first-order kinetics derive from the same equation. As seen in "EquationÂ  No. 1 "Kinetic order elimination equation," where delta [drug] represents the change in plasma concentration of the drug divided by time, "n" represents either first or zero-order elimination with 1 or 0, respectively, and "-Kc" represents a constant. For example, when n = 1, the change in drug plasma concentration divided by time is proportional to the amount of drug initially given, showing the rate-limiting factor being the initial concentration. In contrast, when n = 0, [Drug]^0 = equal 1, the change of drug plasma concentration is equal to the constant, -Kc. Thus demonstrating how the rate-limiting factor is time.

The same principles with zero and first-order kinetics are demonstrable on a graph. As seen in "Graph 1: Zero-order kinetics", regardless of the plasma concentration of a substance, the same amount is limited over 2 hours. Thus, the graph demonstrates a linear slope. In comparison to "Graph 2: First-order kinetics," the exponential curve of the graph illustrates how a larger plasma concentration implies a larger amount eliminated in a 2-hour time span.
