Though superficial fungal infections are very common worldwide, tinea barbae is relatively uncommon. Tinea barbae was first reported in 1842 by Gruby,

Due to the rarity of the disease, predicting a true incidence or lifetime risk is difficult.Â The distribution of dermatophytes is worldwide, and so are the cases of tinea barbae that were reported in the literature. Since tinea barbae is an infection of hair and hair follicles of the beard and mustache area, it is exclusively seen in adolescent boys and men. In an extreme rarity, a case of tinea barbae has been reported in a hirsute woman in a longitudinal study from Portugal.
