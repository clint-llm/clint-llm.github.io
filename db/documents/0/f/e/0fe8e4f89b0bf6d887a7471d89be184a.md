Surgery in the head and neck region necessitates knowledge of the intricate anatomy of the region involved. Additionally, the surgeon needs to keep in mind the possible anatomical variations that exist. The surgeon must consider the potential aberrant origin of branches. For detailed vascular imaging, computed tomography angiography (CT) is most commonly employed.

Thyroidectomy can be complicated by bleeding due to an injury of the ITA. In such cases, ligation of the proximal ITA can mitigate the bleeding.

From a surgical point of view, the thyrocervical trunk merits consideration as an area of interest for neurologists and angiologists. The thyrocervical trunk can be involved for endovascular procedures such as embolizations (embolization is an interventional radiology intervention, which involves selective occlusion of some blood vessels); paragangliomas or glomus tumors (benign tumors that originate from some corpuscles responsible for controlling blood pressure distributed along the course of some nerves at the level of the middle ear and the cranial base); cervical vertebral metastasis; hemangioblastoma (rare, benign, highly vascularized tumor of the central nervous system, most commonly located in the cerebellum or spinal cord, onset in adulthood, or other non-cerebral sites); aneurysms; vertebral aneurysmal bone cyst (is a bone hamartoma (malformation) which consists of reactive hemorrhagic tissue that grows inside a bone).
