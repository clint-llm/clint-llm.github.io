Vernal keratoconjunctivitis is a common bilateral atopic disease clinically characterized by limbal papillae (Horner Tranta dots) having papillary, limbal, and mixed forms. The most consistent presentation is itching, and the episodes are often recurrent, usually perennial in the beginning, and become chronic over time. The males are more often affected than females. Histopathology shows eosinophils in the conjunctival secretions. The treatment comprises topical antihistamines and mast cell inhibitors. Topical steroids might be needed to control acute episodes. This activity discusses the varied clinical presentations, evaluation, and treatment of vernal keratoconjunctivitis. This activity also describes the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients affected by this entity.
