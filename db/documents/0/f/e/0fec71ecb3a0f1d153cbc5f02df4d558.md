Experienced Mohs and plastic surgeons commonly use the island pedicle advancement flap to close defects to preserve function and optimize cosmesis. The island pedicle flap is similar to other standard advancement flaps in which the primary tension vector is parallel to the direction of the advancing pedicle. Therefore, an indication for using the island pedicle flap includes closing defects in areas where the surgeon needs to preserve a tension vector that remains parallel with the wound. Additionally, the size and location of the defect dictate the utility of the island flap closure.

The island pedicle technique is particularly suitable for several cosmetic units of the face, including the junction of the upper lip, nose, medial canthus, cheek, and even the ear.

Because the island pedicle advancement flap relies on a subcutaneous vascular stalk to preserve the tissue, the flap remains impervious to ischemia.
