Patients who undergo splenectomy are at a higher risk of infection and overwhelming sepsis. Therefore, post-splenectomy vaccines should be administered to ensure their protection from encapsulated bacteria, which include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Hemophilus influenzae.

Children receive penicillin V (250 mg/day) for at least two years, and life-long antibiotic therapy is recommended for high-risk patients.

Beware that patients with splenic injuries may worsen during the hours or days following initial trauma and should be carefully monitored.

Caution: Since the contrast agent diffuses relatively slowly through the pulp of the spleen and may appear as a defect in enhancement, these may be misinterpreted as splenic injury.
