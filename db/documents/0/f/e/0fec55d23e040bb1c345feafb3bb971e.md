The evaluation of a talar neck fracture should begin with plain radiographic imaging with an appropriate plain-film X-ray series consisting of anteroposterior (AP), lateral, and Canale views. The Canale view provides the best visualization of the talar neck. It is obtained by angling the x-ray beam 75 degrees from the horizontal and positioning the foot in maximum equinus with varying degrees of eversion (usually 15).

In 1970, Dr. Leland Hawkins published a now landmark paper in which he described a classification system for talar neck fractures.

- Hawkins I: nondisplaced fracture

- Hawkins II: fracture with an associated subtalar dislocation

- Hawkins III: fracture with associated subtalar and tibiotalar dislocation

- Hawkins IV: fracture with associated subtalar, tibiotalar, and talonavicular dislocations

The value of a classification system rests on its ability to predict outcomes or guide treatment. The Hawkins classification has been shown to be prognostic in nature, with more severe injury (Hawkins IV) having a higher rate of osteonecrosis.

- Hawkins I: 0 to 13% AVN

- Hawkins II: 20 to 50% AVN

- Hawkins III: 20 to 100% AVN

- Hawkins IV: 70 to 100% AVN
