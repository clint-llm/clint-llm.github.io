The pathophysiology of bullous emphysema is intimately related to the chronic inflammation of the distal airspaces mostly secondary to insult, i.e., cigarette smoke, which results in a breakdown of the alveolar walls which subsequently leads to permanent enlargement of airspaces.  Eventually, this can lead to a decline in gas exchange and an airflow limitation through decreased elastic recoil of the chest wall.  There is often an increased amount of goblet cells in the airways with hyperplasia of the mucous glands, fibrosis, and airway collapse secondary to the loss of tethering from alveolar destruction.  This decrease in gas exchange and airflow limitation eventually leads to chronic hypoxia and hypercarbia in these patients.
