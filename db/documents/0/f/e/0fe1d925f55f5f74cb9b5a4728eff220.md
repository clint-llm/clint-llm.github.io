Although necrotizing periodontal diseases are infectious conditions, immunosuppression is the most critical predisposing factor. Cases of necrotizing gingivitis and necrotizing periodontitis are almost always found in patients with an immunosuppressed condition, most notably HIV. A CD4 count of less than 200 in an HIV-positive patient is more strongly linked to necrotizing periodontitis than any other risk factor.

Other contributing factors include tobacco smoking, unusual psychological stress, severe malnutrition, poor sleeping habits, and poor oral hygiene. Most cases of NPDs are seen in patients that are tobacco smokers. Malnutrition has been shown to be an important risk factor. In developed countries, NPDs are associated with populations who display poor eating habits, such as college students, whereas, in developing countries, they are associated with young children with deficient protein intake.

Virulent bacteria, specifically Fusobacteria, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Treponema sp, have been identified in the necrotic lesions associated with NPDs.

A limited understanding exists surrounding the actual cause of necrotizing periodontal diseases; however, evidence points to an existing periodontal condition that is given the opportunity to proliferate into a more rapid and destructive state.
