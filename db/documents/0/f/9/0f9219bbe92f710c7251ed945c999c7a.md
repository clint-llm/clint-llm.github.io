It is often challenging to differentiate X-linked agammaglobulinemia from other conditions clinically; thus, a careful investigation should be performed to rule them out. These other conditions include common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy (THI), autosomal-recessive agammaglobulinemia (ARA), and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). All of these conditions have low/absent B cells and their associated antibody response. However, further lab testing provides clues that support the diagnosis of XLA, such as:

- A patient with SCID has a low T cell count as compared to XLA with a normal T cell count.

- Generally, observations show that patients with XLA have fewer B cells than those with CVID; however, these differences are not absolute.

- In THI, there is low serum IgG with or without decreased IgA and IgM levels. Children usually grow out of this, with normal immunoglobulin levels by age four. One of the proposed causes for THI is the suppressive effect of maternal antibodies (IgG) that affect fetal immunoglobulin production.

Eventually, genetic testing for the BTK gene mutation will differentiate XLA from other conditions.
