The use of alprostadil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men has correlations with prolonged erection, and sometimes priapism.Â The incidence of priapism as an adverse effect of alprostadil is more common with the intraurethral suppository, and priapism is a genitourinary emergency that requires detailed evaluation. The evaluation is primarily based on physical exam and possibly with the help of penile ultrasonography and penile blood gas analysis. Some of the management techniques include aspiration of cavernosal blood, cold saline irrigation, and penile injections with sympathomimetic agents.
