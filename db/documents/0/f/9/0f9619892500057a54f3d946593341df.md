Beta-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid, are an essential tool for treating bacterial infections capable of producing beta-lactamase. To prevent an increase in antibiotic resistance, it is critical to administer this drug only to patients infected with beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.

It is also crucial that pharmacists, nurses, and physicians work together as an interprofessional team to make sure the drug is administered safely and in the appropriate setting to avoid adverse effects or reactions to clavulanic acid and amoxicillin. Clinicians are responsible for initial agent selection, but the pharmacist can weigh in after performing medication reconciliation and verifying dosing. Nursing will often be responsible for administration instructions, confirmed by the pharmacist, and can follow up to assess compliance as well as the effectiveness of the regimen. Any deviations from expected in the above should be reported to the prescribing/ordering clinician. In this manner, the entire interprofessional team can guide and participate in the antimicrobial regimen to optimize patient results. [Level 5]
