Below we discuss normal and abnormal findings in native adult joints. It is important to note that cell count thresholds vary in joints with previous hardware such as post-traumatic fixation with hardware or in cases of previous joint replacement.

**Native adult joint synovial fluid analysis****:**

According to the American Rheumatologic Association guidelines

- Non-inflammatory <200 to 2000 WBC/mm^3

- Inflammatory >2000 to 50,000 WBC/mm^3

- Infectious > 50,000 WBC/mm^3

**Differential with polymorphic nuclear cells (PMNs)**

- >75 percent PMNs indicative of bacterial joint infection

**Crystal Analysis: Gout and Pseudogout**

- Presence of monosodium urate crystals indicates a diagnosis of gout

- Presence of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals indicates a diagnosis of pseudogout

Gram stain and bacterial culture: synovial fluid aspirate is analyzed for gram stain and both aerobic and anaerobic culture to determine the presence of infection; the presence of any organism indicates abnormal findings.
