Phenazopyridine-induced methemoglobinemia is rare, and there have been fewer than 50 cases published since 1951. Methemoglobinemia is managed with standard treatment, methylene blue (1 to 2 mg/kg/dose administered IV as a 1% solution as needed) being the antidote of choice. Methylene blue should not be given to patients with known or suspected G6PD deficiency. It should also be avoided in patients taking antidepressants, as it increases the risk of serotonin syndrome.

In these cases, high-dose ascorbic acid is the recommended alternative antidote given intravenously. It is now known why phenazopyridine and other drugs, such as dapsone and chloroquine cause methemoglobinemia more frequently compared to other medications. Oxidative Heinz body hemolytic anemia also may precipitate, and "bite cells" (degmacytes) can be present in chronic overdosage incidents.

Renal toxicity, occasional renal failure, and/or hepatic impairment can occur in overdose patients.
