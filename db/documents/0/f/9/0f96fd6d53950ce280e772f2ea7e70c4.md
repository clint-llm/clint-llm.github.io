Endometrial carcinoma is among the more common (the fourth most common) cancers in women in developed countries. Every year around 65,000 females develop uterine cancer in the USA alone, out of which more than 90% is of endometrial origin. It is commonly diagnosed in the seventh decade, with the mean age being 61 years. The incidence in Black women is twice that of White women. In addition, Black women with uterine cancer carry a poorer prognosis as compared to White women.

Even though the death rates from other cancers in women are down, death rates from uterine cancer are increasing. Patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer are most commonly postmenopausal, although 15%-25% of patients are diagnosed before menopause.

About a quarter are diagnosed between 65 to74 years of age. Also, the percentage of deaths due to uterine cancer is highest amongst women of ages between 65 to 74 years (32%). There are multiple reasons for high mortality in this age group compared to the younger population, e.g., aggressive tumor, advanced disease, reluctance to surgical treatment options, and worse treatment outcomes.
