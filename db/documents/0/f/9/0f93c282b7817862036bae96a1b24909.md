Modified 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification defines over 14 types of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs):

- Clear cell RCC

- Multilocular cystic renal neoplasm of low malignant potential

- Papillary RCC

- Hereditary leiomyomatosis RCC

- Chromophobe RCC

- Collecting duct carcinoma

- Renal medullary carcinoma

- MiT Family translocation carcinomas

- Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) deficient RCC

- Mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma

- Tubulocystic RCC

- Acquired cystic disease-associated RCC

- Clear cell papillary RCC

- RCC, unclassified

Major subclasses include clear cell RCC (CCRCC), papillary RCC (PRCC), chromophobe RCC, collecting duct, and unclassified RCC. Xp11 translocation carcinoma is another distinct entity. Only the most common four subtypes will be discussed here.

**Clear Cell Carcinoma (CCRCC):**is the most common type (70-80%) of RCC. Sporadic tumors are usually single and unilateral, unlike the familial lesions, which may be multiple and bilateral. The cut surface is yellow due to large amounts of lipid in the cells, with large areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. The tumor has prominent and delicate vasculature with cystic and solid areas.

**Papillary Carcinoma (PRCC):**is about 10-15% of all renal cancers. Small tumors are often incidental findings and can be seen at autopsy. Unlike CCRCC, even sporadic tumors can be multifocal and bilateral. Grossly the tumor is well circumscribed and grayish-white and typically exhibits central necrosis and frequent hemorrhages. Histologically PRCC has two main subtypes. Type 1, are multifocal and characterized by papillae and tubular structures covered with small cells containing basophilic cytoplasm and small, uniform, oval nuclei. Type 2 has a heterogeneous pattern characterized by papillae covered with large cells containing eosinophilic cytoplasm and large, spherical nuclei with prominent nucleoli, suggesting a more aggressive tumor.

**Chromophobe Carcinoma (ChRCC):**constitute about 5% of all RCCs. They are thought to arise from intercalated cells of collecting ducts. The tumor presents as one or more nodules and has a lobulated surface. Tumor cut surface appears orange colored that turns to grayish-white on formalin fixation. The tumor pattern is solid mostly, occasionally cribriform, and may have focal calcifications. Histologically they are made up of basic chromophobe large polygonal cells that have a transparent slightly reticulated cytoplasm and perinuclear halos with thick-walled vasculature. They are difficult to distinguish from oncocytoma.

**Collecting Duct (Bellini duct) Carcinoma:**comprise about 1% or less of RCCs. They arise from cells in the medullary part of collecting ducts. There is no distinct molecular or genetic pattern. Histologically the tumor has irregular channels lined by highly atypical epithelium with a hobnail appearance arranged in glandular pattern enmeshed within a prominent fibrotic stroma. Bellini duct carcinoma needs to be distinguished from medullary carcinoma, which is associated with sickle cell trait.
