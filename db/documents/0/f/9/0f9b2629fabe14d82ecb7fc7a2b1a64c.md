Pathogenesis of cutaneous sarcoidosis is poorly understood and attributable to both genetic and environmental factors. A key role in the development of sarcoidosis is played by T cells as they promote cellular immune reaction and are usually associated with an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio. It is well characterized by noncaseating granuloma typically containing macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, and epithelioid cells, in addition to lymphocytes, monocytes, mast cells, and fibroblasts  There is a role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptors, as both are increased in this disease.  This has been evidenced by the role of anti-TNF agents, such as pentoxifylline and infliximab. In addition to T cell's role, B cell hyperreactivity with immunoglobulin production is implicated as well. Active sarcoidosis has also been associated with plasmatic hypergammaglobulinemia. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels correlated with elevated soluble HLA class I antigens levels in serum.
