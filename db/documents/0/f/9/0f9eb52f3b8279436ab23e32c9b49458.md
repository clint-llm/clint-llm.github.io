The compression of the pudendal nerve(s) is visible to the surgeon during decompression and transposition surgeries. The degree of compression may be severe. Congenital nerve compression is frequently noted when aberrant fascias are present, and the nerve travels through the sacrotuberous ligament. Acquired compressions include scarring after pelvic surgeries and suspected hematomas following repetitive serious falls, as in skiers, skaters, snowboarders, and other athletes. It is particularly common in cyclists.

A hypertrophied obturator internus muscle may compress the nerve in the pudendal canal. A dense, enlarged falciform process is seen in some athletes. Stretching of the nerve(s) is occasionally observed.
