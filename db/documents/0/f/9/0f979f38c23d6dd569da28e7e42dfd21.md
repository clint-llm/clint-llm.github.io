Free tissue transfer has become a common technique for breast reconstruction following oncologic resection. Free transverse rectus abdominis muscle (TRAM) flaps are one option for autologous breast reconstruction. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of patients with a deficit of breast tissue following oncologic resection who wish to undergo autologous breast reconstruction using free transverse rectus abdominis flaps and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the vascular anatomy of the rectus abdominis muscle and the overlying abdominal skin.
- Identify the indications and contraindications for autologous breast reconstruction.
- Describe the muscle-sparing options for free transverse rectus abdominis flaps.
- Outline how interprofessional teams can improve the post-operative monitoring of patients who have undergone autologous breast reconstruction with free transverse rectus abdominis muscle flaps.
