Serotonin syndrome (SS) or toxicity (ST) is a combination of hyper-serotonergic stimulation on CNS and visceral organs, resulting from a patient receiving a combination of 5-HT elevating drugs or an overdose.

The predominant diagnostic criteria consider the patients' presentation depends on symptoms or signs reflecting the neuromuscular, autonomic, and mental manifestations of SS.

**Neuromuscular**

- Tremor

- Hyperreflexia

- Myoclonus

- Babinski sign

- hypertonia

**Autonomic**

- Mydriasis

- Diaphoresis

- Tachycardia

- Tachypnea

- Hyperthermia

- Vomiting

- Arrhythmias

**Neurological**

- Agitation

- Excitement

- Insomnia

- Confusion

- Anxiety

The severity assessment is based on the type and extent of manifestations, formulating a mild, moderate, and severe SS spectrum. The mild presentation (e.g., nervousness, insomnia, tremors), the moderate (e.g., hyperreflexia with or without clonus, agitation, horizontal nystagmus), and severe might lead to stupor, coma, and rarely death.
