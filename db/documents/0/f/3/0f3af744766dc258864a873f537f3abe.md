A maturation defect causes the developing cell to have an imbalance between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The result will be an RBC precursor with more cytoplasm compared to the nucleus. Binucleate cells and macro-ovalocytes may be found on a peripheral smear. Large leukocytes and platelets may also be observed. Leukocytes may show nuclear abnormalities such as hypersegmentation.
