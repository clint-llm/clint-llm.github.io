The evaluation of coronary artery fistulas begins with the auscultation of a continuous murmur over the lower precordium. Initial diagnostic exams could include chest radiography and electrocardiography (EKG). Although these modalities do not yield a sufficient diagnosis, they are helpful in uncovering any ensuing complications. For example, ST-segment changes on an EKG could be indicative of acute myocardial infarction or chronic myocardial ischemia. Chest radiography would be able to assess volume overload.

Studies have shown that transthoracic echocardiograms (TTE) are able to visualize hemodynamically significant coronary artery fistulas, but were not helpful in determining sites of origin and termination. TTEs were sufficient to diagnose this disease in children. Doppler echocardiography was also useful in pinpointing dilated or tortuous arteries and helping map out the blood flow. A greater than usual flow is usually seen at the origin and termination points of the fistula. Also, inappropriate blood flow into the right/left chambers of the heart can be seen through Doppler echocardiography. Transesophageal echocardiograms (TEE) were helpful in assessing turbulent blood flow and delineating the origin and insertion points of the fistulas in adults.

Undoubtedly, coronary catheterization and subsequent coronary angiography are the gold standards in diagnosing coronary artery fistulas. In general, studies have shown that aortic root angiograms should be done initially to help guide the next step in management. This initial step will help in selecting the most appropriate coronary artery to undergo angiography. The next step is for each of the arteries to selectively undergo coronary angiography, with the goal of establishing sites of origination and termination as well as estimating the amount of blood flow.
