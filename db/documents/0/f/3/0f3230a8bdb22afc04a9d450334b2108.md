ARB drugs target one of the critical elements of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). In the progression of the RAAS, angiotensin II binds to AT1 receptors, which are highly expressed in vascular tissues and the adrenal gland, causing significant vasoconstriction.

In addition to binding to AT1 receptors, angiotensin II binds to angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptors. The action of angiotensin II bound to AT2 receptors produces effects opposite of AT1 receptors, such as natriuresis, blood pressure-lowering, and reduction of vasoconstriction in the vasculature.

ARB drugs, such as azilsartan, provide an alternate and highly effective option in treating blood pressure involving the RAAS pathway. Many first-line options for antihypertensive treatment include ACE inhibitors, which come with associated side effects related to the ACE drug target (a dry cough, angioedema).
