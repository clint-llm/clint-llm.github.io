Thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1 helps to distinguish if a tumor is a lung primary. Increasingly, molecular diagnostic studies are being performed to determine the presence ofÂ certain gene alterations in the tumor such as EGFR mutations, ALK gene rearrangements, ROS1 rearrangements, and PD-L1 expression. There is increasing evidence to show that such tumors with these specific gene mutations or alterations can respond to targeted therapies.
