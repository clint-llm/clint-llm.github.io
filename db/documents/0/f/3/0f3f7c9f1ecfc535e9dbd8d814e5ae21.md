Prognosis depends on the cause of arthritis. If treated early and appropriately, acute inflammatory arthropathies such as septic arthritis or crystal-induced arthritis have an excellent prognosis. Delay in treatment or misdiagnosis can lead to erosions and permanent joint damage, which can be aggressive, especially in septic arthritis. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or seronegative spondyloarthritis, early and aggressive treatment can prevent long-term complications such as erosions and joint deformities. The prognosis of inflammatory arthritis associated with underlying connective tissue disorders depends on the underlying disorder.
