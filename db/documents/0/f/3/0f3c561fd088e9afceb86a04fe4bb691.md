Scleroderma (encompassing localized scleroderma and the more serious form of systemic sclerosis) is a relatively rare autoimmune connective tissue disease (CTD) that predominantly affects women aged 30 to 50 years. It affects between 75,000 and 100,000 people in the US and is more common in people who have family members with other autoimmune CTDs.[American College of Rheumatology. Scleroderma. Fast Facts.]

Scleroderma, particularly systemic sclerosis (SSc), is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Of great concern is an elevated risk of developing the potentially life-threatening complication of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). PAH is a chronic, progressive type of pulmonary hypertension (PH) characterized by abnormally high pressure in the pulmonary vasculature.

Rates of PAH in patients with SSc are substantially higher than rates in the general population. The overall prevalence of PAH is about 5 to 15 cases per million and is more common in women than men.
