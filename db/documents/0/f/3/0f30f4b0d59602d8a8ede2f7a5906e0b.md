Gestational choriocarcinoma and non-gestational choriocarcinoma have different prognoses, with non-gestational choriocarcinoma having a much worse prognosis.

Low-risk gestational choriocarcinoma has almost 100% survival in women treated with chemotherapy, and high-risk gestational choriocarcinoma patients have 91% to 93% survival when utilizing multi-agent chemotherapy with or without radiation and surgery. Adverse risk factors making death more likely include stage IV disease or a cumulative score greater than 12 in women.

In men with mixed germ cell tumors, increasing amounts of choriocarcinoma portend a worse prognosis, with pure choriocarcinomas having the worst prognosis in testicular germ cell neoplasms. An hCG greater than 50,000 mIU/ml also correlates to a worse prognosis in men.

Intra-placental choriocarcinoma with metastasis to the infant carries a very poor prognosis, with less than 20% survival.
