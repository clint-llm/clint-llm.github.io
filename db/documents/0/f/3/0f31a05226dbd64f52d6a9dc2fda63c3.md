Once administered, heparin binds to several proteins; however, it is binding to an antithrombin that is important, as this causes a surface change and inactivates thrombin. Binding to antithrombin blocks several different factors of the clotting cascade, but two are predominant: thrombin (Factor IIa) and Factor Xa. By inactivating thrombin, it blocks the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin; this prevents the formation of clots and prolongs the clotting time of blood. Heparin does not affect bleeding time, but it does prolong the time that blood takes to clot.
