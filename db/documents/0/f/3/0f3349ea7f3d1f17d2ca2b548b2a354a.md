Clinical Evaluation

Diagnostic evaluation relies not only on a careful history and physical, but also on biochemical, histologic, and radiographic analyses. Laboratory studies should include the following:

- CBC

- Renal function

- Liver function

- Electrolytes

- LDH

Histologic confirmation is required to establish a diagnosis of neuroblastoma. Histologically, small round pale blue cells, known as Homer-Wright pseudorosettes, can be seen; these are similarly seen in Wilm's tumor and Ewing sarcoma, leading to their common group categorization as small blue cell tumors.

Preliminary imaging is preferentially conducted with MRI for good resolution and surgical excision planning. Further exploiting sympathetic neuronal uptake of mIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine), due to its analogous nature to norepinephrine, the extent of neuroblastoma metastasis can be delineated with an mIBG scan with high accuracy and quality.

CT scan of the abdomen and chest are recommended to look for calcifications and metastatic lesions.

MRI is the spine is required if cord compression and Horner syndrome are suspected.

Skeletal surveys may help assess the presence of metastatic lesions.

Baseline ECG and echocardiogram are necessary. Baseline hearing is recommended before initiating cisplatinum treatment.
