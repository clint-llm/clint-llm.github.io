A caveat of PHRs is the importance of presenting information to the layperson in a manner that simplifies the concepts while retaining the accuracy and veracity of facts. This may depend heavily on the involvement of sensitized healthcare professionals from various disciplines for the development of PHR platforms, as they would be best poised to recognize cognitive errors of reporting and interpretation that may affect the use of PHRs by the public at large. All of this data must be handled within the confines of maintaining patient privacy while sharing data as necessary for medical purposes.

Allied health providers can significantly contribute to developing individual PHRs by counseling and educating persons on the benefits and shortcomings of various platforms, the relevance of data recorded to their clinical problems, and filtering this data to make interpretation more straightforward for the clinicians and other healthcare personnel (e.g., nurses, therapists, techs, pharmacists) involved in the patient's care. A multi-disciplinary approach to creating PHRs, constant study and improvement of PHR design by a team of pan-professional individuals, and post-marketing surveillance of usage data, successes, and pitfalls are all critical components of developing this modality as a fresh addition to the healthcare armamentarium.
