A thorough clinical history, along with an evaluation of the possible exposures in the domestic surroundings and the workplace, is crucial before commencing the workout. The laboratory evaluation should include the demonstration of mercury levels in the blood, urine, and body tissues. The initial exercise should consist of radiological evaluation, toxicological screening of blood and urine, basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, and complete blood profile. Spot urine collections can be used for creatinine estimations, but the urine mercury concentrations should be estimated by a 24-hour urine sample.

Gas chromatography and thin layer chromatography techniques are useful to differentiate the organic and inorganic salts of mercury. A toxicology screening should be done to rule out other heavy metal poisonings. Estimations of the urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid, homovanillic acid, and 17-ketosteroid should be done in patients with concurrent hypertension and endocrinological involvement.

While making inferences, it is essential to note that there is no established correlation between the symptomatology of mercury toxicity and its concentrations in the body fluids.
