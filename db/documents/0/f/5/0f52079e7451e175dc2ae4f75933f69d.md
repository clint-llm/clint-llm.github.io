The main treatment goal of nerve repair is to allow reinnervation of the target organs by guiding regenerating sensory, motor, and autonomic axons into the environment of the distal nerve with minimal loss of fibers at the suture line. For optimal nerve regeneration, nerve stumps must be precisely aligned without tension and repaired atraumatically with minimal tissue damage and a minimal number of sutures.

In sharp nerve transections with none or minimal crush component, good blood supply, and clean wound, primary nerve repair is the best option for restoring the function. They are usually repaired within 72 hours when the fascicles are still identifiable.

Blunt transection repairs are usually delayed for 3 to 4 weeks, at which point the nonconducting fibrotic segment of both stumps is appreciable and can be adequately resected before repair. When repair is performed prior to this time, failure rates of 100% have been reported.

For gunshot wounds, nerve regeneration through the neuroma-in-continuity may require three months or so, depending on the severity of the neuroma. Repair is delayed until that time. For stretch/avulsion injuries, if clinical or electrophysiological recovery still has not occurred by 4 to 5 months, then operative repair is indicated.

Lack of clinical and electrophysiological signs of spontaneous recovery after 3 to 6 months imposes surgical intervention. It is essential that endoneurial tubes will be in contact with regenerating axons within 18 to 24 months after injury; otherwise, degeneration will occur. The Schwann cells and the endoneurial tubes remain viable for 18 to 24 months after injury. If they do not receive a regenerating axon within this period, the tubes degenerate. Target muscle atrophy becomes irreversible after 12 to 18 months of denervation, which limits the functional outcome of the repair.

Tension at the repair site will cause scarring that blocks the advance of regenerating sprouts.

Tissue-engineered nerve grafts can be used as supplements or even substitutes for autologous nerve grafts to bridge peripheral nerve defects. The biomaterial-based scaffold offers physical structural support for the growth of injured nerves. Allografts provide an alternative for short grafts and can yield similar outcomes without the associated risks of harvesting autologous graft.

Incorporated seed cells and neurotrophic factors further enhance the therapeutic effect of the biomaterial-based scaffold.

Adipose stem cells can be induced into spindle-shaped cells that express Schwann cell markers, secrete neurotrophic factors, stimulate neurite outgrowth and form myelin sheaths, skin-derived precursor stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells. The downsides of induced pluripotent stem cells are that they exhibit some similar characteristics to embryonic stem cells, including malignant potential. Immunomodulation to promote myelin debris clearance during Wallerian degeneration and promote subsequent axon regeneration via enhanced macrophage recruitment in neurotmesis has been used in combination with mesenchymal stem cells.

Control of pain is a challenge in the management of peripheral nerve injury. The pain is typically neuropathic, characterized by burning and dysesthesias, and requires medications that are specific for neuropathic pain, such as tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine, gabapentin, and pregabalin), antiarrhythmics, and baclofen. The mechanism of action of these drugs is thought to be the peripheral or central reduction of neuronal hyperexcitability. Although traditional analgesics are not regarded as first-line drugs for treating neuropathic pain, agents such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tramadol, and opioids may be useful for short-term use.
