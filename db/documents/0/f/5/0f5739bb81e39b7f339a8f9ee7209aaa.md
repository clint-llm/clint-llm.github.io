Patients with diffuse goiters are advised to be evaluated by endocrinologists to undergo more detailed testing. Team work between primary care physicians, radiologists, surgeons and endocrine specialists should be coordinated for achieving better outcomes. Pharmacists should also counsel the patients on potential side effects of the medications used for their treatment, so they can be aware of the findings and report them to their doctors in a timely manner. Treatment approach steps should be discussed in advance and the patients should be provided with details of the expected advantages versus disadvantages of the different treatment choices. On several occasions, the physicians involved in the care of those patients will need to communicate closely to prepare the patients for the next steps to guarantee better compliance and results.
