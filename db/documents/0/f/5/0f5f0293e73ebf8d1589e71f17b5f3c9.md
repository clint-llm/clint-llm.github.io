While typically, history and physical exams are sufficient for evaluation of back pain, the presence of red flags requires further investigation. Early imaging in the adult population correlates with worse outcomes and more invasive treatments without a corresponding improvement in outcomes

Anteroposterior and lateral plain films should be sufficient to evaluate for boney pathology. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be necessary to evaluate soft tissue lesions, nerve root/cord compression from a bulging disc, malignancy, and inflammatory conditions of the spine and surrounding tissues

In addition to imaging, one may consider laboratory evaluation if red flags are present. Rheumatologic assays such as HLA-B27, antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), and Lyme are typically not helpful
