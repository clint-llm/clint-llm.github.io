The lateral view of the chest radiograph clearly demonstrates the sternal defect.  Additional imaging studies may reveal displaced vertebral bodies and varying degrees of scoliosis.  Patients with mild pectus excavatum may have minimal or no symptoms; however, cardiopulmonary evaluation to establish a baseline as well as assess for progression is warranted every one to two years.

The Haller index (HI) is the standard upon which to quantify the severity of a pectus excavatum deformity.  It is defined as the ratio of the transverse diameter and anteroposterior diameter.  The measurements are obtained from computed tomography (CT) scan; normal value is 2.5 or less.  Measurement above 3.2 are considered severe.
