All members of the treatment team need to work well together for the evaluation and management of the patient with macrocephaly. Often, a technician or nurse will begin the evaluation by measuring the head along with initial vital signs. If needed, the primary physician may verify this measurement to account for any interpersonal variations.

Depending on the findings on history and physical, referrals to developmental therapies, pediatric neurology, genetics, or neurosurgery may be warranted. Good communication during any of these transfers of care is crucial for the continuity of care of the patient.
