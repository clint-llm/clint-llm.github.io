Traumatic injury is the leading cause of death among individuals younger than 45 years old. Eighty percent of traumatic injury is blunt with the majority of deaths secondary to hypovolemic shock. Intraperitoneal bleeds occur in 12 percent of blunt trauma; therefore, it is essential to identify trauma quickly. The optimal test should be rapid, accurate, and non-invasive. The implementation of point of care ultrasound has significantly impacted the evaluation and treatment of patients. This activity describes the indications for FAST and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the rapid evaluation of the trauma patient to help improve patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the limitations of a Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam.
- Summarize the indications for a Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam.
- Explain how to perform a Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure appropriate selection of candidates for Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) to enhance the management of trauma patients and improve outcomes.
