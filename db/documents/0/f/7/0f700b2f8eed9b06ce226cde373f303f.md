Laboratory evaluation of a case of FK begins with the collection of an appropriate sample for testing. These specimens are used for direct examination by microscopy using various stains such as Giemsa and Gomori methenamine silver stains, culture, histologic testing, and other tests.

Beta-D-glucan is a component of the cell wall of many fungal species that can be detected in blood samples of patients with invasive fungal infections.Aspergillosis.

Non-invasive methods, including confocal microscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), can also be used to detect microorganisms responsible forÂ microbial keratitis, including fungi, using in vivo examination techniques. Confocal microscopy may allow detection of hyphae-like branching white lines in the area of infiltration in cases of filamentous fungi,Aspergillus species.

Ophthalmic B-scan ultrasonography can be useful in the diagnosis and follow up of cases suspected of developing endophthalmitis especially if corneal fungal infiltration precludes examination with ophthalmoscopy.
