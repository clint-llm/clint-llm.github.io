The control of muscular movements in the human brain is a very complex, yet delicate process. Multiple areas of the brain are involved, each of which is responsible for specific areas and functions. This control is conveyed mainly through the pyramidal tract, which arises from the pyramidal cell in the cortex, primarily the primary motor cortex. It divides into the corticospinal tract, which synapses with the lower motor neurons innervating the muscles in the limbs and trunk, and the corticobulbar tract, which synapses with the cranial nerves to control muscular movements of the face, head, and neck.
