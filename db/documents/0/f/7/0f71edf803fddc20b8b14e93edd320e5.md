Numerous studies have shown the kiss1 gene, which produces kisspeptin, and its receptor G protein-coupled receptor 54 (GPR54) to be necessary for normal reproductive function. Kisspeptin and GPR54 are expressed in hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. The hypothalamic kiss1 system relays metabolic information to the gonadotropic axis. Circulating estradiol activates kisspeptin, which in turn activates GnRH neurons. Puberty is initiated when GnRH is secreted in a pulsatile manner by hypothalamic neurons.

A single nucleotide polymorphism on chromosome 6, LIN28B, has been found to be associated with earlier menarche.
