Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is a rare, self-limited panniculitis that typically occurs in full-term or post-term newborn infants within the first few weeks of life. This condition may be complicated by several severe hematologic and metabolic alterations, which are crucial to monitor. Some of the complications include thrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and, most importantly, hypercalcemia. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn by an interprofessional team. It highlights the importance of the general pediatrician in evaluating and treating patients with this condition by performing detailed skin examinations and regular laboratory surveillance for several months after diagnosis.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn (SCFN).
- Explain the importance of monitoring patients with subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn with regular laboratory surveillance, including serum ionized calcium levels.
- Outline the common complications of subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn.
- Describe the importance of detailed skin examination and regular laboratory surveillance and how it avoids potential complications as it pertains to improving care coordination among the interprofessional team when evaluating and treating patients with subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn.
