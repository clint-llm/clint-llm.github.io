Definitive evaluation and diagnosis depend on dermatologist clinical examination and a pathologist's histopathologic examination of the skin lesions, which are suspected to be due to EV disease. Indeed, due to the characteristic findings histopathologically, and when found in conjunctionÂ with a familial history of EV or patient history of the early development of multiple EV-like lesions, the diagnosis of this disease is more problematic due to its rarity and the clinician's lack of awareness than to the diagnostic difficulty of the disease itself. Dermatologic clinical evaluation and histopathologic examination of suspected EV-like lesions are necessary to arrive at the correct diagnosis. Molecular analysis identifying known mutations associated with EV is now also possible.
