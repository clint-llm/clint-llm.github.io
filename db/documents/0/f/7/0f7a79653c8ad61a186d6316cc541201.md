The lateral pterygoid muscle receives innervation from the mandibular branch of theÂ trigeminal nerve. The main trunk of the mandibular nerve divides into the anterior and the posterior division. The anterior division gives off three motor branches. One of the motor branches is the nerve to the lateral pterygoid, a paired nerve (one for each belly) innervating the lateral pterygoid muscle. According to some authors, this muscle may also receive innervation from the anterior, middle, and posterior deep temporal nerves, masseteric nerve, and sometimes from the buccal nerve. They innervate different muscle parts, resulting in selective activation, which ensures coordination of movements and reduces stress on the temporomandibular joint.

It is generally accepted that the lateral pterygoid muscle is innervated by the lateral pterygoid nerve, which arises from the mandibular nerve.
