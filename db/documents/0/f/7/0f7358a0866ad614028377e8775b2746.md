An interprofessional team (nursing, primary care clinician, psychiatrist or specialty physicians, and social worker/case manager) that provides an evidence-based approach to refractory daytime sleepiness is essential to achieving a satisfactory outcome. If side effects of treatment adherence occur, prompt follow-up with the patient is necessary.

If medication is used to manage idiopathic hypersomnia, the pharmacist should provide input to verify appropriate dosing, perform medication reconciliation, and offer patient counsel.

Finally, counseling patients and working with employers to accommodate patient schedules and safety is vital to prevent accidents and productivity issues.

All interprofessional team members must document their patient interactions and interventions so that everyone on the care team has the latest and most accurate data. They also need to have open communication lines between themselves and other team members so that appropriate action can occur if any changes in patient status require intervention. This interprofessional approach will optimize patient care for idiopathic hypersomnia. [Level 5]
