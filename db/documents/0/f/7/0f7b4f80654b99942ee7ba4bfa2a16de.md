A detailed history, including current symptoms and the mechanism of injury, should be obtained.

A hip pointer is usually caused by a direct blow or a fall striking the iliac crest or greater trochanter. Most commonly, patients present with varying degrees of ecchymoses or contusion around the area of impact. The patient will be tender directly over these areas, and often range of motion (ROM) about the hip is limited secondary to pain. The hip abductors are typically weak, while the motor strength of the hip flexor and extensors should be intact. Hip abductors and external rotators may exhibit limited strength secondary to pain.
