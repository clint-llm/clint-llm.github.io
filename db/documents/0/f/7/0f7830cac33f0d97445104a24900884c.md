Renal oncocytomas are common benign kidney neoplasms that account for 3% to 7%  of all renal neoplasms.

Renal oncocytomas usually have an excellent prognosis and are not associated with an aggressive clinical course; however, there can occasionally be metastasis to liver and bone and fatalities have occurred. Surgical excision is curative if there have not been metastases.
