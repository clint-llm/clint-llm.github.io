There are two commonly accepted theories used to describe the pathogenesis of Charcot: neuro-traumatic and neurovascular. The neuro-traumatic theory proposes neuropathy, and repeated micro-trauma produces joint destruction. The neurovascular theory suggests the increased peripheral blood flow results in osteolysis and demineralization.

Pathophysiologically, key inflammatory markers have been identified that contribute to the development of an acute Charcot foot. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) acts typically at the nerve terminal to antagonist the synthesis of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL), a cytokine involved in the inflammatory process. However, in the neuropathic foot, the CGRP is not functioning, and therefore RANKL is synthesized without inhibition. RANKL is a very important marker in the development of Charcot as it is responsible for the proliferation of osteoclastogenesis. The RANKL osteoclastic relationship is normally moderated by osteoprotegerin (OPG) by acting as a decoy receptor to RANKL binding. In the Charcot foot, this relationship between RANKL and OPG is disrupted. The unregulated synthesis of RANKL accounts for the excessive bony turnover and accumulation that is seen in the Charcot limb. Additionally, CGRP may have a further role in Charcot in that it is involved in upholding the integrity of the joint capsule.Â  Therefore, in its absence, it is presumed to lead to joint destruction and dislocation that is characteristic of the Charcot foot.
