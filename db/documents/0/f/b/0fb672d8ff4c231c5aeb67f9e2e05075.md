Low titer anticardiolipin antibodies can be seen in up to 10% of healthy individuals, and the prevalence of a positive APLA test increases with age. High titers and persistent positivity is rare among healthy individuals (less than 1%). Patients with SLE are at high risk of having a positive APLA test, as well as an APLA related clinical outcome (thrombosis or pregnancy-related morbidity). 50% to 70% of the patients with SLE with positive APLA progress to APLS.
