Breach rhythm was described in 1979 by Cobb and associates. Breach rhythm refers to a change in the transmission of EEG waves through a skull defect. Bone offers major resistance between cortex and scalp electrodes. One cm2 of the skull provides about 40,000-ohms resistance, dura mater about 12,000 ohms, and scalp about 1000 ohm resistance. Therefore, there is a significant increase in electrical activity from cortex to scalp when bone between them is absent. These events are spiky, sharply-contoured waveforms. Breach rhythm is most prominent in the central and temporal regions.

Breach rhythm is not due to the abnormality of the brain; it is due to a skull defect.
