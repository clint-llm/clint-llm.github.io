Typically patients suspected to have NEC undergo computed tomography (CT) scan of their abdomen. CT findings usually include intestinal wall thickening, mesenteric stranding, intestinal dilatation, and pneumatosis.

The diagnosis of NEC is usually based on a combination of clinically and radiologic findings. However, the absence of a disease definition makes it difficult to have a consensus on the criteria for the diagnosis of NEC. Gorschl√ºter et al. suggested diagnostic criteria in a systematic review include fever, abdominal pain, and any bowel wall thickening more than 4 mm seen on imaging in addition to the exclusion of Clostridium difficile as a cause of the colitis.

**Table 1**

- Presence of fever (axillary temperature over 38.0 C or rectal temperature above 38.5 C)

- Abdominal pain (at least degree 3 determined by the patient using a visual analogous scale pain score ranging from degree 1 to 10)

- Demonstration of bowel wall thickening by more than 4 mm (transversal scan) over more than 30 mm (longitudinal scan) in any segment by US or CT
