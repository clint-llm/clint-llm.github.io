One study examining autopsy findings of 46 patients who died of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis showed the presence of either biliary sludge or brown pigment stones in every case. 80% showed evidence of liver abscesses, a common complication of chronic pyogenic cholangitis. Early histological findings included portal inflammation and pylephlebitis whereas later findings included periductal fibrosis and stricturing.
