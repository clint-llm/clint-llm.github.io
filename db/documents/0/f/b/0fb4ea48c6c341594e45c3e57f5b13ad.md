Contraindications for scintimammography are also currently being debated, with most of these being relative contraindications. Pregnant or lactating women would pose a high risk for the fetus and/or infant regarding radiation exposure. Scintimammography should not be performed if there is a history of recent surgical intervention, including cyst aspiration, fine needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, and excisional biopsy, with the suggestion to wait 2 weeks for minor procedures and up to six weeks for major procedures. Appropriate delay in the examination is recommended to minimize the chances of false positives from increased uptake in the post-surgical reactive tissues. Examination during menses should also be avoided, as well as hypersensitivity to technetium 99m.
