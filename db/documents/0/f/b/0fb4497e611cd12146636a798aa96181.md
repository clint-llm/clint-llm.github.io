Minimally invasive procedures like laparoscopy have reduced postoperative pain, hospital length of stay, and markedly less blood loss versus laparotomy, hence, early mobilization and quick recovery. Post-operative counselingÂ regarding incision care, diet, pain management, and extent of physical activity determine the course of the patient's natural recovery.
