The neurologic mechanism behind the Hering Breuer reflex is complex and is a prime example of an inhibitory feedback loop. In human adults, the reflex begins with prolonged inspiration well exceeding eupneic tidal volume. This thoracic expansion subsequently and gradually activates, slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors. These receptors relay a signal through the vagus nerve (on a breath-by-breath basis) to "pump" cells" located within the ventrolateral nucleus of the solitary tract.
