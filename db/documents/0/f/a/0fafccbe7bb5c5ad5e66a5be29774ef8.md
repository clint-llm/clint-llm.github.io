The equipment needed for the procedure are:

- Lubricating jelly or lidocaine jelly

- Sterile or nonsterile gloves

- Paper towels or tissue paper

- Disposable sheet

- Light source (if not already built into the anoscope)

- Anoscope

The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure should be discussed with the patient before initiation of anoscopy. The patient should be counseled regarding the expectation of some discomfort during the examination

Anoscopes come in the slotted and non-slotted variety, both with an obturator or occlusion device which is left in place during insertion. Both devices are then gradually removed with the obturator removed, enabling visualization. The non-slotted variety has the benefit of allowing 360-degree visualization of the entire anal passage versus the slotted version which provides a view of only a small portion of the distal rectum and anal opening at a time. As a consequence, the slotted version may require several passes to provide complete visualization if the patient is unable to tolerate the rotation of the device. Most commercially available anoscopes do not include a built-in light source, leaving providers to use either a head-mounted light source or to enlist an assistant in directing the light source to allow adequate visualization. High-resolution anoscopy is a specialized procedure involving camera-assisted magnification and is typically considered to be out of the scope of practice of practitioners who have not received specialized training in its use.
