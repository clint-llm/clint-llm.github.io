Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is one of the types of systemic amyloidosis in which misfolded transthyretin (TTR) protein gets deposited in the myocardium. Another pertinent etiology of cardiac amyloidosis is due to the deposition ofÂ immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) aggregates. Several other amyloidogenic proteins may get deposited in various organs and tissues but rarely involve the myocardium.

Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is a systemic disease. Due to amyloid deposition in extracardiac tissues, patients often have associated extracardiac signs and symptoms. However, isolated cardiac involvement has been reported as well.

With improving bone avid radiotracer scintigraphy technology and the advent of new therapeutic options, diagnosis and treatment of ATTR-CM have become possible. As diagnostic capabilities are getting better, studies have shown a higher prevalence of ATTR-CM in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction than previously perceived.
