PCS has a good prognosis in general terms. The symptoms and disability are greatest within the first week in most cases. However, after one month, symptoms are improved and most of the time even resolved.

A small number of patients can continue with disabling symptoms that persist after several months or a year. On some occasions, these symptoms may be more disabling than they were immediately after the injury. While the entire symptom complex persists in most cases, emotional symptoms seem particularly prominent.

The literature has reported that patients with litigation or compensation issues consistently have reported persistent symptoms and disability after mild TBI.
