Although not explicitly stated, patients with CTK are most commonly identified in routine follow up after excimer laser ablative surgeries. In cases that present elsewhere (e.g., to their primary care physician for changes in vision and a corneal opacity), ophthalmic consultation is warranted. Clinicians should consider CTK as a potential cause in these cases even if a history of ocular surgery is not present in the recent past.
