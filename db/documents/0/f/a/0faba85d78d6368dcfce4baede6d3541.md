Evaluation should include the following tests:

- Total calcium

- Albumin

- Calculation of the “corrected” serum calcium.

- 
              
- Approximately 50% of total serum calcium is protein-bound, principally to albumin, and only the free or ionized fraction is biologically active.
              
              
- Corrected calcium = Measured calcium + 0.8 x (4.0 - albumin)
              
              
- 
                  
- (calcium measured in mg/dL; albumin measured in g/L)

- Ionized calcium in selected cases when there are questions about the accuracy of the corrected calcium

- Parathyroid hormone level

- Phosphorus

- Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine

- Alkaline phosphatase

- 25-hydroxyvitamin D

- Urine calcium and creatinine

- Electrocardiogram
