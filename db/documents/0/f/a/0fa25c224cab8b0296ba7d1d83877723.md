As previously discussed, in cases where physical therapy is warranted, a structured PT program should be carried out for roughly six months. This program should focus on hamstring stretching to offload additional extension forces, core strengthening, and pelvic tilts. Additionally, the PT program should begin with a flexion-based program with slow progression into extension exercises once these are no longer aggravating.
