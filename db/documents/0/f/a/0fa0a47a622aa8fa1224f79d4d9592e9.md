The differential diagnosis of myelophthisic anemia includes other causes of hypo-proliferative anemia. Before diagnosing myelophthisic anemia, it is essential to rule out nutritional deficiencies like iron, vitamin B12, and folate deficiencies, anemia of chronic disease and inflammation, anemia of renal disease, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, hematologic malignancies and other causes of bone marrow failure. Bone marrow failure can be due to various etiologies, including drugs, infection, immune diseases, pregnancy, and some genetic diseases. Drugs that could cause this presentation include cytotoxic drugs such as those used in chemotherapy. Infections such as parvovirus B19 and EBV have also been reported to mimic myelophthisic anemia. Genetic causes that should be ruled out include Fanconi anemia, GATA 2 deficiency, and Schwachman-Diamond syndrome as they also cause pancytopenia. Anemia is multifactorial, and it could be challenging to come up with a diagnosis of myelophthisic. However, the careful evaluation of peripheral smear, bone marrow biopsy, and immunohistochemistry will help in coming up with the diagnosis.
