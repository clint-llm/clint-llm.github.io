Many years ago, echolalia was regarded as negative, meaningless, stereotypic behavior. However, several researchers have recently studied the communicative function of echolalia. Echolalia is an adaptive response of patients to their language learning difficulties. It is considered a positive prognostic sign for potential future language growth. Some of the functional categories of echolalia include turn-taking, declarative, requesting, self-regulation, rehearsal, situation association, calling, affirmation, requesting, verbal completion, interactive labeling, and directives. Echolalia should be taken advantage of to facilitate language acquisition and generalization.
