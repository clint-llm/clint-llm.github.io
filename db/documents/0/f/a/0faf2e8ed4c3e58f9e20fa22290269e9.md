Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by either a lack of C1-inhibitor protein or dysfunctional C1-inhibitor protein. HAE manifests with symptoms related to angioedema of the upper airway, skin, and/ or gastrointestinal tract. The most feared complication is upper airway swelling that can proceed to asphyxiation. Fortunately, upper airway involvement is rare. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of HAE and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the different types of hereditary angioedema.
- Outline the clinical presentation of a patient with hereditary angioedema.
- Review the treatment considerations for patients with hereditary angioedema. 
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the management of patients with hereditary angioedema.
