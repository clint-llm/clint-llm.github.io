In general, Neonatal hyperglycemia is associated with a clinical condition rather than a specific disorder of glucose metabolism. Neonatal hyperglycemia can be a sign of an underlying illness like sepsis, NEC, seizures. A rare cause of neonatal hyperglycemia is neonatal diabetes mellitus. Neonatal diabetes can occur in one in 400,000 births.

- The transient form accounts for more than 50%. It is usually associated with mutations of sulfonylurea receptors. Transient neonatal diabetes manifests soon after birth and remits spontaneously in 6 months.

- Permanent neonatal diabetes needs lifelong management. Mutations in the genes encoding the subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel is the most common cause.

- Syndromic Neonatal diabetes is usually associated with syndromes like Wolfram syndrome, IPEX syndrome (immune dysregulation polyendocrinopathy X linked syndrome).
