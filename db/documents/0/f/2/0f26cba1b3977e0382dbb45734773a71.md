Because there is a small quantity of ritonavir in the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, there are few reports of ritonavir toxicity. However, a few case reports have suggested retinal toxicity secondary to ritonavir. One such case showed an improvement after discontinuing ritonavir after 2 and 4 weeks.

Because most of the neurological and gastrointestinal side effects are directly associated with higher ritonavir concentrations, the dosage should be monitored and titrated down in patients with side effects. This titration could result in increased tolerability of the drug and a decrease in treatment failure.
