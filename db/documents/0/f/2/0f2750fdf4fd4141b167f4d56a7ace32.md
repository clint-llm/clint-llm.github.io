A treatment plan for any patient with xanthelasma should be interprofessional involving a dietician, internist, dermatologist, and oculoplastic surgeon. Always remember to start with changing the dietary lifestyle of the patient, and if he or she requires lipid-lowering drugs, refer them to an internist before establishing treatment sessions. Simple and safe treatment methods should be tried first. Invasive procedures should be the last option. Liquid nitrogen sessions are the first to be offered for the patients.
