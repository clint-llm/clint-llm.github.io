**Peptide bonds**

The peptide bond formed in the active site of the ribosome has a partial double-bond character.

**Bioactive Peptides**

As amino acids combine to form a peptide, specific bioactive peptides can be designed with implications to the pharmaceutical industry and biologics design usage for therapeutic biomedical research.
