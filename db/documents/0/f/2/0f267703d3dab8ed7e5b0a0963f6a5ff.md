The commonest indication for surgical resection of the colon is a colorectal malignancy, and theÂ resection should be carried out according to oncological principles:

- Resection margin 5 cm proximal and distal to the tumor for colonic malignancies

- Circumferential resection margin for rectum, distal margin of 2 cm adequate

- Remove vasculature and lymphatic drainage at the level of origin of the primary feeding vessel

- Thus allowing resection of locoregional lymph node-bearing mesentery for cure and staging

- The fashioning of a well-vascularized and tension-free anastomosis
