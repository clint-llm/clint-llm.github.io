Megalocornea, also known as anterior megalophthalmos, X-linked megalocornea, and macrocornea, is a rare bilateral nonprogressive congenital defect that is characterized by an increased corneal diameter greater than 12.5 to 13 mm at birth and a deep anterior chamber with normal intraocular pressures. This activity will discuss the etiology, genetic characteristics, and evaluation of a patient with primary megalocornea. There will also be a discussion of the role the interdisciplinary team has in the treatment options for complications, prognosis, and associated conditions that should be considered in a differential diagnosis.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the features of congenital megalocornea
- Identify the differential diagnosis in patients with congenital megalocornea
- Summarize the genetic characteristics of congenital megalocornea
- Review the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in patients with megalocornea.
