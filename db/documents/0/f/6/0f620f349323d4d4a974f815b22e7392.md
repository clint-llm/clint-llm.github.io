Trichomonas vaginalis is a protozoan responsible for trichomoniasis, one of the most prevalent non-viral sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the United States. Women with trichomoniasis will often present with vaginal discharge, painful intercourse, urinary tract infection symptoms, vaginal itching, or pelvic pain. Men may be asymptomatic, or on occasion, they may present with symptoms including penile discharge, testicular pain, dysuria, urinary frequency, or cloudy urine. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of trichomoniasis and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of trichomoniasis.
- Review the presentation of a patient with trichomoniasis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for trichomoniasis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by trichomoniasis.
