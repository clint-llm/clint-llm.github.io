**Screening for Suicide**

There has been a lot of debate on the use of universal screening for depression in primary care. However, the universal feeling is that such screening should only be undertaken if there is a strong commitment to providing treatment and follow-up. There are many screening tools for suicide, and there is no one screening tool that is applicable in all patients with a risk for suicide. Also, one should not always rely on the screening tool but also get to know the patient and the past mental health history.

**Targeted Screening versus Universal Screening
**

Many countries, including Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and several other European countries, have concluded that there is moderate evidence to recommend screening for depression in the primary care setting. The little evidence collected reveals that screening improves health outcomes when associated with close follow-up and treatment. However, screening alone without any follow-up is not recommended as there is inadequate evidence that it helps prevent or reduce the risk of suicide. Instead of universal screening, some experts have suggested targeted screening as is done in Wales and England. For targeted screening, the following population has been identified as a risk for suicide:

- Constant fatigue

- Elderly individuals living alone

- The home environment is impoverished.

- Individuals with first-degree biological relatives with a history of depression

- Individual with 2 or more chronic diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis)

- Individuals with chronic pain (e.g., usually non-cancer like musculoskeletal, migraine)

- Loss of sexual interest

- Postpartum depression

- Sleep disturbances

- Socially isolated and lonely

- Substance abuse (e.g., alcohol, prescription drugs, or illicit drugs)

- Sudden changes in life (e.g., loss of a job, the death of spouse, or divorce)

- Under severe financial strain

**Available Screening Tools
**

The USPSTF recommends the Beck Fast scan. It has seven long questions that can help determine the intensity and severity of the depression.

Suicide risk screen is a 10-item questionnaire that is often used to screen for suicide, especially in young people.

The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) can also be used to identify high-risk patients. It consists of 9 items that ask various questions about self-harm.

The SAFE-T: The SAFE-T tool can be used in an outpatient setting and does offer a good insight into the extent and nature of suicidal thoughts and harmful behavior. The SAFE-T explores the following:

- What is the suicidal ideation, its intensity, frequency, and duration within the past 48 hours and over the past 4 weeks? It also determines the most serious or worst harmful thought.

- Planning of the suicide, location, time, availability, and if any preparations have been made.

- It provides information on past behaviors such as past suicide attempts and any aborted attempts.

- It also asks if the individual has rehearsed any events like loading or pointing a gun or tying a noose. Has the individual visited the location like a bridge or waterfall?

- The intent and extent when the individual is likely to carry off the plan are also assessed. The SAFE-T also gives insight into where the individual is serious or ambivalent about self-harm.

C-SSRS: The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is another tool that in outpatient settings to assess for the presence of harmful behavior. The C-SSRS also assesses any known suicide attempts and also assesses suicide ideations and behaviors. Like the SAFE-T, it can be used as an initial screen.

**Cautions Regarding Screening
**

The sensitivity and specificity of the currently available screening tools vary from 50% to 100% and 60% to 98%, respectively. No one instrument is 100% sensitive, and choosing one depends on personal preference and experience. When initiating a screening program for suicide, it is important to have access to effective treatment and follow-up. Other considerations include:

- Making a commitment

- Refer patients timely to consultants

- Utilize resources to prevent suicide (e.g., hotlines)

- Understand the nature of depression

- Need to administer repeat screening to identify any ongoing depression

Because not all patients complete or refuse the initial screen, the healthcare providers must be persistent in using these screening tools. Countless reports indicate that follow-up on these patients has been universally poor. Hence, the primary care provider must ensure that the patient identified with major depression is followed up. In many cases, after the initial screen is completed and support provided, patients are never rescreened again for depression. Because depression has no cure and relapse is common, rescreening should be continued at regular intervals.

The one negative about going to primary care providers for depression or any mental health disorder is that these professionals simply do not have time. They often have many other patients to deal with and can barely spare more than 15 minutes at each visit. Patients with psychosocial or emotional problems usually require much longer visits, and if they feel hurried, they will not show up again.

**False Positives
**

All healthcare workers who screen for suicide should be aware that the screening tools can lead to a false positive, which in turn can lead to high costs of medical care for the individual. This can be a severe burden for patients who do not have private insurance. A Canadian study revealed that many individuals who are suicidal have no symptoms or signs of depression. These people are very unlikely to seek assistance from healthcare providers, compared to people who are depressed.
