Clinically, Waardenburg syndrome can be recognized by specific morphological features that appear after birth. These typical features are white forelock, broad nasal root, and the difference in the color of eyes. According to parents, the child usually does not respond to sounds. Every case of Waardenburg syndromeÂ does not present with all clinical features. Based on genetic and clinical criteria, four types of WS are identified.

Type 1 is characterized by dystopia canthorum, broad nasal root, short philtrum, and short retropositional maxilla. Patients with type 2 Waardenburg syndrome have normally located canthi, sensorineural deafness, and different colored irises. Type 3 WS (also called Klein-Waardenburg syndrome) has the same features as type-1, but musculoskeletal abnormalities are more prominent, like small carpal bones not differentiated fully, aplasia of first and second ribs, sacral cysts, abnormalities of the arms, and hypoplasia of muscles with syndactyly. Some cases of type 3 present with all primary features plus severe skeletal abnormalities, mental disability, and microcephaly. Type 4 WS (also called Shah-Waardenburg syndrome) has the same features as type 2 WS, but it is associated with congenital megacolon (Hirschsprung disease). Pigmentary abnormalities of WS affect skin, hair, and eyes. Skin abnormalities manifest as achromic spots and hyperpigmented macules over normal skin. Eye changes include heterochromia and bilateral isohypochromia. Waardenburg syndrome is a clinical diagnosis, but 2 criteria are used for diagnosis, i.e., major and minor criteria.

Major criteria: Heterochromia, sensorineural deafness, white forelock, lateral displacement of inner canthi of eyes, and a first-degree relative with WS

Minor criteria: Broad nasal root, white macules/patches on the skin, synophrys, premature greying of the scalp hairs, and hypoplasia of nasal alae. For clinical diagnosis of Type 1 WS, two major or one minor and two minor criteria are needed.
