Diphenoxylate hydrochloride/atropine sulfate combination is available as the fixed-dose composition of 2.5 mg/0.025 mg. Diphenoxylate/atropine is available in both tablet and liquid preparation. Only the liquid preparation can be administered to children, and not the tablets. A maximum of eight tablets, i.e., 20 mg of diphenoxylate, can be administered in 24 hours. The dose is the same for children between 13 to 17 years. There is not enough evidence available specifying the safety of diphenoxylate/atropine in children <13 yrs. However, the drug is contraindicated in children < 6yrs due to severe complications. Using medicine in quantities of more than 20 mg is associated with symptoms related to toxicity.

The initial dose of 20 mg can be administered for the initial control of symptoms and then reduced to a lower maintenance dose as per individual requirements. Clinical improvement after administration usually occurs within 48 hours. If there is no improvement seen within ten days of maximum dosing, further drug administration is unlikely to make a difference.

The preparation of diphenoxylate hydrochloride is insoluble in commonly available aqueous media. This property precludes the self-administration of the drug. A dose of 100 to 300 mg/day, or the equivalent of 40 to 120 tablets, administered over 50 to 70 days, can produce opioid withdrawal symptoms if the patient stops the drug abruptly.
