Pattern dystrophies as a wholeÂ may resemble AMD and must be worked up appropriately to ensure AMD is not present. A key differential for multifocal pattern dystrophy is Stargardt disease due to the similar appearance of the flecks in the macula and beyond. FA and genetic testing can help distinguish between the two. Best disease and choroidal neovascularization are differentials for AVFD and can be ruled out based on FA and EOG findings, respectively.
