Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a viral infection that targets the body’s immune system--specifically CD4+ T cells. The disease is transmitted through bodily fluids but can remain undetected in its host for years, causing a diverse array of complications to the sufferer. During the progression of HIV infection, a patient’s CD4 cell count will decrease as the lymphocytes are hijacked and destroyed to reproduce HIV. Individuals that do not receive treatment can develop AIDS once their CD4 cell count drops below 200, which indicates the individual is highly susceptible to opportunistic infection. Patients that develop untreated AIDS have a 1 to 2 years prognosis of survival.

Due to the loci of infection, the management of the virus uses a multifaceted approach. The core of HIV treatment is antiretroviral therapy (ART). In a majority of patients, ART includes two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (InSTI).
