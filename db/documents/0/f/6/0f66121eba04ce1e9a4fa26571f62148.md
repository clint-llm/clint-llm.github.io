Fine-needle aspiration is indicated in any situation where a tissue or fluid sample would aid in diagnosis or treatment. This can include determining the cell type of nonfunction thyroid nodules, suspicious skin masses, or suspicious breast masses. Fine-needle aspiration can investigate if there is malignancy contained within suspicious lymph nodes or new masses that may arise from any of the previously mentioned organs. In the setting of a known diagnosis, particularly with metastatic disease, fine-needle aspiration of suspicious lymph nodes or masses can be used to determine genetic or molecular markers that indicate the cancer is susceptible to specific chemotherapeutic or biologic treatments. Fine-needle aspiration may be used to aspirate the contents of an abscess to treat it when combined with antibiotics, and this treatment is used rather than the standard incision and drainage in cosmetically sensitive areas such as the breast, although data on its efficacy is mixed.

Fine-needle aspiration is also an important triage in deep-seated lesions such as in lung, mediastinum, and abdominal organs, including pancreas and lymph nodes, especially in patients who are not fit for more invasive biopsy sampling.
