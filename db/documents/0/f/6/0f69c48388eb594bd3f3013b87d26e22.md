Abdominal aortic aneurysms rupture when the mechanical stress on the aortic wall exceeds the tensile strength of the wall tissue. Although it was originally believed that a simplified Law of Laplace could predict wall stress, experimental evidence has demonstrated that wall stress is more complicated to predict, as it is influenced by aneurysm position, architecture, and the presence of intraluminal thrombus.

**Risk Of Rupture**

The size and rate of expansion of the abdominal aortic aneurysm are the most important factors to forecast rupture. According to the general consensus patients with larger aneurysms should undergo surgery. The clinical approach for smaller aneurysms is controversial. There a few clinical studies in the management of smaller aneurysms size ranging from 4.0 cm to 5.5 cm. The conclusions have shown similar survival rates in patients with the early intervention compared to intervening when the aneurysm reaches greater than or equal to 5.5 cm in size. US veterans administration study has shown lower operative complication when intervened early.

Aortic wall fissuring and rupture has been observed in rapidly expanding aneurysms independent of their initial size. A family history of aneurysmal rupture has also shown to increase the risk of abdominal aneurysmal rupture by several folds in several studies. In additional patients with a family history of rupture have an early age of aneurysmal rupture compared to patients with no family history of rupture (age 65 vs age 75).[10]
