Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) typically is recommended after other causes of heart failure such ischemic heart disease, valvular lesions, and other causes of cardiomyopathy have been excluded. Endomyocardial biopsy is recommended should the likelihood of the results change management or impact prognosis. Classic histologic examination of the endomyocardial biopsy will reveal cellular infiltrates, which are usually histiocytic and mononuclear with or without associated myocyte damage. Specific findings include eosinophilic, granulomatous, and giant cell myocarditis. The infiltrates are highly variable, often associated with varying degrees myonecrosis. With subacute and chronic myocarditis, interstitial fibrosis may result from the previous insult of the myocardial cytoskeleton.
