Assessment of competence has become an integral part of specialty training programs and, in many countries, revalidation of specialists. The utilization of simulation as an assessment tool is more controversial than as a training tool. Simulators require high levels of construct validity to be useful as an assessment tool. In the United Kingdom, simulation of basic surgical tasks, with low face validity but high construct validity, such as tying knots at depth and suturing, have long been a part of the otolaryngology higher training interview process. In the United States, simulation has been demonstrated to be a feasible adjunct to the oral residency interview process.
