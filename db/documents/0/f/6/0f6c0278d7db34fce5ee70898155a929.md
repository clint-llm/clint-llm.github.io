RPGN is mediated by an antibody or cellular immunity or the interaction of the two immune system arms.  anti-GBM disease results from the deposition of antibodies along the basement membrane and/or glomerular deposition of preformed soluble immune complexes. Following the disruption of the glomerular capillary, circulating cells, inflammatory mediators, and plasma proteins pass through the capillary wall into the Bowman space, which leads to the development of crescents. The major participants in crescent formation are coagulation proteins, macrophages, T cells, fibroblasts, and parietal epithelial cells. Activated macrophages contribute to the crescents by proliferating and releasing procoagulant tissue factor, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). T cells are not prominent components, but they play an important role in glomerular injury by antigen recognition and macrophage recruitment.
