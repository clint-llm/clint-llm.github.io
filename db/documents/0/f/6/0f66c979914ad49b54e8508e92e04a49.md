Ranibizumab is a recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody fragment designed for intraocular use. Intravitreal injection is indicated for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), macular edema (ME) following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), diabetic macular edema (DME), myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV), and diabetic retinopathy (DR).

Proper diagnosis and management of ocular diseases can significantly impact a patient's quality of life and have long-term physical and mental health effects.

Healthcare practitioners, including pharmacists, should thoroughly counsel patients so that they can make informed decisions about their treatment with ranibizumab or other VEGF inhibitors.Â Managing the treatment of ocular diseases with abnormal angiogenesis, such as NVAMD and diabetic retinopathy, requires an interprofessional team of healthcare providers (clinicians, specialists, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists) to ensure effective treatment and prevent and monitor adverse effects. In addition to the prescribing of physicians and medication management of pharmacists, nursing plays a crucial role in monitoring and taking/updating the patient history and reporting on therapy response and adverse events. Ranibizumab therapy requires the collaboration and communication of the entire interprofessional team to optimize therapeutic outcomes. [Level 5]

Patient education and self-monitoring are crucial to detect signs of infection and a decrease in visual acuity. Intravitreal injections can be associated with endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, and increases in intraocular pressures (IOP). The intraocular pressures require monitoring before and after the intravitreal injection of ranibizumab by the ophthalmic nurse/ophthalmologist. Additionally, cost-effective treatment should be considered in the use of bevacizumab versus ranibizumab, as the outcomes of both treatments have demonstrated similar clinical results.
