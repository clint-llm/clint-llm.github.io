Blood supply to the arytenoid, as well as the entire larynx, is derived from the superior and inferior thyroid arteries. The superior thyroid artery branches from the external carotid artery and gives the superior laryngeal artery. The superior laryngeal artery accompanies the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve through the thyrohyoid membrane to supply the supraglottic region. It ends in the anastomotic network in front of the cricothyroid membrane. The inferior thyroid artery comes off the thyrocervical trunk, itself originating from the subclavian artery and gives a terminal small caliber artery that accompanies the terminal segment of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. This vessel supplies the infraglottic larynx andÂ gives two terminal small artery branches. The first branch supplies the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle, and the second passes along the lower border of the cricoid cartilage. Both of the two terminal branches give many anastomotic arteries to the terminals of the superior laryngeal artery. The drainage of the supraglottic structures (epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, arytenoids, and false cords) follows the superior laryngeal and superior thyroid vessels. Thus, the lymphatics flow from the piriform sinus through the thyrohyoid membrane to end primarily in the deep jugular chain around the carotid bifurcation.
