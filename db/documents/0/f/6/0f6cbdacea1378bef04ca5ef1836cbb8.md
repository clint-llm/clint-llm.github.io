Balloon valvuloplasty or aortic valve replacement are indicated procedures for symptomatic aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. A bioprosthetic valve (i.e., cadaveric, xenograft, or Ross procedure) or mechanical valve represent options. Following the placement of a mechanical valve, lifelong anticoagulation therapy is necessary. An additional valvular option is in development called Tissue-engineered heart valves.

Cardiac surgery on the aortic valve falls into two basic groups: those of "plastic" or "repair," which maintains the native valve, and "replacement" interventions, in which the valve is replaced with a prosthesis (biological or mechanical). Aortic plastic interventions consist of repairing the valve to correct its pathology (insufficiency or stenosis) without replacing it. Whenever possible, it is preferable to repair a valve rather than replace it because proper valve function is associated with better maintenance of cardiac function, better survival, and less risk of endocarditis; moreover, there is often no need for anticoagulant treatment.
