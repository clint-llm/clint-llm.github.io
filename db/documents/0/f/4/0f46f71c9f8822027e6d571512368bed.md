A Paleolithic diet is the modern interpretation of the diet that humans ate during the Paleolithic or "Old Stone Age" era. This period, about 2.5 million years ago, was notable for the anatomic and physiologic changes taking place in humans as they adapted to climate change, learned to cook meat using fire, and began to use stone tools for greater access to food and resources. Anthropologists hold that the diet of our ancestors heavily influenced their neural expansion, increasing brain size, and reduction in their gastrointestinal tract size. This activity describes the benefits and indications of the paleolithic diet and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in ensuring patients eat a healthy diet.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the function of the paleolithic diet.
- Describe the issues of concern regarding the paleolithic diet.
- Review the clinical significance of a paleolithic diet.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance patient education about diet and improve outcomes.
