EMS must quickly assess the patient and obtain their pertinent history due to time constraints as the ultimate goal of every EMS encounter is transport to an emergency department (ED). EMS providers can use the pediatric assessment triangle (PAT) to assess the appearance, work of breathing, and circulation as a quick and validated method to determine the level of care required. The PAT can distinguish a stable patient from respiratory distress, and from respiratory failure. Providers should observe the patient’s work of breathing (including positioning, retractions, nasal flaring, audible wheezing), as well as auscultate for abnormal lung sounds. The lack of abnormal lung sounds may be an ominous sign of poor air movement in a patient at risk for respiratory failure. Pertinent items from the patient’s history include prior diagnosis of asthma, onset, and triggers for the exacerbation, current asthma medications, and prior ED visits or hospitalizations for asthma (including intensive care unit admissions and/or intubations). In children younger than 2 years of age, providers should be aware that bronchiolitis may mimic asthma. In toddlers, providers should also be aware that wheezing can be a sign of foreign body ingestion.
