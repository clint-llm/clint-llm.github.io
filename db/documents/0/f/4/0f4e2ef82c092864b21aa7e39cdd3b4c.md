Indications of ICD according to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Rhythm Society (ACC/AHRS) 2008:

Class I in patients having any of the following:

- Survivors of cardiac arrest due to hemodynamically unstable sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or FF after evaluation and exclusion of any reversible cause

- Structural heart disease, with spontaneous sustained VT whether hemodynamically stable or not

- Unexplained syncope, with hemodynamically significant sustained VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF), induced at electrophysiology study (EPS)

- Ischemic cardiomyopathy patients with left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 35% due to prior MI who a minimum of 40 days post-MI and are in NYHA functional class II or III.

- Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with LVEF 35% or less and in NYHA functional class II or III.

- Patients with LV dysfunction due to prior MI who are a minimum of 40 days post-MI, and LVEF less than 30%, with New York Heart Association functional class I

- Non-sustained VT due to prior MI, LVEF less than 40%, and sustained VT or inducible VF at EPS.

Class IIa

- Unexplained syncope, non-ischemic DCM, and significant LV dysfunction

- Patients with sustained VT and normal or near-normal ventricular function

- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who have one or more major risk factors for sudden cardiac death

- Prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD/C) who have one or more risk factors for sudden cardiac death

- Patients with Long QT syndrome, to reduce sudden cardiac death, who are suffering syncope or Ventricular tachycardia

- Nonhospitalized patients are awaiting transplantation

- Brugada syndrome patients who have had syncope or have documented VT that has not resulted in cardiac arrest

- Catecholaminergic polymorphic VT who have syncope and/or documented sustained VT while receiving beta blockers

- Patients with cardiac sarcoidosis, Chagas disease, and giant cell myocarditis.

Class IIb

- Non-ischemic heart disease with LVEF 35% and who are in NYHA functional class I.

- Long-QT syndrome patients and risk factors for sudden cardiac death

- ICD therapy may be considered in patients with sudden cardiac death and advanced structural heart disease in whom without a defining cause by invasive or noninvasive methods

- Patients with a familial cardiomyopathy associated with sudden death

- Patients with LV noncompaction.
