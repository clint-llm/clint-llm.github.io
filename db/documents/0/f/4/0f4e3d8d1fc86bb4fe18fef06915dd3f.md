When providing interpleural analgesia, medication is injected into the pleural cavity. Before accessing the pleural cavity, the provider must first pass a needle through the intercostal space of the posterior or lateral thoracic wall. The intercostal spaces contain 3 muscle layers. The external intercostal muscles form the most superficial muscular layer of the intercostal space. The internal intercostal muscles form the next muscular layer. The innermost intercostal muscles form the deepest muscle layer of the intercostal space. A neurovascular bundle, containing an intercostal vein, artery, and nerve, is also located in the intercostal space.

The intercostal nerve is derived from the anterior rami of the thoracic spinal nerve. These rami of the thoracic spinal nerves exit the intervertebral foramina and are typically initially located in the endothoracic fascia, just superficial to the parietal pleura. However, as these nerves course more distally from the neuraxis, they begin toÂ pass superficially at the angle of the ribs. At this point, the nerves will continue their distal course between the internal and innermost intercostal muscles. As these nerves pass through the intercostal space, they tend to be located just under the rib along with the other components of the neurovascular bundles.

Two serous membranes form the pleural cavity.
