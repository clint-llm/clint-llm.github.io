Treatment is primarily supportive and consists of rinsing the affected area with soap and water until any residual odor disappears or for up to twenty minutes. The use of topical corticosteroids and analgesics should be considered, and a 1% hydrocortisone cream can be applied to affected areas three times daily in appropriate cases. There is anecdotal evidence suggesting the use of topical alcohols, which may break down any remaining chemicals on the skin; however, clinical studies regarding the efficacy of adjunctive treatment with alcohols are lacking.
