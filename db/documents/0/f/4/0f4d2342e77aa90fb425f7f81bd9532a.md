The forearm is a vital structure in the human body that is essential for completing activities of daily living. It is designed to help maximize versatility by allowing pronation and supination of the hand. Forearm fractures can lead to significant short-term and long-term disability, particularly if treated incorrectly. The Monteggia fracture is a fracture of the proximal ulna associated with dislocation of the radial head. Monteggia fractures can be difficult to diagnose, and debilitating complications can occur if proper management is not instituted. Technological advances in radiography and fracture research have helped to better define, classify, and guide operative management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify common physical exam findings of a Monteggia fracture.
- Describe the typical imaging findings associated with a Monteggia fracture.
- Review the injuries commonly seen in association with a Monteggia fracture. 
- Explain strategies to enhance communication and collaboration between medical, radiologic, and surgical teams to improve care for patients with Monteggia fractures.
