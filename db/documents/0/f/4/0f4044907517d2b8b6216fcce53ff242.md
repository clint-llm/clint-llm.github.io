A commonly utilized procedure in most radiology practices is placing a drain or catheter percutaneously under imaging guidance. Usually, the development of an abscess, no matter location in the body, requires further intervention when a simple incision and drainage cannot be performed. Percutaneous drainage can bridge the gap between non-invasive and surgical intervention with minimally invasive, image-guided drainage. Depending on the preference of the performing radiologist and location of the abscess, drainage catheter placement can be performed under computer tomography or ultrasound guidance. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in carrying out the procedure successfully for the best patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for percutaneous abscess drainage.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to percutaneous abscess drainage.
- Outline appropriate evaluation techniques for the potential complications and their clinical significance of percutaneous abscess drainage.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance percutaneous abscess drainage and improve outcomes.
