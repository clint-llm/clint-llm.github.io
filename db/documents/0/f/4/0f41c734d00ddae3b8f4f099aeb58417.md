Larger cysts are more likely to cause significant symptoms and cause complications.

Reported complications include hemorrhage, rupture into the peritoneal cavity following a traumatic event, bile duct torsion, secondary infection, compression of the biliary tree, Malignant transformation in case of cystadenoma, and anaphylactic shock due to a hydatid cyst—several other rare complications such as Budd-Chiari syndrome secondary to a rapidly enlarging cyst obstructing the hepatic vein. Also, a case report described an inferior vena cava thrombus caused by external pressure from a simple hepatic cyst had been reported.

Liver failure is a rare manifestation in patients with isolated PLCD. In patients with co-existing ADPKD patients, extrarenal manifestations include Cerebral aneurysms, pancreatic cysts, Cardiac valve disease, Colonic diverticula, Abdominal wall, inguinal hernia, and seminal vesicle cyst might exist and should be evaluated.
