**Excessive Accommodation**

The long duration of near work is an essential factor in the etiology of the accommodative excess.

- Young individuals with hyperopia often use excess accommodation to get clear vision without refractive correction.

- Young myopes performing near activities for long duration use excess accommodative effort associated with excessive convergence.

- Astigmatic errors at a young age may also be associated with excessive accommodation.

- Presbyopes may use excessive accommodation to attain clearer vision for near work.

**Spasm of Accommodation**

This is a spontaneous spasm of accommodation in children with a refractive anomaly that impairs their vision (hypermetropia, astigmatism, and sometimes even myopia).

Overstimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) is also associated with muscle fatigue and part of excessive accommodation, excessive convergence, and mitotic pupils. This condition is known as the spasm of near reflex (SNR).

This may result from various factors, including:

- Topical medications (parasympathomimetics, cholinergic drugs including pilocarpine)

- Myasthenia gravis

- Psychological factors (including anxiety)

- After the refractive procedures, including laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK)

- Head trauma

- Opioid use disorder (OUD)

- The toxic reaction of drugs (sulphonamides) and antipsychotic drug administration (haloperidol and biperiden).
