Healthcare workers, including MDs, DOs, PAs, and NPs who prescribe baclofen, should educate the patient on the safe use of this drug. It works well as a muscle relaxant, but its use to manage low back pain is limited. The drug should not be combined with narcotics, sedatives, or hypnotics. Also, baclofen should not be prescribed for a prolonged duration.

The healthcare team's open communication and collaborative work are essential for baclofen use. The prescriber will make the clinical decision to use baclofen, but the pharmacist should verify the appropriateness of the dose, mode of administration and perform medication reconciliation to rule out drug interactions. In many cases, nurses will administer the drug, particularly intrathecally, and should be aware of the signs of adverse effects or excessive dosing. When the pharmacist or nurse encounters a reason for concern, they must be empowered to communicate it to the treating clinicians immediately. This interprofessional team approach will optimize baclofen therapy while minimizing adverse events. [Level 5]
