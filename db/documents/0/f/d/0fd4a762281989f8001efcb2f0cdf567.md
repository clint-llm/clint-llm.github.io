The median is the middle value of a set of numbers. The median is the same as the 50th percentile for the set of numbers. In other words, the median is the middle of a set of numbers with half of the values less than the median and half the values greater than the median.

A short example will help clarify this point. Take the set of seven numbers (8, 6, 9, 5, 8, 23, 4). To find the median, we first sort the numbers from lowest to highest (in ascending order). The numbers sorted are (4, 5, 6, 8, 8, 9, 23). The median is then the middle number. As there are seven numbers in the set, the fourth number is the median, which is '8' in our example. Note the median is different from the mean. The mean is the "average" of the values in the set, which would be 9 as calculated by:

What does one do if there is an even set of numbers? Then the median is the average of the two middle numbers. Use the second set of numbers to show this principle. The second set of numbers is (7, 3, 10, 2, 9, 2, 1, 4). Then, order the set of numbers and get (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10). The second set of numbers has eight numbers, with the two middle numbers being 3 and 4. The median would then be the average of these two numbers or 3.5 (calculated as (3+4)/2 =  3.5). Note this median of 3.5 is again different than the mean or average of the set of numbers, which 4.75 as calculated by:
