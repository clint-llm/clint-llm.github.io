In the undifferentiated sick neonate presenting with cyanosis, a broad differential diagnosis must be considered, including but not limited to neonatal sepsis, non-accidental trauma, midgut volvulus, congenital heart disease, and inborn errors of metabolism. Blood work should include glucose, complete blood count with differential, complete metabolic panel, blood gas analysis, serum ammonia, serum lactic acid, serum ketones, and consideration for cardiac biomarkers including troponin and brain natriuretic peptide. In the setting of chloramphenicol toxicity, serum chloramphenicol levels may be drawn. Radiologic studies should include chest and abdominal films, and CT head or abdominal ultrasound (depending on the history). An electrocardiogram should also be obtained.
