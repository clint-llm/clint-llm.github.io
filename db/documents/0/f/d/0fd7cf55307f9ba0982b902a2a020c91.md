Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome has a heterogeneous presentation and can be difficult to diagnose at times. The following conditions can closely mimic the IRIS and must be considered or ruled out before the diagnosis of the IRIS is made.

1. Side effects of HAART therapy or anti-microbial treatment. 2. Resistance to anti-microbial agents and progression of opportunistic infections (OI) as a result. 3. Lack of adherence to anti-microbial agents leading to worsening of existing OI. 4. New untreated opportunistic infections.
