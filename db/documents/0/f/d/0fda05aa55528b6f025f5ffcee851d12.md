HV deformity, also known as a bunion, is one of the common forefoot deformities. It manifests as a deformity in the big toe, causing it to bend towards the other toes, and the joint tends to become red and painful. The exact cause is not well understood. However, it tends to occur more often in women and people who wear tight shoes or heels. The diagnosis is typically through a physical exam. However, imaging is essential because it helps assess the severity of the deformity. Treatment centers upon first trialing non-surgical approaches such as wider shoes, use of orthotics, and night splinting. If this is ineffective, surgical management is the recommendation. Patients typically tolerate the surgery well, with bony union usually occurring around 6 to 7 weeks postoperatively.

If the patient is a smoker, the healing may take longer, and there is a higher risk of complications such as non-union or wound infection.
