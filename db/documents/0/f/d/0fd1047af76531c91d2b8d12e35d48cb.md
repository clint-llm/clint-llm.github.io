Histologic features of CTCL are subtle and can mimic benign inflammation. Usual findings are haloed lymphocytes, exocytosis, epidermotropism, Pautrier microabscess, severely convoluted, and hyperchromatic lymphocytes in the epidermis and lymphocytes within the basal layer.

Bone marrow biopsy assists in diagnosis, ruling out other diseases, and prognostic assessment of PTCL. PTCL has diverse histological patterns and can have overlapping features of other diseases like B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin disease. Adult T-cell lymphoma shows peripheral circulating lymphocytes with abnormally convoluted nuclei (feather nuclei, cloverleaf cell). ALCL is characterized by hallmark cells with horseshoe-shaped nuclei. Some common and universal findings include polymorphous infiltrate with the tumor cells, with eosinophils, plasma cells, histiocytes, and blood vessels.
