The emergency cricothyrotomy is the last step in the CICO algorithm and is a step taken to save a patient's life. Therefore, it is a procedure in which the benefit drastically outweighs the risk. However, the procedure is not without complications. Complication rates differ from study to study based on the clinical scenario, level of training, or procedure location, ranging from 0% to as high as 54%. The most common complication is bleeding. Bleeding is expected and should be ignored during the procedure. Pressure or packing at the site should provide control if severe bleeding occurs. Other immediate complications include lacerations of tracheal cartilage, including the thyroid, cricoid, or tracheal rings, perforation of the trachea, creation of a false tract (passage of the ET tube into a potential space other than the trachea), and infection.
