One of the most important goals in the management of IBS patients is to develop a trusting patient-physician relationship by actively listening, showing empathy, and setting realistic expectations for treatment.

Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable broad-spectrum antibiotic sometimes used to treat patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome who take rifaximin have less abdominal pain and diarrhea. The effectiveness of rifaximin in patients with IBS is used as evidence to support the idea that bacterial overgrowth plays a role in the etiology of IBS.
