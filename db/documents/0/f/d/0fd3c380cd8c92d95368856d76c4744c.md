The classical clinical presentation is of a young boy, who is aged between 3 months to early adulthood, with recurrent bacterial infections. During the third trimester of pregnancy, maternal IgG transfers to the fetus protecting the neonate from early infections. However, this effect wanes by six months of age, which is when the first signs of disease become apparent. The average age at diagnosis for patients with a family history of XLA is 2.6 years of age, while those without a positive family history are diagnosed only at 5.4 years of age on average.

However, it is important to note that infections are relatively common, and knowing when to suspect XLA is key. Proper family history for frequent hospitalizations or deaths in boys at an early age can hint towards XLA well before symptoms of infections manifest. Even without a positive family history, signs hinting towards an evaluation for a primary immunodeficiency include recurrent infections, atypical infections, and unusually severe infections requiring hospitalization in a young male.

On physical examination, the absence of tonsils, chronic cough, chronic rhinitis, post-nasal drip, and clubbing can be seen. Growth charts may show evidence of failure to thrive especially in older children.
