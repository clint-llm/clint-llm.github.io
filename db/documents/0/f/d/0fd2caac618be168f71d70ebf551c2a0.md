Physical and chemical lesions of the oral cavity are oftentimes discovered during routine examination and are a common finding as the oral cavity is continually exposed to trauma and chemical agents. These can range from traumatic occlusion, sharp occlusal anatomy, acidic and alkaline products or drugs, and food or drink at varying temperatures. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of physical and chemical lesions of the oral mucosa and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe common physical and chemical lesions of the oral mucosa.
- Identify the etiology of discovered physical and chemical lesions of the oral mucosa.
- Outline appropriate patient education to aid in the prevention of physical and chemical lesions of the oral mucosa.
- Review how interprofessional team collaboration and communication can improve patient outcomes for physical and chemical lesions of the oral mucosa.
