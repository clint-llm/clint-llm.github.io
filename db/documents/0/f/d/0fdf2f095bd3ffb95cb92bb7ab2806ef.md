The major indication for assaying gastrin is to diagnose Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which is a gastrin-producing tumor resulting in recurrent, treatment-refractory peptic ulcer disease and diarrhea.

However, pentagastrin does have other indications. Parenteral injection with synthetic pentagastrin has been used as a diagnostic aid for carcinoid syndrome by inducing symptoms in patients who are difficult to discern due to the minimal presence of symptoms. It has also been used in nuclear medicine to detect the presence of Meckel's diverticulum.

Pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin test can be used in patients with normal calcitonin levels suspected of having medullary thyroid carcinoma. If positive, the patient’s serum calcitonin levels will elevate to levels significantly above the normal range. Also, pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin release can be used postoperatively in these patients to detect any remaining calcitonin-secreting parafollicular cells (C-cells).
