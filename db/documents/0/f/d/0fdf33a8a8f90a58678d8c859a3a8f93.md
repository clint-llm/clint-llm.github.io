Ocular surface squamous neoplasia is a broad entity that comprises the spectrum of squamous neoplasms of conjunctiva and cornea. The varied malignancies include conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), corneal epithelial dysplasia, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The clinical manifestation can range from an ocular mass, excessive irritation, congestion, prominent feeder vessels, and reduced visual acuity. The diagnosis rests on histopathological evaluation of the excised mass and imaging to rule out infiltrative neoplasms. A high index of clinical suspicion, prompt diagnosis, meticulous management, and regular follow-up post-surgical excision results in an excellent outcome. This review describes etiology, risk factors, clinical features, investigations, imaging modalities, treatment options, differential diagnosis, and complications of ocular surface squamous neoplasia.
