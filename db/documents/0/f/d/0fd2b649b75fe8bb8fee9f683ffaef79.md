Acoustic neuroma accounts for around 80% to 90% of CPA lesions. Differential diagnosis of an acoustic neuroma include:

- Meningioma (5% to 10% of CPA lesions)

- Ectodermal inclusion tumors

- Epidermoid (5% to 7% of CPA lesions)

- Dermoid

- Metastases

- Neuroma from cranial nerves other than cranial nerve VIII:

- Trigeminal neuroma.

- Facial nerve neuroma

- Neurinoma of the lowest four cranial nerves (IX, X, XI, XII)

- Arachnoid Cyst

- Neurenteric Cyst

- Cholesterol granuloma (distinct from epidermoid)

- Aneurysm

- Dolichobasilar ectasia

- Extensions of nearby lesions in the CPA:

- Brainstem or cerebellar glioma

- Pituitary adenoma

- Craniopharyngioma

- Chordoma and tumors of skull base

- Fourth ventricle tumors (ependymoma, medulloblastoma)

- Choroids plexus papilloma from the fourth ventricle through foramen of Luschka

- Glomus jugulare tumor

- Tumors of the temporal bone
