Unfortunately, irrespective of chosen treatment modality, metacarpal fractures have associated complications, and treating those is essential to achieve good outcomes. The scope for complications is greater with open injuries and those with a soft tissue damage component. The greater the damage to surrounding soft tissues, the poorer the outcome tends to be, and the incidence of complications increases.

Metacarpal fracture complications include:

- **Compartment syndrome.**Severe trauma and/or soft tissue injury may result in compartment syndrome of the hand whether or not the injury presents in a closed (as opposed to open) fashion.

- **Stiffness.**Stiffness is common and often coexists with tendon adhesions. Longer immobilization periods, as well as periosteal stripping and neurovascular injuries, increase the risk of it. Prevention includes using low-profile plates, splinting in functional positions, pain control, and early mobilization. In severe cases, tenolysis might be needed to improve the outcome.

- **Malunion.**Malunion is the most common complication and results in a deformity, which can be functionally and cosmetically problematic. Extensors are more likely to be affected than flexors in metacarpal fractures because of bone shortening. Surgery is required to treat malunion if indicated in a particular patient.

- **Non-union.**Non-union is a lack of bone healing four months after the injury. It is rare and commonly associated with nerve injury, infection, bone loss, and devascularizing methods of fixation. Diagnosis is made clinically with the help of radiological evidence. It can result from inadequate immobilization, failed fixation, bone loss, and poor tissue approximation. The treatment is a stable fixation with or without bone grafting. Occasionally tenolysis is also required to improve function.

- **Tendon rupture.**Plate fixation runs a risk of tendon irritation and, in the worst cases, rupture. If plates are used, periosteal closure should be done whenever possible to reduce this risk.

- **Infection (including osteomyelitis).**Although metacarpal osteomyelitis is rare, it requires the removal of all metalwork, taking cultures from tissues, and thorough debridement. Over 50% of such infections end in amputation.

- **Cold intolerance.**Cold intolerance is a known complication of hand trauma and may affect over a third of patients.

- **Chronic pain.**Intra-articular fractures have a slightly worse prognosis, with 40% of patients with metacarpal base fractures reporting chronic pain irrespective of the management method. Arthrodesis can be performed to manage this if severe.

- **Instability.**Long-term instability is a risk, particularly in thumb base fractures.
