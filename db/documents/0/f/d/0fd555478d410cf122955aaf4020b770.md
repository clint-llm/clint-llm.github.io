Color vision deficiency can result from a variety of abnormalities, both systemic and specifically within the visual system. Defects in the genes responsible for visual transduction often lead to congenital color vision deficits. Any abnormalities of the retina, optic nerve, optic tract, and visual cortex can cause defects in color vision. As such, systemic diseases like diabetes can alter color vision, as can eye-specific diseases like glaucoma and cataracts.
