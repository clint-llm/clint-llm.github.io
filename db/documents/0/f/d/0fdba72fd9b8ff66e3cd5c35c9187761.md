**Terminology Confusion**

It is crucial to understand stereognosis relative to a set of related terms: astereognosis, agnosia, and tactile object agnosia. Recall that stereognosis is the ability to perceive the physical form and identity of an object based on tactile stimuli alone. Astereognosis refers to the inability to perceive the form and identity of an object when physically manipulating it through active touch. By definition, astereognosis necessitates functioning peripheral sensory modalities (pain, temperature, fine touch, and vibration sense) and results from pathology within the central cortical integration of this sensory information. Astereognosis falls under a family of conditions called agnosias, which are classified based on the sensory modality involved (auditory, visual, or tactile). In this terminology, one should also be aware that the term tactile object agnosia is used interchangeably and is practically synonymous with astereognosis.

**Limitations of Testing**

Because stereognosis is a function of cortical sensory areas, it is worth noting that cortical sensory function is not testable if the patient has peripheral lesions that cause dysfunction in the afferent pathways that supply the cerebrum. For example, if a patient has peripheral neuropathy that limits the ability for tactile signals to reach the brain, it can be challenging to ascertain whether or not the patient's stereognosis limitations are secondary to their peripheral neuropathy or a cortical processing deficit.
