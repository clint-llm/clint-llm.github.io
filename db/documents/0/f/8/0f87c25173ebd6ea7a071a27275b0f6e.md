The differential diagnosis for CN is broad, including both common axial lumbar spine pathology and peripheral nerve and muscle etiologies. Lumbar radiculopathy secondary to intervertebral disc herniation must be considered. Other causes of lumbar radiculopathies, such as foraminal stenosis due to lumbar spondylosis, also remain high on the differential. These causes can mimic symptoms of CN like lower extremity pain and paresthesia. Furthermore, extra-spinal disorders like piriformis syndrome, which can lead to compression of the sciatic nerve, and myofascial pain syndromes involving the quadratus lumborum and gluteal musculature can present similarly to CN.

Lastly, sacroiliac joint dysfunction is a prevalent musculoskeletal issue that produces symptoms in the low back, gluteal, and hip regions that must be considered when evaluating CN. A cluneal nerve block is an important diagnostic step in differentiating CN from these other clinical disorders.
