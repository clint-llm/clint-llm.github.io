Articular cartilage defects often result in pain and discomfort that seriously affect a patient's quality of life. When non-surgical management fails, osteochondral autograft or allograft transplantation is a reasonable solution to provide patients with hope for a better quality of life. With joint pain reduced or eliminated, patients may return to normal activity while avoiding more invasive or elevated risk profile procedures such as total knee arthroplasty. Prolonging an active lifestyle is important and can lead to overall better physical and mental health.
