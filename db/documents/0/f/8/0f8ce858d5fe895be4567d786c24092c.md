The incidence of any of the cicatricial alopecias is not precisely known. Lichen planopilaris has been reported as the most frequent primary scarring alopecia, accounting for 43% of people in a 72-patient series. Frontal fibrosing alopecia and Graham-Little syndrome are considered variants of lichen planopilaris. It affects women, usually between ages 40 to 60 years, more often than men. Up to 50% of patients may develop characteristic lichen planus lesions that affect the skin, mucous membranes, or nails.
