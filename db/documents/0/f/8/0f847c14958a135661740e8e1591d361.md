**Medical Management**

**Asymptomatic Patients**

Asymptomatic patients need no specific treatment. Observe the patients for the development of signs and symptoms. Schedule regular medical follow-ups.

**Symptomatic Patients**

Treatment option for symptomatic patients includes both medical/conservative management and surgical repair. Medical treatment includes:

- Hemodynamic stabilization of fluid overload and pulmonary edema

- Rate and rhythm control and anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation

- Thromboembolic prophylaxis with anticoagulation against deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and stroke

- Obtain surgical consultation

**Surgical Management**

Surgery is the definitive treatment. Complete surgical resection of atrial appendage/accessory membrane through a midline sternotomy under cardiopulmonary bypass and closure of atrial septum with a pericardial patch provides the optimum cure. The 10-year survival rate following surgery is 83%, while patients with coexisting congenital heart diseases have a greater risk of adverse outcomes and a lower survival rate.
