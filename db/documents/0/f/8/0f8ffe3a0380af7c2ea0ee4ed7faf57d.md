As mentioned above, the clinical presentation is contingent upon the degree of pulmonary obstruction, the presence of a VSD, and the relationship of the great arteries.

**Patients with pulmonary obstruction**

Patients often present with cyanosis in the newborn period, especially after the ductus closes. On physical examination TA with pulmonary oligemia would show central cyanosis, there would be normal pulses, and there may be a diminution of the right ventricular impulse. There may be a thrill present in the context of a restrictive VSD or severe PS. The presence of a holosystolic murmur in the left lower sternal border would suggest a VSD, while occasionally, the continuous murmur of the PDA may be auscultated. Additionally, a systolic ejection murmur may be heard at the left upper sternal border correlating with pulmonary stenosis. Clubbing may occur in older patients with unrepaired TA with chronic cyanosis.

**Patients without pulmonary obstruction**

Patients with a VSD and no pulmonary stenosis would have large pulmonary blood flow. These patients could be missed at birth as they are not cyanotic and may be discovered when pulmonary vascular resistance drops, and they exhibit pulmonary over circulation. This condition manifests with signs and symptoms of heart failure, with tachypnea or respiratory distress, poor feeding, and growth. In patients with pulmonary plethora, a physical examination would be significant for tachypnea, tachycardia, and hepatomegaly.
