Patients with Frey syndrome often have a history of prior parotid surgery, neck surgery, trauma, or infection of the parotid region, although idiopathic and infantile presentations may also occur. They report unilateral sweating, flushing, neuralgia, pruritus, and warmth over the preauricular and temporal areas after gustatory stimuli, especially with sour and spicy foods.
