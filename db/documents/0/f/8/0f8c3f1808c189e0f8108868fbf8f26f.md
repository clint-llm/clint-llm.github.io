The most common presenting symptoms in patients with Chilaiditi syndrome are abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, constipation, changes in bowel habits followed by respiratory distress, and less frequently cardiac symptoms such as angina like chest pain and arrhythmias. These symptoms are usually worse at night while the patient is supine. Rarely, a patient will present with a combination of these multiorgan symptoms. The gastrointestinal symptoms may range from mild to severe (e.g., acute abdomen).
