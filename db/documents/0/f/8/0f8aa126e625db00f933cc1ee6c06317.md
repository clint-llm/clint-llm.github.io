If the area to be aspirated is superficial, then simply sterilizing the area before performing fine-needle aspiration is all that is necessary.

If the procedure is to be performed laparoscopically, endoscopically, or percutaneously then additional preparation is required as there would be for any procedure performed that way, including confirming the planned site and sedating or anesthetizing the patient.
