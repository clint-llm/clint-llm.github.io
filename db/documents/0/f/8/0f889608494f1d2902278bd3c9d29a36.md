To avoid hydrazine toxicity, those potentially exposed to it through manufacturing or the military should be aware of the recommended exposure guidelines. The National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH) has set out certain Acute Exposure Guideline Levels for Hazardous Substances. The guideline level for the airborne concentration for which the general population is expected to experience discomfort or irritation for hydrazine is 0.1 ppm. The guideline level for the airborne concentration for which the general population is expected to experience long-lasting effects is 1.6 ppm in 8 hours.

The guideline level for the airborne concentration for which the general population is expected to experience life-threatening health effects or death is 4.4 ppm in 8 hours. Overall the NIOSH exposure limit is 0.03 ppm with a 2-hour ceiling. The odor threshold for hydrazine’s ammonia-like odor is 3 to 4 ppm. There are also guidelines from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, and Short-Term Public Emergency Guidance Level. Those exposed to hydrazine should also be educated about the possible symptoms that acute exposure may cause.
