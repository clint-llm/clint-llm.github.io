Civil commitment is ubiquitous in the psychiatric setting. Not only must clinicians be cognizant of the nuanced variations of differing jurisdictions, but they must also appropriately assess the necessity of initiating an involuntary hospitalization. It is no longer sufficient that a patient simply exhibits "psychotic" symptoms to be committed but instead must meet a specific threshold criterion. Furthermore, the clinician will evaluate whether the patient is appropriate for hospitalization while also considering the necessity to uphold patient autonomy.
