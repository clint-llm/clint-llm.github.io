The degree of pathologic central nervous system findings in patients with biotinidase deficiency varies based on the severity of the clinical condition before death. Features are similar to those found in Wernicke encephalopathy or Leigh syndrome, although the pathologic brain lesions appear more widespread. Myelin seems to be significantly affected as opposed to neurons or axonal processes. Necrotic lesions have been observed in the pons, hypothalamus, medulla, and hippocampus. Microscopically, affected areas show micro-cavitation, gliosis, and capillary proliferation. In addition, extensive cerebral edema may be seen in many major white matter tracts.
