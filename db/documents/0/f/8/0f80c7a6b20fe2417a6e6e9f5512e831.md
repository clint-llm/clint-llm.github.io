In adults, recovery of idiopathic vocal cord paralysis (or vocal cord paralysis due to non-transecting nerve injury) can occur as early as 12 months following injury. Although spontaneous recovery is expected in 55% of patients, full recovery can be very protracted. The prognosis for complete spontaneous recovery is far worse in bilateral vocal cord paralysis than unilateral. Recovery of glottic function is otherwise most dependent on the underlying etiology, and the overall prognosis of this root cause.
