TxA2 serves as a positive-feedback mediator during platelet activation. Because of its short half-life of about 30 seconds, TxA2 acts in an autocrine or paracrine matter to activate adjacent platelets and generate more TxA2 and amplify the action of other, more potent, platelet agonists. When TxA2 binds to TP, there is platelet activation leading to platelet-shape change, activation of phospholipase A2, platelet degranulation of dense granules and alpha granules, and platelet aggregation. TxA2 also induces vasoconstriction of smooth muscle**.**
