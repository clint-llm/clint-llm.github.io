Patients with hepatorenal syndrome present with signs and symptoms of severe liver failure. These patients initially can present with fatigue and lethargy which can be multifactorial. This may be contributed to by loss of appetite due to increasing nausea. Over time, patients become increasingly more jaundiced, originating in the sclera and then spreading from head-to-toe.Â The liver's synthetic function becomes affected, and patients become coagulopathic and more likely to bleed. As all this occurs, there is a very slow, gradual build-up of ascitic fluid in the peritoneum due to the intravascular loss of albumin. Confusion due to hepatic encephalopathy is likely the last and most severe stage of the liver disease as a result of the liver failing to break down toxic metabolites. Most importantly these patients notice they urinate less frequently in smaller and smaller volumes as they become oliguric.
