Corticosteroids are the first-line treatment of Diamond Blackfan anemia. However, due to long-term side effects of corticosteroids, patients with DBA often require chronic blood transfusions and concurrent iron chelation therapy.

The mechanism of action of corticosteroids remains obscure, but it seems to have a nonspecific anti-apoptotic effect on erythroid progenitors.

DBA may also receive treatment with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This approach is the only treatment that cures the hematological manifestation of DBA; the procedure proves to be risky if a matched sibling donor is not available.

According to recent literature, gene therapy and gene editing may be potential future treatments for DBA.

Since the RPS19 gene presents in 25% of DBA cases, gene therapy may prove beneficial in patients with the mutation; this involves the replacement of the normal copy of gene RPS19 to rid the patient of DBA symptoms.

About 20 to 25% of DBA patients undergo spontaneous remission.
