The differential diagnoses of dental fluorosis are extensive. They include and are not limited to early carious lesions, molar-incisor hypomineralisation, developmental disorders of enamel and dentine, including amelogenesis imperfecta, Turner hypoplasia, tetracycline staining, and dental manifestations of celiac disease.

The key to recognizing dental fluorosis is a positive fluoride history within the critical window of amelogenesis, a symmetrical chronological distribution in the pattern of affected teeth, and an increased caries resistance.
