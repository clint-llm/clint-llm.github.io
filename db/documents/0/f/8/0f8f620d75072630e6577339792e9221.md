Depending on the etiological factors, dacryostenosis can be classified into the following two broad categories:

**Congenital Dacryostenosis**

The most common cause of congenital dacryostenosis is a mechanical obstruction located in the distal part of the nasolacrimal duct (NLD) at the level of the valve of Hasner, where this structure enters the nose.

When both the proximal and distal portions of the nasolacrimal system are obstructed, a dacryocystocele can occur. In this case, a bluish bulge below the medial canthus is seen. Congenital dacryocystoceles are less common but may be associated with potentially serious complications.

**Acquired Dacryostenosis**

The etiology of acquired dacryostenosis is multifactorial and is not fully understood. Some cases may be related to trauma, neoplasm, systemic disease, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy.

Some authors suggest that the cause may be from ascending inflammation from the region of the nose and sinus cavities.

Familial predisposition and osteoporotic changes have also been suggested as being predisposing factors.
