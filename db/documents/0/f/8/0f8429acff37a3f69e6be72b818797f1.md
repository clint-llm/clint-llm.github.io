Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is a clinical condition arises as acute respiratory distress taking place in conjunction with severe neurological damage/injury. By definition, this condition incorporates a clinical picture of a large accumulation of extra-vascular pulmonary fluid, of acute onset, always in the immediate outcome of serious central nervous system (CNS) lesions, mostly the brainstem. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of neurogenic pulmonary edema and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of neurogenic pulmonary edema.
- Review the pathophysiology of neurogenic pulmonary edema.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for neurogenic pulmonary edema.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with neurogenic pulmonary edema.
