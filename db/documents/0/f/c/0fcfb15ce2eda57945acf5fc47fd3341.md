Treating patients in pain can often be challenging. It is vital for the healthcare workers (i.e., the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, internist, and orthopedic surgeon) to listen to the patient to obtain a solid history and perform a complete physical exam to diagnose the source of the patient’s pain and importantly, rule out more serious causes for the pain.   Although complications are rare, prompt follow-up after facet joint interventions is necessary to ensure no negative side effects have occurred. The clinician may want to explore other pain mitigation strategies, especially those that do not involve opioids. To help slow down the facet joint disease, educating the patient on the importance of lifestyle changes is of vital importance.

Facet joint arthrosis requires a collaborative interprofessional approach that includes physicians, nurses, therapists, and pharmacists who are engaged and communicate all aspects of the patient's case to bring about the best possible outcome. [Level 5]
