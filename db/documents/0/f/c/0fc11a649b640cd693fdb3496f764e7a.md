A brain PET (positron emission tomography) scan is a highly sensitive nuclear medicine imaging technique that maps the distribution of radiopharmaceuticals in physiological and pathological conditions. This activity describes the process of obtaining a brain PET scan and reviews the current clinical use of neuro PET assessments by the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the PET acquisition process.
- Review the different radiopharmaceuticals used in neurology-related PET.
- Outline the impact of amyloid PET imaging on neurodegenerative outcomes.
- Describe the importance of using F18 Fluorodopa (FDOPA) by the interprofessional team in the evaluation of movement disorders.
