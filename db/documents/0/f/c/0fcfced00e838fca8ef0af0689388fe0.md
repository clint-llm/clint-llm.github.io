Time out is done to confirm the eye and the correct implant and its expiration date.

- The patient should be placed in a comfortable, supine position with the head kept stable.

- The choice of anesthesia depends on the type of implant; larger implants may require local or general anesthesia. For smaller-sized implants, topical anesthesia is suitable. A few surgeons also prefer subconjunctival anesthesia.

- Povidone iodine is used to clean and sterilize the lids, lashes, and surrounding eyes.

- Topical proparacaine hydrochloride drops of 0.5% are applied for topical anesthesia.

- 5% povidone-iodine drops are also instilled in the inferior cul de sac of the conjunctiva.

- A sterile eyelid speculum is inserted in the eye.

- The location of the injection site is marked with calipers depending upon the phakic status: Phakic: 3.5 to 4 mm, Pseudophakic: 3 to 3.5 mm, and Aphakic: 3 mm.

- Superotemporal quadrant is a convenient location.

- A cotton bud dipped in proparacaine drops can provide additional anesthesia to the injection area.

- Always check the implant before insertion.

- Different implants are inserted in different ways as described:

Vitrasert and Retisert are implanted into the vitreous cavity after making a scleral incision at the pars plana and trimming prolapsed vitreous, followed by suturing it in place on the sclera.

Iluvein is the smallest NBI that can be injected with a 25-gauge needle through the pars plana into the vitreous cavity, creating a self-sealing hole.

I-vation implant is surgically fixed at the pars plana. The small diameter of the implant allows implantation through a <0.5mm pars plana sclerotomy. The implant has a thin cup that rests under the conjunctiva.

Ranibizumab PDS has a slightly more complex method of implantation. An infusion line is first placed inferotemporally, followed by peritomy in the superotemporal quadrant. A 3.5 mm long incision in the sclera is made 4 mm posterior to the limbus, and the pars plana are ablated with the laser before making an incision. The implant is then inserted in the scleral wound, and the extrascleral flange helps anchor the sclera. The conjunctiva and tenon capsule is sutured carefully to cover the implant.

Ozurdex is delivered intravitreally through the pars plana with a single-use applicator using a 22-gauge needle device. A tunneled injection technique is used to create an angled intrascleral injection tract to avoid a vitreous prolapse through the scleral puncture.

Verisome is injected with a 30-gauge injector via the pars plana.

- Following the implantation, the presence of the implant in the vitreous cavity, as well as perfusion of the optic disc, should be confirmed using an indirect ophthalmoscope after implantation.

- The speculum is removed, and topical 5% povidone-iodine drops are instilled.

- The eye is temporarily patched for an hour.
