Homocysteine is converted to cysteine and methionine by a combination of B vitamins (B12, B6, and folate) and enzymes (Methylene Tetrahydrofolate Reductase: MTHFR). Specifically, homocysteine is converted to methionine by a process known as remethylation with the help of vitamin B12.  Methionine can subsequently be broken down to S-adenosyl-methionine to be regenerated to homocysteine. In a reaction called transsulfuration, homocysteine is converted to cysteine catalyzed by pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP) and cystathionine B-synthase. Elevations in homocysteine suggest disruptions in one of the components of this reaction.
