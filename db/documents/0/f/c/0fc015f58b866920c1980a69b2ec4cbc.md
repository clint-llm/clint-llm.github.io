All patients should be informed regarding the risks, benefits, and alternatives to all nonoperative and operative treatment options.  While most patients improve and return to baseline function following either type of management pathway, persistent disability and loss of function remain common issues of concern.  Each PHF should be treated on a case-by-case basis and should factor in the patient's age, hand dominance, functional status, social situation, medical comorbidities, and the overall goals and expectations during and after the recovery process.
