With an effective vaccine schedule in place, poliomyelitis is often a forgotten-about disease, but we must recognize that polio is still endemic in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Therefore, a comprehensive interprofessional approach to polio prevention and management is necessary, utilizing an interprofessional team approach that involves clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists, all working collaboratively and delivering a consistent message to the patient/patient's parents regarding vaccination schedules, the importance fo hygiene, and working to treat the disease when it makes an appearance in accordance with best practices. This interprofessional approach to managing polio vaccine scheduling and preventing this disease will result in individual patients and provide societal health benefits. [Level 5]
