Traumatic vertebral artery injuries can have devastating complications. Sanelli et al. reported a stroke rate of 24% and a death rate of 8% in patients with traumatic vertebral artery injury. Mortality in patients with associated cervical spine injury is even higher and approaches 40%. Highest mortality occurs in those with bilateral injury or injury due to penetrating, high-velocity trauma such as blast injury or gunshot wound.

The prognosis in patients with spontaneous vertebral artery dissections depends on location as well as the degree of associated ischemic stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage. In patients with extracranial dissections, anÂ excellent outcome is reported in up to 85% with 5% to 25% have poor neurologic outcome or death. Poor outcome is associated with older age, arterial occlusion, and higher stroke scores at diagnosis.
