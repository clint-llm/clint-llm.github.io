As the parotid duct pierces the buccinator muscle, it should be identified and preserved during surgery, such as while raising the buccinator flap. Small to moderate-sized defects of the oral cavity can have reconstruction with the buccinator flap, which is easy and quick to raise. It replaces mucosa with mucosa and correlates with a very low degree of morbidity at the donor site. It is remarkably elastic and thus can be stretched easily to conform to defects with a complex shape.
