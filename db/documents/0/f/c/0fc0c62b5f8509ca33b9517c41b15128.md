In the absence of the red flags discussed above, no laboratory or radiographic studies are necessary to diagnose or manage mechanical back strains in the acute setting. Inflammatory biomarkers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), are useful for risk stratification of patients with risk factors for infectious spinal pathology or malignancy but have no neurologic deficits on examination. Routine imaging for mechanical back strains is not recommended, as many may have incidental abnormal findings that are unrelated to their pain. More advanced imaging is needed in trauma, failure of conservative management, worsening of symptoms, and new neurologic deficits. Plain radiographs and computed tomography are useful when suspecting fractures. However, patients with signs of spinal cord compression or red flag symptoms need magnetic resonance imaging for an accurate diagnosis.
