Plasma cells develop from antigen-activated B lymphocytes in lymphoid organs, such as the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes, after antigenic stimulation. Blimp-1, IRF4, and XBP-1 transcription factors are known to be essential for the differentiation of mature B cells into plasma cells.

The most immature blood cell of a plasma cell lineage is the plasmablast. Plasmablasts can proliferate and secrete small amounts of antibodies. The terminally differentiated or mature plasma cells are non-proliferating, are much larger than B cells, and can secrete large amounts of antibodies. During their lifespan of 2 to 3 days, they continuously synthesize and secrete antibodies with specificity for the antigen that stimulated the plasma cell precursor to proliferate and differentiate. Estimates are that a single plasma cell can secrete hundreds to thousands of antibody molecules per second, a remarkable measure of the power of the immune response for combating pathogens. Plasma cells, as antibody factories, are important contributors to humoral immunity.

Though the production and secretion of antibodies were long thought to be the sole functions of plasma cells, recent studies indicate plasma cell involvement in immune response regulation. Within this capacity, research has found plasma cells to inhibit the development of follicular T-helper cells.
