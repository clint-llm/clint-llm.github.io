Chronic pyelonephritis with gross findings of the kidney usually distinguishes RN from obstructive pyelonephritis. RN has polar scars, and obstructive pyelonephritis has diffuse hydronephrosis with cortico-medullary atrophy. Advanced VUR may resemble radiographically polycystic kidney disease or unilateral renal cystic disease, a condition that mimics polycystic kidney disease.
