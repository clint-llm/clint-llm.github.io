Overdose of Digoxin may provoke troublesome arrhythmias or malignant hyperkalemia.

The association between digoxin use and mortality has raised many concerns among researchers, as there is some evidence that it seems to increase mortality risks.

Digoxin has a very narrow therapeutic index, and its administration is subject to drug-drug interactions and comorbidities. In the case of overdose, digoxin immune fab is the reversal agent.

The following conditions indicate the use of digoxin immune fab:

- Any digoxin-related life-threatening dysrhythmia

- Refractory hyperkalemia

- Serum digoxin concentration over 15 ng/mL at any timeÂ or above 10 ng/mL 6 hours post-ingestion

- Acute ingestion of 10 mg in adults

- Acute ingestion of 4 mg in children

- Chronic elevation of serum digoxin concentration with altered mental status, dysrhythmias, or severe gastrointestinal symptoms
