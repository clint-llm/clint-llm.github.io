In normal anatomy, the innominate artery is the most proximal branch of the aortic arch.  It arises to the right of and anteriorly to the left common carotid artery.  The artery is short in length and courses superiorly and posteriorly from the aortic arch until it bifurcates into the right subclavian artery and the right common carotid artery at about the level of the sternoclavicular joint. Along its short course, it typically crosses from left to right anterior to the trachea around the ninth tracheal ring. However, due to anatomic variation, it is not uncommon for it to cross at any level from around the sixth ring to the thirteenth ring.

After bifurcation, the right subclavian artery goes on to provide the entire blood supply to the right upper extremity as well as collateral circulation of the head via the right vertebral artery. The right common carotid artery bifurcates into the external carotid and internal carotid arteries, which provide a large percentage of the blood supply to the head and neck.
