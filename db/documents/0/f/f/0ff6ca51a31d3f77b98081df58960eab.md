Endocardial cushions are paired (superior and inferior) mesenchymal structures located in the common atrioventricular canal in the early embryonic period, and there growth is of prime importance in the development of atrioventricular septum and atrioventricular valves.

Based on atrioventricular valve morphology and its development, atrioventricular septal defects are classified into complete and partial.

A complete atrioventricular septal defect is characterized by a common atrioventricular valve, ostium primum atrial septal defect and ventricular septal defect of inlet type. It is caused by the complete failure of the endocardial cushions to fuse.

A partial atrioventricular septal defect is characterized by separate atrioventricular valves, an ostium primum atrial septal defect, a ventricular septal defect of inlet type, and cleft mitral valve. It is caused by incomplete fusion of endocardial cushions.

In the complete form of the atrioventricular septal defect, a common atrioventricular valve has five leaflets, including superior bridging, interior bridging, left mural, right mural, and anterosuperior. Rastelli divided complete atrioventricular septal defect into three anatomical subgroups.

In type A, the superior bridging leaflet of the common atrioventricular valve is attached to the left ventricular surface of the interventricular septum with the help of chordae.

In type B, the superior bridging leaflet of common atrioventricular valve overhangs the interventricular septum and attached to the right ventricle with the help of chordae.

In type C, the superior bridging leaflet does not have an attachment to the interventricular septum and floats freely, thus provides a large unrestricted ventricular septal defect.

Rastelli type A is associated with left-sided obstruction, type C is associated with tetralogy of Fallot and other complex congenital heart diseases, and type B is the least common form of the complete atrioventricular septal defect.
