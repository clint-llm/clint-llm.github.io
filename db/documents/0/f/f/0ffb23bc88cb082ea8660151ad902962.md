The most common causes of amyloidosis are the immunoglobulin-light-chain relate amyloidosis (AL), ATTR amyloidosis, and reactive amyloidosis (AA) due to chronic inflammatory diseases like chronic infections and rheumatoid arthritis. AL amyloidosis is acquired and is caused by a small plasma cell clone that produces misfolded amyloidogenic light chains that deposit in different organs and tissues.

AA amyloidosis is associated with various chronic inflammatory conditions, chronic or local microbial infections, and rarely with neoplasms. AA is the most common type of systemic amyloidosis. However, its incidence varies in different ethnic groups.
