Direct cannulation of the SOV for endovascular treatment is appropriate for indirect CCFs. Typical signs and symptoms include pulsatile visual defects, headache, ocular and orbital pain, diplopia, conjunctival chemosis, proptosis, and orbital bruits. A common association is congestion of the inferior petrosal sinus and arterialization of the ophthalmic and orbital veins. The superior ophthalmic vein may be used for transvenous access to lesions of the cavernous sinus when other routes have been exhausted or are anatomically unavailable. Aberrant anatomy of the inferior petrosal sinus, in which it is exquisitely tortuous or in discontinuity with the proximal jugular system, may make that approach impossible. Access to the SOV via the angular vein through the facial vein is commonly employed as well, though the small caliber of the vessels and sharp angles may make this route technically challenging. In such cases, if arterial access is insufficient, direct cannulation of the SOV should be employed.
