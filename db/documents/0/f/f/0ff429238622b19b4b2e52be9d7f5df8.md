The success of the subjective refraction process depends on the collaboration of different health workers attending to the patient. A patient who has been found to have high blood sugar is not a good candidate for refraction. It is therefore indicative that the nurses are available to conduct proper vital examinations like blood pressure and blood sugar before refraction. Attending clinicians should also take note of the patient's medical and social histories before refraction, as several drugs and food items affect the accommodative system.

An interprofessional team can help achieve the best possible visual outcomes. Collaboration, shared decision-making with patients and family members for minors, and communication are critical elements for good visual outcomes. The interprofessional care provided to the patient must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach. The earlier the signs and symptoms of uncorrected hypermetropia and amblyopia, the better the prognosis and outcome. [Level 3]
