Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the axial spine. Chronic back pain and progressive spinal stiffness are the most common features of this disease. Involvement of the spine, sacroiliac joints, peripheral joints, digits, and entheses are characteristic. Impaired spinal mobility, postural abnormalities, buttock pain, hip pain, peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis are all commonly associated with ankylosing spondylitis. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of ankylosing spondylitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of ankylosing spondylitis.
- Describe the workup of a patient with ankylosing spondylitis.
- Review the management options available for ankylosing spondylitis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.
