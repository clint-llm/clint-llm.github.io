Patients require monitoring due to the potentialÂ adverse drug reactions, especially when receiving haloperidol in the intramuscular form. It can be easily monitored by taking blood levels. It has a therapeutic range of 2 to 15 ng/ml in serum. Therefore, clinicians should monitor blood levels of haloperidol at 12-hour or 24-hour intervals or after the last dose of haloperidol.
