Transfusion-transmitted HBV infection is currently prevented in most developed countries by testing for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), nucleic acid testing (NAT), and screening for antibodies against the HBV core antigen.

In Brazilian blood banks, the testing of Plasmodium falciparum relies on blood thick smears examination. A study was conducted to demonstrate that molecular biology techniques can be more efficient in detecting Malaria among blood donors. The molecular diagnostic based on mitochondrial DNA using real-time PCR (mt-qPCR) was improved to detect P. falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, and Plasmodium malariae. The analytic sensitivity of this mt-qPCR test showed to be highly efficient and effective in revealing potentially infected donors and should be applied as a screening routine of asymptomatic carriers for the prevention of transfusion-transmitted malaria in blood banks.

The frequent occurrence of inconclusive serology affecting blood banks and the lack of a standard gold test for Chagas disease led to study the efficacy of the blood culture test and other commercial tests based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect immunofluorescence and hemagglutination assay. These methods were useful in testing for anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies and predict the absence of infection with a probability of 100% when using in combination.

Several methods are being used to reduce infectivity of blood products, e.g., solvent-detergent processing of plasma and also nucleic acid cross-linking via photochemical reactions with riboflavin, methylene blue,  psoralen, and alkylating agents.
