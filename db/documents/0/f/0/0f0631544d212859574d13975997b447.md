Superficial cervical plexus block provides dense anesthesia for procedures like carotid endarterectomies, lymph node dissection, plastic surgery, laceration repairs, and incision and drainage of abscesses. It avoids the potential for under- or overdosing when using oral or parenteral analgesics. It can be done expeditiously, using minimal resources, and is safe. It can be done prior to placing an internal jugular central venous catheter to allow for pain-free line placement. An ultrasound-guided superficial cervical plexus block using a longer-acting local anesthetic like ropivacaine can provide sufficient analgesia for a clavicle fracture to the point where over the counter medications can manage the residual pain.
