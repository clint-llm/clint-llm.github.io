Felbamate therapy is best accomplished using an interprofessional healthcare team that includes clinicians, specialists, nurses, and pharmacists. The monitoring for idiosyncratic reactions from felbamate falls upon the responsibilities of neurologists and primary care clinicians. The pharmacist should thoroughly educate the patient and caregiver about medication compliance and the need for regular follow-up. Close monitoring is vital because the drug has correlations with severe adverse reactions; this requires interprofessional communication between the two specialties to ensure no issues arise. Nursing is often the first point of contact the patient has with the healthcare team. They need to be prepared to offer counsel, answer questions, and alert appropriate team members if intervention is warranted. As noted above, clinical and laboratory monitoring is essential following drug initiation, though it may be spaced out after the first 3 months of therapy. If there is a concern for aplastic anemia or hepatic dysfunction in any patients on felbamate, they should be evaluated in an emergency care setting. With an interprofessional approach, monitoring for adverse events and verifying therapeutic efficacy can result in optimal patient outcomes with felbamate. [Level 5]
