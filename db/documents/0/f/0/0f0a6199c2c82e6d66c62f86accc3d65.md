A variety of etiologies for adrenal cortical hyperplasia has been described including ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent causes, and also congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Moreover, a wide range of disorders may masquerade the signs and symptoms of adrenal cortical hyperplasia.

Cushing syndrome: Most commonly caused by abnormal corticosteroid intake. If an obvious history of glucocorticoid administration along with a variety of symptoms including visceral obesity, buffalo hump, moon face appearance, generalized abdominal and limb striae, and decreased bone mineral density exists, obtaining extra diagnostic tests would be unnecessary.

Cushing disease, or hypophysial corticotropin producing adenoma, accounts for the vast majority of Cushing syndrome causalities. Although the discrete threshold of pituitary adenoma has not been identified yet, tumor size of equal or greater than 6 millimeters is highly indicative of Cushing disease as the cause of Cushing syndrome.

Ectopic ACTH, mostly due to paraneoplastic causalities, accounts for the second-most common cause of ACTH-dependent cortical hyperplasia. The three most common types include lung, bronchial carcinoid tumor, and small cell lung cancer.

ACTH-independent hypercortisolism or adrenal originated Cushing syndrome might occur due to a couple of causalities, including primary pigmented nodular adrenal disease (PPNAD) or ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (AIMAH).
