The role of Immunoglobulin D has not been clear. However, recent research suggestsÂ Secreted Immunoglobulin D improves mucosal homeostasis and immune system vigilance by providing myeloid cells such as basophils and mast cells with IgD antibodies reactive against mucosal antigens against pathogenic microorganisms. However, additional research is needed to understand the precise function of immunoglobulin D.

In a study, distinct immunoglobulin patterns predicted the risk of developing post-acute COVID-19 syndrome(PACS). Researchers observed decreased IgM, unaltered IgG1, and decreased IgG3 in patients with PACS. In addition. Evaluation of changes in COVID-19 patients at primary infection, six-month, and one-year follow-up, indicated that these total serum Ig concentrations remained steady over time. In summary, patients with either low IgM or low IgG3 had an increased risk of acquiring PACS, whereas patients with both high IgM and high IgG3 were less likely to develop PACS.
