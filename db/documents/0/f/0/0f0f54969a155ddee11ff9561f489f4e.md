All of these potential reasons nurses choose to leave the profession add to nursing turnover, thus affecting staffing ratios. Staffing ratios are of clinical concern.

**Staffing Ratios**

Bedside nurses, actually deciding acceptable nurse-patient ratios instead of managers, will lead to better job satisfaction, higher retention rates, and less desire to leave their chosen profession. Appropriate staffing levels will decrease errors, increase patient satisfaction, and improve nurse retention rates.

Nursing shortages lead to errors, higher morbidity, and mortality rates. In hospitals with high patient-to-nurse ratios, nurses experience burnout, dissatisfaction, and the patients experienced higher mortality and failure-to-rescue rates than facilities with lower patient-to-nurse ratios. Some states have begun to pass legislation to limit patient-to-nurse ratios. Despite this, when staffing is short, ratios go up to meet the need.
