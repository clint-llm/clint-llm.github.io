Napalm is a weaponized mixture of chemicals designed to create a highly flammable and gelatinous liquid. The initial thickening agent was a combination of naphthenic and palmitic acids leading to the trade name “na-palm” but more generically known as firebomb fuel-gel mixture. Many variations of the chemicals used in napalm exist. The most common current composition includes aluminum salts, polystyrene, and benzene. Detonation then occurs by various explosive compounds that ignite phosphorous, which burns at a temperature adequate to ignite the fuel mixture.

The consistency of napalm results in its tendency to adhere to exposed surfaces, increasing its lethality and destructive capability. Additionally, the increased viscosity allows the ignited liquid to maintain a directable stream when dispersed under pressure allowing for its use in military flamethrowers.

The toxicity of napalm comes from multiple etiologies.  Burns are the most obvious harm, but the delivery of napalm may come from explosive delivery devices leading to blast-burn injuries. Burning napalm rapidly de-oxygenates the surrounding environment causing asphyxiation. Byproducts of flaming napalm include high levels of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide that can lead to toxicity.  Some types of napalm use polystyrene chemicals that convert to styrene, which is a neurotoxin and likely carcinogen.
