When it comes to the proper teaching of a new technique such as purse-lip breathing the trained individual should explain the benefits and potential adverse effects. The physiology of the technique requires explanation, followed by a demonstration. After teaching, the trainer should ensure that the trainee has learned the technique properly by asking the trainee to perform the technique or explain the technique to the trainer; this can ensure proper technique and correction of any mistakes that may occur during the learning process.

Physicians, nurses, and health care professionals can incorporate the technique to help calm the patient. Patients with COPD, congestive heart failure, or panic attack may use the technique to relieve their dyspnea. This method could help reduce the need for noninvasive mechanical ventilation.

Nurses that can recognize COPD patients in respiratory distress through signs such as increase purse-lip breathing, dyspnea, and accessory muscles use will allow rapid initiation of a response team to assist the patient before they deteriorate.
