The incidence of NEC varies amongst studies. In a systemic review done by Gorschl√ºter et al., the incidence rate from 21 studies was 5.3% in patients hospitalized for hematological malignancies, high-dose chemotherapy for solid tumors, or aplastic anemia.

NEC was first described in patients with hematological malignancies, primarily acute myeloid leukemia. Patients with hematologic malignancies are generally at higher risk for developing NEC due to their underlying malignancy but also due to their chemotherapy protocols. However, NEC also reportedly occurs in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, solid malignancy, and patients with autoimmune conditions on immune suppressive medications.A study on pediatric patients found that patients who had mucositis, chemotherapy in the previous 14 days, or a hematopoietic stem cell transplant were at a higher risk of developing NEC.
