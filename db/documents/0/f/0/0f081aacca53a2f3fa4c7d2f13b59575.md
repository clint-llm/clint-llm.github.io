If radial nerve entrapment has resulted in only mild damage to the nerve (neurapraxia), recovery should be rapid and complete in a relatively short time period ranging from 2 to 8 weeks. However, more severe injuries (axonotmesis) will recover more slowly. Recovery time depends on how far the regenerating axon must grow to reinnervate affected muscles; this healing rate is typically 1 mm/day.

Surgical recovery depends on the extent of preoperative damage. Following early release of neurapraxia, the result should be a return to normal function in 80 to 90% of cases. Even after early release, the results will be less favorable with axonotmesis than in cases of neurapraxia, with complete return of function being rare.
