Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the primary psychoactive cannabinoid extracted from the cannabis (marijuana) plant. It was historically used recreationally due to its psychoactive effects, but recently there has been significant interest in exploring its medical utility.

Synthetic THC, such as nabilone and dronabinol, are FDA approved for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Dronabinol is also FDA approved for HIV/AIDS anorexia for appetite stimulation.

Many states permit medical marijuana use, though it continues to be a Schedule 1 drug with no currently accepted medical use and at high risk for abuse by Federal standards.  Per the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2017 guidelines, there is insufficient evidence to recommend THC as monotherapy for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Although for breakthrough nausea and vomiting refractory to ondansetron, there is moderate evidence for the utility of THC if used alongside standard antiemetic therapy.

Currently, various possible off-label uses of THC are objects of active research. Randomized controlled trials have shown that synthetic THC-dronabinol improved respiratory stability in patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Randomized control trials have also shown THC to effectively improve fibromyalgia and chronic neuropathic pain, though its off-label use is still controversial and requires further research.

Even though synthetic cannabinoids dronabinol and nabilone are FDA approved for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, research has not found it an effective antiemetic for postoperative nausea and vomiting.
