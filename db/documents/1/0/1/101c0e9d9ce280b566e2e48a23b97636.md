**Pectus Excavatum**

General postoperative care as; pain control, wound/drainage-care, and possible complications vigilance are equal in both surgical techniques. Respiratory exercises with a spirometer is a paramount highlight. Some postoperative care differences exist between open and MARPE surgery. In open surgery, an early regular walk is encouraged, while in MARPE, short interval steps with gradually increasing are recommended, paying special attention that Nuss bar twisting does not occur. Patients get discharged at 3 to 5 postoperative days. Muscle weakness (thorax, limbs, abdomen) and poor posture are a constant feature in pectus deformities and correlate with enhanced deformity recurrence or causing a wrong esthetic post-surgical result perception; therefore physical rehabilitation program is mandatory.

**Pectus Carinatum**

Postoperative management is the same as pectus excavatum open surgery. Specific pectus carinatum post-surgical care highlights are; spirometer using, start lightweights lifting at three weeks, start a gym at five months, and if utilizing a metal strut, it is removable at four months.

**Jeunes Syndrome**

Devries published a follow-up protocol in which the frequency of clinical vigilance and realization of para-clinic studies depends on the patient's age.

**Poland Syndrome, Sternal Clefts,**Ectopia Cordis,**and**Jarcho-Levin syndrome****

Postoperative and rehabilitation care is determined case by case basis.
