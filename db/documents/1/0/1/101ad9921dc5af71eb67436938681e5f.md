Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside derived from the foxglove plant (digitalis species). It has inotropic effects and is utilized in the management of systolic dysfunction in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and as an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent for managing atrial tachydysrhythmias. Digoxin toxicity can present acutely after an overdose or chronically, as is often seen in patients on digoxin that develop acute kidney injury. This activity reviews the clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of digoxin toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of digoxin toxicity.
- Describe the pathophysiology of digoxin toxicity.
- Summarize the management of digoxin toxicity.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the detection and management of digoxin toxicity and improve outcomes.
