Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) within a compartment can be caused by the following:

- Hematoma: intracerebral, subarachnoid

- Hydrocephalus

- Tumor

- Abscess

- Malignant ischemia such as malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) syndrome

- Swelling: diffuse axonal injury (DAI)

- Pneumocephalus (traumatic or postoperative)

- cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) over drainage

- Metabolic: hepatic encephalopathy

- Tumefactive multiple sclerosis
