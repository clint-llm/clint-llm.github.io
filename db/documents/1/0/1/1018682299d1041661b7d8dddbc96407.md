Imaging and fluid biomarkers are the primary focus in current and future evaluations of frontotemporal dementia. Standard, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) modalities can demonstrate characteristic atrophy of frontal and temporal lobe grey matter.

Further studies are necessary to implement these techniques in diagnosing frontotemporal dementia, isolating which disease subset is present, differentiating between other dementia syndromes such as Alzheimer's, and longitudinal monitoring of disease progression.

Cerebrospinal fluid and serum protein biomarkers are presently utilized to exclude Alzheimer's disease in the assessment of frontotemporal dementia and are under appraisal for prospective diagnostic indications and monitoring pathologic progression and response to potential therapies. Elevated CSF tau proteins and decreased beta-amyloid 42 protein concentrations can accurately confirm Alzheimer's dementia and are validated for eliminating frontotemporal dementia from the differential.

Neurofilament light chain (NFL) proteins are increased in serum and CSF samples of patients with frontotemporal dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders and have promising applications in future frontotemporal dementia assays.
