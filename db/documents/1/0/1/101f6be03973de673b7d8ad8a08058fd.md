Disease processes that cause chronic hypoxia will increase pulmonary vascular resistance through hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. These include pulmonary edema, pulmonary emboli, and cardiovascular disease. Pulmonary edema causes alveoli to shrink due to increased surface tension, causing hypoxemia and shunting of blood to areas of greater ventilation. Hypoxia will induce vasoconstriction leading to pulmonary hypertension and increased vascular resistance. Peri-bronchial cuffing increases the resistance of extra-alveolar vessels while alveolar edema compresses and distorts capillaries. Recruitment and distension of pulmonary capillaries allow for a large reserve in the pulmonary circulation. Half of the pulmonary circulation can become obstructed before there is a significant detectable rise in pulmonary pressures. While the mechanism of increased PVR secondary to pulmonary embolism is still under investigation, the current thinking is that it results from serotonin release from platelets.

Cardiovascular disease may also lead to increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Left heart valvular disease, such as mitral stenosis or regurgitation, leads to elevation of pressures in the left atrium and, ultimately, the pulmonary veins. Increases in pulmonary capillary pressures over a long period lead to smooth muscle hypertrophy and fibrosis of pulmonary vasculature. These changes, in turn,Â cause pulmonary arterial hypertension and eventually cor pulmonale.
