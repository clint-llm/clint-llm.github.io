Stercoral colitis occurs when chronic constipation leads to fecal impaction, colonic distention and deformation, and the development of masses of dehydrated fecal material called fecalomas. The fecaloma becomes lodged within areas of the colon, most commonly in the rectosigmoid colon. This can lead to areas of ischemic pressure ulceration and eventually, focal ischemic necrosis and colonic perforation.

About 27% of patients develop multiple areas of focal ulceration.
