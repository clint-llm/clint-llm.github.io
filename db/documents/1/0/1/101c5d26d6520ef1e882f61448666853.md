OHS is associated with a significantly high rate of morbidity and mortality. Although treatment modalities target different aspects of the underlying pathophysiology, the goal is to normalize arterialÂ CO2 hypoxia and improve symptoms. Several therapeutic options have been tried, including positive airway pressure therapy, weight reduction surgery, and pharmacotherapy.

**Positive Airway Pressure Therapy**

Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is typically the first-line treatment for OHS.

A recent study compared the three standard treatments for OHS, including NIV, CPAP, and lifestyle modification. This study showed that both NIV and CPAP significantly improved polysomnographic parameters, although NIV was superior in improving respiratory parameters compared to other treatment modalities. In a total of 351 patients compared to baseline, at two months, the three treatments showed a reduction in PaCO2 of 5.5, 3.7, and 3.2 with NIV, CPAP, and lifestyle modification, respectively.

**Weight Reduction**

Weight loss can improve both OHS and OSA and cardiovascular comorbidities.

**Tracheostomy**

Tracheostomy relieves airway obstruction during sleep, thus improving alveolar ventilation and waking PaCO2.
