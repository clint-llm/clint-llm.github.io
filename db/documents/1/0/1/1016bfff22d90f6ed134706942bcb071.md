The absence of myelin seen on an MRI in patients with PMD correlates with the histological picture. In the connatal form, myelin is absent from most of the areas of the brain, and oligodendrocytes are either absent or present with significant cytoskeletal abnormalities. Gliosis is present around areas of demyelination, and the remaining cells of the cortex are preserved. There are no signs of myelin degradation.

In the classic form, some form of myelin degradation is present, and some myelin fibers are present as myelin islets in the perivascular area. Gliosis and astrocytosis are present.

In the case of SPG2, histology shows tigroid patches of myelin, corresponding to the discontinuous pattern of myelin seen on an MRI.
