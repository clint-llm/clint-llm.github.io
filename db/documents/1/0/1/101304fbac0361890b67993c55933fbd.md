The management of ocular pemphigoid is primarily by the eye surgeon but the follow up is with the primary care provider, dermatologist or nurse practitioner. The medical management strategy for ocular cicatricial pemphigoid is to control inflammation and halt the progression of fibrosis.Â  Treatments include topical/local therapies, systemic medications, minor procedures, and surgical intervention when necessary.

In general, of those with MMP, those with ocular involvement have a worse prognosis than those affected with skin and/or oral mucosa involvement alone. Systemic therapy can stop the progression of ocular cicatricial pemphigoid in about 90% of patients, and the rate of recurrence is about 20% to 30%, but this is variable.
