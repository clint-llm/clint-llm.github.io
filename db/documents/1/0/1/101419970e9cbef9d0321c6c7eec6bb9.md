Allergic contact dermatitis is an inflammatory disease of the skin that is caused by a type 4 hypersensitivityÂ reaction. It results from the contact of an offending chemical or antigen with the skin, and the subsequent T-cell mediated response.

Poison ivy is a common cause of ACD and presents as linear streaks where the plant comes into contact with the skin.

Nickel is another common cause of ACD and presents as dermatitis where necklaces and earrings containing nickel are worn.

Rubber gloves are also a common cause of chronic dermatitis.

Other agents include hair dyes, textile chemicals, preservatives, fragrances, sunscreens, and photo allergens.
