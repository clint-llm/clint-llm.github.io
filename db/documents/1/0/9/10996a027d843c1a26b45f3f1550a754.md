The primary vectors for CHIKV are Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus (Asian Tiger mosquito). These mosquitoes have biological characteristics that provide effective invasiveness, vector competence, and vectorial capacity that sets the tone for the global manifestation of Chikungunya fever.

Ae. aegypti has been established in the U.S. for more than 300 years while Ae. albopictus has been present since 1985 with different vector characteristics making global expansion of the disease possible. Specifically, CHIKV was found to have adapted to Ae. albopictus fairly recently during the Indian Ocean outbreak in 2005-06 when it acquired a mutation in its E1 membrane protein that allowed it to infest the urban mosquito vector.Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes is a function of their focused feeding on and association with humans along with the ability of the human host and mosquito vector to travel.
