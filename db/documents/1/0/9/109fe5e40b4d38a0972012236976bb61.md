Overall, adults' cognitive functioning with isolated mega cisterna magna is within normal limits.Â However, patients with isolated mega cisterna magna in a small case series have been found to score inferior to controls on specific parameters, including those of memory, executive functioning, and verbal fluency.

Studies on outcomes in patients with mega cisterna magna are limited and conflicting. In an older study identifying 14 cases of isolated mega cisterna magna out of 1,260 reviewed CT scans, long-standing neurologic dysfunction was reported in 57% of patients (8/14).

The high frequency in this study may be due to the use of CT imaging, which has poor posterior fossa resolution and may have missed an associated malformation resulting in misdiagnosis. In a later study, 15 fetuses reviewed sonographically were found to have isolated mega cisterna magna.

These results may also be of limited value as cognitive and behavioral disorders may be difficult to assess during childhood accurately and may become more apparent with age.
