Dermatofibromas are referred to as benign fibrous histiocytomas of the skin, superficial/cutaneous benign fibrous histiocytomas, or common fibrous histiocytoma. The term "fibrous histiocytoma" refers more to the morphologic appearance of the cell populations that comprise these lesions rather than strictly describing the cellular lineage. Often, patients who present with a dermatofibroma relate a history of possibly inciting local trauma at the site, such as from an insect bite or superficial puncture wound from thorns or wood splinters. Dermatofibromas occur in people of all ages, although more commonly during the ages of the 20s to 40s, and develop more frequently in females than males, with as high as a 2:1 female to male predominance according to some reports. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of dermatofibroma and interprofessional team members' role in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of dermatofibroma.
- Describe the evaluation of dermatofibroma.
- Summarize the treatment of dermatofibroma.
- Outline the evaluation and management of dermatofibroma and interprofessional team members' role in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.
