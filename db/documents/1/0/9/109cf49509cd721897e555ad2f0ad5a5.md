Current data do not show a clear benefit to the use of continued fetal monitoring over intermittent auscultation, thus either is acceptable for uncomplicated patients. The ACOG recommends continuous FHR monitoring for high-risk patients, such as those with known intrauterine growth restriction or preeclampsia. When using continuous FHR monitoring during labor, recommendations are that nurses and physicians review it frequently. In a patient without complications, the recommendation is that it be reviewed every 30 minutes in the first stage of labor and every 15 minutes during the second stage. In high-risk patients, the tracing requires a review every 15 minutes in the first stage and every 5 minutes in the second stage.
