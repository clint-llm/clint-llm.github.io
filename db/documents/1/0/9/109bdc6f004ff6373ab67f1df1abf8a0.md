Failure of the natural defense mechanisms like the closure of the glottis and cough reflex increases the risk of aspiration. The common risk factors for aspiration include an altered mental status, neurologic disorders, esophageal motility disorders, protracted vomiting, and gastric outlet obstruction. Although the common organisms involved in the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia are Streptococci, Haemophilus, and Gram-negative bacilli, the etiology of aspiration pneumonia depends on the content of aspirate. A prospective study of 95 patients showed that gram-negative bacilli contributed 49%, followed by anaerobes (16%). The major anaerobes isolated were Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and Peptostreptococcus. In hospital-acquired aspiration pneumonia, gram-negative organisms, specifically Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have to be considered.

Conditions that increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia include:

- Stroke

- Drug overdose

- Alcohol use disorder

- Seizures

- General anesthesia

- Head trauma

- Intracranial masses

- Dementia

- Parkinson disease

- Esophageal strictures

- Gastroesophageal reflux disease

- Pseudobulbar palsy

- Tracheostomy

- NG tube

- Bronchoscopy

- Protracted vomiting
