Gallbladder volvulus (GV)Â is an uncommon condition presenting as an acute abdomen. This condition was first reported by Wendel in 1898 as "floating gallbladder." Urgent surgical intervention is necessary. In a majority of cases, the diagnosis is made intraoperatively. This clinical problem is very rare and accounts for only 1 out of 365,000 cases with gallstone disease.
