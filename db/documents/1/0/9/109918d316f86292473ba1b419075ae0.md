Acclimatization is the best means by which to prevent HACE and all other forms of AMS.  Considerations for prevention of AMS and subsequent HACE is to have a slow rate of ascent with the altitude one sleeps at being more important than the altitude reached.  Final ascent rates of 300-500m per day are recommended for safe and preventative acclimatization.  If signs of AMS develop, stop ascent and if debilitating or severe, descend immediately.   Prophylaxis for HACE/AMS includes both Acetazolamide and Dexamethasone. Ibuprofen is recommended for those with a history of altitude illness. There is less evidence for natural remedies such as ginkgo balboa and coca leaves.  Most advocate training regimens and slow rate of ascent to optimize acclimatization.  This often requires an intense time commitment and is difficult for many to achieve, particularly for those engaged in recreational climbing. Some studies have shown benefit to sleeping in specialized tents at home that provide normobaric hypoxia before departure to higher altitudes, although this has not been validated as a primary preventative measure of AMS or HACE.
