Patients with smoke inhalation injury are at high risk for complications. The majority of fatal burn cases are caused by respiratory failure, either from direct injury or complications such as pneumonia. Severe injuries often will lead to long-term complications such as bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis obliterans, and the need for artificial airways; however, many patients will have no long-term sequelae from a single episode of smoke inhalation injury.
