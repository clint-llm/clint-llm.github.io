The mainstay of treatment of functional voice disorders is vocal rehabilitation, which is tailored according to patient presentation and prognosis. The most significant drawback to this approach is the inherent difficulty in maintaining patient compliance for regular follow-up and long-term self-directed treatment. Outcomes are improved when barriers to compliance are identified and addressed, often through the use of patient-centered questionnaires. Additionally, patient motivation can be improved with a thorough understanding of the diagnosis and etiopathogenesis of the condition, which facilitates insight into the factors that contribute to the problem.
