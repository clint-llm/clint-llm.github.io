As noted, Virchow's triad (i.e., endothelial damage, hypercoagulability, & venous or arterial blood stasis) plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of thrombosis. Damage to the vessel wall leads to the production of pro-inflammatory (and prothrombotic) cytokines, an increase in available tissue factor, the proliferation of adhesion molecules, and enhanced platelet activation. Cytokines initiate inflammation-promoting interaction between leukocytes and endothelial cells.

Thrombosis occurs throughout our arterial system, especially in those with predisposing cardiovascular risk factors. In the heart, microthrombi can develop as a result of blood stasis in the ventricles or atria due to underlying valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathies, or arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation predisposing to ischemic emboli and CVA. Arterial thrombosis (and microthrombi formation) typically initiates by theÂ accumulation of lipid plaques in the arterial wall, provoking chronic inflammatory cells and platelet activation, as can be seen with coronary artery disease.
