The Unipedicle Tram Flap is an important alternative in breast reconstruction. This procedure does not require microvascular anastomosing techniques, which allows shorter operative time and fewer complications. A transverse rectus abdominis flap also avoids the use of foreign bodies which carry their own risks of complications. There is a high degree of patient satisfaction because of the similarity to breast tissue, but not every patient is a candidate for this procedure. If the patient is a thin woman with minimal extra abdominal tissue, has multiple abdominal surgeries, plans on getting pregnant, or is concerned about the strength of her lower abdomen, then alternative procedures would be ideal.
