A varicocele is abnormal dilation and enlargement of the scrotal venous pampiniform plexus which drains blood from each testicle. While usually painless, varicoceles are clinically significant because they are the most commonly identified cause of abnormal semen analysis, low sperm count, decreased sperm motility, and abnormal sperm morphology. Varicoceles are classified as small, medium, and large. This activity examines when this condition should be considered on differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate it. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of varicoceles.
- Describe the presentation of a varicocele.
- Summarize the treatment options for varicoceles.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by varicoceles.
