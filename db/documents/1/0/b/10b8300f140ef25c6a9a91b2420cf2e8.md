Meningitis is a devastating disease that without early treatment can cause lifelong neurologic sequelae or even death. Clinical signs and symptoms to aid in the early diagnosis and initiation of therapy are extremely important to help reduce long-term complications. While Brudzinski's sign may not definitively rule out meningitis, it can increase clinical suspicion of meningitis and trigger early treatment. Given its high specificity for the disease, there is a high likelihood of meningitis if the Brudzinski's sign is present.  A positive result can aid providers who have a clinical suspicion of meningitis by allowing them to initiate antibiotics early. However, it is important to note that the absence of the sign does not rule out meningitis due to its poor sensitivity.
