The importance of compliance with medical therapy should be discussed with patients with HFrEF as these medications are proven to halt the progression of cardiomyopathy, improve ejection fraction and have mortality and morbidity benefits. Regular follow-up to ensure optimal fluid-volume status, electrolytes, and renal function is important as these medications frequently cause renal injury and hyperkalemia. Revascularization is likely to improve the patient's heart function if viability is present.
