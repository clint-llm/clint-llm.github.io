Reported anatomic variations of the foot nerves areÂ common. The superficial fibular nerve has variations of deep fascia piercings and can present in different compartments of the leg compared to its normal anatomic location in the lateral leg compartment.

Other reports have commented on the variations of the bifurcation of the tibial nerve and have shown that the tibial nerve more commonly bifurcates under the tarsal tunnel (88%) than it does proximally (12%).

Regarding the anatomic variations of the sural and saphenous nerves of the foot, reports have explained the variable cutaneous innervation patterns of the sural nerves, suggesting that the sural nerve may supply a wider area of skin than previously described.
