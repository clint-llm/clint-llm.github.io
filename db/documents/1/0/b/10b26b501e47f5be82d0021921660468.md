It is important to know the type of specimen in which the ADH is identified because the lesion's management depends on it.

If atypical ductal hyperplasia is found on core needle biopsy, additional tissue is necessary by excisional biopsy. A wire or seed localization technique should be used at the time of the core biopsy to later identify the area potentially requiring excision. The reason for re-excision is that with a more extensive tissue specimen, there is a chance the lesion will be upgraded to carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma. Studies suggest that 22 to 65% of ADH found on core needle biopsies were upgraded to carcinoma after subsequent excisional biopsy.

If, however, ADH alone is diagnosed on an excisional biopsy, no additional surgery is required, even if there are positive margins because ADH is a high-risk lesion, but it is not a pre-cancerous or cancerous lesion.
