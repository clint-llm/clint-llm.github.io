One notable contraindication to balloon sinuplasty is CRSwNP, due to the device's mechanism of action versus the pathophysiology of the diseases. In CRSwNP, numerous polyps grow into and obstruct the nasal cavity and sinus ostia. The balloon does not alter or destroy the nasal mucosa and, therefore, would be unable to remove the polyp burden by itself.

BSP is indicated and effective for use in single-cell sinuses, but would not be effective within the ethmoids because they are multicell structures.

Other contraindications include but are not limited to the following

- Headache without CRS or RARS

- Sleep apnea without RARS or CRS

- CRS or RARS patients without CT findings or an asymptomatic patient

- Allergic fungal sinusitis

- Cystic fibrosis

- Malignancy

- Patient refusal

- Prior skull-based dehiscence
