**Cardiovascular Complications**

- Hypertension is seen in about 40% of patients with acromegaly and is usually mild. Anti-hypertensive treatment is similar to non-acromegalic patients. Good control of blood pressure is very important irrespective of the modality used for acromegalic treatment.

- Cardiomyopathy is seen in most patients with acromegaly. An echocardiogram and electrocardiogram (ECG) should be done at baseline and repeated yearly. Treatment of acromegaly improves cardiomyopathy; however, this depends on the patient's age, disease duration, and hypertension.

**Obstructive Sleep ApneaÂ (OSA)**

The prevalence of sleep apnea is 70% of all patients with acromegaly. Prognathism, enlarged tongue, and soft tissue accumulation in the upper airways predispose to OSA. Clinical assessment (Epworth score) and, if needed, polysomnography should be done at baseline and repeated every year. Surgical correction of prognathism may help, and referral to the maxillofacial surgeon should be considered.

**Arthropathy**

Around 75% of patients with acromegaly are affected by arthropathy. Both small and large joints are affected. Bony expansion and soft tissue swelling can lead to nerve entrapment. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment of acromegaly are essential to prevent arthropathy, as these changes are irreversible.

**Colon Polyps**

Colon length is increased in acromegaly, and so are the mucosal folds. There is an increased prevalence of colonic polyps; however, the risk of colon cancer may or may not be increased. Patients should get a colonoscopy at baseline and every five years.

The incidence of both benign and malignant tumors in patients with acromegaly has increased lately, like kidney and ureteral cancers, but not the mortality from cancers.

**Hypopituitarism**can occur as a result of surgery or radiation. An annual assessment of pituitary hormones is recommended, and replacement hormones are needed.

**Vertebral fractures**have been reported more frequently in patients with acromegaly. In a recent study, there seems to be a correlation between a hypogonadal state and bone loss in this population.
