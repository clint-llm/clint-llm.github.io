The collecting ducts of the inner medullary and papillary portions of the kidney are directly involved in this disorder. On gross pathology, the cysts generallyÂ measure less than 1 centimeter and are within the renal pyramids.

On histology, there are dilated papillary collecting ducts. These dilated papillary collecting ducts are lined with flattened or cuboidal epithelium. Within the cyst, there may be inflammation and/or calculi.

The cortex of the kidney is normal and unaffected.
