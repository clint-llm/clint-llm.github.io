Heart failure (HF) often results from poor left ventricular function. Reduced diastolic filling and ejection fraction can both lead to less blood leaving the heart into systemic circulation. Â HF correlates with structural changes in the ventricular wall such as ventricular dilation and mural thinning. Alterations in various components of the myocardium precede these ventricular changes such as focal myocyte loss and fibrotic replacement, as well as hypertrophic myocyte activity leading to a thicker ventricular wall. These myocardial changes lead to a decrease in the ability of the individual myocytes to contract with sufficient speed and force to maintain cardiac output necessary to meet bodily needs.
