Prognosis depends on the age of the patient, histologic grade, and status of surgical resection. Older patients, higher-grade lesions, and those who have incomplete surgical resection have a worse prognosis. The five-year survival for stages 1 to 3 is 93% compared to 28% for stage 4. Despite advances in genetic screening for the RET proto-oncogene, preliminary population studies have yet to show a definitive impact on disease prognosis.
