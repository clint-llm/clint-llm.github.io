**Renal Failure Etiopathogenesis**

**Acute Renal Failure**

- Prerenal (approximately 60%): Hypotension, volume contraction (e.g., sepsis, hemorrhage), severe organ failure such as heart failure or liver failure, drugs like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), and cyclosporine

- Intrarenal (approximately 35%): Acute tubule necrosis (from prolonged prerenal failure, radiographic contrast material, drugs like aminoglycosides, or nephrotoxic substances), acute interstitial nephritis (drug-induced), connective tissue disorders (vasculitis), arteriolar insults, fat emboli, intrarenal deposition (seen in tumor-lysis syndrome, increased uric acid production and multiple myeloma-Bence-Jones proteins), rhabdomyolysis

- Postrenal (approximately 5%): Extrinsic compression (prostatic hypertrophy, carcinoma), intrinsic obstruction (calculus, tumor, clot, stricture), decreased function (neurogenic bladder)

**Chronic Renal FailureÂ 
**

- Diabetes mellitus, especially type 2 diabetes mellitus, is the most frequent cause of ESRD.

- Hypertension is the second most frequent cause.

- Glomerulonephritis

- Polycystic kidney diseases

- Renal vascular diseases

- Other known causes, like prolonged obstruction of the urinary tract, nephrolithiasis

- Vesicoureteral reflux, a condition in which urine to back up into the kidneys

- Recurrent kidney infections/ pyelonephritis

- Unknown etiology
