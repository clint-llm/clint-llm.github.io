Iron deficiency is a preventable condition. Screening can identify iron deficiency at an early stage and improve outcomes. It is reasonable to perform annual screening with CBC and iron studies in populations at high risk e.g., women with menorrhagia, low iron intake, or a history of iron deficiency. In general, women in the reproductive age group can be screened every five years with hemoglobin or hematocrit. It may be reasonable to screen men and postmenopausal women once or more frequently if any risk factors are present.
