The worldwide incidence of ocular burns is largely unknown. Despite best efforts using available data, there is a knowledge gap regarding the worldwide incidence of ocular burns. The World Health Organizationâ€™s Blindness Data Bank describes the incidence of penetrating eye injuries and eye injuries leading to blindness but unfortunately does not include any data for ocular chemical burns.

Ocular chemical burns cause between 11.5 and 22.1% of eye injuries.

According to one database, alkali injuries (53.6%) were seen more commonly than acid injuries (46.4%).
