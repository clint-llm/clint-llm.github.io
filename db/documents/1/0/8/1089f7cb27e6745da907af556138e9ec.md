Ensuring a quality and biologically safe work environment fosters good and effective delivery of laboratory and clinical services for patients. While performing complex laboratory procedures, staff can work with a certain level of confidence that they won’t contract any infection or disease. The spread of infectious agents from facilities to other healthcare workers, patients, and the community is preventable by applying biosafety practices.
