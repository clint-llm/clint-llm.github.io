The importance of autonomic dysfunction secondary to other diseases is related to the prognosis of the primary disease process, the severity of orthostatic symptoms, and its response to treatment. The primary forms of autonomic dysfunction, both peripheral and central, have a generally poor prognosis, especially those associated with parkinsonian symptoms or movement disorders. The mean age of onset of these primary syndromes is in the 6th decade, and survival five years after the neurologic symptoms is less than 50%.
