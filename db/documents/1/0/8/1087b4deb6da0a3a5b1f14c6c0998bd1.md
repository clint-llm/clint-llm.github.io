A detailed physical examination of newborns is very important for the diagnosis of congenital unilateral lower lip palsy. An interprofessional team approach should be used for the evaluation and management of patients with CULLP. In selected cases, clinicians can use electrodiagnostic testing or ultrasonography to differentiate CULLP from facial nerve paralysis. Clinicians should be aware that some cases of CULLP can be associated with additional various congenital anomalies. A thorough evaluation should be started after the diagnosis. Early and accurate diagnosis provides early detection of other congenital anomalies as well as adequate parental education regarding the prognosis and possible treatment options.
