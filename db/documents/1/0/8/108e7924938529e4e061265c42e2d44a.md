Serum calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone levels should be checked together as well as 25OH Vitamin D levels. The presence of hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, normal 25 hydroxyvitamin D, and elevated parathyroid hormone levels suggest pseudohypoparathyroidism. A synthetic PTH challenge test can be performed (Ellsworth-Howard test) but is not necessary for diagnosis.

An electrocardiogram is likely appropriate if significant hypocalcemia is present to assess for prolonged QT interval and risk for arrhythmia. PHP1 patients should have biochemical testing completed annually, including PTH, calcium, phosphate, TSH, and urine calcium.

Monitoring of appropriate height and growth is important, and testing for growth hormone deficiency should take place even if the height is normal.

X-rays of the upper and lower extremities are recommended during the initial evaluation to screen for brachydactyly or other bone malformations.

In patients with PHP with AHO, genetic testing is essential. Genetic testing and counseling provide information regarding likely disease manifestations and future complications. Additionally, genetic testing can help determine family inheritance patterns and provide insight into the possibility of affected offspring.
