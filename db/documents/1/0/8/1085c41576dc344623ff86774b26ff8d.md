The primary differential diagnosis is nodular BCC. Tumor cells have elongated nuclei and show prominent palisading along the tumor nodules' periphery, which often extends into the dermis. Major cleft retraction, cytologic atypia, significant mitotic activity, tumor necrosis, or myxoinflammatory stroma may be present. TE/TB often lacks these features. However, similar to TE/TB, BCC tends to arise in sun-exposed skin areas (i.e., face, neck, head).

In challenging cases, cytokeratin 20 (CK20) can distinguish TE/TB from BCC, as this marker routinely stains Merkel cells in benign, hair-germ tumors. This stain may be used alongside androgen receptor (AR) staining when evaluating TE/TB versus BCC, as AR positivity (with CK20 negativity) suggests the latter. However, AR positivity may be focal or completely absent in some cases of BCC.

DTE may histologically appear similar to the morpheaphorm subtype of BCC (MBCC), other adnexal tumors (e.g., syringoma, microcystic adnexal carcinoma - MAC), and cutaneous metastatic breast cancer. IHC staining may sometimes help inÂ tumor differentiation; however, correlation with clinical and histologic features remains essential. As opposed to these other entities, DTE routinely expresses CK20-positive Merkel cells.

Although multiple histologic variants of TB exist according to the updated 2018 WHO classification guidelines, CD34 (stromal), BCL-2, CK20, and PHLDA1 positivity may all be used to help distinguish TB from BCC.

Fibroepithelioma of Pinkus (FeP) is an uncommon BCC variant that may resemble TE/TB. Histology of FeP often shows fenestrated strands of basaloid epithelial tumor cells with significant dermal fibrosis. Peripheral palisading of fenestrations tends to be apparent, and stromal clefting with tumor cell retraction is common. FeP often stains positive for CK20 (85% of cases), AR (77% of cases), and BCL-2.

Another entity closely resembling BCC and TE/TB clinically is basaloid follicular hamartoma (BFH), a rare benign adnexal tumor. Like BCC, BFH arises due to a mutation in PTCH, located on chromosome 9q23. This gene encodes a receptor for the sonic hedgehog pathway, and mutations lead to abnormal tumor cell growth and development. However, BFH classically centers around hair follicles and remains limited to the superficial dermis. Branching cords of basaloid cells can be seen connecting to pilosebaceous units in early disease, and tumor cells may completely replace them in cases of longstanding disease.
