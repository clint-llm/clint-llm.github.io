Specular microscopy relies on a smooth, transparent cornea to generate specular reflection; therefore, it is less useful for diseased corneas with significant edema, as in FED.

Confocal microscopy provides a superior view of the corneal endothelium compared to specular microscopy. Although it is more useful for evaluation of FED, confocal microscopy not all clinics perform it.

Light microscopy will show intracellular epithelial edema, bullous separation, stromal thickening, endothelial loss, and Descemet membrane thickening with posterior nodules, a common finding. Patients with FED only are not expected to have inflammatory cell infiltrates. Electron microscopy will show degenerating keratocytes in the corneal stroma and lipid keratopathy in the majority of cases. Degenerating keratocytes will show vacuolization, dissolution of cytoplasm, loss of intracellular organelles, and nuclear chromatin clumping. The endothelium is attenuated, particularly over the posterior nodules.

Non-guttate forms of Fuchs dystrophy will show many of the same corneal changes as the guttate forms, including endothelial cell pleomorphism and polymegethism, as well as reduced endothelial cell density. However, guttata will be absent. Often, specular microscopy (or confocal microscopy) will be the only way to determine whether a patient has a non-guttate form of FED.
