The investigation should start with the measurement of serum transferrin saturation or serum ferritin concentration.HFE mutation is prevalent, further genetic testing for the mutations C282Y and H63D should be obtained.

Radiography can be utilized in diagnosing organ involvement, such as echocardiography to preclude cardiomyopathy. A chest radiograph may indicate cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings. MRI of the liver is a non-invasive way to measure liver iron content.

Liver biopsy is the test that is most sensitive and specific for measuring liver iron content and can also assess liver damage. On histopathological analysis with Perls Prussian blue staining, there is a classic pattern in which iron deposits primarily in hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells, with slight involvement of Kupffer cells. A liver biopsy is indicated in the following situations:

- Elevated liver enzymes in a diagnosed case of hemochromatosis

- Serum ferritin levels more than 1000 mcg/L

Liver enzymes are usually elevated, with most patients having elevated aminotransferase levels, but the liver enzymes are usually not higher than twice the normal levels.

Fasting blood glucose levels need to be checked for diabetes. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels might not be reliable in patients with high red cell turnover.

First-degree relatives of patients with hemochromatosis should undergo screening with genetic testing.
