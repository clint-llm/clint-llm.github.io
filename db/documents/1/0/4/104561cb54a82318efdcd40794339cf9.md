Although rare, reports of fatalities because of M. pneumoniae infection exist. Up to about 25% of individuals who develop respiratory infections from M. pneumoniae experience extrapulmonary complications.

Dermatological complications (Steven-Johnson syndrome, ulcerative stomatitis, bullous exanthems, and erythema multiforme) occur in up to 25% of patients.

Synovial fluid involvement causes septic arthritis, arthralgias, osteomyelitis, and poly arthropathies. Approximately 14% of patients infected with M. pneumoniae are affected.

Cardiac complications (pericarditis, cardiac tamponade, myocarditis, myopericarditis, and endocarditis) are rare but documented in 1 to 8.5% of patients with serological evidence of infection.

Hemolytic anemia is a complication seen in children infected by Mycoplasma pneumoniae more often than in adults.  Cross-reacting cold agglutinins are believed to be the responsible mechanism. There are also reports of thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura and disseminated intravascular coagulation. If one considers subclinical forms of these hematological disorders, they may affect 50% of patients.

Other complications of M. pneumoniae infection involve the GI tract (nausea, vomiting, hepatitis, pancreatitis), the kidneys (acute glomerulonephritis, renal failure), ears (otitis externa, otitis media, myringitis), and eyes (conjunctivitis, iritis, optic disk swelling, retinitis).

Ureaplasma and M. genitalium have links to pregnancy complications and neonatal risk. Recent studies correlate Ureaplasma parvum infection with an increased risk for preterm birth, low weight infants, and bronchopulmonary disease in preterm neonates.  M. hominis correlates with mid-trimester abortions and early miscarriages. As a cause for sexually transmitted infections, M. genitalium correlates with pelvic inflammatory disease and chorioamnionitis.
