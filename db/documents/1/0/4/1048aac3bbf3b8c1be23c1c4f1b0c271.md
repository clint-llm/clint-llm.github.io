The importance of the appropriate perioperative cardiac management in non-cardiac surgery lies in the high number of surgical procedures performed each year and the related cardiac complications, which account for almost half of the perioperative morbidity. The risk of complications in non-cardiac surgery depends on (1) the type, urgency, and duration of the surgery and (2) the patient risk factors, including the perioperative condition and comorbidities. This activity addresses the advantages of perioperative cardiac management as a process of risk stratification by the interprofessional team and mitigation, and not "cardiac clearance" as is often requested by providers.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk of complications in non-cardiac surgery related to the type of surgery and the patient's risk factors, including the perioperative condition and comorbidities. 
- Summarize the perioperative management of frequently used drugs in patients with cardiovascular disease.
- Review indications for cardiac surgery and endovascular procedures to reduce the risk of patients with heart disease who will undergo non-cardiac surgery.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients who will undergo non-cardiac surgery.
