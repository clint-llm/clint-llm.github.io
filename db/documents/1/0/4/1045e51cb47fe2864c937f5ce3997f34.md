Clinical presentation of medication overuse headache varies between patients and even changes with time in the same patient. There can be an increase in the frequency of a pre-existing headache or the evolution into a new type of headache. There are no specific tests to diagnose this condition, and thus it is headache quantity and frequency, and type and frequency of acute medication used that leads to the diagnosis.

- The headaches are usually episodic

- Frequent acute medication consumption depends on the type of abortive medication used (see Etiology section for more detail)

- Neck pain is common (often mistaken for a cervicogenic headache, which in turn tends to be resistant to cervicalgia-appropriate treatments)

- Typically occurs in the morning (presumed related to withdrawal occurring during sleep)

- Poor sleep

- Autonomic symptoms (i.e., nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, gastrointestinal [GI] disturbance) are more frequent with overused opioids

- Comorbid anxiety and depression

- All headache treatments are generally less effective when medication overuse headache is present; efficacy improves after the weaning.
