Some causes and examples of SCID

- T-B-NK- SCID can be seen in reticular dysgenesis caused by a lack of stem cells. A similar phenotype (T-B-NK-) occurs in adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, and defective ADA genes cause it leads to toxic metabolites in T, B, and NK cells.

- T-B-NK+ SCID (RAG1/2 defect) can cause SCID due to RAG1/2 enzymes to snip DNA for VDJ rearrangement for TCR and BCR. A similar phenotype is Artemis deficiency characterized by a failure to repair DNA after RAG1/2 snips.

- T-B+NK- SCID can be X linked and due to absent IL receptor for a range of cytokines due to lack of common gamma chain. A similar phenotype named Jak 3 kinase deficiency is caused by a lack of Jak 3 kinase to follow signal via IL-R binding.

- T-B+NK+ SCID is the phenotype of IL-7 deficiency when there are no IL-7 alpha chains that lead to the failure of T cell differentiation. A similar phenotype is present in CD3 activation failure, characterized by defective signal transduction, e.g., ZAP-70 deficiency.

- T+B+NK+ MHC failure is a phenotype that has two conditions: MHC class I deficiency (bare lymphocyte syndrome) and MHC class II deficiency. The first condition is caused by failure to express MHC class I caused by a defect in TAP-2 transcription. The second condition is due to a defect in transcription of MHC class II proteins.
