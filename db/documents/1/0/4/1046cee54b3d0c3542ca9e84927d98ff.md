Management is through medical and surgical treatment. Medical treatment includes supportive therapy plus antimicrobials. Supportive measures are mainly bowel rest with nasogastric suction, intravenous fluids, and parenteral nutrition if indicated. Replacement of platelets should start if severe thrombocytopenia is present or if bleeding occurs. Any coagulopathy should be corrected.There are no trials to date to evaluate different treatment regimens. The guidance for antimicrobial therapy should be according to the patient's antimicrobial exposure, bacteremia, and local resistance pattern. The patient should receive a broad-spectrum antimicrobial that covers for gram-negative and anaerobic microorganisms as they are the most common organisms causing NEC. Monotherapy with piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenem, or anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin such as cefepime with metronidazole can start empirically.

The persistence of gastrointestinal bleeding despite correction of coagulopathies, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia can cause:

- Free air in the intraperitoneal cavity indicative of bowel perforation;

- Clinical deterioration despite optimal medical management;

- The development of other indications for surgery, such as appendicitis

Surgical treatment, in general, has typically been avoided due to concerns about bleeding, increased risk of infection, and poor healing. However, a metaanalysis done showed that surgical treatment did not cause excess risk compared to conservative treatment.
