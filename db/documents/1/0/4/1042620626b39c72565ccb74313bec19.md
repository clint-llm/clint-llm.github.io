The majority of sternal fractures result from blunt trauma. The most common location of the fracture is in the sternal manubrium or body. In many cases, there is an underlying organ injury. Heart and lung contusion, as well as rib fractures, are not uncommon with sternal fractures. The pain can be moderate to severe and limit deep inspiration, leading to atelectasis. Myocardial injury can lead to pericardial effusions resulting in tamponade.
