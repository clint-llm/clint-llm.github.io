Patients with esophageal candidiasis can have a multitude of complaints; however, patients are often asymptomatic. The most common symptoms associated with esophageal candidiasis are dysphagia, odynophagia, and retrosternal chest pain. Odynophagia is considered to be the hallmark of esophageal candidiasis. Other symptoms include abdominal pain, heartburn, weight loss, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, melena.

The only finding may be an associated infection of the oropharynx with candida.
