ACS can develop in all ICU patients. In an identified series of mixed ICU populations, 35% of ventilated patients were found to have intraabdominal hypertension (IAH) or ACS.  Risk factors include a plethora of medical conditions but may be classified based on abdominal wall mechanics.  Risk factors include those that reduce abdominal compliance, increase intra-abdominal contents, increase luminal contents or third space expansion, and cause a capillary leak.
