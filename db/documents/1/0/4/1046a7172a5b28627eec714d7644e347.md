Preoperative patient selection and proper surgical planning are a must for achieving the best outcomes after surgery. A chest radiograph and a contrast-enhanced computed tomogram (CECT) must be done before the surgery to confirm the thickness of the pleural peel, lung trapping, condition of the lung parenchyma, shift of the mediastinal structures, etc. In some centers, a bronchoscopy is also performed before surgery. It is important to perform all the routine blood workup before the surgery. It must also be kept in mind that stripping off the rind from the pleural surface and the chest wall may result in considerable bleeding. Therefore, adequate supplies of blood and blood products must be ensured.

**Pre-procedure Positioning**

The patient is placed in the lateral decubitus position with the diseased side up. A folded towel or a roll is placed below the dependent side. The down leg is flexed to 90 degrees and a pillow is placed between the legs. All the pressure points are cushioned. An esophageal dilator/bougie or a wide-bore nasogastric tube may be inserted to identify the esophagus during left-sided decortication. This might prevent an injury to the esophagus during decortication. The chest wall is painted with a skin-prep solution and draped.
