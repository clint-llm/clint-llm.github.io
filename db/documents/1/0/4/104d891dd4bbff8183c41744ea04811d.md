Tarsal tunnel syndrome, also called posterior tibial nerve neuralgia or tibial nerve dysfunction refers to an entrapment neuropathy of the posterior tibial nerve within the structures of the tarsal tunnel which is located inferior and posterior to the medial malleolus. The contents of the tarsal tunnel are the tendons of the posterior tibialis, flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus muscles along with the posterior tibial artery, vein, and nerve (L4-S3). The etiology of this syndrome subdivides into either extrinsic causes including post-surgical scarring, valgus or varus hind-foot, diabetes, lower extremity edema, poorly fitting shoes, trauma, or intrinsic causes. The clinical manifestations occur due to compression of the posterior tibial nerve or its distal branches (the lateral or medial plantar nerve), and the diagnosis is clinical. Pain is typically noted directly over the tarsal tunnel and radiates to the plantar footâ€™s arch. It is not uncommon for pain to present as shooting or sharp with accompanying plantar numbness and/or paresthesia along the course of the posterior tibial nerve or pain with eversion or dorsiflexion. Management is variable depending on etiology and can be operative or nonoperative.

A posterior tibial nerve block is completed using the posterior tibial artery as a landmark. The needle passes toward the posterior tibial artery behind the medial malleolus, adjacent to the Achilles tendon.
