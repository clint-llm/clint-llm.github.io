The most effective treatment, for now, for this condition is the long-term, sometimes continuous, use of antibiotics (penicillinase-resistant penicillins, cephalosporins, antifungal agents, and others) by adapting the treatment to the infections occurring in these patients and sometimes using surgical procedures during abscess development.

Interferon-gamma has shown no clinical benefit in this condition. Thanks to the antibiotics, and if the diagnosis is made early, patient survival can be increased. The management of non-immunological manifestations must be interprofessional. It aims to treat complications. Thus, scoliosis, depending on its severity, as well as bone fractures and degenerative joints diseases may require orthopedic surgery. Dental abnormalities require adequate stomatological treatment. Cardiovascular complications are managed in a specialized environment.

Bone-marrow transplantation has been associated with mixed results in these patients.
