The immune system protects the body against many diseases including recurrent infections, allergy, tumor, and autoimmunity. The consequences of an altered immunity will manifest in the development of many immunological disorders some of which are listed below:

- X- linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton disease)

- Selective IgG deficiency

- Congenital thymic aplasia (DiGeorge Syndrome)

- Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis

- Hyper-IgM syndrome
