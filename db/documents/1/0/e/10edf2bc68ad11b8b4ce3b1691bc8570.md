The most aspect of management in a patient with an elevated blood lead concentration is identifying the source of lead and removing it from the patient’s environment. Many county and state health departments employ individuals who can assess the home environments of children found to have elevated blood lead concentrations and assist in identifying the likely source. Patients with ingested foreign bodies should be monitored for the passage of the foreign body and should receive laxatives or cathartics if required to assist the object in passing, and those who have had massive ingestions may warrant whole bowel irrigation. Surgery should be a consideration for those with retained lead bullets. Additionally, optimizing the patient’s nutritional status is paramount, with particular attention to ensuring adequate iron, calcium, and zinc intake. Those who are found to have decreased iron stores should also begin iron therapy to replete their stores.

Children with a blood lead concentration higher than 45mcg/dL, adults with a blood lead concentration of over 70 to 100 mcg/dL, or any patient with lead encephalopathy (which is usually accompanied by a markedly elevated blood lead concentration) should undergo chelation therapy under the direction of a medical toxicologist.
