Due to the varying etiological causes for VPD, a thorough evaluation must be first be performed. Patients with hypernasal speech secondary to faulty learning, phonologic disorder, or language impairment without anatomic or neurological deficits should be treated with speech therapy.

Instrumentation can assist in surgical planning by determining the location of the VP closure, size of VP gap, mobility of VP structures, and pattern of VP closure (coronal, sagittal, or circular) as well as an underlying occult cleft palate.

VPD secondary to anatomic abnormality is most commonly caused by a cleft palate. Delayed primary cleft palate repair after 18 months is associated with a higher incidence of speech impairment and VPD.
