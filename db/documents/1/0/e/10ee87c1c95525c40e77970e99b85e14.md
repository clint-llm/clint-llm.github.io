The cervical spine is a dynamic structure tasked with protecting nervous innervation to the entire body while also maintaining a range of motion for the head and neck. Fractures of the cervical spine are a leading cause of mobility and mortality in trauma patients, and a bone fracture is associated with 56% of cervical spinal cord injuries. Fractures of the cervical spine can be described based on the level involved and typically divided into three groups: C1, C2 and the sub-axial spine (C3 to C7).
