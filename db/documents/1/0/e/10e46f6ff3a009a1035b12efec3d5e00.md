In addition to the biomarkers released secondary to the neuronal injury (proteins that leak from astrocytes and neurons when are damaged), researchers have studied the role of cJun N-terminal kinase (JNK) that mediates neuronal death in response to stress and injury in the CNS and peripheral nervous system. Some of the other variables in settings of TBI include interleukin-1beta concentration, aspartate, glutamate in the CSF, and microdialysate lactate, glucose, pyruvate, and glycerol, along with brain tissue partial oxygen pressure and intracranial pressure. Most of these were measured while studying different modalities of therapy like hyperbaric oxygen treatment and hypothermia in TBI.
