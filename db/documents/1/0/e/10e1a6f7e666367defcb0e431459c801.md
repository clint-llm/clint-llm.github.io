The organ systems involved in biliary tract physiology are the hepatobiliary, gastrointestinal, and hematologic systems. The breakdown of the hemoglobin stored in the red blood cells occurs in the reticuloendothelial system to form unconjugated bilirubin, which is then transported in the blood attached to albumin. Once this bilirubin enters hepatocytes, it undergoes conjugation via the enzyme UDP glucuronyl transferase and is subsequently secreted in the bile. The bile then passes through the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts to the gallbladder for storage. The bile is secreted into the duodenum and regulated by various hormones. In the intestines, the conjugated bilirubin is converted into urobilinogen, urobilin, and stercobilin. Due to the enterohepatic circulation, most bile salts are then reabsorbed back into the liver.

Two venous plexuses are responsible for draining the biliary tract; the epicholedochal and the paracholedochal venous plexus. The epicholedochal venous plexus is found on the wall of the bile ducts and empties into the paracholedochal venous plexus (PVP). The PVP is connected to the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal vein, gastrocolic trunk, right gastric vein, superior mesenteric vein inferiorly, and intrahepatic portal vein branches superiorly.
