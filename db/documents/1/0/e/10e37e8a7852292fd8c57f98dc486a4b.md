Pacinian and Meissner corpuscles are located in the deep dermis and detect distortion of skin from external stimuli and transmit it to the central neurite. Stretch gated ion channels open and conduct a neural response; this is the underlying mechanism of vibration perception. Trigeminal nerve transmits the vibrotactile signals from the facial area, and the dorsal columnâ€“medial lemniscus (DCML) pathway carries vibratory signals from the rest of the body. The signals get relayed via the thalamus to the primary somatosensory area of the postcentral gyrus.
