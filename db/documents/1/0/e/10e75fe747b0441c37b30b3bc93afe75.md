Although most patients present in their 30s or 40s, the overall prognosis for CCSST is generally regarded as poor. Some patients may appear disease-free after treatment for some time and posteriorly develop local recurrence or late metastatic disease with a rapidly fatal progression. Patients should be educated about the overall poor prognosis of CCSST, individual risk factors for local or metastatic recurrence, and be provided with tumor staging before and after treatment. They should also be encouraged to follow up closely with their healthcare providers.
