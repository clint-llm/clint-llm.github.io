Lafora disease is a neurodegenerative disease with autosomal recessive inheritance. Heterozygotes are asymptomatic. EPM2A on chromosome 6q24.3 and EPM2B (NHLRC1) on chromosome 6p22.3 are the two known culprit genes leading to deficiencies in Laforin and Malin respectively. They seem to contribute almost equally to the pathogenic variants. The most pathogenic variants include the following loss of function mutations: splice site, missense, nonsense and small intragenic deletions, and insertions.

PRMD8 is a recently discovered gene associated with Lafora disease that codes for a protein responsible for Laforin and Malin translocation to the nucleus and the mutated form cause Laforin and Malin deficiency within the cytoplasm.

The PRMD8 gene mutation is associated with early onset Lafora disease.
