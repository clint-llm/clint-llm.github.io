Bacopa monnieri has a high therapeutic index and is generally well-tolerated. The most common side effects are gastrointestinal, including increased stool frequency, nausea, and abdominal cramps. These are believed to be secondary to an upregulation of acetylcholine activity and/or a saponin-mediated gastrointestinal tract irritation.Bacopa extract could also decrease fertility in animals. Libido is unaltered; however, there was a decrease in sperm count, motility, and viability when a dose of 250 mg/kg/day was administered for 28 and 56 days.Bacopa is mildly sedating, which may contribute to its anxiolytic activity.
