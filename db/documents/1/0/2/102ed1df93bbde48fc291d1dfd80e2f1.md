The leaves of the coca plant Erythroxylon coca have been used as a stimulant in South America for over 4000 years. Cocaine was first isolated from the leaves in the mid-1800s. It was considered safe and used in toothache drops, nausea pills, energy tonics, and, of course, the original “Coca-Cola” beverage. Since 1961 the International Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs has made recreational use of cocaine a crime internationally. The resurgence of cocaine’s popularity occurred in the 1970s during the disco era and then in the 1980s with the advent of crack cocaine. Cocaine is listed as a DEA schedule II controlled substance because it has a medical use (see StatPearls chapter “Cocaine”), but it also has a high potential for abuse.
