GCTs are staged based on findings at surgical exploration and follow the FIGO (Federation International of Gynecology and Obstetrics) system for staging ovarian malignancies, which was last revised in 2014.

Stage I: Tumor is confined to the ovaries

- IA - limited to one ovary.

- IB - involves both ovaries.

- IC - IA or IB with intraoperative surgical spill or tumor on the external surface of ovaries / capsular rupture of the ovary or malignant cells in ascites/peritoneal washings.

Stage II: Tumor involves one or both ovaries, with pelvic extension.

Stage III: Tumor involves one or both ovaries, with peritoneal implants outside of the pelvis and/or positive retroperitoneal lymph nodes.

Stage IV: Distant metastasis
