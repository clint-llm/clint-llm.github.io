Monitor for improvement in the clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure. The PARADIGM-HF trial showed an improvement in subjective symptoms reported by patients as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and a reduction in hospitalizations and mortality.

Monitor volume status, weight, chemotherapy drugs, sodium intake, and the ability to perform activities of daily living.

Transthoracic echocardiogram to assess ejection fraction(EF) and potentially identify theÂ etiology of heart failure. (systolic/diastolic dysfunction or valvular dysfunction).

Because sacubitril/valsartan therapy affects several biomarkers and specifically inhibits the breakdown of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), BNP will be elevated in patients taking this drug. Therefore, BNP will not be a reliable marker of heart failure exacerbations in these patients. In addition, NT-pro-BNP is not a substrate for neprilysin and is therefore not affected by sacubitril. Therefore, NT-pro-BNP should be utilized in patients on sacubitril/valsartan when a heart failure exacerbation is suspected.

Regarding safety, renal function and serum potassium should be monitored, especially at the initiation of therapy and in patients with risk factors that would predispose them to renal impairment and hyperkalemia.
