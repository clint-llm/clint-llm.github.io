Understanding basic aspects of study bias and related concepts will aid clinicians in practicing and improving evidence-based medicine. Study bias can be a major factor that detracts from the external validity of a study or the generalizability of findings to other populations or settings.

The replicability of a study with similar findings is a strong factor in determining its external validity and generalizability to the clinical setting. Whenever possible, clinicians should arm themselves with the knowledge from multiple studies or systematic reviews on a topic, as opposed to using a single study.

With a critical, investigational point of view, a willingness to evaluate contrary sources, and the use of systematic reviews, clinicians can better identify sources of bias. In doing so, they can better reduce its impact in their decision-making process and thereby implement a strong form of evidence-based medicine.
