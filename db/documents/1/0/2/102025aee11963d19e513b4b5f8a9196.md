The study by De Ferranti et al. has estimated that familial hypercholesterolemia occurs in about 1 in 250 individuals older than 20-year-old in the United States. The most common age prevalence was from 60 to 69 years old, while the least common age prevalence was 20 to 29 years old. Also, familial hypercholesterolemia had a similar prevalence between men and women but was more common in the obese or black race.

**Race**

Finnish, Afrikaner, Lebanese, Ashkenazi Jewish, or French Canadian origins have a higher prevalence of FH.

**Sex**

The inheritance pattern is the same for males and females because the gene for FH is on chromosome 19.

**Age**

A defective LDL receptor is present at birth, but the longer patients live with extremely elevated LDLc levels, the higher their risk of CAD.
