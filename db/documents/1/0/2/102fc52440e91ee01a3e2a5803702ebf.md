The most important disease states to evaluate in the setting of pleuritic pain are acute coronary syndromes, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, pericardial effusion/tamponade, and pulmonary embolism.Â Once these have been evaluated with imaging and serum chemistry, other considerations would be pleural effusions, pericarditis, pulmonary infectious processes, or intrathoracic malignancies.
