Developing programs consistent with the guideline to help individuals achieve physical activity goals is essential to the interprofessional team of health care providers. Programs do not need to provide all of the recommended activity goals for the individual. However, programs considered consistent with the national guidelines meet the following criteria:

- They provide patient education consistent with theÂ national physical activity guidelines.

- They add episodes of activity that can count toward meeting the key guidelines.

- They include stretching or warming up and cooling down to help patients perform the physical activity safely and effectively.
