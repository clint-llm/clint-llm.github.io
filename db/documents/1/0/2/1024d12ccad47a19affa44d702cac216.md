Another mode of molecular analysis that takes a closer look at the capillary structure is known as transmission electron micrography (TEM). This functions by staining a particular tissue and passing a short wavelength electronic beam through the sample, which becomes absorbed and produces a contrast image appreciated with an electron microscope. In addition to the structures highlighted in the H&E stain,Â TEM can even detect small transcytosis vesicles in the capillary lumen that aid in transporting large molecules across the capillary endothelium.
