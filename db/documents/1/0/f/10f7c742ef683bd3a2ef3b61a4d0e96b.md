The minimally invasiveÂ approach provided great advantage to visualizing and accessing multiple parts of the abdominal cavity with minimal tissue disruption and incision size.

Access to the abdominal cavity should be in a virgin area least likely to have adhesions and organs, usually the left upper quadrant. After accessing the abdominal cavity, enough safe place should be created for the rest of the ports by lysing the easy and close adhesions. Adhesiolysis requires a specific reason to avoid risking inuring normal tissue. In cases of small bowel obstruction, the surgeon examines the small bowel from the ileocecal valve area proceeding proximally until identifying the transition zone of obstruction. When the bowel obstruction is released, the rest of the bowel requires assessment with minimal interruption. Excessive adhesiolysis is not the recommended approach. Hemostasis is necessary upon finishing the procedure.
