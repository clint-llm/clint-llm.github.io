Organophosphates (OP) are chemical substances produced by the process of esterification between phosphoric acid and alcohol. Organophosphates can undergo hydrolysis with the liberation of alcohol from the ester bond. These chemicals are the main components of herbicides, pesticides, and insecticides. OPs are also the main components of nerve gas. Acute or chronic exposure to OPs can produce varying toxicity levels in humans, animals, plants, and insects. OPs also are widely used in the production of plastics and solvents. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of organophosphate exposure and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the agents that commonly contain organophosphates.
- Describe the mechanisms of action of organophosphate toxicity.
- Review the adverse effects of organophosphates.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination of the interprofessional team can enhance patient care in patients exposed to organophosphate toxicity and improve patient outcomes.
