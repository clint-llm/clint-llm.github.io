The differential diagnosis for marine envenomation is lengthy. Marine injuries may be mistaken for each other making it difficult to determine the source of the injury. The mechanism of the injury may reveal the organism responsible. The stingray causes the most marine injuries in the United States annually and should be on the differential if patients were injured after stepping on a flat diamond-shaped fish buried in the sand. Injury from stepping on sharp debris such as coral is also very common which may result in acute contact dermatitis at the site of injury. Sea urchins also cause injury when stepped on and are distinguished by many small puncture wounds that often contain dark, brittle spines. Jellyfish envenomation is typically characterized by dermatitis in a flagellation, or whip-like, pattern. Other organisms to consider are the cone snail, sea anemone, starfish, catfish, blue-ringed octopus, and weeverfish.
