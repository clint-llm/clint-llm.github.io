Branchial cleft cysts, also known as branchial cleft anomalies, are congenital anomalies arising from the first through fourth pharyngeal pouches. These anomalies can exist as true fistulae, cysts, or sinus tracts, depending on the degree of incomplete obliteration during embryogenesis. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of branchial cleft anomalies.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology and pathophysiology of patients with branchial cleft cysts.
- Outline the clinical presentations and evaluation of patients with branchial cleft cysts.
- List the treatment options available for patients with branchial cleft cysts.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination to facilitate the evaluation and management of patients with branchial cleft cysts.
