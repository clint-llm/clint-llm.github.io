The first recorded tracheostomies were performed for upper airway obstruction. In modern practice, the indications for tracheostomy are (1) obstruction in the upper airway; (2) establishing and maintaining a secure airway when the upper airway is unsafe, such as in the face, head and neck injuries; (3) bronchial toilet and secretion removal; (4) airway protection e.g., neuromuscular disorders; (5) prolonged mechanical ventilation and facilitate weaning. The most common indication is to assist in facilitating weaning off ventilation in intensive care patients. In children, common indications for tracheostomy include congenital and acquired airway stenosis, neurologic conditions requiring long-term ventilation or pulmonary toilet, bilateral vocal fold insufficiency, and infectious compromise of the upper airway.

Currently, there is no convincing data to indicate the best timing for performing tracheostomy on patients ventilated via endotracheal tubes. However, in non-acute settings, tracheostomy should be considered after ten days. Nevertheless, the physiological changes associated with tracheostomy, benefits, and potential risks are issues that need to be considered, and in all cases, be discussed with patients and family members.

Postoperative complications vary and depend on the timing and insertion technique. Early postoperative complications tend to arise in the first few days to weeks that include hemorrhage, postoperative tube dislodgement or obstruction, subcutaneous emphysema, soft tissue infection, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum. Late complications that occur more than three weeks post tracheostomy include tracheal stenosis or tracheal malacia (granulation tissue), tube dislodgement or obstruction, equipment failure, tracheoinnominate artery fistula, tracheoesophageal fistula, and infections such as aspiration pneumonia.

Routine tracheostomy maintenance involves (1) regular cleaning of the tube, (2) frequent stomal care, and (3) periodic monitoring of cuff pressure. Adequate air humidification must be provided to patients with a tracheostomy. Inadequate humidification can result in obstruction of the tube from thick secretions, sputum retention, keratinization or ulceration of the tracheal mucosa, and impaired gas exchange as a result of lung atelectasis.

There are many different types of tracheostomy tubes. They are divided based on the material used in construction PVC, silicone, or metal. Tracheostomy tubes can be cuffed or uncuffed. Cuffed tracheostomy tubes are used for patients on long-term mechanical ventilation and those at risk for aspiration. Cuffed tubes also prevent loss of volume during positive pressure ventilation while preventing air leaks across the vocal cords. Uncuffed and metal tubes are used in patients with adequate ventilatory effort who are alert and at low risk for aspiration. Uncuffed and metal tubes are used in patients with adequate ventilatory effort who are alert and at low risk for aspiration.

Lack of cleaning and maintenance of the inner cannula is the primary cause of tube obstruction. The primary indications for tracheal suctioning are to remove secretions, enhance oxygenation, or obtain samples of lower respiratory tract secretions for diagnostic tests. It is important toÂ understand that tracheal suctioning should be performed only when it is clinically indicated; frequent, routine suctioning is not recommended.

There are no absolute contraindications to tracheal suctioning. Relative contraindications include severe bronchospasm, which may worsen with suctioning, and persistently elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), which is exacerbated by suctioning.

The indications for a tracheostomy tube change are (I) minimizing the risk of infection and granulation tissue formation
