There are mainly three syndromes in the differential diagnosis of hemisensory disturbances in a parietal lesion.

- The cortical sensory syndrome, including astereognosis, agraphesthesia, and loss of position sense, is due to a superior-posterior parietal lesion.

- The pseudothalamic sensory syndrome consists of a faciobrachiocrural impairment of touch, pain, temperature, and vibration, due to an inferior-anterior parietal lesion.

- The atypical sensory syndrome with a sensory loss involving all modalities of sensation in a partial distribution is produced by parietal lesions of different topography.

Astereognosis is used to describe both the inability to discriminate shape and size by touch and the inability to recognize objects by touch. These are apperceptive and associative types of agnosia. The term tactile agnosia is used for the associative type. The deficits in discrimination are most commonly seen with lesions in the primary somatosensory area and its connections. Lesions in the parietal somatosensory association areas result in tactile agnosia.

Tumors at the craniovertebral junction also can produce astereognosis with the involvement of the dorsal column medial lemniscus tract.
