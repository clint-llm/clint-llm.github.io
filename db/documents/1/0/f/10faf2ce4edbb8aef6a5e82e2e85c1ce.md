Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis is estimated to affect two to seven per million people each year. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is three times more common than toxic epidermal necrolysis. Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis can affect anyone with a genetic predisposition: any age, either sex, and all races, although it is more common in older people and women. It is much more likely to occur in people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with an estimated incidence of 1/1000.

- Numerous medications have been reported to trigger Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis.

- Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis are rarely associated with vaccination and infections such as mycoplasma, cytomegalovirus, and dengue.

The drugs that most commonly cause Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis are:

- Anticonvulsants: lamotrigine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbitone

- Allopurinol, especially in doses of more than 100 mg per day

- Sulfonamides: cotrimoxazole, sulfasalazine

- Antibiotics: penicillins, cephalosporins, quinolones, minocycline

- Paracetamol/acetaminophen

- Nevirapine (non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor)

- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (oxicam type mainly)

- Contrast media

Genetic factors include human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allotypes that lead to an increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis when exposed to aromatic anticonvulsants and allopurinol. Family members of a patient with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis should be advised that they are at risk of developing the disease and should be cautious about taking any medications associated with the disease.

To date, findings have included the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis in:

- Han Chinese, Thai, Malaysian, and South Indian people if they carry HLA-B*1502 and take aromatic anticonvulsants.

- Han Chinese if they carry HLA-B*5801 and take allopurinol

- Europeans if they carry HLA-B*5701 and take abacavir, or if they carry HLA-A*3101 and take carbamazepine.
