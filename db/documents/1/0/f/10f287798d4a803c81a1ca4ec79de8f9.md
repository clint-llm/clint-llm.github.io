The disruption of the circadian rhythm can have severe health implications for multiple organ systems including the immune, reproductive, gastrointestinal, skeletal, endocrine, renal, and cardiovascular systems. The central clock, or suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), is not the only internal mechanism of control, as recent discoveries have revealed the presence of secondary or peripheral oscillators throughout the body in a number of organs like the heart, liver, kidneys, lungs, intestines, skin, lymphocytes, esophagus, spleen, thymus, adrenal gland, prostate, and olfactory bulb. Although independent, these secondary clocks are still synchronized with the SCN and other factors like temperatures, the timing of meals, as well as external cues.
