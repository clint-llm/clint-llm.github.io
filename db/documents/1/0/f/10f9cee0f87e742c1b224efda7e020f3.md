Nocardia has been reported to be found ubiquitously in the environment and has been cultured from both fresh and saltwater, dust, soil, decaying vegetation, and decaying organic matter.Nocardia infections are thought to be due to inhalation of bacteria via environmental sources (i.e., dust), leading to the most common form of the infection, pulmonary nocardiosis.

Contrastingly, cutaneous nocardiosis arises via the inoculation of traumatic skin lesions. Other methods of infection that have been implicated include hospitalized acquired infections where clusters of nocardiosis have been described, and infection is transmitted from central venous catheters.Nocardia infection, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, it can spread hematogenously or by local extensions. Overall, immunocompromised individuals are more susceptible to nocardiosis and disseminated spread.
