Organs affected by hemochromatosis include the liver, pancreas, heart, thyroid, joints, skin, gonads, and pituitary. Excessive alcohol intake and viral hepatitis accelerate the pathology associated with hemochromatosis, especially with respect to the liver and pancreatic toxicity.

- Cirrhosis is present in 70% of patients with hemochromatosis. In these patients, there is a marked increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a significant cause of death.

- Diabetes is the primary manifestation of pancreatic iron deposition. The incidence of diabetes is approximately 50% in symptomatic patients, and the risk is increased in heterozygotes for hereditary hemochromatosis.

- Arthropathy manifests as joint pain without joint destruction. Although the presentation is identical to that of degenerative joint diseases, calcium pyrophosphate crystals can be found in the synovial fluid. It can still progress after the normalization of iron stores.

- Cardiac symptoms result from iron deposition in the cardiac muscle fibers and cells of the conduction system. Electrocardiac abnormalities can be present before true cardiac dysfunction occurs. Symptoms are due to congestive heart failure as a result of dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmias. Left ventricular failure can sometimes be reversed with the removal of iron stores.

- Hypogonadism, with resultant impotence, is due to iron-induced hypothalamic or pituitary failure, resulting in impairment of gonadotropin hormone release.

- Skin hyperpigmentation is a result of both iron and melanin deposition. It does not usually occur before the iron stores exceed five times the normal levels.

Iron overload of macrophages can cause impaired phagocytosis and lead to decreased immunity, resulting in an increased risk of infection from Listeria, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Vibrio vulnificus. Patients with hemochromatosis should not handle or eat raw shellfish due to the increased risk of sepsis from Vibrio vulnificus.

- Iron deposition in the thyroid gland causes hypothyroidism. The risk of hypothyroidism is 80 times greater than normal for men with hemochromatosis.

- Iron deposition in the adrenal and parathyroid glands rarely results in clinical manifestations.

- The iron overload that causes hemochromatosis can occur in three ways:

- Massive oral intake of iron
- Increased iron absorption with normal iron intake
- Excessive production or massive transfusion of red blood cells

The most common cause of hemochromatosis is an inherited autosomal recessive condition with variable penetrance. This condition is classified as primary hemochromatosis. Hereditary hemochromatosis occurs in homozygotes with a mutation of the HFE protein. A mutation in the HFE gene causes increased absorption of iron despite a normal dietary iron intake. The HFE protein regulates the production of hepcidin, the iron regulatory hormone.HFE gene are responsible for 90% of the cases of hereditary hemochromatosis in people of Northern European descent. Heterozygotes may have abnormalities in clinical markers of iron metabolism but do acquire iron overload. Heterozygotes do have an increased risk of diabetes over the general population due to unknown mechanisms.

Causes of secondary hemochromatosis include erythropoietic hemochromatosis, a condition that results from the absorption of excess iron because the patient is producing excessive amounts of red blood cells. This often occurs as a result of an underlying disease of the red blood cells that causes them to be more fragile, and therefore, to have a shortened lifespan. When the cells are destroyed, the iron from them is deposited in the body tissues. The same mechanism is in effect in patients who receive multiple, usually chronic, transfusions of red blood cells. Other less common conditions, such as porphyria cutanea tarda, can also cause iron overload. Erythropoietic hemochromatosis follows the prevalence of the underlying disease (i.e., thalassemia, spherocytosis) and is found in a wider range of races than the hereditary form of the disorder.

Finally, excessive iron consumption also can cause hemochromatosis. Historically, this has resulted from drinking beer prepared in steel drums. Accidental and intentional overdoses of iron can result from the consumption of some over-the-counter dietary supplements.
