The investigation into depressive symptoms begins with inquiries of the neurovegetative symptoms which include changes in sleeping patterns, appetite, and energy levels. Positive responses should elicit further questioning focused on evaluating for the presence of the symptoms which are diagnostic of major depression. These are the 9 symptoms listed in the DSM-5. Five must be present to make the diagnosis (one of the symptoms should be depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure):

- Sleep disturbance

- Interest/pleasure reduction

- Guilt feelings or thoughts of worthlessness

- Energy changes/fatigue

- Concentration/attention impairment

- Appetite/weight changes

- Psychomotor disturbances

- Suicidal thoughts

- Depressed mood

All patients with depression should be evaluated for suicidal risk. Any suicide risk must be given prompt attention which could include hospitalization or close and frequent monitoring.

Other areas of investigation include:

- Past medical history and family medical history, and current medications

- Social history with a focus on stressors and the use of drugs and alcohol

- History and physical examination to rule out organic causes of depression. Depressive symptoms and their severity are also evaluated with the help of questionnaires such as the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Depression Scale (Ham-D), and Zung Self Rating Depression Scale
