The diagnosis of CSX is mainly of exclusion. Patient presentation is typical of recurring anginal-type chest pains and no evidence of lesions more than 50% on imaging. Chest pains can present during activities such as exercise, and continued chest discomfort may occur after. Chest pain may also occur during rest and has been characterized as retrosternal, which may radiate towards the left arm. A thorough history and physical should be conducted prior to non-invasive and invasive testing, and patients should be carefully assessed for the potential pathophysiology of their manifestations. Chest pain from all non-cardiac causes, including psychological possibilities, should be differentiated. The patient's risk factors for coronary artery disease should also be thoroughly assessed.
