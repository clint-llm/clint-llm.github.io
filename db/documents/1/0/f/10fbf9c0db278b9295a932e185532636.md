Several species of mosquitos are capable of transmitting both the enzootic and epizootic strains of VEEV.Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus appears to be the primary mosquito vector during epizootics, while Culex species transmit enzootic strains.

VEEV can cause a spectrum of disease from mild febrile flu-like illness to severe or fatal encephalitis.
