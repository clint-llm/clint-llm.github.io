The primary complication of vesicovaginal fistula surgery is recurrent fistula formation. Urinary frequency and urgency most commonly arise in the acute perioperative setting. Urgency and stress urinary incontinence are recognized as long-term complications of vesicovaginal repair. In obstetric causes for fistula formation where the sphincter mechanism is injured, stress urinary incontinence is common. Anticholinergic medication can be used to reduce symptoms for urgency symptoms. Stress urinary incontinence can be treated with the usual treatment for that disorder. Failure and recurrence occurred in 30% of vesicovaginal repair cases. In recurrent cases, consider a delay of 2 to 3 months from the previous attempted repair. Utilizing the interposition of flaps as a surgical technique should be considered to increase the chances of a successful repair.
