An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach to care can help achieve the best possible outcomes. Based on the type of patient population involved in refractory angina, different specialist involvement can improve the outcome for the patient.

The pharmacist should be consulted to make sure that the patient is restarted on all the cardiac medications that he or she was on before the surgery.
