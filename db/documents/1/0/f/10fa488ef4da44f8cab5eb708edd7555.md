Atezolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody that has been approved by the U.S Food Drug Administration (FDA) for various neoplastic conditions either as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Atezolizumab is FDA approved for the following neoplastic conditions:

**Locally Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma**

- **Atezolizumab, as a single agent, is indicated in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.**
- Who are ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy with a level of tumor PD-L1 expression, or
- Are ineligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy irrespective of their PD-L1expression status, or
- Have the progression of their disease during or following any platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy

- **Extensive-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer**
- Atezolizumab, in combination with carboplatin and etoposide, is indicated as the first-line treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer.

- **Metastatic Non-small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)**
- Atezolizumab, as a single agent, is indicated in patients with metastatic NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression, regardless of histologic type.
- Atezolizumab, in combination with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin), is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression and (epidermal growth factor receptor)EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic tumor alterations.
- Atezolizumab in combination with nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel and carboplatin is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.
- Atezolizumab as a single agent is indicated for treating adult patients with metastatic NSCLC who have disease progression during or despite receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy.

- **Metastatic Triple-negative Breast Cancer**
- Atezolizumab, in combination with nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer whose tumors express PD-L1.

**UnresectableÂ or Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma**

- Atezolizumab, in combination with bevacizumab, is indicated to treat patients with unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not previously received treatment with chemotherapy.

**Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma**

- Atezolizumab, in combination with vemurafenib and cobimetinib, is indicated to treat patients with BRAF mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
