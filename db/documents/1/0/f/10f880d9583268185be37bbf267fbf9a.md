The semilunar ganglion contains neurons that arise from two trigeminal placodes and the neural crest. In the chick, they are known as the ophthalmic and maxillomandibular trigeminal placodes, whereas in the Xenopus frog, they are known as the profundal and trigeminal placodes. In the chick, the ophthalmic placode has a small area of ectodermal thickenings divided across a broad area rostral to rhombomere one and gives rise to postmitotic neurons.

The first condensation of the semilunar ganglion forms by neural crest cells. In the chick, the ophthalmic placode can express Pax3 (also known as the paired domain transcription factor gene), Fgfr4, (also known as the fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 gene), and Neurogenin2 (also known as the proneural transcription factor gene) while the maxillomandibular trigeminal placode expresses Ngn1 (also known as the proneural transcription factor gene). Neurogenesis in the ophthalmic placode starts in the ten-somite stage with the expression of Ngn2. Researchers also found that even though the degree of separation between the ophthalmic and maxillomandibular trigeminal placodes augments with time, a definitive border between them does not exist even at the 16-somite level. Moreover, some cells along the border between the two placodes express Pax3 and Ngn1, which suggests these cells respond to ophthalmic and maxillomandibular placode-inducing signals.
