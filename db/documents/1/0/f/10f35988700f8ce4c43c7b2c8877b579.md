Gastric peristalsis has been observed in the human fetus as early as 14 weeks of gestation, with all normal developing fetuses exhibiting sporadic gastric peristalsis by 23 weeks of gestation. At 24 weeks, fetal peristalsis increases in strength and duration up through weeks 32-35 of gestation, after which time the duration of peristaltic episodes remains constant.
