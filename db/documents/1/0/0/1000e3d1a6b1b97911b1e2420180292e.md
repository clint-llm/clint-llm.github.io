Oxaliplatin is a medication used to manage and treat metastatic colorectal cancer. It is a member of the platinum-based chemotherapeutic class of drugs and is indicated in the adjunctive treatment of stage III colorectal cancer after resection of the primary tumor and for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. It is FDA-approved in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin. This activity reviews the indications, actions, and contraindications for oxaliplatin as a valuable agent in treating colorectal cancer and will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interaction) pertinent for members of the healthcare team in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of oxaliplatin.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of oxaliplatin.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for patients receiving therapy with oxaliplatin.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance oxaliplatin and improve outcomes.
