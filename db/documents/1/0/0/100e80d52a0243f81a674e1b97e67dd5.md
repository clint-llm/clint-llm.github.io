Hydranencephaly is a rare condition and is rarely seen nowadays due to therapeutic abortions. The incidence may vary from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 5,000 (0.01% - 0.02%) of pregnancies.

A study performed in the United States with the population of Texas showed an incidence rate of 1.4 to 2.8 per 100,000 live births.

Although there is no established model of transmissions between mother and fetus, a few cases have been linked with autosomal recessive inheritance. This mode of transmission occurs in patients with the association of a rare genetic syndrome and/or conditions listed below.

- Fowler syndrome: Also known as proliferative vasculopathy and hydranencephaly–hydrocephaly syndrome. It has an autosomal recessive inheritance, in which a mutation in the FLVCR2 gene in chromosome 14q24.3 occurs. It is a proliferative glomeruloid vasculopathy that results in the destruction of the cerebral mantle, deep gray matter, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord.

- Trisomy 13

- Renal aplastic dysplasia

- Polyhydramnios

- Arthrogryposis

- Poly-valvular heart disease
