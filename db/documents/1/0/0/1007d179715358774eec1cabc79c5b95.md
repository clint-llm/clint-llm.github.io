Enkephalins are generated through the cleavage of the precursor molecule pro-enkephalin, generating either met-enkephalin or leu-enkephalin. The pro-enkephalin gene is composed of three exons that are separated by two introns. Processing of pro-enkephalin generates six copies of met-enkephalin and one copy of leu-enkephalin in humans and other mammals. Enkephalins have a wide distribution throughout multiple brain regions and the spinal cord, as well as the adrenal medulla. There is speculation that enkephalins detected in the plasma are primarily from the adrenal medulla.
