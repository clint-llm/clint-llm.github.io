Complications may include

- Bleeding at the surgical site

- Hematoma

- Surgical site infection

- Nerve damage

Intraoperative hemostasis and postoperative pressure dressings and ice decrease the likelihood of excessive postoperative bleeding or hematoma formation. Surgical site infection is mostly dependent on wound care by the patient with daily cleaning and bandage changes. Prophylactic antibiotics are indicated if the patient is considered high risk.
