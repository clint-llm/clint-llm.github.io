Chikungunya fever evaluation consists mainly of the clinical findings of fever and polyarthralgia in a person who recently returned from an affected region with anÂ 84% sensitivity, 71% positive predictive value (PPV), and 83% negative predictive value (NPV).

Diagnosis of CHIKV can be established or confirmed by detection of viral RNA with serology and/or reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) depending on disease timeframe presentation.
