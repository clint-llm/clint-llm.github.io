Preoperative anesthesia care should be based on available evidence-based practice and delivered in a context respective of the needs of each patient and their family. Suboptimal preoperative management of children results in post-traumatic stress that can manifest in night terrors, bed-wetting, stranger anxiety, and a subsequent fear of medically associated personnel and buildings. The care of children in the preoperative area should be centered on a compassionate and team-based approach. It may begin with an empathic approach towards the family, who likely brings with them significant concerns about the anesthetic and or the procedure. Asking questions to elicit any of these concerns is important.  Once identified, explanations can be provided to put risk into context and provide assurances about surgical indication and post-operative pain management plan. Also, employing procedures that double-check the patient and drug identity, dose, route of administration, and indication can provide reassurance to anxious parents and patients. In addition, many parents are knowledgeable about their child's condition and may also be a resource to medical staff.
