Even with treatment, paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) outcomes are often poor, with mortality rates up to 90%.

The presence of keratinocyte necrosis and cutaneous lesions resembling erythema multiforme, especially when accompanied by extensive mucosal and cutaneous lesions at presentation, are two factors associated with a worse prognosis.

Concentrations of serum IgG autoantibodies against Dsg1 and Dsg3 may parallel the clinical symptoms. Thus Dsg-ELISA can be a serological marker of disease activity in pemphigus.
