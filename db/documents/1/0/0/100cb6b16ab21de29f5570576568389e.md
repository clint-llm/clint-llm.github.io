The prompt diagnosis and successful treatment of Whipple disease require an interprofessional approach involving internal medicine, gastroenterology, and infectious disease specialists to work in a coordinated manner with nursing and pharmacy staff.

The diagnosis of Whipple disease is not straightforward, as the disorder is rare and the symptoms are vague. Many organs can be involved, and hence awareness is vital. The treatment of Whipple disease requires antibiotics for 1 to 2 years, and hence, an infectious disease board-certified pharmacist may consult on the case, helping the clinicians focus antibiotic therapy appropriately. The pharmacist must also educate the patient on compliance. Premature discontinuation can lead to relapse and progression of the infection into other tissues. Regular clinic follow-ups are also critical due to the prolonged course of treatment; this is where the nursing staff is crucial, charting progress, counseling the patient and answering questions, recognizing potential adverse drug reactions, and informing the clinicians of any concerns. Because of the rarity of the disorder, the team should clearly communicate with each other so that the patient receives the current standard of care.
