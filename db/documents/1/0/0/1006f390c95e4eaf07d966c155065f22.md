Patients who have a reparable tear pattern in a vascular zone of the meniscus should have repair attempted as opposed to partial meniscectomy. Although there is contradictory evidence, it is generally recommended that older patients with degenerative meniscal tears may not benefit from arthroscopic partial meniscectomy as opposed to those with more acute, traumatic tears.
