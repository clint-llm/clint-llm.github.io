Care should be coordinated between physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals. Medical management can typically be accomplished by an ophthalmologist, optometrist, or general clinician experienced in handling ocular conditions. Surgical care can be performed by an ophthalmologist or a surgeon specializing in facial and ocular plastic surgery. Patient safety and the best possible outcome should always be considered, and patients should undergo any treatment that may harm or worsen their outcomes. Before initiating any treatment, an in-depth discussion about risks and benefits should be conducted with the patient.
