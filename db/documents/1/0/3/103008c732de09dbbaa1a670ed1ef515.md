Chronic headache is not a single disease entity but an umbrella term that encompasses all chronic headaches. The International Headache Society defines chronic daily headaches (CDH) as "15 or more headache episodes per month for at least three months."

CDH is rather a descriptive term that most encompasses five subtypes of primary and secondary headaches defined by ICHD-3:

- Chronic migraine headache

- Chronic tension-type headache

- Medication overuse headache (MOH)

- Hemicrania continua

- New daily persistent headache

A chronic daily headache can be divided into primary and secondary headache disorders depending upon its etiology. Primary chronic headache disorders do not have secondary organic etiology. Within the primary headache categories, a headache duration of fewer than 4 hours is labeled as a 'short headache .' More than 4 hours is known as a 'long headache.' Long headaches more commonly include chronic migraine and chronic tension headaches.
