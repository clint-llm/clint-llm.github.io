ALA intoxication cases are rare and happen mostly in the pediatric population. Most of the cases were accidental; therefore, better communication is needed between healthcare providers to provide the appropriate dosage and monitoring information to patients, especially to diabetic patients with children. Also, patients should always consult with their primary doctor before taking the ALA supplementation.

ALA is a generally safe supplement that can be purchased over the counter. Primary care physicians may act as frontline and provide proper dosage and safety information to the patients. Other specialists and health care professionals monitor and treat any adverse events of the supplement. Appropriate cooperation between interprofessional team members is essential to ensure the patient receives the most effective care and optimal benefits from ALA supplementation.
