The biliary tree is innervated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers from the celiac plexus. The splanchnic nerves carry sympathetic fibers, while the vagus nerve carries parasympathetic fibers. Stimulation of splanchnic nerve visceral efferent fibers causes gallbladder relaxation, allowing bile to flow into the gallbladder through the cystic duct for storage.

Conversely, gallbladder contraction with bile secretion is primarily mediated by the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) which the duodenum secretes in response to the arrival ofÂ food in the small intestine. Parasympathetic fibers from the vagus nerve assist CCK in this process.
