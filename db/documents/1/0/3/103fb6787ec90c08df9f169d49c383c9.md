Maple syrup urine disease is a rare, inborn error of metabolism, resulting in decreased branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase enzyme activity. It can result in fatal irreversible neurocognitive deficits. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary to prevent or reduce the severity of these complications.
