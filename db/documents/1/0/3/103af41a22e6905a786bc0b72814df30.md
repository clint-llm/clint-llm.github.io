The workup of a patient with suspected CES consists of obtaining a pertinent history suggestive of trauma, surgery, or anticoagulation therapy. Perianal or saddle numbness, altered sexual function, or altered sensation during micturition with a high residual volume are also suspect. The physical exam may reveal lower extremity weakness or paresthesia, and/or perianal anesthesia with diminished external anal sphincter tone. In distinguishing between a lesion which compresses the conus medullaris itself rather than the cauda equina, the patellar reflex (L4) is informative; this reflex will typically be spared in conus medullaris compression because the tapered end of the spinal cord contains nerve roots S1-S5. Thus, a cauda equina lesion would compromise both the patellar and Achilles reflexes, while a conus medullaris lesion would spare the patellar reflex. There should be a low threshold for MRI of the lumbar spine as an initial step to triage possibleÂ CES, as delay in diagnosis or management is an important notion in prolonged morbidity and the medico-legal considerations associated with CES are disproportionately high.
