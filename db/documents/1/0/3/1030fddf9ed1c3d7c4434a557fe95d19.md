The prevalence of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is 1% to 6% among the White race population. CRC in those with HNPCC is found to occur earlier than the median age for the general population by 10 to 15 years. HNPCC is commonly diagnosed in both sexes without significant variation.
