Aortic valve-sparing surgery or valve repair is performed under general anesthesia. In addition to the surgical blades, saw, and operating knives, delicate instruments to perform aortic valve repair may be needed. Other instruments used include retractors, surgical sutures, and if plans for repairing aortic root or aorta, an aortic graft may also be needed as well.
