- Common adverse effects are dyspepsia and bloating. These symptoms can be decreased if cholestyramine is completely suspended in liquid several hours before ingestion.

- Constipation is a common side effect that isÂ preventable with adequate water and fiber intake.

- Decreased palatability due to gritty sensation from drinking the powdered solution of cholestyramine.

- Cholestyramine is considered a safe medication since it is not systemically absorbed. However, in rare instances, such as in patients with renal insufficiency and patients on aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone, it is known to cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

- Cholestyramine is a cationic resin that exchanges chloride anions for bile acids in the lumen of the small intestine, resulting in fecal excretion of bile acids. The chloride and bicarbonate anti-porter present at the apical brush border of the duodenum causes increased absorption of chloride and secretion of bicarbonate, leading to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. This effect is more pronounced in patients with impaired urinary acidification due to renal insufficiency and medications such as spironolactone since there is no adequate renal compensation.
