Complications from surgical intervention involve obstruction of nasal airflow, hyponasal speech, persistent hypernasal speech, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The pharyngeal flap has been associated with lateral port stenosis, hyponasal voice secondary to over-obturation of the nasopharynx, and postoperative OSA in up to 20% of patients.

Risks of posterior pharyngeal wall augmentation include migration or extrusion of injected material, foreign body reaction, and fat embolism.
