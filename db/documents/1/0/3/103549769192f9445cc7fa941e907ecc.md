Retinal detachment is the most frequent complication of ROP and is strongly associated with a poor visual outcome.

Low vision secondary to retinopathy of prematurity is associated with higher rates of developmental, education and social challenges. A followup to the CRYO-ROP study evaluated a cohort of children born at a weight of <1251 g and threshold ROP at 5 and 8 years. Children in this cohort with unfavorable visual status, classified as vision limited to light perception or no light perception, had significantly higher rates of developmental disability, epilepsy, special education and below-grade-level academic performance.
