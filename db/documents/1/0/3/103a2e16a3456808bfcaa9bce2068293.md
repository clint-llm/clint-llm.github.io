The hallmark of HAPE is the presence of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema leading to worsening respiratory distress and failure. The pathophysiology behind this phenomenon is complex and multifactorial. The proposed mechanism involves hypoxia at altitude leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction, subsequent pulmonary hypertension, capillary over perfusion, leak, and edema.

When a portion of the lung is suffering from poor ventilation (e.g., lobar pneumonia), regional vasoconstriction occurs, shunting the blood to the better-perfused regions of the lung to ensure adequate oxygenation. This phenomenon, known as the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictor response (HPVR), optimizes adequate gas exchange to prevent systemic hypoxia.

Increased pulmonary artery pressures occur in an unequal distribution throughout the lung, leading to focal capillary beds with increased capillary pressures, over perfusion, and subsequent edema secondary to capillary leak. This over perfusion and capillary leak in an unequal distribution may explain the patchy distribution of edema noted on imaging.

As the capillary leak progresses, worsening disruption of the epithelial cell membranes leads to increasing edema. Autopsy findings have noted lung weights of two to four times normal. Alveolar hemorrhage is common, as are pulmonary infarcts. Edema samples on bronchoalveolar lavage and autopsy have proteinaceous debris with plasma and red blood cells, microthrombi, but an absence of neutrophils and bacteria.
