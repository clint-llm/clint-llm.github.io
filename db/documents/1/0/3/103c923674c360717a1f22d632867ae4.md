First described in 1919 by Hess and Meyers, carotenemia is the medical terminology describing yellow-orange skin pigmentation due to high carotene levels in the blood.

The condition of carotenemia is benign; however, it can lead to a wrong diagnosis of jaundice. Orangeness may also bear a significant symbolic significance.
