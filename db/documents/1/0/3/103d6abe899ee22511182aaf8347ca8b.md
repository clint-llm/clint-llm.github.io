Usually, following trauma, a small warty papule appears. It enlarges veryÂ slowly to form a thick, hypertrophic, verrucous plaque. The lesion is, by and large, asymptomatic, though some patients may complain of occasional itching. Black dots (sclerotic bodies) will be present on the surface of the plaque. These are fungal bodies eliminated transepidermally. They are usually solitary, but a few small lesions may also appear in the periphery. These peripheral lesions are more common when there is itching. In some lesions, the plaque is flat and expands slowly with central scarring. The lesion is usually painless but can be painful in the presence of secondary infection. There can be lymphatic spread to adjacent areas.
