Branches of the external carotid artery deliver blood supply to the majority of the face, while the internal carotid artery contributes a smaller amount of blood flow, predominantly in the periocular region.

The facial artery provides the lateral nasal artery, which crosses and then runs medially to the levator anguli oris; the internal maxillary artery gives off the infraorbital artery, which runs with the infraorbital nerve (V2) and then emerges from the maxilla through the infraorbital foramen, just superior to the levator anguli oris. The transverse facial branch of the superficial temporal artery also supplies the midface musculature, and some terminal branches may feed the levator anguli oris.

Venous drainage of the levator anguli oris muscle predominantly flows into the facial vein, which in turn empties into the internal jugular vein. Any blood draining back through the infraorbital vein reaches the pterygoid plexus and proceeds into the retromandibular vein, which frequently joins both the internal and external jugular veins.

Following the facial vein, lymphatic fluid from the midface drains into the preauricular, infra-auricular, parotid, nasolabial, buccinator, submandibular, submental, internal jugular, and anterior jugular basins, ultimately into the cervical lymph nodes.
