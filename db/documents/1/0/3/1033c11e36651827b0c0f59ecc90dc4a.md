**CAMT**

Progression to bone marrow failure and aplastic anemia is seen at a mean age of 13 months for patients with CAMT type 1 and 5 years for patients with CAMT type 2.

CAMT patients are at an increased risk of development of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. The pathogenesis of the above conditions can be explained by karyotype instability, mutator effect, i.e., an increased accumulation of chromosomal aberrations over time, or an expansion of abnormal cell clones in the bone marrow.

**AAMT**

AAMT can progress to aplastic anemia from an average of 1 month to 2 years after diagnosis.
