Choroid plexus papillomas (CPPs) are rare central nervous system tumors. They may be seen at any age, but are more common in infants. Their site of occurrence varies according to age. They usually present with the increasing head circumference or altered mental status in children; whereas in adults they present with signs of increased intracranial tension. Imaging shows intraventricular enhancing masses. Surgery is the therapeutic intervention of choice for these lesions. They have a good prognosis in spite of their size as they are benign. Improvements in surgical techniques and intensive care have improved survival.
