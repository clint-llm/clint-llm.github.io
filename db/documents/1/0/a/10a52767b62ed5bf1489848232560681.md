**Maintain Accurate Medical Records Regarding Opiate Prescriptions**

All clinicians should maintain accurate, complete, and current medical records, including:

- Records of prescriptions for controlled substances

- Record instructions provided

- Detailed history, physical, monitoring, and reasons prescribed

**Federal and State Laws**

Several regulations and programs at the federal and state levels reduce prescription opioid abuse, diversion, and overdose. These laws require:

- Immunity from prosecution for individuals seeking assistance during an overdose

- Pain clinic oversight

- Patient identification prior to dispensing

- A physical examination prior to prescribing opioids

- Prescription limits

- Prohibition from obtaining controlled substance prescriptions

- Tamper-resistant prescriptions

**Federal Laws**

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sets national standards for controlled substances. Drug scheduling was mandated under The Federal Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. The law addresses controlled substances within Title II. The DEA maintains a list of controlled medications and illicit substances categorized from scheduled I to V. The five categories have their basis on the medication’s proper and beneficial medical use and the medication’s potential for dependency and abuse. The purpose of the law is to provide government oversight over the manufacturing and distribution of these types of substances. Prescribers and dispensers are required to have a DEA license to supply these drugs. The licensing provides links to users, prescribers, and distributors.

The schedules range from Schedule I to V. Schedule I drugs are considered to have the highest risk of abuse, while Schedule V drugs have the lowest potential for abuse. Other factors considered by the DEA include pharmacological effect, evidenced-based knowledge of the drug, risk to public health, trends in the use of the drug, and whether or not the drug has the potential to be made more dangerous with minor chemical modifications.

- "High abuse potential with no accepted medical use; medications within this schedule may not be prescribed, dispensed, or administered"

-  Examples include marijuana (cannabis), heroin, mescaline (peyote), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and methaqualone.

- "High abuse potential with severe psychological or physical dependence; however, these medications have an accepted medical use and may be prescribed, dispensed, or administered"

-  Examples include fentanyl, oxycodone, morphine, methylphenidate, hydromorphone, amphetamine, methamphetamine (meth), pentobarbital, and secobarbital.

- Schedule II drugs may not receive a refill

- "Intermediate abuse potential (i.e., less than Schedule II but more than Schedule IV medications)"

- Examples include anabolic steroids, testosterone, and ketamine

- "Abuse potential less than Schedule II but more than Schedule V medications"

- Examples include diazepam, alprazolam, and tramadol

- "Medications with the least potential for abuse among the controlled substances."

- Examples include pregabalin, Diphenoxylate/atropine, dextromethorphan

It is essential to understand the DEA controlled-substance scheduling to ensure adequate caution when prescribing medications with high abuse potential and to ensure against prescribing outside of one's authority.

The Controlled Substances Act has great potential to improve patient safety by providing federal oversight for drugs with a high potential for abuse. Providers of scheduled substances (physicians, dentists, podiatrists, advanced practitioners) may have links to the distribution of these substances. They are required to have a DEA license and record prescription of scheduled drugs. This licensing prevents overprescribing and obligates providers to be wary of potential drug-seeking patients. The dispenser must also be aware of a patient's medication history and be mindful of the potential for polypharmacy if a patient seeks multiple providers. The current opioid epidemic is a time where federal oversight and interdisciplinary coordination can potentially reduce harm to patients prescribed scheduled drugs drastically. However, it will take further time and evaluation to know if drug scheduling actually reduces abuse, addiction, and overdose.

See Table 1 for information regarding registration, records, prescriptions, refills, distribution, security, theft, or significant loss of controlled substances.

See Table 2 for information regarding DEA forms 106, 222, 224, and 224a.

**Tennessee Chronic Pain Guidelines For the Management of Chronic Non-Malignant Pain**

The practitioner should review the detailed guidelines provided by the Tennessee Department of Health. The following is a summary of the key points.

**Section I: Prior to Initiating Opioid Therapy for Chronic Non-Malignant Pain**

- Try non-opioid therapy first, don't initiate opioid therapy just because a previous provider did

- Administer a urine drug screen to the newly pregnant woman; before administering opioids, or renewing prescriptions to child-bearing woman, discuss a birth control plan and evaluate for a possible pregnancy

- A full medical workup including history, physical, ROS, prior opioid use, co-morbid conditions, mental health disorder screening, review of medical records should be documented prior to initiating steroids

- In-person exam, do not prescribe through telemedicine

- A current diagnosis should justify the need for opioids

- Access for risk of abuse using risk assessment tools, obtain a urine drug test and check the Controlled Substances Monitoring Database (CSMD)

- Establish and follow goals for treatment with the 3-item PEG Assessment Scale (**P**ain average, Interference with**E**njoyment of life, and Interference with**G**eneral Activity); the goal is to increase function and reduce pain

**Section II: Initiating Opioid Therapy for Chronic Non-Malignant Pain**

- Prescribe the lowest effective dose for the shortest time period required

- Start with immediate-release opioids, gradually switch to extended-release or long-acting

- Avoid benzodiazepines or naloxone combinations with an opioid for chronic pain

- Methadone should only be used for addiction or by pain specialists

- Document any deviations from guidelines

- Obtained informed consent discussing and documenting risks and benefits

- Obtain a written treatment agreement - reasons to discontinue, refill policy, lost prescription policy, safe storage, periodic drug testing, and pregnancy issues

- Ongoing monitoring for abuse, misuse, or diversion

- If potentially child-bearing, obtain pregnancy test and discuss methods to avoid unintended pregnancy if child-bearing age, with documented and signed discussion of risks and benefits

**Section III: Ongoing Opioid Therapy for Chronic Non-Malignant Pain**

- All opioid therapy by a single provider and single pharmacy

- Only one opioid

- Document five A's (analgesia, activities of daily living, adverse side effects, aberrant drug-taking behaviors, and affect)

- Review the patient’s history of controlled substance prescriptions using the Controlled Substance Monitoring Database (CSMD) data to determine whether the patients receiving opioid dosages or potentially dangerous combinations

- Continually monitor for signs of abuse, misuse, or diversion; including urine drug screen at least twice per year

- Ongoing risk assessment of behavior, the CSMD results, and the urine drug screen

- Emergency physicians should inform providers of any incidents or conditions

- Opioids are to be discontinued when the risks, side effects, lack of efficacy or presence of medication, or aberrant behavior outweigh the benefits

- Document CSMD queries

- Discuss a method to prevent unintended pregnancy with every woman of child-bearing age who has reproductive capacity when opioids are initiated

- If the patient plans to become pregnant, referred to an obstetrician

- Document urine drug screen results

**Tennessee Laws on Opioid Prescribing**

- Offer reasonable alternatives risks and benefits

- Explain opioid use, what to expect, and disclose the risk of dependency, addiction, diversion, and misuse

- A consent signed by the patient or legal representative

- An agreement (contract), usually including informed consent, providing patient-provider long-term conditions for the prolonged (typically > 90-days) use of opioids or controlled substances

- Informed consent is for the episode of care for which the controlled substance is prescribed (TN law does not specify an expiration)

- Agreement (contract) is for the duration of care under that provider or practice and are typically renewed with major changes in treatment or periodically
