Mastocytosis can present at birth or develop any time into late adulthood. It occurs in all races and has no gender preferences.Â  Although most patients do not have a family history of mastocytosis, familial cases have been reported. Cutaneous mastocytomas occur in 15% to 50% of patients, urticaria pigmentosa occurs in 45% to 75%, and diffuse cutaneous involvement occurs in less than 5% to 10%.
