- Keloids are a benign overgrowth of scar tissue that can lead to pain and disfigurement

- Surgery followed by radiation therapy is most effective for the treatment of recurrent keloids

- Start radiation on post-op day 1 and use a radiation prescription with BED greater than 30 Gy (i.e., 6 Gy times 3) for optimal local control
