Adverse events in the management of xanthomas are generally related to systemic therapy. For example, the use of HMG CoA reductase inhibitor therapy has a well-known side effect profile. These side effects range from the more commonly reported statin-associated muscle symptoms (including mild myalgia in up to 10% of users) to rarer but more feared complications such as rhabdomyolysis and necrotizing autoimmune myopathy.

Therefore, systemic therapy for patients presenting with xanthomas should be initiated and managed closely by a provider who is able to recognize and manage any adverse effects of such medications.Â Surgical complications from the excision of xanthomatous lesions are also well described. As tendinous xanthomas tend to develop in areas that are well known to be at high risk for delayed wound healing, careful surgical planning is essential to avoid wound complications and local recurrence.
