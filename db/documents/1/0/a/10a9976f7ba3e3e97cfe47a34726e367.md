Borderline personality disorder is one of the most difficult mental health disorders to manage; it is best managed with an interprofessional team, including psychiatrists, psychologists, pharmacists, mental health nurses, and social workers. Pharmacists review prescribed medications, check for drug-drug interactions and provide patient education. Mental health nurses and social workers provide care, monitor patients, participate in the education of patients and their families, and provide follow-up to the team. Unfortunately, there are no medications that seem to help; psychotherapy may help some patients, but compliance with treatment is low. The outcomes for most patients are poor, with many running into legal, social, and personal problems. [Level 5]
