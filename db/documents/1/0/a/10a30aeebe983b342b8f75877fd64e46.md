People can use classical conditioning to exploit others for their gain. A prominent example of this occurs in advertising. The advertiser generally attempts to get consumers to associate their product with a particular response or feeling so they are more likely to buy the product. Advertisers can use music or mouth-watering food in their ads to create an association with their product. These types of associations can lead to increased spending as well as poor eating habits especially if the product is unhealthy food.
