Pityriasis rosea is a self-limiting, exanthematous disease. Most patients need emollients, antihistaminics, and topical steroids. Macrolides and acyclovirÂ lead to faster resolution of lesions and help to relieve pruritus. Narrowband ultraviolet B therapy is also used. It works by altering the immune response in the skin.
