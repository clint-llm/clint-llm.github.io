History of a long-standing cough with purulence is typical of bronchiectasis. Patients may report repetitive pulmonary infections that require antibiotics over several years. Patients can also present with progressive dyspnea, intermittent wheezing, hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, and associated fatigue and weight loss. The hemoptysis is mild and manifested by blood flecks in the patient's usual purulent sputum, which is occasionally life-threatening. Often patients are diagnosed after many years of symptoms when a chronic cough or hemoptysis becomes debilitating.

Cough: 98%, sputum: 78% (sputum is typically mucoid and relatively odorless), dyspnea: 62%, haemoptysis: 56% to 92%, and pleuritic chest pain: 20% (secondary to chronic coughing).

**Physical:**Findings are nonspecific.

**General findings**may include digital clubbing (2% to 3%), cyanosis, plethora, wasting, and weight loss.

- Local chest examination:  Most commonly crackles and wheezes on auscultation.

- Crackles: 75%, usually bi-basal.

- Wheezing: 22% (wheezing may be due to airflow obstruction from secretions)

**Clinical Features of Associated Causative condition:**

- Connective tissue diseases: Arthritis Sicca syndrome

- ABPA: Prominent wheezing

- Bronchial obstruction: localized wheezing

- PCD, CF, Young Syndrome: Recurrent sinus disease, infertility

- Features of acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis: Change in sputum production, increased dyspnea, increased cough, fever, increased wheezing, and reduced pulmonary function.
