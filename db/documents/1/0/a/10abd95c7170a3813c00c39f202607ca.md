All musculature of the human body, both striated and smooth muscle, with few exceptions, arises from the mesoderm. The few exceptions arise from the ectoderm. The trapezius and sternocleidomastoideus muscle originates initially as a singular mass in the lateral occipital area. At this very early period, it is innervated by the spinal accessory nerve (CN XI in the adult form).

As the muscle mass moves into its adult position, it extends and moves caudally, carrying the nerve with it. This single mass splits into the trapezius and the sternocleidomastoideus at approximately the 20th week of gestation. It is not unusualÂ for the muscle to receive secondary new nerves while retaining its original nerve CN XI and later receiving branches from the cervical plexus.
