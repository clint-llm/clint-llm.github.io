In traumatic shoulder subluxation, the recurrent rate is higher, especially in younger patients. Patients who have a greater awareness of their condition and modify their daily activities accordingly have a high chance of recovery. Meanwhile, immobilization for 3 to 4 weeks does not change the outcome, and immediate gentle mobilization is then allowed.

In atraumatic shoulder subluxation without concurrent fractures or labral injuries, around 20% of the patients have spontaneous recovery.

In hemiplegic stroke patients, motor weakness and Brunnstromâ€™s arm motor stages are the predictors of the presence of glenohumeral subluxations, and there is the spontaneous reduction of shoulder subluxation in patients with significant motor recovery.
