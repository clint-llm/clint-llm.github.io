The rotator cuff is comprised of four muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. The supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor all arise from the posterior scapula and insert onto the greater tubercle of the humerus. The subscapularis arises from the subscapular fossa of the anterior scapula and inserts on the lesser tubercle of the humerus.

Collectively, the rotator cuff stabilizes the glenohumeral joint, which is a far more shallow and unstable ball-and-socket joint than the hip. Each muscle also helps with certain movements of the arm. The supraspinatus is responsible for the first 15 degrees of abduction; the deltoid, an intrinsic muscle of the shoulder that is not a rotator cuff muscle, is responsible for abduction from 15 to 90 degrees. The infraspinatus and teres minor both aid in lateral or external rotation of the arm at the shoulder. The subscapularis,Â along with the teres major, which is another intrinsic muscle that is not part of the rotator cuff, and extrinsic muscles like the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, are responsible for medial, or internal, rotation of the arm.
