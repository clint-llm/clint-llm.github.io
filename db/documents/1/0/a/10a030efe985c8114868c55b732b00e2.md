The care of a central line includes routine inspection and dressing changes. The dressing changes allow a more detailed site inspection and cleansing of the skin/site. How often these changes are done is a matter of contention; there has been a benefit demonstrated by 48 hourly dressing changes with the use of chlorhexidine washes at every change compared to similar care at 7-day intervals. However, more frequent than 48 hourly changes are not associated with any improvement.

Frequent hand hygiene, sterile gloves for the provider performing care, and masks for the provider and patient are essential for dressing changes. After removing the soiled dressing, a new pair of sterile gloves should be donned before proceeding with the dressing change. A chlorhexidine-impregnated sponge dressing may be advisable if the central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rate in the facility is not decreasing. At this and any other care opportunity, healthcare providers should perform a careful assessment of the catheter insertion site daily, ensuring the sutureless securement device is intact, noting the dressing change date listed on the dressing, and encouraging the patient to report any swelling or pain at the insertion site.

Central venous catheters must be flushed every day to prevent clotting and keep it clear of blood. Each lumen should be flushed in the same order each time. Depending on the type of catheter flush it with either heparin or saline solution.
