**Surgery:**

Location and histologic grade determine the treatment approaches of chondrosarcoma. The primary treatment modality of chondrosarcoma is surgical excision. Low-grade central chondrosarcoma can be treated with intralesional curettage, burring and surgical adjuvant application such as hydrogen peroxide

Tumors with intraarticular or soft tissue involvement, larger tumors, axial or pelvic tumors must be treated with wide excision. For the intermediate or high-grade chondrosarcoma, wide en bloc excision is the surgical approach of choice

**Chemotherapy:**

Chemotherapy is generally not efficient in conventional chondrosarcoma. However, it may have a role in dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas containing a high-grade spindle cell component

**Radiation therapy:**

After incomplete resection of high-risk chondrosarcomas, radiation therapy is indicated to improve the high local failure rates. These indications include locally recurrent tumors intermediate to high-grade tumors, and tumors in locations where surgical resection is challenging or limited. Definitive radiation can also be indicated for unresectable tumors
