Anterior segment injuries can cause corneal scarring, traumatic cataract, iris defect, hypopyon, hyphema, and open-angle glaucoma. IOFB in the posterior segment can cause endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and phthisis bulbi.

The incidence of infectious endophthalmitis has been reported in 7 to 13% of IOFB cases.
