Patient education is primarily around early diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Treatment with HAART can delay and even deter the onset of dementia secondary to HIV disease. High viral loads and low CD4 cell counts are associated with a higher incidence of HIV-associated dementia; therefore, early HAART therapy is paramount in the prevention of severe neurocognitive decline in patients with HIV.

Screening asymptomatic patients with HIV for neurocognitive impairment is somewhat controversial. Arguments against this practice namely highlight cost-effectiveness and the limited resources in most settings to screen asymptomatic patients for this disease. However, some studies suggest that screening asymptomatic patients can lead to early recognition and allow a change in HAART regimens to those that optimally penetrate the central nervous system, which in turn will improve clinical outcomes.
