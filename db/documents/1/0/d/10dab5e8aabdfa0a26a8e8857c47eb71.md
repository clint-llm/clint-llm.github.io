The prognosis of hyperhidrosis is guarded. While not life-threatening, it can be cosmetically unacceptable and may even lead to difficulties with work. The quality of life for patients with severe hyperhidrosis is poor. No treatment works reliably, and the recurrence of hyperhidrosis is common with all currently available treatment options. Newer surgical treatments offer hope but do not always provide a cure.
