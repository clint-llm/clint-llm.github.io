Although colic is a benign and self-limiting condition, a thorough history, physical examination, and reviewing growth charts are important to rule out more serious issues. After obtaining information regarding the pattern, frequency, circumstances, duration, and intensity of crying,Â the health care provider should take care to obtain information regarding fever, growth, feeding patterns, the presence of bilious emesis, constipation or diarrhea, bloody stools, lethargy, cough, wheezing, rash. The physical exam should then focus on identifying signs of failure to thrive or serious illness. Findings such as poor weight gain or growth, abdominal distension and tenderness, scrotal or inguinal swelling, suspicious bruises or burns, and signs of dehydration should prompt further evaluation. Findings such as a hair wrapped around a digit or penis should not be missed.
