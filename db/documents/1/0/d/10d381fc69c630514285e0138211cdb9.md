Systemic diseases like diabetes mellitus (DM), systemic hypertension, and hyperlipidemia have been associated with asteroid hyalosis, but controversies do exist. A study by Smith et al. found 70% of patients with AH had DM according to glucose tolerance test, but the absence of a control group was the limitation of the study. Luxenberg and Sime, in a clinic-based study, reported no difference in the prevalence rate of AH in DM and control groups.
