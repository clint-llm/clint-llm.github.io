Analysis of organizational culture is extremely beneficial in identifying hurdles and possible interventions to strengthen nursing, allied health, and interprofessional teams. For example, in a survey by Poghosyan et al., nurse practitioners felt that in their organization, they get less organizational support and less access to organizational resources than physicians in similar situations.

When organizational culture is cohesive and unified, however, there can be many benefits to patient care.  Take interprofessional health care teams that conduct interdisciplinary ward rounds. An organizational culture strong in-group culture will allow all team members to collaborate on patient care that is holistic and patient-centered. This paradigm can be difficult to accomplish, however, as perceived challenges include health professionals’ limited time as well as coordination of different teams to allow involvement in rounds.
