Surgical intervention remains the only cure. It is often recommended that femoral hernias be repaired at the time of diagnosis. This is mostly due to their increased incidence of complications including incarceration or strangulation, compared to the more common inguinal hernia

Many repairs are available, and thisÂ strongly suggests that a "best repair method" does not exist.
