The cellular response that takes place during the dive reflex is vast; however, the primary cellular mechanisms responsible for the reflex involve afferent and efferent neuron tracts along with carotid chemoreceptors. The dive response activates with the immersion of the face in water which triggers a neuronal afferent response via the trigeminal nerve.  Nerve fibers innervating the anterior nasal mucosa and paranasal region are essential in triggering this autonomic reflex. However, at this present time, it is not entirely clear what stimulus activates these specific nerve fibers, but chemesthetic trigeminal chemoreceptors are believed to play a role.

In addition to neural tracts, the chemoreceptors located in the carotid bodies contribute to the induction of bradycardia and peripheral vascular changes.  When a human holds their breath underwater, oxygen gets consumed, and carbon dioxide is produced; a decrease in oxygen of 60mm Hg or less activates the chemoreceptor.  Studies have observed that when divers hold their breath for an extended period a robust chemoreflex activation aids in triggering additional sympathetic peripheral vasoconstriction activity.  Widespread peripheral vasoconstriction is believed to help maintain proper oxygen stores to fundamental organ systems during times of prolonged water submersion.
