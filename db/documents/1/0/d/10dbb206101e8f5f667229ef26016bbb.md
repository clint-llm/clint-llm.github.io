Met-Cbl is a cofactor for methionine synthase enzyme. In this reaction, the methyl group of methyltetrahydrofolate transferred to homocysteine to form methionine and tetrahydrofolate. Methionine converted to s-adenosyl methionine (SAM), a methyl donor for phospholipid biosynthesis especially that of the myelin sheath. Tetrahydrofolate is the free form of folate essential for purines synthesis. Dysfunction of this reaction leads to the following:

- Folate trap in methyltetrahydrofolate form; therefore, less amount of tetrahydrofolate is available for DNA synthesis, the result is megaloblastic anemia.

- Less methionine for phospholipid synthesis leading to demyelination of neurons

- Homocysteine accumulates, leading to endothelial dysfunction predisposing to cardiovascular events plus homocystinuria.

Ado-Cbl is a cofactor for methylmalonyl CoA mutase enzyme. In this reaction, the methylmalonyl-CoA (a product from odd number fatty acid catabolism) converted to Succinyl-CoA. The latter makes its way into two pathways, the citric acid cycle, and heme synthesis. Accumulation of methylmalonyl-CoA responsible for:

-  Neurological disorders due to the incorporation of methylmalonyl-CoA into the myelin sheath, and the result is neuron demyelination.

-  Methylmalonic aciduria
