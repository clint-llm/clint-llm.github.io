The differential diagnoses for spasticity include contractures, rigidity, and catatonia. A contracture is defined as a decreased elasticity of a muscle, tendon, ligament, joint capsule, and skin, leading to increased resistance during the passive stretch, similar to spasticity. However, the difference between the two is that contractures do now show any velocity-dependent changes with movement or limb positioning.  Rigidity is most commonly associated with basal ganglia injuries.  Rigidity, unlike spasticity, exhibits high tone that is non-selective and affects all muscles surrounding a particular joint equally.  Similar to a contracture, rigidity is unaffected by the speed of movement and is constant throughout the range of movement. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric disorder in which the patient exhibits abnormal posturing; the increase in muscle tone seen here is dependent on the force applied to the muscle in question. Unlike spasticity, catatonia frequently presents with concomitant signs such as stupor, impulsivity, perseveration, staring, grimacing, echolalia, echopraxia, and withdrawal.
