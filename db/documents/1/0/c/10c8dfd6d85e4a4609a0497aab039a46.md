Management of a concussion requires an interprofessional team approach involving the patient, family members, coaches, therapists, athletic trainers, and medical providers (clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists.)

Opportunities for concussion prevention in the general population are limited and largely center around educating patients on the recognition and treatment of concussions. Outside of strategies aimed at preventing falls, there are few options for preventing traumatically induced concussions. Opportunities for preventing sports-related concussions include strict enforcement of the rules of play, promotion of fair play, and reducing the number of contact practices.

No guidelines exist regarding the disqualification of a patient from athletic participation after a concussion. The American Medical Society for Sports Medicine suggests an individualized approach for each patient and consideration of factors such as persistent symptoms, the number of lifetime concussions, previous prolonged recoveries from a concussion, and the perceived ease of sustaining a repeat concussion when deciding on continued athletic participation.
