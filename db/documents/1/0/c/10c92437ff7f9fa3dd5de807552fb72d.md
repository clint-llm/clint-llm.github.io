Plantar fasciitis is the result of degenerative irritation of the plantar fascia origin at the medial calcaneal tuberosity of the heel as well as the surrounding perifascial structures. The plantar fascia plays an important role in the normal biomechanics of the foot and is composed of three segments, all of which arise from the calcaneus. The fascia itself is important in providing support for the arch and providing shock absorption. Despite the diagnosis containing the segment "itis," this condition is notably characterized by an absence of inflammatory cells.

Plantar fasciitis is very common in the US with millions experiencing heel pain every year. The cause of plantar fasciitis is multifactorial but most cases result from overuse stress. The classic presentation is of sharp localized pain at the heel. In some cases, a heel spur may be found. Plantar fasciitis is not easy to treat and patient dis-satisfaction is common with most treatments. The majority of cases are managed non-surgically but recurrence of pain is frustrating.
