Giardiasis is multifactorial disease, with a complex interplay between the host and parasite. When a host ingests Giardia cysts, they are able to excyst into their trophozoic form due to the combination of low gastric pH and pancreatic enzyme release in the duodenum. The trophozoites then divide and adhere tightly to small intestine enterocytes but do not invade the small intestine.

Different genotypes of Giardia have not been proven to correlate with severity of the disease.
