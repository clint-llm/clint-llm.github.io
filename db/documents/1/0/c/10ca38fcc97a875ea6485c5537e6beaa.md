The gram-negative bacteria have a great ability to cause disease in humans and can reach almost all systems in the organism, such as the digestive system, nervous system, urinary system, and bloodstream, causing diarrheal gastroenteritis until severe meningitis. Such microorganisms colonize the intestines, airways, and skin, which favors the spread to other parts of the human organism, especially in immunocompromised individuals. One of the greatest difficulties of health professionals is to treat nosocomial infections of the lower respiratory tract in which the pathogens GNB are involved because although they are responsible for a good portion of these infections, they are non-responsive to antibiotic therapy due to the high resistance rates and the poor penetration of drugs into the lung parenchyma.

Another major concern is gastroenteritis caused by Enterobacteriaceae (Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., enteropathogenic E. coli), which affects millions of people worldwide and is related to a lack of sanitation.
