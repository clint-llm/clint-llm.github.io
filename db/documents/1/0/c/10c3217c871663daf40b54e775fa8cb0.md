The prostate is a "walnut-shaped' gland, a part of the male reproductive system which produces and secrets thin alkaline fluid in the ejaculate. It contains glandular and stromal elements that are subject to enlargement and developing adenocarcinoma in an elderly patient. Infection is common in relatively younger patients. Imaging plays a vital role in the diagnosis of different prostatic pathology, including early detection of carcinoma. Imaging also helps obtain tissue samples, drain abscess and post-procedure collections,Â  and stage and follow malignancy.
