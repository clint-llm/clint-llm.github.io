There are two types of contraindications in the cervical HVLA OMT, absolute and relative. Absolute contraindications include patients with a medical history of osteoporosis, active osteomyelitis, fractures in the cervical area, severe rheumatoid arthritis, and bone metastasis in the cervical region. Also included are patients with Down syndrome as HVLA therapy can lead to rupture of the transverse ligament of the dens process since this population may have increased laxity of the transverse ligament at baseline.

**Absolute Contraindications:**

- Acute fractures

- Acute soft tissue injury

- Acute myelopathy

- Ankylosing spondylitis

- Anticoagulant therapy

- Chiari malformation

- Connective tissue disease

- Dislocation

- Down syndrome

- Infection

- Instability

- Ligament rupture

- Osteoporosis

- Patient refusal

- Recent surgery

- Rheumatoid arthritis

- Surgical or pathologic fusion of a joint

- Tumor/bony malignancy

- Vertebral artery abnormalities

- Vascular disease

**Relative Contraindications:**

- Acute herniated nucleus pulposis

- Acute whiplash

- Any symptom aggravated by movement of the neck

- Blurred vision

- Diplopia

- Dizziness/vertigo

- Drop attacks

- Dysarthria

- Dysphagia

- Facial/oral paresthesia

- Hypermobility syndromes

- Nausea

- Previous diagnosis of vertebrobasilar insufficiency

- Tinnitus

- Visual disturbances

- Worsening of symptoms with manipulations

Since a large number of the reported cases of serious adverse outcomes involved in cervical HVLA OMT and "thrust" techniques involve vertebrobasilar accidents (VBA) and strokes, caution should be used when treating patients with suspected artery disease or vascular anomalies.
