There are no clear guidelines for the prevention or deterrence of sternoclavicular joint injuries.

Patients should be aware that this is a rare cause of shoulder pain. Although spontaneous subluxations can occur, most are caused by high trauma such as a motor vehicle accident or collision in sports. Typically there is pain, swelling, and deformity at the joint. If the patient experiences these symptoms, they should be evaluated emergently. Most sternoclavicular joint injuries are managed nonoperatively. If they are dislocated posteriorly, an orthopedic surgeon is likely to surgically fix that dislocation due to the risk of secondary injuries.
