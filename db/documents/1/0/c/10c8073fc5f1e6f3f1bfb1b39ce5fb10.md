Knowledge of the principle of MRI acquisition is vital for an adequate interpretation of MRI images. MRI system has two systems, i.e., the control center is usually located in the adjacent room and the MRI machine within which the patient lies. Components of the MRI machine include- a set of Primary magnets, three gradient coils, shim coils, and an integrated radiofrequency(RF) coil. Due to extensive use of the Radiofrequency waves (RF waves), the MRI machine is incorporated within a special copper-lined room called a Faraday shield to keep the potential electromagnetic noise out. The strength of the magnetic field is measured in Tesla (T). Clinical MRI is usually performed at 1.5-3 Tesla (1.5-3T).
