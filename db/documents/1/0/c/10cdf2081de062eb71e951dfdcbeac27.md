Most patients with advanced cataracts who have phacogenic uveitis are elderly with co-morbidities. They need physician review to control diabetes, hypertension, and other systemic disorders. High intraocular pressure due to phacolytic glaucoma has to be controlled by antiglaucoma medications, including systemic acetazolamide or intravenous mannitol, which needs monitoring by the nursing staff. Options for anesthesia in cataract surgery include topical proparacaine, peribulbar lignocaine, sub-Tenon lignocaine, intracameral lignocaine, sedation, and general anesthesia.
