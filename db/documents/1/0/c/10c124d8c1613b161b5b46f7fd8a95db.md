There is no proven treatment in AIP.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended initially until infectious etiology is excluded.

Despite that steroid therapy is usually started empirically, it has no clear benefit in AIP. In a case series of 29 patients with AIP, 12 patients survived. Survival was 45% compared to 33% in patients who did vs. did not receive steroids, respectively.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and lung transplantation should be considered for appropriate candidates after failing conventional therapy.
