Skin is continuously shedding and desquamating and varies slightly depending on the body region. There are more layers of cells in thicker hairless skin with an additional layer, known as the stratum lucidum. Overall, the process of cell division, desquamation, and shedding go as follows:

- Cell division occurs in stratum basale/germinativum. One cell remains, another cell is pushed toward the surface. Basal cells begin synthesis of tonofilaments (composed of keratin) which are grouped into bundles (tonofibrils).

- Cells are pushed into stratum spinosum. In the upper part of the spinous layer, cells begin to produce keratohyalin granules having intermediate-associated proteins, filaggrin, and trichohyalin; helps aggregate keratin filaments and conversion of granular cells to cornified cells, i.e. keratinization. Cells also produce lamellar bodies.

- Cells are pushed into stratum granulosum and become flattened and diamond shaped. The cells accumulate keratohyalin granules mixed between tonofibrils.

- Cells continue to stratum corneum where they flatten and lose organelles and nuclei.  The keratohyalin granules turn tonofibrils into a homogenous keratin matrix.

- Finally, cornified cells reach the surface and are desquamated via a break-down of desmosomes. Proteinase activity of KLK (kallikrein-related serine peptidase) is triggered by lowered pH near the surface.
