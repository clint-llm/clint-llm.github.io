Three primary methods for calculation of medication dosages exist, and these include dimensional analysis, ratio proportion, and formula or desired-over-have method. This article explores dimensional analysis in more detail.

Dimensional analysis, as the name represents, explores dimensions or units of measurements called factors. Commonly used in solving chemistry and physics problems, dimensional analysis is fast becoming the go-to method for dosage calculations in nursing and the medical profession.

One equation leads to the answer. Clinicians do not need to memorize this complicated formula. Chances for error are diminished, thus increasing the popularity of these dosing calculations. More than one approach can be used to build an equation using this factor-label method.
