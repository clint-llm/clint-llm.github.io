PDS or PG can be picked up on routine eye examination as the patients can be completely asymptomatic. PDS has a typical presentation, and the examining ophthalmologist should be aware of all the signs of the pathology. PG can be difficult to control and may require other treatment strategies like laser trabeculoplasty, laser iridotomy, or filtration surgery.
