The differential diagnosis of opioid use disorder includes many of the comorbid conditions that lead to chronic opioid use. Moreover, the differential diagnosis includes malingering and substance abuse disorder. The clinician must determine if the patient is using opioids for secondary gain, or are they using illegal controlled substances, prescription opioids, or street drugs. Chronic pain disorders, mental health disorders, substance abuse disorders, and various chronic injuries and diseases should be a part of the differential for opioid use disorder. Evaluation and treatment of the underlying medical condition responsible for opioid use are of the utmost importance.
