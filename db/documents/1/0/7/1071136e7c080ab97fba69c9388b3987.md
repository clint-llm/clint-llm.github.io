As KCl is used to increase body potassium content, its use with other drugs that achieve this outcome is contraindicated. Examples of such medications include potassium-sparing diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

Certain medical conditions involve hyperkalemia as part of their pathophysiologies. As such, KCl use in these cases is contraindicated. Examples of notable conditions that involve hyperkalemia include type IV renal tubular acidosis, chronic kidney disease, and leakage from cell breakdown (e.g., rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis syndrome, etc.).
