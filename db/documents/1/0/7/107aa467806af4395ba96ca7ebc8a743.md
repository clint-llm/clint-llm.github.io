Coordination of care between health care providers (i.e., the primary care provider, nurse practitioner) is essential for health care outcomes and patient safety. Patients who complain of dysphagia may be encountered in the outpatient clinic by a primary care physician. It is important to ask patients about new symptoms that they may be experiencing. When dysphagia is identified, referral to a gastroenterologist is usually necessary for evaluation. Focused history and examination by the primary care physician in addition to proper documentation can enhance care coordination. Evaluation by gastroenterology may reveal esophageal webs and rings that may require treatment with esophageal dilatation. These findings must be communicated back to the primary care physician. Also, the gastroenterologist should thoroughly explain his recommendations including the need for a repeat EGD or the need for a PPI.
