The patient should be evaluated for electrolyte abnormalities and acidosis. A chest x-ray should be done to evaluate for cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. An electrocardiogram should be checked to assess for narrow complex tachycardia. It usually presents with intermittent ventriculoatrial dissociation with irregular ventricular rates. If there is 1Â to 1 ventriculoatrial conduction, then the ventricular and atrial rate will be the same. It may be challenging to differentiate it from AV nodal reentry and AV reentry tachycardia.

Intravenous adenosine will cause ventriculoatrial dissociation in such cases and will show atrial nonparticipation in the arrhythmia. Very rarely, patients can have both JET and complete heart block. An echocardiogram shows cardiac dilation with systolic dysfunction related to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
