Metformin is generally regarded as safe and well-tolerated. Gastrointestinal side effects, including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, are very common and typically occur in up to 30% of patients taking metformin.

Occurring less frequently, some patients experience chest discomfort, headache, diaphoresis, hypoglycemia, weakness, and rhinitis. Decreased vitamin B12 levels are associated with long-term metformin and should be monitored, particularly in anemic or peripheral neuropathy patients. Supplementation of vitamin B12 may be necessary.

Metformin has a black box warning for lactic acidosis. This side effect is rare but serious and has an incident rate of 1Â in 30,000 patients.

**Drug Interactions**

- Specific drug interactions may increase the risk of developing lactic acidosis. These include but are not limited to bupropion, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, cephalexin, cimetidine, dolutegravir, ethanol, glycopyrrolate, iodinated contrast agents, lamotrigine, ranolazine, and topiramate.

- Other drug interactions can contribute to an increased hypoglycemic effect. Some of these drugs include androgens, alpha-lipoic acid, salicylates, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, quinolones, prothionamide, pegvisomant, and other antidiabetic agents. The recommendation is for clinicians to monitor patients who are concomitantly taking these medications with metformin.
