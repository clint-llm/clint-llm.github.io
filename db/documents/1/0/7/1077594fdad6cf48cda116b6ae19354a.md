Best practice guidelines for the management of annular pancreasÂ are lacking, and the treatment of AP is individualized based on presenting symptoms.

Division of the pancreatic annulus is not advised due to the increased incidence of postoperative complications like pancreatitis, pancreatic fistulas, and duodenal stenosis.

In contrast to children undergoing duodenal bypass procedures, Zyromski et al. highlighted the complex pancreaticobiliary pathology associated with AP in the adult population by describing that 20% of adult patients in their study group requiring surgical intervention underwent complex pancreaticobiliary surgical procedures which included pancreaticoduodenectomy, lateral pancreatojejunostomy, biliary/pancreatic sphincteroplasty, and bypass of the biliary system.
