Spontaneous intestinal perforation is potentially fatal and may present with various signs and symptoms. Timely diagnosis is of utmost importance. The most important diagnostic study is the abdominal plain film radiographs, showing free air in the abdomen. Pediatric surgery should be involved for further management.

The initial management includes cessation of enteral feedings, gastric decompression with a nasogastric tube, intravenous antibiotics, and total parenteral nutrition. Surgical management includes primary peritoneal drainage and laparotomy. Postoperative care includes parenteral nutrition and stoma care. Many of these patients require NICU hospitalization for a prolonged period.
