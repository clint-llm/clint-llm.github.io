Understanding the prehospital environment is extremely useful for emergency department clinicians. The scene of a traumatic injury can be chaotic, and understanding what the patient experienced before arriving in the emergency department can improve communication between the emergency department clinician and EMS, which may lead to more efficiency and improved care. The clinician must understand that delays often occur between the incident and arrival to the hospital. This understanding is critical in trauma resuscitation when time is of the essence. Extrication may be a traumatic process of its own, complicating the clinical picture.

EMS provides essential care in the prehospital setting. Providing that care while maintaining personal safety is imperative. EMTs and paramedics should also understand the importance of time during a trauma. Gaining access and extrication should be performed as quickly and efficiently as is safely possible. Ultimately, patients would never arrive in the emergency department without the dedication and hard work of EMS, who provide the critical intervention of extrication.
