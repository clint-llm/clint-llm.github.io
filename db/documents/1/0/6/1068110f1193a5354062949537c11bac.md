Due to leptomeningeal dissemination and possible extraneural metastasis, prognosis is poor. Approximately 32% of supratentorial embryonal tumors have metastases to the spine.

Several factors influence a poor prognosis, including delay in the diagnosis, poor general status, inadequate initial response to treatment.

Supratentorial high-grade glioma has a 12% five-year overall survival, which is significantly worse compared to embryonal tumors (pineoblastomas included) with a 78.5% five-year overall survival.
