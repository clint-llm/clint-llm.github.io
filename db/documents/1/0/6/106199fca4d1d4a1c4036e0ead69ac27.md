A Smith fracture is an eponym for an extraarticular fracture of the distal radius featuring a volar displacement or angulation of the distal fragment. It is also known as a reverse Colles fracture since the more common Colles fracture features a dorsal displacement of the distal fracture fragment. The Smith fracture was named by Irish surgeon Robert William Smith in 1847, who incidentally followed Abraham Colles as Professor of Surgery at Trinity College in Dublin and performed and published Collesâ€™ autopsy. However, this injury was first named for French Physician Jean-Gaspard-Blaise Goyrand (1746-1814) and is commonly known as a Goyrand fracture in French literature.
