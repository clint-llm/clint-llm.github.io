The patient is asked to undress from the waist down and cover themselves with a gown. Lying supine, transabdominal ultrasound is first performed. A full bladder is recommended as this displaces the adjacent bowel loops that would otherwise distort the image and create an acoustic window, illuminating the organs behind it. Once completed, the patient is asked to empty their bladder. A disinfected transvaginal ultrasound probe is prepared by placing lubricant gel within the tip of the probe cover and then inserting the probe into it. Careful attention should be made to eliminate any bubbles which may interfere with imaging quality as an artifact.
