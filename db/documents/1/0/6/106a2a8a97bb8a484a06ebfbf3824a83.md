One of the major limitations of minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is that it is not applicable when administering total intravenous anesthesia. Furthermore, in clinical practice, it is common to administer balanced anesthesia, including the use of neuromuscular blockade, intravenous anesthesia, and opioids. While these drugs tend to decrease MAC, they may not equally affect MAC-awake or MAC-amnesia. Therefore, MAC cannot be used as the sole measure of anesthetic effect.
