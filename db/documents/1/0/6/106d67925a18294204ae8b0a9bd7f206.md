The differential diagnosis of ACA depends on the clinical presentation and disease stage. Lesions on the lower extremities are often mistaken as vascular insufficiency (i.e., chronic venous or arterial insufficiency, superficial thrombophlebitis), cold injury, livedo reticularis, localized scleroderma, erysipelas, lymphedema, related to chronic use of potent topical corticosteroids or aging. Nodules may be confused with rheumatoid disease, gout, or erythema nodosum.
