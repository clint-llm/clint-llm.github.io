Postoperatively the patient should be started on low dose surface acting topical steroids in the form of 0.5% loteprednol 4 times per day for 1 week and then tapered over weekly intervals along with topical antibiotics 0.5% moxifloxacin 4 times for 20 days. The patient can also be started on oral analgesics 50 mg diclofenac two times for the initial 3 to 5 days to reduce the pain. The patient should be followed up at 1 month and reassessed for head posture and ocular deviation with a prism bar cover test.

The parents and patient should receive explanations regarding the need for regular follow-up and use of post medications. To prevent amblyopia, the parents must understand the need for patching or occlusion therapy in case of residual deviation, more importantly in children less than 8 years of age. The patient can be followed up at 3 months and 6 monthly intervals thereafter until the critical age for amblyopia has surpassed.
