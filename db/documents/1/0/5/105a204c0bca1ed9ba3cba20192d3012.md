Lichen striatus is an uncommon condition typically seen in children that presents as elevated pink papules that coalesce to form one or more linear, potentially scaly bands along the Blaschko lines. Lichen striatus is benign and self-resolving and does not require extensive investigations or treatment. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management recommendations for lichen striatus and stresses the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients affected by these skin lesions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of lichen striatus.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with lichen striatus.
- Explain the management considerations for lichen striatus.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis and management of lichen striatus and improve outcomes.
