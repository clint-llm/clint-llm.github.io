The high maternal temperature has a broad differential diagnosis that, in addition to antepartum infections, includes infections common to the general population. Following differential diagnoses should be considered in patients with prenatal infection:

- Pneumonia

- Cellulitis

- Urinary tract infections

- Pulmonary embolism

- Hyperthermic toxidromes

Genetic disorders should be considered in the differential of neonates born with suspected stigmata of congenital infections. Genetic counseling and testing should be advised to these families.
