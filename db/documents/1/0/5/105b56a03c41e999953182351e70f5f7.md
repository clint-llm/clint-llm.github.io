Avoidance of egg exposure is the most effective form of egg allergy management but is not equivalent to cure and may not always be feasible.  Unfortunately, efforts of avoiding exposure can pose a significant psychosocial stressor on both the child and the parents.

Children, wanting to socialize with their peers, may feel more isolated and withdrawn. Also, avoidance of eggs (or any food allergen) can place children at higher risk for nutritional deficiencies
