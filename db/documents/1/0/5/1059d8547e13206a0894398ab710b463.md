The endothelium is an active player in inflammatory processes and pathogenesis of vasculitis. Cytokine-mediated changes in the expression and function of adhesion molecules coupled with inappropriate activation of leukocytes and endothelial cells are the primary factors influencing the degree and location of vessel damage in vasculitis syndromes. Few mechanisms studied includeÂ pathogenic immune complex formation and deposition (mixed cryoglobulinemia, PAN), production of antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (in GPA, MPA, and Churg-Strauss syndrome), and pathogenic T lymphocyte responses and granuloma formation.
