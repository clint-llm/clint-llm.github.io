Nearly all patients affected by neuroacanthocytosis syndromes will experience the eventual onset of progressive abnormalities in movement (usually ataxia or hyperkinetic movements) with a neurocognitive decline and behavioral changes (see Table 3). Each specific disease, however, may present with symptoms and comorbidities unique to the disease. If the clinician possesses significant clinical suspicion of a neuroacanthocytosis syndrome, a thorough physical exam is required. This would include a complete physical and neurological examination, including reflexes, cranial nerves, gait, muscle strength, and mental status exams.

A clear history of progressive neurological, neuromuscular, or neuropsychiatric symptoms that are not consistent with other more common diseases plays an integral role in identifying these rare syndromes as possible diagnoses. The acquisition of prior records, family history, collateral history, and any prior genetic testing may prove instrumental in establishing accurate differential diagnoses and choosing clinically appropriate diagnostic modalities for further evaluation.
