HPNS is mainly characterized by hyperexcitability of the central nervous system (CNS) that involves neurological, and psychological abnormalities, showing changes in EEG recordings. HPNS should be differentiated from nitrogen narcosis, decompression sickness, and oxygen toxicity.

Tremor, the most characteristic symptom of HPNS, occurs at rest and on movement. Tremors begin at the distal extremities and may spread to the whole body. The frequency of tremors is 8 to 12 Hz.

Clinical presentation may be influenced by breathing gas mixture components, compression rates, and the hydrostatic pressure attained. For instance, adding a certain amount of nitrogen or hydrogen into the helium-oxygen breathing gas mixture ameliorates the signs and symptoms of HPNS.
