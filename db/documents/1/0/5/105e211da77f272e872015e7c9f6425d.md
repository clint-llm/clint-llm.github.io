While there are no significant complications from assessing for hearing loss in children, the primary concern is the risk of false results, both false positives and, more importantly, false negatives. A false positive, or a falsely abnormal test, may result in additional testing for the patient and added stress or anxiety for parents and caregivers, but ultimately will not result in long-term deficits for the patient. On the other hand, false negative, or falsely normal testing in a patient who truly does have hearing loss, may result in delayed diagnosis of hearing loss.

The associated social, intellectual, and developmental consequences of false-negative assessments may negatively affect the child's developmental potential. Complications of the hearing assessment, such as perforation of the tympanic membrane or injury to the ear canal, are rare and typically not long-term. These risks are presentÂ whenever the ear is instrumented. The presence of behavioral concerns during evaluation may increase the risk of any of the above complications and make the testing more challenging to perform. Behavioral issues may decrease the accuracy of results.
