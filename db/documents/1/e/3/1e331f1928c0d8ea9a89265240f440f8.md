This activity reviews the major indications, action, contraindications, and toxicity of sodium nitroprusside. This activity will also highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring) pertinent for the interprofessional healthcare team members in the management of patients with acute hypertensive crises and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of sodium nitroprusside.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of sodium nitroprusside.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for the toxicity of sodium nitroprusside.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to optimize the clinical use of sodium nitroprusside and improve patient outcomes.
