**Hypothyroidism**

Hypothyroidism during pregnancy is defined as elevated TSH levels above the population and trimester-specific reference range. When it is not available, an upper reference range above 4.0 mU/L should be used. Hypothyroidism during pregnancy can present as overt hypothyroidism defined as increased trimester-specific TSH and low free T4 levels or subclinical hypothyroidism defined as increased trimester specific TSH and normal free T4 levels.

**Hyperthyroidism**

Overt hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is characterized by decreased TSH and increased free T4 levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is characterized by decreased TSH and normal free T4 levels. It is important to remember transient subclinical hyperthyroidism can be seen during the first trimester of pregnancy due to adaption in thyroid physiology as discussed above. In gestational thyrotoxicosis, there is a physiological decrease in TSH levels during the first trimester due to hCG mediated stimulation of the TSH receptor. It peaks between 7 to 11 weeks of gestation.
