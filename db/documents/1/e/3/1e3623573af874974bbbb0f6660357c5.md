TED complicated with DON requires aggressive management. The treatment options include medical decompression using corticosteroids, radiotherapy, surgical decompression. There is no single best treatment option, and sometimes, even a combination of the above choices is recommended.

The clinician must perform a thorough clinical assessment and get all the baseline investigations, such as blood sugar, liver function tests, serum electrolytes, chest x-ray, electrocardiography, and blood pressure done prior to administering steroids.Â Inadequate response to IVMP is defined as persistent activity and disc edema even after 2 weeks of treatment.

A high number of cases with postoperative diplopia (66%) outranks its rate of success (90%). Alveolar nerve hypoesthesia, Cerebrospinal Fluid leak (CSF), and entropion are rare but possible complications.

In fat-centric TED complicated with DON, fat decompression alone, via transconjunctival or transcutaneous approach, can alleviate compression.
