The acronym "PAINT" can be used to memorize the causes of restrictive lung disease into pleural, alveolar, interstitial, neuromuscular, and thoracic cage abnormalities. Nevertheless, a more accurate division takes into account the pathogenetic mechanism.

Restrictive lung syndromes can be caused by:

- Pulmonary parenchyma diseases (intrinsic causes)

- Extrapulmonary diseases (extrinsic causes)

Intrinsic, or pulmonary causes, involve the lung parenchyma itself, while the extrinsic restrictive lung diseases originate from neuromuscular disorders, obesity, and other extra-parenchymal disorders.

**Pulmonary Parenchyma Diseases (Intrinsic Causes)**

Intrinsic restriction can be caused by intrapulmonary restriction due to inflammatory processes within the lung tissue by diseases categorized under interstitial lung diseases.

- Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)

- Non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)

- Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP)

- Sarcoidosis

- Acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP)

- Inorganic dust exposure such as silicosis, asbestosis, talc, pneumoconiosis, berylliosis, hard metal fibrosis, coal worker's pneumoconiosis, chemical worker's lung

- Organic dust exposure such as farmer's lung, bird fancier's lung, bagassosis, and mushroom worker's lung, humidifier lung, hot tub pneumonitis

- Hypersensitivity pneumonitis

- Systemic sclerosis

- Pulmonary vasculitis

- Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (formerly referred to as histiocytosis X)

- Medications such as nitrofurantoin, amiodarone, gold, phenytoin, thiazides, hydralazine, bleomycin, carmustine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate

- Radiation therapy

These conditions can be grouped into diseases that lead to an increased elastic return (e.g., diffuse infiltrative pneumopathies, and interstitial diseases), and diseases provoked by the occupation of alveolar spaces (e.g., pneumonia).

**Extrinsic or Extrapulmonary Diseases**

They can be a result of diseases of the chest wall, such as:

- Kyphoscoliosis

- Pleural conditions such as effusions, trapped lung, pleural scarring, chronic empyema, asbestosis

- Obesity

- Neuromuscular disorders like muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, polio, and phrenic neuropathies.

- Ascites

Extrapulmonary diseases can also be schematically grouped into pathologies that produce a decreased muscle tone of the respiratory pump (e.g., myopathies, and neurological deficits), deformations of the rib cage (e.g., kyphoscoliosis), and space occupation (e.g., pleural effusions, pneumothorax).

In brief, the causes of restrictive diseases can, therefore, be manifold. In some conditions, such as IPF, the causes are unknown. In this context, a challenge concerns the genetic factors that contribute to disease risk. Kaur et al.
