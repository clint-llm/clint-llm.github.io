The key to prenatal screening is patient education provided by an interprofessional team. Besides the general healthcare provider, the obstetrician, dietitian and prenatal nurse should educate the patient on the benefits of prenatal screening. In order for patients to make informed decisions about the wide number of test, they need to understand the limitations and benefits of the testing. The patient should also be informed about the risk of some prenatal tests like amniocentesisÂ or chorionic villus sampling. It is also important to educate the patient on the possibility of false positives and false negative results especially when testing for genetic or chromosomal disorders. Finally, genetic counselors should always be available when a diagnosis of a chromosomal disorder is diagnosed prenatally. The decision to continue with the pregnancy, adopt or choosing to end the pregnancy is not always easy and is best done with the help of genetic and mental health counselors.
