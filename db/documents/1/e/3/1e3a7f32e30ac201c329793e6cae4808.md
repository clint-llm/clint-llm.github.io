- Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is transmitted by transfusion of blood products. It causes severe disease in immunosuppressed individuals, including transplant recipients and neonates.

- A protozoan of the genus Babesia causes babesiosis, that is transmitted by ixodid tick vectors, which feed blood from the host. Babesia can be transmitted through a blood transfusion among humans. This zoonosis is endemic primarily in the upper Midwestern and Northeast United States. Babesia can replicate in the hostâ€™s erythrocytes that are called piroplasms due to their pear-shaped appearance within the red blood cells.

- Transfusion-transmitted leishmaniasis is a concern in endemic regions. Donors should be tested for leishmaniasis using immunofluorescent antibody test, PCR, ELISA, and leishmaniasis rapid test. Blood bank should be aware of the threat that imposes leishmania-contaminated blood and should routinely include a test to diagnose this infection.

- Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (a proteinopathy) usually associated with deposits of abnormal prion protein in the brain. Symptoms include behavioral and psychiatric problems. Blood transfusions can transmit this disease.

- Zika is an infectious disease caused by Zika virus, which has recently emerged as a cause of outbreaks in many countries. The clinical picture of Zika is variable from primarily mild exanthematic febrile disease to microcephaly and Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Mosquito of the Aedes type usually transmit Zika virus, but transmission through transfusion of blood products has been reported in French Polynesia and Brazil.

- A blood transfusion can transmit human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). It is a tick-borne rickettsial infectious disease. The clinical picture of anaplasmosis includes a headache, fever, and chills. The HGA diagnosis is made by the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes containing morulae in the peripheral smear. Samples from the recipient may test positive by PCR for Anaplasma phagocytophilum.

- Bacterial sepsis is one of the transfusion-transmitted diseases. The prevalence of bacterial contamination in red blood cells and platelets is approximately 1 in 3000 units transfused.
