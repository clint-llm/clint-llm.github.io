A collaborative team approach is essential in theÂ evaluation and management of testicular cancer. Excellent cure rates in testicular cancer are a testament to multimodal evaluation and treatment. Testicular cancer is exquisitely sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy and careful surgical management. The chain of care begins with the patient himself (noticing a palpable mass and seeking prompt medical evaluation), followed by prompt initiation of investigations by the primary care physician, followed by appropriate referrals to radiology, medical oncology, urology, and radiation oncology. Other services making a significant impact in the management of testicular cancer, both pre-treatment, and post-treatment, include physical therapy, pain medicine, pharmacists, nursing staff, and fertility counselors. Effective communication and utilization of expert skills with clearly defined responsibilities and care coordination amongst all the above individuals or services are required to enhance patient-centered care and to improve clinical outcomes.
