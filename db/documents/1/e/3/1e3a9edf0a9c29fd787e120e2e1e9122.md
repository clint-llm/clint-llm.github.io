Diagnosis of AVSD in fetal life or early neonatal period is essential in order to initiate appropriate medical treatment and to plan early surgical repair. In the contemporary era of advanced surgical techniques, the operative mortality of atrioventricular septal defect repair is low with excellent long term outcomes even in patients with Down syndrome.

Atrioventricular valve regurgitation is the most common reason for reoperation, thatâ€™s why it is mandatory to assess the imaging data before surgical repair and pay detailed attention to atrioventricular valve repair at the time of primary repair. Postoperatively patients should be followed regularly for atrioventricular valve regurgitation and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
