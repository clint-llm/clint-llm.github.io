Education is important in patients presenting with this disease, regarding awareness of the possibility of progression to significant motor weakness (i.e., paraplegia/quadriplegia) and accompanied by unremitting pain in atypical cases from the most severe side of the spectrum. Patients should be encouraged, and reassurance provided, as this is a limited disease process, with an expectation of complete or partial self-resolution.
