The pharyngeal muscles have many important implications regarding potential dysphagia, aspiration, and breathing problems following trauma, neurological diseases, muscular diseases, and surgical resection for benign and malignant processes. Patients undergoing significant resection of pharyngeal muscles during oncologic surgery, or those with neurological or muscular diseases should have an assessment for dysphagia and aspiration. Feeding tubes, dietary modifications, and swallowing therapy may be required. AnotherÂ example is the importance of preservation of the STP muscle during lateral pharyngoplasty for obstructive sleep apnea.
