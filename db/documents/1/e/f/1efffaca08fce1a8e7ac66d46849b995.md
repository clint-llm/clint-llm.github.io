Acute valproate toxicity results in dose-related and reversible hepatotoxicity. Stopping the drug therapy usually results in normalization of liver function abnormalities, but idiosyncratic fulminant hepatic failure and death have been reported with valproate toxicity.

Liver transplant in children with valproate-induced acute hepatic failure has decreased survival rates compared to liver transplant from other causes of drug-induced liver injury.

Cerebral edema may lead to herniation, prolonged CNS depression, and coma.

Valproate-related hyperammonemic encephalopathy can lead to confusion, lethargy, and increased seizure frequency. If valproate toxicity is untreated, it can progress to stupor, coma, and death.
