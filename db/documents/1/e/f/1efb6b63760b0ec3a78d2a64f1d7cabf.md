An enhanced recovery pathway is recommended for thoracic patients undergoing major resection, including pulmonary sleeve resection (PSR). A multidisciplinary approach to pain control and rehabilitation is key to achieving good surgical outcomes and decreasing complications.

Overall, sleeve lobectomy appears to be safe, effective, and an effective surgical option compared to pneumonectomy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) over the past 20 years. Most case series reported are from high-volume thoracic surgical centers with experienced thoracic surgeons and skilled peri-operative teams.
