HIV transmission occurs through the exchange of bodily fluids. The most common route of transmission is sexual through the anogenital mucosa. It penetrates into the body by binding its GP120 molecule to CD4 molecules on dendritic cells in the mucosa. After entering the body, the virus invades macrophages (by binding GP120 to the chemokine receptor CCR5 as well as CD4) or T cell (by binding GP120 to the chemokine receptor CXCR4 as well as CD4) depending on the virus. After penetrating the cell, viral RNA will get transcribed to DNA by the virus own Reverse transcriptase. The DNA is then included into the host's DNA with the use of the virus Integrase enzyme. This DNA later transcribes into new RNA molecules that will be enveloped by proteins that have been cleaved into form by the HIV protease. These forms mature virions that later bud out of the cell and go to infect other cells. Highlighted in bold are those places where HIV antiretroviral therapy acts on different parts of the viral cycle.
