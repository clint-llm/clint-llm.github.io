Trans-sphenoidal surgery is the therapeutic choice in cases of pituitary tumors that require surgical removal. It involves accessing the pituitary gland by passing surgical instruments through the nose and sphenoidal sinuses to reach the sella turcica. This trans-sphenoidal approach may also be an access method to perform surgeries on other structures apart from the pituitary, like in the case of a craniopharyngioma.
