The diagnosis and management of trigger thumb is with an interprofessional team that consists of the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, hand surgeon, plastic surgeon, orthopedic surgeon and physical therapist. Healthcare workers who initially see patients with a trigger thumb should refer them to a hand surgeon and let him/her make the decision about treatment. Practitioners base treatment of trigger thumb on severity and duration of symptoms. Initial treatment entails conservative management and adjunctive pain relief. In addition, physical therapy is a key part of treatment. If the patient fails to improve, surgery may be an option. A variety of procedures have been developed to treat trigger but not are always 100% successful. Residual pain, recurrence and limitation of thumb motion are seen in a fair number of patients, even after adequate physical therapy.
