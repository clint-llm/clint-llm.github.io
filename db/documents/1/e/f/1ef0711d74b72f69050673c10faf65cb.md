The ultrasound is a critical modality for the evaluation of the contents of the female pelvis. It allows ready and portable imaging of the uterus, ovaries, and other structures at a reasonable cost, without ionizing radiation or contrast. The absence of radiation is important since the ovaries are particularly sensitive to radiation. This activity outlines the technique, indications, and contraindications for performing pelvic ultrasound. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing pelvic ultrasound.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the indications for a pelvic ultrasound.
- Describe the technique involved in performing a pelvic ultrasound.
- Summarize the clinical significance of the pelvic ultrasound.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the use of pelvic ultrasound and improve patient outcomes.
