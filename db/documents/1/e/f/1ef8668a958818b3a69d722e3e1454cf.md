Astigmatism typically changes with age. In early childhood, from 0 to 4 years of age, the cornea is steep, there is a high degree of corneal astigmatism, and the most common axis is against the rule astigmatism. In the age group aged 4 to 18 years, the cornea flattens, astigmatism reduces, and small degrees of with the rule astigmatism is common. From 18 to 40 years, the cornea remains stable, and a small degree of with the rule astigmatism is common. From 40 years onwards, the cornea again steepens, and there is a shift in corneal astigmatism toward against the rule.

Further, astigmatism varies amongst different ethnic groups. An increased prevalence of with the rule astigmatism has been noted among Native Americans.

As a result of this, the pressure from the upper eyelid steepens the vertical cornea and flattens the horizontal cornea. Increased rates of change in astigmatism have been reported among Asian subjects. The tightness of the Asian eyelids and narrow palpebral fissures have been suggested as causes of the greater rates of astigmatism change. Kleisnstein et al. reported the prevalence of one or more diopters among 33.6% of Asian and 36.9% of Hispanic children.

A study from Brazil reported the prevalence of myopia to be 2.7%, with a high prevalence of astigmatism of 16% (1 D astigmatism). They found a predominance of against the rule astigmatism.
