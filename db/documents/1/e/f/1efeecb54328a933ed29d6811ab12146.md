Dumping syndrome is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes nurses, dietitians and pharmacist. The key is to be patient and consider dietary changes as the initial treatment of choice. Most cases of dumping syndrome are successfully treated with dietary adjustments. The suggested division of meals recommended is at least six times per day. Liquids should be withheld until 30 minutes after the meal. In addition, simple sugars and milk products should be avoided. Protein and fat calories should be increased to compensate for the decreased carbohydrate intake. Fiber-rich food is encouraged and has shown to promote a longer transit time in the bowel.

Medications and surgery to enhance persistalsis are not consistently effective and may even worsen the symptoms. Overall, most patients wil lbenefit from dietary changes but the response may take a few weeks or months.
