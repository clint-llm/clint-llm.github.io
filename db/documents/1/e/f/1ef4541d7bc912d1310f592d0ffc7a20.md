There are no absolute contraindications for a vasectomy. There are relative contraindications to an office vasectomy, but these can be mitigated by performing the vasectomy in the operating room. Contraindications to an office vasectomy include difficulty isolating the vas deferens during the scrotal exam at the initial evaluation, coagulopathy, previous scrotal surgery, chronic orchialgia, or testicular pathology such as a malignancy. Some patients may present an ethical dilemma to the physician (young age, no children, lack of agreement with the partner, current pregnancy, and possibility of fetal loss), which the physician will need to consider during a consultation. In most cases, we recommend that patients wait until after a successful delivery before doing a vasectomy if it is requested during a pregnancy.
