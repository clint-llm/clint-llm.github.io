Anatomic variations of deep (crural) fascia piercings have been widely identified for the superficial peroneal nerve.

In addition to variation in fascial layer piercings, the superficial peroneal nerve has also been shown to be located in various compartments of the leg rather than the normal lateral leg compartment. According to one study in India, 28.3% of cadaveric specimens were found to have the superficial peroneal nerve located in the anterior compartment.
