The typical incubation period for vivax malaria is 12 to 17 days, but relapse may occur up to 2 years later from dormant hypnozoites.P. vivax malaria tend to have paroxysmal fevers every approximately 42 to 56 hours.P. vivax is sometimes referred to as “tertian fever.” Anemia is the most common presenting symptom in adults and children living in P. vivax endemic areas. Unlike falciparum malaria, vivax malaria does not tend to cause sequestration; thus multi-system organ failure is less common. However, there are reports of cases of severe vivax malaria.
