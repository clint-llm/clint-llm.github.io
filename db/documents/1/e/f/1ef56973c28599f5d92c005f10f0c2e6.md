LPL deficiency is considered in young individuals with chylomicronemia and triglyceride levels of more than 2000 mg/dl. However, it has been found that such individuals do not necessarily have familial LPL deficiency. Instead, they may have one of the more common genetic disorders of triglyceride metabolism, like familial combined hyperlipidemia and monogenic familial hypertriglyceridemia, or there may be some secondary causes leading to hypertriglyceridemia.

Other than LPL deficiency, that constitutes 95.0 percent of primary monogenic variants of chylomicronemia, the differential diagnoses for primary monogenic chylomicronemia include:

- Familial apolipoprotein C- II deficiency - severe chylomicronemia in childhood or adolescence, constitutes 2.0 percent of monogenic variants.

- Familial apolipoprotein A-V deficiency-chylomicronemia in late adulthood constitutes 0.6 percent of monogenic variants.

- Familial lipase maturation factor 1 deficiency- chylomicronemia in late adulthood, constitutes 0.4 percent of monogenic variants.

- Familial glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein binding protein 1 deficiency-Chylomicronemia in late adulthood, constitutes 2.0 percent of monogenic variants.

The following secondary causes can also cause hypertriglyceridemia:

- Diabetes mellitus

- Paraproteinemia and lymphoproliferative disorders

- Alcohol use

- Estrogen therapy

- Drugs like selective serotonin receptor reuptake inhibitors, glucocorticoids, atypical antipsychotics, isotretinoin, certain antihypertensives
