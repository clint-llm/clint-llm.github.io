There are typically not any absolute contraindications to axillary lymphadenectomy. If a patient has recurrent breast disease or a second primary with a history of an axillary dissection on the same side, an axillary dissection is not usually performed for new cancer. In current times, most patients will be able to have a sentinel lymph node biopsy in place of a formal axillary dissection, except, of course, for the indications listed above. If a patient has distant metastasis, an axillary dissection is not usually necessary with evidence of grossly metastatic disease.
