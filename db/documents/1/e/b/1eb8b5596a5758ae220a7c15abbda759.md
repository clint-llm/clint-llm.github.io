In the absence ofÂ anemia or other concerning findings on history, physical, and laboratory testing, the patient should be reassured that a mildly elevated MCV is relatively common in healthy patients. If the patient regularly consumes alcohol, even if the other laboratory tests are unremarkable and no other evidence of liver disease is present, patients should be cautioned that their macrocytosis may be an early sign of excessive use. Patients should be counseled regarding any other abnormal findings on their presentation and diagnostic testing, as these will dictate further management strategies.
