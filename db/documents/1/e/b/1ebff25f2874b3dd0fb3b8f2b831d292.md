Uric acid nephrolithiasis is commonly seen with certain conditions like metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Increasing age, hot and dry environmental conditions, male sex, decreased urine volume and lower urinary pH are important risk factors for uric acid nephrolithiasis. Almost two-thirds of all uric acid kidney stones can be dissolved by increasing urinary pH and volume along with decreasing hyperuricosuria. This article reviews the evaluation and management of uric acid nephrolithiasis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical presentation and diagnosis of uric acid nephrolithiasis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of uric acid nephrolithiasis.
- Review the risk factors for developing uric acid nephrolithiasis.
