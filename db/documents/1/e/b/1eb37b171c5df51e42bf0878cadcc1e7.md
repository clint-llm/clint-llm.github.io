The diagnosis and management of popliteal artery aneurysms (PAA) require careful clinical acumen combined with diagnostic workup, including duplex ultrasound imaging and, at times, CT Angiography to better define the anatomy and determine the need for and options for repair. Multiple specialties collaborate to obtain the best patient outcomes, including emergency room physicians, primary care, internal medicine, radiology, and vascular surgery specialists. It is important that these aneurysms are diagnosed early and are not allowed to enlarge because of the risk of thrombosis and limb loss. It has been suggested that repair of larger aneurysms, performed either via open or endovascular approach, have poorer bypass patency rates when compared to smaller lesions.

Acceptable options for repair include open repair via a medial or posterior approach with bypass or interposition and endovascular repair. The decision of which approach for repair will be pursued is dictated by the anatomy of the aneurysm, the surgeon's preference, and patient factors. One meta-analysis of PAA repair reviewing papers comparing outcomes of posterior repair vs. medial repair suggests the superiority of the posterior approach for primary and secondary patency, aneurysm exclusion, and reduced need for reoperation. High-level evidence from randomized clinical trials is needed and would better define the relative benefits of the posterior approach over the medial approach in selected patients.
