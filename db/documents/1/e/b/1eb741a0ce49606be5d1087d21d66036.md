There are a few relative contraindications for the extended SMAS technique. Nicotine use, keloid formation, anticoagulation, previous deep plane rhytidectomy, and unrealistic expectations are some examples. Some patients might also benefit from other facelift techniques rather than the extended SMAS. For instance, patients with a youthful appearing midface should not be offered this procedure. It is important to assess psychiatric comorbidities, medical contraindications, and life situations that may lead to complications. Patients with a narcissistic personality disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, and other psychiatric disorders should seek psychiatric evaluation and treatment before the intervention or even avoid cosmetic procedures at all. The high rate of postoperative depression that occurs with facelifting means that patients with an history of depression should be counseled appropriately, and the procedure delayed if pharmacotherapy needs to be initiated preoperatively.
