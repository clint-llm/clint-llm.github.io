Treatment failure is frequently the result of noncompliance. Patients should be educated about the appropriate methods to apply the medications, including the amount to be used and the duration of treatment. They should also be made aware of the importance of re-treatment in 7-10 days. Additionally, patients and caregivers should be counseled that their infested bedding, clothing, and towels should be washed in hot water and dried on the high heat setting. Parents and children should be instructed to not share headgear such as hats and hair bows. Steps to help prevent body lice re-infestation after eradication include proper body hygiene, clothing changes weekly at a minimum, and proper clothing laundering. Sexual partners of patients with pubic lice should be treated as well.
