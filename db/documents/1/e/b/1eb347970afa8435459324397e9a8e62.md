Vertebral osteomyelitis is challenging to diagnose in its early stages and unfortunately can lead to significant morbidity in late stages. Systematic clinical workup and utilization of treatment algorithms are necessary to optimize clinical outcomes. This activity reviews etiology, evaluation, and management of vertebral osteomyelitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the patient population at risk for vertebral osteomyelitis.
- Describe the clinical evaluation of vertebral osteomyelitis.
- Review typical imaging findings in vertebral osteomyelitis.
- Explain why careful planning and discussion amongst interprofessional team members involved in the management of patients with vertebral osteomyelitis will improve outcomes.
