A common variant is occurring in 20% of the population. There is an accessory obturator artery that arises from the inferior epigastric artery and descends into the pelvis along the route of the pubic branch.

The corona mortis is a vascular variant of the anastomotic branch between the inferior epigastric and obturator vessels in the obturator canal. Another variation includes the accessory obturator artery arising from the external iliac artery and forming a connection with the obturator artery coming off of the internal iliac artery.

Such knowledge of variations of blood vessels in the abdomen is quite significant in the diagnostic and surgical procedures.
