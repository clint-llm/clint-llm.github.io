The optimal management of patients with myotonic dystrophy requires an interprofessional approach. Members of the team should include a primary care provider or pediatrician if onset is before 18 years of age, a neurologist, and a physiatrist. Supplementary medical providers may include a cardiologist or ophthalmologist for associated cardiac arrhythmias or early-onset cataracts, respectively. Appropriate consultants should be involved whenever necessary to manage and treat these patients optimally. Other team members include physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language pathologists to optimize function and assist with durable medical equipment evaluation. For pediatric patients, providing a structured and educational environment that is adapted to the intellectual disability with home health service staff well versed in neuroscience and rehabilitation is necessary. Unfortunately, at this time, there is no cure for DM, and treatment is aimed at monitoring and treating associated conditions while maximizing functional independence.  Consensus-based care recommendations for adults with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 2 should be followed to reduce morbidity and mortality.
