Systemic examination to look for signs of Valsalva – bradycardia, increased peripheral blood pressure, petechial hemorrhages of skin.

Rule out predisposing factors such as anemia, sickle cell disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, diabetes, and hypertension. The workup may include a hemogram with platelet count, peripheral blood smear, fasting blood sugar, blood pressure, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), hemoglobin electrophoresis to rule out sickle cell anemia

Ocular examination:

- Best-corrected visual acuity – serves to monitor patient, to plan intervention, intraocular pressure, pupillary reaction, and comprehensive ocular examination

- Subconjunctival hemorrhage

- Optical coherence tomography – to look for the location of bleed (sub-ILM/subhyaloid)

- Fundus fluorescein angiography to look for neovascularization and other retinal pathologies

- Fundus picture – to monitor the progression of the disease

- B scan ultrasonogram – in cases with breakthrough vitreous hemorrhage
