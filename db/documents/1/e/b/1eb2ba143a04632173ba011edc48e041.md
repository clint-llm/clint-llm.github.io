The pathophysiology is not entirely understood but is thought to be caused by the RANK/RANKL signaling pathway overexpression by osteoblast-like mononuclear stromal cells. This overexpression results in the transformation of monocytic pre-osteoclast cells to osteoclast cells. These osteoclasts start absorbing the bone resulting in osteolysis seen with these tumors.
