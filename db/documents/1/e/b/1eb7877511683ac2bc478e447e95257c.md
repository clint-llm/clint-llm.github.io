Immune-mediated transfusion reactions typically occur due to mismatch or incompatibility of the transfused product and the recipient. They include naturally occurring antibodies in the blood **recipient**(such as anti-A, anti-B which are typically responsible for acute hemolytic transfusion reactions) as well as antibodies made in response to foreign antigens (alloantibodies). These alloantibodies account for many reactions including mild allergic, febrile non-hemolytic, acute hemolytic and anaphylactic. Antibodies present in the blood**donor**can also cause reactions and are thought to be involved in transfusion-associated lung injury (TRALI).

Non-immunologic reactions are usually caused by the physical effects of blood components or the transmission of disease. Bacterial contamination, for example, results in septic transfusion reactions and is caused by bacterial and/or endotoxin contamination of a blood product. This may happen at the time of collection due to inadequate blood donor arm disinfection, the presence of bacteria in the donor’s circulation at the time of collection, or due to improper product handling after collection.

Transfusion reactions can also occur unrelated to factors intrinsic to the blood. Examples of these include transfusion-associated volume overload (TACO) and hypothermia.
