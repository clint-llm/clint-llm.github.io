Acute spinal cord injury occurs in two phases. The initial injury phase results from the initial insult to the cord; be it by direct mechanical damage or by disruption of blood vessels, axons or cells membranes. This initial insult triggers a pathophysiological cascade that takes place within seconds. The secondary injury phase results from the on-going endogenous triggers that cause tissue destruction. The secondary phase can further subdivide into the immediate (less than 2 hrs), early acute (less than 48 hrs), and subacute (less than 2 weeks) phases.
