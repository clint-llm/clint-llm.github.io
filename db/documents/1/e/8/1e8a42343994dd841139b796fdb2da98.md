Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis is an autoimmune disorder that leads to the gradual destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts resulting in periportal inflammation, cholestasis. Prolonged hepatic cholestasis subsequently leads to cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Primary biliary cholangitis is the most common cholestatic disease of middle-aged women in the United States.
