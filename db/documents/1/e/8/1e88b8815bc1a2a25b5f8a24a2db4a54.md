- Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte abnormality.

- Hyponatremia can range from an asymptomatic condition to a life-threatening condition.

- Hyponatremia can occur with hypovolemic or hypervolemic or euvolemic states.

- Common causes include diuretics, vomiting, diarrhea, congestive heart failure, renal, and liver disease.

- Degree, duration of hyponatremia, along with the severity of symptoms, determine the management algorithm and the rapidity to correct sodium.

- Do not correct the hyponatremia by more than 10 mEq/L to 12 mEq/L in 24 hours except in patients with severe symptoms and rapidly decreased sodium levels.

- Too rapid correction of the sodium levels can lead to the osmotic demyelinating syndrome.
