Life-threatening complications, e.g., thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, renal crisis, malignant hypertension, and respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension, can occur rarely. Cardiovascular complications include dilated cardiomyopathy, cardiac tamponade, coronary sclerosis with ischemic cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmias. Infections accelerate atherosclerosis, and malignancies can occur as side effects of immunosuppressives. Transverse myelitis is a rare central nervous system complication.
