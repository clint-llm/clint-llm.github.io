Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a progressive multiorgan fibrosing condition mainly caused by patients' exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents used in magnetic resonance imaging. This condition is primarily characterized by thickening of the skin and subcutaneous tissue in addition to systemic manifestations. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.
- Review the evaluation of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.
- Outline the management options available for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in patients with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and improving outcomes.
