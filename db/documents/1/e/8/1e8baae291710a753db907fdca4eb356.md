It is important to routinely monitor the patient's response, tolerability, and PBC disease progression. Also, continually evaluate Child-Pugh classification as dosage adjustments may be required with changes in classification. Monitoring liver function, including serum bilirubin, ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase, can be done to assess safety and efficacy.

If the patient has a biliary obstruction, evidence of worsening hepatic function indicating risk of decompensation, or liver-related adverse reactions (such as jaundice, worsening ascites, or PBC flare), OCA should be discontinued. Obeticholic acid has been associated with reductions in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Serum lipid levels should be monitored during treatment. International Normalized Ratio (INR) should be monitored for necessary dosage adjustments as OCA is associated with decreasing INR for patients taking warfarin.

Inhibitors of bile salt efflux pump (BSEP) should be avoided using OCA. However, if BSEP inhibitors are necessary, it is important to monitor serum transaminases and bilirubin. Obeticholic acid has the potential for increasing the exposure of CYP1A2 substrates. Hence the drug concentrations should be monitored in CYP1A2 substrates with narrow therapeutic indexes such as theophylline and tizanidine.
