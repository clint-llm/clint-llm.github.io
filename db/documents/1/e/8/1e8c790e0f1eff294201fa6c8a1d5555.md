The amino acids take part in certain common reactions like transamination followed by deamination for the production of ammonia. The amino group of amino acids is utilized for the formation of urea which is an excretory product for protein metabolism. The amino acid is transaminated to produce a molecule of glutamate. Glutamate is the one amino acid that undergoes oxidative deamination to liberate free ammonia for the synthesis of urea. Once free ammonia is formed in peripheral tissues, it must be transferred to the liver for the conversation to urea. This is carried out by the ‘glucose-alanine cycle”. In the glucose-alanine cycle, alanine which is formed by the transamination of pyruvate gets transported in the blood to the liver, where it is transaminated by alanine transaminase to pyruvate. The non-toxic storage and transport form of ammonia in the liver is glutamine. Ammonia is loaded via glutamine synthetase by the reaction, NH3 + glutamate → glutamine. It occurs in nearly all tissues of the body. Ammonia is unloaded via glutaminase by a reaction, glutamine --> NH3 + glutamate. It specifically occurs in the kidneys and intestine and in very low concentrations in the liver. This reaction is induced by acidosis.
