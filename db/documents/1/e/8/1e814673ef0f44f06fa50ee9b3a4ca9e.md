Congenital cystic eye, also known as anophthalmia with cyst, is a close differential diagnosis of microphthalmia with the cyst. Both the conditions may present with a clinically invisible globe. Therefore, appropriate investigations, as discussed above, must be performed to identify the presence of any ocular elements.

A sudden onset, rapidly progressive orbital mass may raise a suspicion of malignancy.Â Conditions such as a dermoid cyst, epidermoid cyst, arachnoid cyst, meningocele, orbital teratoma, primary optic nerve sheath cysts, and encephalocele may mimic the intra-orbital cyst associated with microphthalmia.
