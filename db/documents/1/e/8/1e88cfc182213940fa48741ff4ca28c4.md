Addison disease can develop into an adrenal crisis if not recognized and promptly treated. This can result in hypotension, shock, hypoglycemia, acute cardiovascular decompensation, and death. Patients with adrenal insufficiency are also at higher risk of death due to infections, cancer, and cardiovascular causes. Delayed recognition and treatment of hypoglycemia can cause neurologic consequences. A supraphysiologic glucocorticoid replacement can lead to the development of Cushing syndrome.
