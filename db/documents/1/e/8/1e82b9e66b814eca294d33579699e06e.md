In contrast to non-tunneled central venous catheters (CVCs), subcutaneously tunneled CVCs travel under the skin, away from the point of venous entry, before exiting the skin. Tunneled CVCs provide long-term intravenous access for parenteral nutrition, fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, chemotherapy, and hemodialysis. The placement of tunneled catheters allows patients to continue intravenous therapy upon their discharge from the hospital. This activity summarizes the indications and contraindications for tunneled CVCs and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in patient management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for tunneled central venous catheter access.
- Describe the contraindications to tunneled central venous catheter access.
- Summarize the potential complications of tunneled central venous catheter access.
- Outline a structured, interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients with vascular tunneled central venous catheter access.
