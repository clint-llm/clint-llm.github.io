The vestibular system consists of a paired set of organs located within the inner ears. Its unique anatomy consisting of multiple angles and turns can be described as labyrinthine, and thus the vestibular portion of the inner ear is often referred to as the labyrinth.

Each labyrinth consists of 5 organs: the superior, lateral, and posterior semicircular canals (SSC, LSC, and PSC, respectively), the utricle, and the saccule. The semicircular canals provide information about the rotational movements of the head.Â  The utricle and saccule provide information about linear movements of the head, with the five organs functioning together akin to a gyroscope to determine the position in space and relative movements of the head. The input from each labyrinth (right and left) corroborates one-another, and this information, as well as inputs from the visual and somatosensory systems, is processed in the brain balance centers. Lack of corroboration can lead to disequilibrium and vertigo.
