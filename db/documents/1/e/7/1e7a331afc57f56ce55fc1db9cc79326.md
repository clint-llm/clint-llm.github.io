Histopathological findings of pseudoappendicitis depend on the underlying pathological causality. Accordingly, in some extremely rare causalities of pseudoappendicitis, including Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD), despite the acute clinical presentation mimicking acute appendicitis, the histopathological finding is remarkable for histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis. Y. enterocolitica can be isolated from infected tissues, blood, stool, water, and almost any contaminated materials. It causes varying degrees of enteritis with inflammation of the mucosa of the GI tract. Histologic findings similar to salmonella and Shigella infections are usually present. Mesenteric lymph nodes will show signs of inflammation and adenitis. Y. enterocolitica bacteria can also be cultured from these sources.
