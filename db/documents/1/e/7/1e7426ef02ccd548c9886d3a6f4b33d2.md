The most likely objects to be found are pebbles, beads, nuts, chalk, and other small objects.

Animate objects that are likely to be found include the fly maggot and screw warms, with the former being more common and more aggressive.

Foreign bodies tend to lie in one of two locations in the nasal fossae: the floor of the inferior turbinate or anterior to the middle turbinate.

While some foreign bodies remain in the nasal cavity without causing any harm, other objects might startup to cause swelling of the mucosa, leading to mucosal erosions, ulceration, and epistaxis. This is usually seen with organic foreign bodies as they tend to absorb the water from the surrounding tissue and swell. These foreign bodies tend to turn into hard objects due to the accumulation of minerals and thus become a rhinolith, causing more harm.

Batteries can affect the nasal septum, causing septal perforation when they start producing a local inflammatory response associated with liquefactive necrosis.
