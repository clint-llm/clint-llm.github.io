Lymphocyte-depleted classic Hodgkin lymphoma is the rarest subtype of classic Hodgkin lymphoma, accounting for 1% to 1.5% of classic Hodgkin lymphoma cases in western countries. Most patients with lymphocyte-depleted classic Hodgkin lymphoma experience B symptoms such as unexplained fever more than 100.4 F (38 C), drenching night sweats, and unexplained loss of more than 10% of body weight over 6 months. The 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates are significantly lower in these patients than those with other subtypes of classic Hodgkin lymphoma. This activity describes the evaluation and management of lymphocyte-depleted classic Hodgkin lymphoma and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of lymphocyte-depleted classic Hodgkin lymphoma.
- Outline appropriate evaluation of lymphocyte-depleted classic Hodgkin lymphoma and proper referral.
- Review the management options available for lymphocyte-depleted classic Hodgkin lymphoma.
- Summarize some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes in patients with lymphocyte-depleted classic Hodgkin lymphoma.
