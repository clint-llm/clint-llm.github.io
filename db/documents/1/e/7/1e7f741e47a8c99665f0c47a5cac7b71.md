Tiotropium demonstrates poor absorption across both the respiratory alveolar capillaries and gastrointestinal tract; therefore, the risk of systemic medication toxicity is unlikely. Although high doses of tiotropium correlate with anticholinergic side effects, a literature review describes two incidences of high dose tiotropium inhalation/ingestion with unique outcomes. First, a case report of a 74-year-old male with accidental ingestion of a total of 90 mcg of powered tiotropium capsules caused refractory tachycardia that was managed by physostigmine, metoprolol tartrate, and diltiazem.
