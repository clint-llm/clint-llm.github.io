Liver function tests, including bilirubin, should be monitored as signs of liver toxicity and jaundice can appear as early as six days. Natalizumab should be immediately discontinued to prevent further damage.

Changes in a complete blood count (CBC) such as leukocytosis can be expectedÂ given the drug's mechanism of action. Additional signs and symptoms suggestive of new-onset, the underlying infectious process should prompt the physician for further workup.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of meningitis/encephalitis. If herpes encephalitis or meningitis occurs, natalizumab should be stopped, and appropriate treatment for herpes encephalitis or meningitis needs to be administered.

Patients presenting with eye symptoms, including redness, decreased visual acuity, or eye pain, should be referred for retinal screening for ARN.
