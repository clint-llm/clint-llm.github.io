Cyclobenzaprine is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant structurally related to tricyclic antidepressants. Cyclobenzaprine is a tricyclic amine salt that works in the central nervous system (CNS) as a depressant that reduces muscle hyperactivity. Clinical indications for cyclobenzaprine are described below.

**FDA-approved Indication**

- Cyclobenzaprine is approved as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy to relieve muscle spasms associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions for short-term use. Cyclobenzaprine should be used only for short periods (up to 2 or 3 weeks) because adequate evidence of effectiveness for more prolonged use is not available, and muscle spasms due to acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions are generally short-duration. Specific therapy for longer periods is seldom warranted.

**Off-label Clinical Uses**

- Fibromyalgia: American College of Rheumatology guidelines advise duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin as the first line therapy, but cyclobenzaprine may be useful for associated insomnia.

- Myofascial pain due to temporomandibular disorders

- A recent randomized controlled trial indicates that sublingual cyclobenzaprine decreases posttraumatic stress disorder(PTSD) symptoms and improves sleep and psychosocial function. However, this is preliminary evidence, and extensive research is still needed.
