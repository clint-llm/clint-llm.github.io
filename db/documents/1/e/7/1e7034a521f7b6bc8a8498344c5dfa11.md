The prevalence of cerebral aneurysms is estimated to be 3.2% to 4% in the general population without inherited risk factors. The most common age of presentation is between 30 and 60 (mean age of 50-years-old with a 1:1 gender ratio).

Approximately 85% of the cerebral aneurysms are located in the anterior circulation on the circle of Willis and the middle cerebral artery bifurcation. The most common sites of cerebral aneurysms are the junction of the anterior cerebral artery with the anterior communicating artery, the junction of the internal carotid artery with the posterior communicating artery, and the bifurcation of the middle cerebral artery. In the posterior circulation, the most common sites often include the distal basilar bifurcation (basilar tip), the junction of the basilar artery and the superior or anterior inferior cerebellar arteries, and the junction of the vertebral artery with the posterior inferior cerebellar artery.

A study of 284 patients with 322 saccular aortic aneurysms showed that 68% were found in the thoracic aorta, 24.2% in the abdominal aorta, 7.1% in the arch of the aorta, and 0.6% in the ascending aorta.
