A detailed history is a very important tool in the diagnosis of brucellosis. A dietary history is important in evaluating the possibility of brucellosis among individuals who live in non-endemic regions because the disease may be acquired through the ingestion of infected foods shipped from the endemic regions. Symptoms of brucellosis include a headache, cyclical fever, migratory arthralgia, myalgia, asthenia, anorexia, fatigue, malaise, weakness, sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and miscarriage. Brucella has been shown to cause sacroiliitis, osteomyelitis, spondylodiscitis, septic arthritis, and epidural abscess. Hepatic abscesses and granulomas occur in some cases. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and infection of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt have been reported. Respiratory symptoms, including a cough, dyspnea, and pleurisy, may occur; however, in most cases, chest radiography is normal, although focal abscesses, effusions, granulomas, and abscesses have occurred. Neurologic symptoms and Guillain-Barre syndrome have been associated with acute neurobrucellosis. Subarachnoid hemorrhage and myelitis also have been observed. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura has occurred. Death occurs in 2% of cases. Patients have been reported to have particularly foul-smelling perspiration that has been described as similar to mold or wet hay.

The physical examination is most often normal, although lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly may be found. Epididymo-orchitis can occur in association with brucellosis; a tender, swollen scrotum with erythema is present in these patients. Endocarditis may present with new or changing murmurs, and a pericardial rub is present in patients with pericarditis. Endocarditis rarely occurs; however, it is the most common cause of death from brucellosis. Aortic fistulas have also been documented. Neurologic findings vary according to the presentation of neurologic disease. In the case of meningitis, nuchal rigidity, Kerning sign, and Brudzinski sign are present. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) or brain abscess will manifest as papilledema, cranial nerve palsy, and focal neurologic deficits. Skin lesions such as maculopapular eruptions, erythema nodosum, abscesses, and panniculitis have been reported. Ocular findings can include uveitis, keratoconjunctivitis, iridocyclitis, optic neuritis, and cataracts.
