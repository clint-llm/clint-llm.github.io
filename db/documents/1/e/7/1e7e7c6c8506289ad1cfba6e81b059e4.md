The majority of mortalities due to aortic transection occur before hospital arrival. In-hospital mortality occurs in 18.8% of all patients. This is much higher in the non-operative managed patient (34.4%) versus the patient managed with endovascular repair (8.6%). Mortality related to the aortic injury itself is 6.5% forÂ all patients but only 2.5% after endovascular repair. Patients who die have been found to have high injury severity scores, which indicates severe polytrauma. Risk factors for aortic relate mortality include higher injury severity scores and higher grades of injury.
