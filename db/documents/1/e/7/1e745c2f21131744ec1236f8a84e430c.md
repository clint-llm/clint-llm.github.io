Individuals with elevated ESR values may not always have a medical condition that requires treatment. A result outside the usual range is not necessarily a cause for concern. Slightly higher levels can occur due to laboratory errors, pregnancy, menstruation, or advancing age. The ESR result may establish the presence of an inflammatory condition within the body, but the test is not specific to any disease process. It must be combined with other modalities to define an underlying ailment. The use of the ESR as a screening test in asymptomatic patients is limited due to the low sensitivity and specificity.

If there exists a suspicion of disease, the ESR may have some value as a “sickness index.” If the level is extremely elevated (>100 mm/hr), an apparent cause is usually present (malignancy, infection, temporal arteritis). If the level is mild to moderately elevated without obvious causes, additional testing may be added in an extensive search for the underlying disease process. There is no evidence to suggest that an elevated ESR not supported by an alarming history, physical, or other modalities should prompt an extensive workup or further invasive procedures.

Collaboration amongst the interprofessional team to correctly understand and interpret the ESR results is paramount to guide further diagnostics, therapeutics, and consultations for the overall benefit of the patient.
