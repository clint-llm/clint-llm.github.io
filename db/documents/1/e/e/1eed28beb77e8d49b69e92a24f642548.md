**Imaging Studies**

Brain imaging by CT or MRI is the most valuable modality used in the diagnosis of locked-in syndrome. The addition of CT or MR angiography can show vascular lesions causing the syndrome in cases of stroke or arterial dissection. The addition of contrast medium can delineate masses like tumors or abscesses and even active demyelinating lesions.

**Laboratory Examinations**

The cerebrospinal fluid examination (CSF) is usually necessary if no mass or vascular lesion is present on imaging. Results of the CSF analysis may reveal an infectious or autoimmune cause of the symptoms. The CSF should be sent for differential cell count, protein, glucose, staining, cultures, and CSF protein electrophoresis (IgG oligoclonal bands for MS).

**Electrophysiologic Studies**

Diagnosis of other demyelinating neuropathies such as ALS or GBS may be made via electromyography and nerve conduction studies, in conjunction with the physical examination.

Additionally, an EEG may be used in patients to evaluate brain activity, sleep-wake cycles, and attention.

**Blood Tests**

A metabolic panel should be ordered to evaluate any aberration in the sodium level, which may indicate a potential pontine myelinolysis. A history of rapid sodium correction may point to the cause of demyelination.

Hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia may cause comas similar to a locked-in state, so such electrolytes should be closely examined.
