Pudendal neuralgia should be suspected in all patients with a history of pelvic pain (especially perineal and genital) with or without concurrent sexual, bladder, or bowel symptoms. The onset of pain is usually subtle, except when caused by acute trauma. Pain is generally less in the morning and progresses throughout the day. Patients frequently complain of burning perineal pain and may also experience tingling, aching, stabbing, and electric shock-like discomfort.

Paroxysmal pain, associated with pruritus or located exclusively in the coccygeal, gluteal, hypogastric, or pubic areas (outside the sensory distribution area of the pudendal nerve) is unlikely to be from pudendal neuralgia.

Patients with pudendal neuralgia typically complain of chronic perineal pain, although they may also present with bowel, bladder, and sexual issues with or without discomfort. Pain distribution may be limited to the perineum or extensive and may include the vulva, vagina, clitoris, perineum, and rectum in females; the glans penis, scrotum, perineum, and rectum in males.

Areas affected by the sensory portion of the pudendal nerve include:

- The lower buttocks

- The area between the buttocks and genitals (perineum)

- The area around the anus and rectum

- The vulva, labia and clitoris in women

- The scrotum and penis in men

Other symptoms associated with pudendal neuralgia may include urinary frequency, urgency, symptoms mimicking interstitial cystitis, painful ejaculation, dyspareunia, painful nocturnal orgasms, and persistent sexual arousal.

**Physical Exam**

It is essential in both genders to test each pudendal nerve branch for pinprick sensation, including the glans/clitoris, posterior scrotum (labia), and posterior anal skin bilaterally.****One or more of the six branches may show hyperalgesia, hypoalgesia, or analgesia using the thigh as the control. A visual examination will rule out obvious lesions in the vulva, perineal, male genital, or rectal areas. The testis, epididymis, and vas deferens should be examined for tenderness. The rectal sphincter should be evaluated, and any tender regions of the anal canal (e.g., anal fissures) should be inspected. The pelvic floor and the obturator internus muscles should be softly palpated to evaluate for muscle spasms and tenderness. The prostate examination should include an evaluation of the expressed prostate secretions (EPS) or a post-massage urinalysis for inflammatory cells.

It is most important to palpate the pathway of the pudendal nerve medial to the ischial spine and over Alcock's canal. When palpation of these sites reproduces pain in the pudendal distribution, it indicates a "mid-nerve" injury called the Valleix phenomenon. It is considered diagnostic of a mid-nerve pudendal injury and is analogous to the Tinel sign in carpal tunnel syndrome.

In females, the examination is similar and includes gentle palpation of the uterus/ovaries. On bimanual examination, pressure should be placed over the T12 abdominal cutaneous and the iliohypogastric nerves, which may be misinterpreted as organ pain. Other peripheral mononeuropathies are common in pudendal neuropathy patients. These include abdominal cutaneous neuropathies, ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric neuropathies, the thoracolumbar junction syndrome or Maigne syndrome, neuropathies of the T12 posterior ramus, posterior cutaneous perforating nerve, middle cluneal neuropathies of S2, S3, S4, and neuropathy of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve-perineal branch. Genitofemoral, obturator, lateral primary cutaneous, and inferior cluneal neuropathies should also be considered.
