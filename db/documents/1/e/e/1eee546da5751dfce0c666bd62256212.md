Anteroposterior (AP), lateral, and skyline radiographs should be obtained when plica syndrome is suspected, although they will often be normal even if plica syndrome is the diagnosis.

The utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is controversial in the workup of plica syndrome. Plicae are only occasionally apparent on MRI. It is easier to see plica on MRI when an effusion is present. If plicae are apparent, they will appear with low-signal intensity. Symptomatic plicae can sometimes be differentiated from normal plicae on MRI because symptomatic plicae could appear thick and may have synovitis. This is opposed to normal plicae which may appear thin.

A literature review revealed multiple studies which looked at 492 knees and compared the sensitivity and specificity of physical exam compared to ultrasound and MRI. The results were that physical exam had a 90% sensitivity and 89% specificity, ultrasound had 90% sensitivity and 83% specificity, and MRI had 77% sensitivity and 58% specificity. The gold standard for diagnosis is arthroscopy.
