The internal urethral sphincter consists of smooth muscle and is continuous with the detrusor muscle of the bladder. The muscle fibers form a circular configuration that is continuous with the smooth muscle fibers of the bladder. Contraction of internal urethral sphincter stops the flow through the internal urethral orifice preventing the flow of urine from the bladder. The internal urethral sphincter is made of a layer of smooth muscle that is surrounded by striated muscle. The external urethral sphincter is composed of striated muscle and is located distally and inferiorly to the bladder neck in women between the vaginal orifice and clitoris. In the females, the external sphincter is also known as the urogenital sphincter and is made of 3 parts. The first part is circular. The second part is known as the urethral compressor muscle and passes anteriorly pass the urethra and connects to the ischial rami. The third part surrounds both the vagina and urethra and is known as the urethrovaginal sphincter. Contraction of urethrovaginal sphincter leads to constriction of both the urethra and vagina. In males, the external urethral sphincter is located at the same level as the membranous urethra and is composed of circular muscle fibers. The external urethral sphincter is continuous with the isthmus of the prostate. The external sphincter is located between the area of the pudendal canals below the pelvic diaphragm.
