The frequency of sudden cardiac death in athletes in the current literature is variable depending on the methodology used to gather the data. The general range reported is 1 in 40000 to 1 in 80000. However, there are reports with rates as high as 1 in 3000. The variability is likely due to the applied definition of sudden cardiac death. The various definitions range from those who experienced sudden cardiac death during exertion, rest, or survived resuscitation.

The most frequent cause of sudden death in athletes is hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and severe left ventricular hypertrophy, followed by other structural cardiac defects. HOCM is seen in roughly 1 in 500 people and is more common in men.

While structural cardiac defects are primarily genetic, anabolic steroid use is a known etiology of severe left ventricular hypertrophy. The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy is prominent among steroid users, but its significance varies depending on the specific agents used and various confounding factors.

Non-structural etiologies of sudden cardiac death largely involve ion channelopathies and electrical defects which induce potentially lethal arrhythmias. Congenital long QT syndrome is known to occur in approximately 1 in 2000 births.

The occurrence of isolated congenital illnesses is relatively low in the general population but, in summation, is common enough to be a viable health risk given the large number of young athletes.
