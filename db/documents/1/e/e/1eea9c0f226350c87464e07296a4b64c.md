The research concludes that there has been no antidote for treating methylene blue toxicity to be found to exist. If anaphylaxis does occur, the administration of methylene blue should stop immediately and promptly follow by supportive care, although severe anaphylactic shock with methylene blue is quite rare. Methylene blue may become potentially fatal when used in combination with medications that include or increase serotonin; this is because of its monoamine oxidase inhibiting properties. It may precipitate serotonin toxicity at doses of  >5 mg/kg.
