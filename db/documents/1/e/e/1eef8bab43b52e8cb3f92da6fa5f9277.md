A blowout fracture is an isolated fracture of the orbital walls without compromise of the orbital rims.

The trauma mechanism is a blunt, directed force that may be aimed at the eye without a pressure component toward the eye rim, leading to an increase of pressure inside the orbit with a fracture of the bony structures (a hydraulic mechanism). Alternatively, the trauma may be directed towards the orbital rim, which then leads to a bending of the orbital walls with consequent fracturing (buckling mechanism).

The mechanism of entrapment is more frequently referred to as a trapdoor in children, as opposed to the "blowout or punched-out" fracture present in adults.
