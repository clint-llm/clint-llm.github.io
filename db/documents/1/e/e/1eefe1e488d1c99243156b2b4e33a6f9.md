There will be 1.2 million cases of invasive cancer diagnosed in the United States this year. Half of those patients will receive radiation therapy as part of their treatment program. Serious radiation complications will occur in 5% of patients receiving radiation therapy. This represents about 30,000 cases per year.Often, delayed effects of radiation are diagnosed when an additional insult to the tissue such as surgery or trauma occurs. This activity explains how to properly evaluate radiation induced injury and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of radiation induced tissue injury.
- Review the presentation of patients with radiation induced tissue injury.
- Summarize the treatment options for radiation induced tissue injury.
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of radiation induced tissue injury.
