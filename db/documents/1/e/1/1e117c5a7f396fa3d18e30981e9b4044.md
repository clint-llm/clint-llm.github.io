All cutaneous angiofibromas are composed of a dermal proliferation of fibroblasts in a collagenous stroma with an increase in the number of thin-walled, dilated blood vessels. Collagen fibers are concentrically arranged around hair follicles and blood vessels. Elastic fibers can be decreased,Â and the epidermis can be atrophic. Fibroblasts can be stellate in shape and can be multinucleated. Immunohistochemistry for these cells will show positivity for factor XIIa and negative for S100 protein.
