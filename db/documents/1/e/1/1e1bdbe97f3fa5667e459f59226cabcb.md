For patients who are prescribed baclofen by mouth or via an intrathecal pump, the following information should be conveyed:

- Please take your medication as prescribed by your clinician.

- Do not abruptly stop taking baclofen if you have been on it for a prolonged period, as it can result in life-threatening withdrawal.

- If you have chronic kidney disease, you are at an increased risk of baclofen toxicity. Please talk with your physician about any questions regarding your prescription.

- Avoid the use of alcohol and other sedating drugs such as opioids or benzodiazepines unless prescribed by your physician.

- Baclofen toxicity can result in confusion, trouble breathing, seizures, and paralysis.

- Please call your physician or 911 if you or a family member is concerned about baclofen overdose or toxicity.

- If you have any thoughts of harming yourself, please contact your local suicide hotline.
