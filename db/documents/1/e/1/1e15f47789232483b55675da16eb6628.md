The treatment of infantile spasms should be initiated immediately once IS is suspected with hormonal therapy, antiseizure medications or dietary changes. The first line treatment for IS is hormonal therapy with corticotropin, ACTH.

Once ACTH therapy is begun the time to effectiveness with a cessation of spasms was 7 to 12 days.

ACTH treatment does have side effects to include “hypertension, immune suppression, infection, electrolyte imbalances, GI disturbances, ocular opacities, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cerebral atrophy and growth impairment.”

The other hormonal therapy that has potential effectiveness in IS treatment are corticosteroids. At this time as there is only probable effectiveness of corticosteroids the optimal preparation, dosing and duration has not been established.

An alternative initial treatment for IS after consideration of ACTH is vigabatrin. Vigabatrin is a GABA-transaminase inhibitor, this allows for increased GABA in the CNS.

In regards to comparison to ACTH, vigabatrin is inferior to ACTH when assessing short-term outcomes.

In cases that are refractory to initial treatment with ACTH or vigabatrin, clinicians may consider initiation of a ketogenic diet. The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet.

Surgical treatment is another consideration for refractory IS if a focal-cortical structural, metabolic abnormality or neurodevelopmental arrest/regression is noted.
