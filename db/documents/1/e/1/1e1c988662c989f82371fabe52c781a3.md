Amoxicillin-clavulanate is one of the most frequently used antimicrobials in emergency departments and primary care offices worldwide.  It is a combination of two different drugs: amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Amoxicillin is a penicillin derivative and has similar activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including Enterococcus species, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus species, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Corynebacterium diphtheria, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Borrelia species.  Furthermore, with the addition of clavulanic acid, the spectrum is increased to include all beta-lactamase-producing strains of the previously mentioned organisms and broadening the coverage to include methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus
aureus (MSSA), Neisseria species, Proteus species, Pasteurella multocida, and Capnocytophaga canimorsus, among others.
