The recognition of the appropriateÂ anatomy for this procedure is critical, as it is landmark-based. The supraorbital nerve is one of the terminal branches of the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal nerve divides into three branches: the ophthalmic nerve (V1), the maxillary nerve (V2), and the mandibular nerve (V3).

Beyond the orbital rim, the supraorbital nerve has two consistently present divisions: (1) a superficial (medial) division that passes over the frontalis muscle, providing sensory supply to the forehead skin and only to the anterior margin of the scalp; and (2) a deep (lateral) division that runs cephalad across the lateral forehead between the galea aponeurotica and the pericranium as the sensory nerve to the frontoparietal scalp.

Patients with supraorbital neuralgia present with pain, tenderness, hypoesthesia, and allodynia in the territory supplied by the affected nerve. Fractures of the orbital roof, blunt trauma to the face, tumors of the orbit, and tight swimming goggles and motorcycle helmets can cause supraorbital nerve entrapment.
