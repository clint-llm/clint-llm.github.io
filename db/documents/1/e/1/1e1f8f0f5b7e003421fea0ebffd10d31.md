The primary yolk sac, or primary umbilical vesicle, forms from proliferating hypoblast cells after implantation. The inner cell mass becomes a bilaminar embryonic disc as it divides into the hypoblast, which forms the yolk sac, and the epiblast, which forms the amnion. The yolk sac and amnion develop simultaneously, which begins during days 8 through 14 of embryogenesis. The yolk sac has a lining of extra-embryonic mesoderm. Part of yolk sac development involves the enlargement of the primary yolk sac, the sequestering and subsequent disappearance of a part of it, while the yolk sac that continues to develop is referred to as the secondary yolk sac. Although yolk sac formation starts during the second week of development, it cannot be visualized clinically on ultrasound until around five weeks post-fertilization (7 gestational weeks). Growth of the yolk sac progresses linearly during weeks 5 through 10 post-fertilization.

Gastrulation also occurs during the second week of development. This process involves the migration and invagination of blastocyst cells, ultimately transforming the bilaminar embryonic disc into a trilaminar embryonic disc. The end product is the formation of the three primary germ layers within the developing embryo.

The yolk sac disappears near the end of the first trimester and eventually becomes sonographically undetectable, beginning around the 14th week of gestation.
