Balloon valvuloplasty is a cardiac intervention to open up a stenotic or stiffed heart valves (e.g., aortic or mitral) using a catheter with a balloon on the tip. It is also known as balloon valvotomy. It is a less invasive procedure because it is done by inserting a catheter into the blood vessel from groin percutaneously rather than valve replacement with cardiothoracic surgical or other open methods. This activity reviews the indications of balloon valvuloplasty and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for balloon valvuloplasty.
- Describe the technique of balloon valvuloplasty.
- Recall the potential complications of balloon valvuloplasty.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the technique of balloon valvuloplasty and improve outcomes.
