The differential diagnosis for PVE:

- Native valve endocarditis: Patients usually have a similar clinical picture to PVE patients.

- Atrial myxoma: Patients present with constitutional symptoms secondary to cytokine release or may have systemic disease secondary to the embolic phenomenon.

- Libman-Sacks endocarditis: Patients are commonly asymptomatic and have a history suggestive of a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus SLE.

- Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE): Endocarditis caused by sterile vegetations deposition on cardiac valves. NBTE can be caused by pancreatic, lung, and colon tumors or from SLE or tuberculosis.

- Rheumatic fever: Jones criteria make the diagnosis: evidence of carditis, presence of polyarthritis, chorea, erythema marginatum, subcutaneous nodules, and evidence of preceding streptococcal infection.
