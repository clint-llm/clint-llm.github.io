The diagnosis and management of superior mesenteric artery syndrome is with an interprofessional team that consists of a general surgeon, radiologist, emergency department physician, and a gastroenterologist. However, the majority of patients with this syndrome initially present to the nurse practitioner and primary care provider. Because the symptoms are non-specific and there is no sensitive test, the diagnosis in most cases is delayed.Â  Management in the acute setting includes fluid resuscitation, electrolyte correction, total parenteral nutrition and nasogastric tube insertion for gastric decompression. The patient should be educated on lifestyle changes such as eating small meals and adopt the left lateral decubitus position to improve symptoms. Most patients need a dietary consult as significant weight loss is common. Unfortunately, conservative measures help very few patients and most patients eventually require surgery. Various types of surgical procedures are done but none produces satisfactory results. Because there are very few cases, there are no large trials. Anecdotal reports indicate mild improvement in the short term but the long term prognosis remains unknown. The quality of life of these patients is poor.
