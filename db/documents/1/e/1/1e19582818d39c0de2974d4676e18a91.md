Acromegaly is a rare disorder caused by excessive growth hormone production (GH), most commonly from an adenoma of the anterior pituitary gland. The resulting production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) causes the characteristic overgrowth of certain tissues resulting in coarsening of facial features, enlarging hands and feet, as well as effects on multiple systems throughout the body, including cardiovascular, rheumatologic, neurologic, pulmonary, neoplastic, and metabolic. Appropriate screening and early diagnosis are important to hinder associated morbidity and mortality related to the disease by treating early and the involvement of a multidisciplinary team.
