An interprofessional team that provides an integrated approach to patient care, particularly risk factor modification, can help achieve the best overall outcomes. Risk factor modifications are stressed to patients by primary care physicians daily. A patient referral to a registered dietician is likely to be beneficial. There should also be recommendations for routine aerobic exercise. It has become widely recognized that counseling on the importance of dietary changes should include a discussion of the Mediterranean diet,Â although continued studies will be beneficial.

Therefore, the specific requirements of a strict Mediterranean diet are not homogenous and may be difficult to recommend. There was a large scale literature review of the Mediterranean diet performed by Davis et al. that attempted to define the quantities of each food group and specific nutrients; results were as follows:

- Three to nine servings of vegetables

- One-half to two servings of fruit

- One to 13 servings of cereals

- Up to eight servings of olive oil daily

- Red wine daily in moderation

These recommendations resulted in approximately 2200 calories (9300 kJ) per day, with 37% as total fat, 18% as monounsaturated with 9% as saturated, and 33g of fiber per day.
