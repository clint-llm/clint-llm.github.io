The key complications of unstable angina include:

- Myocardial infarction (MI)

- Stroke

- Death

Evidence shows that patients with new-onset ST-segment elevation (more than 1 mm) have a 12-month rate of an MI or death of about 11%, compared to onlyÂ 7% for patients who only have isolated inversion of the T wave.

**Negative prognostic factors include:**

- Low ejection fraction

- Ongoing congestive heart failure (CHF)

- New or worsening MR

- Hemodynamic instability

- Sustained VT

- Recurrent episodes of angina despite maximal therapy
