Safely and accurately performing radionuclide cystography (RNC) depends on a multidisciplinary team. Nuclear medicine providers must thoroughly review each case to understand the indications and determine the adequate dosing. Nuclear medicine technicians and pharmacists are responsible for assuring the purity and activity of the radiopharmaceuticals that are employed; this is critical to not only ensure adequate gamma camera counts and diagnostic accuracy but also for patient safety. Institutional radiation safety officers are required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to oversee any institutions that use radioactive materials, and this is to ensure the safety of the patients, staff, and community.

Urologists, nephrologists, pediatricians, and family providers make up most providers that order RNC examinations; effective communication with these ordering providers ensures the appropriate use of RNC and provides key context for the diagnostician. Together this multidisciplinary team offers indispensable value in both safety and efficacy when performing RNC.
