Localized malignant tumors of the extremities, as well as the retroperitoneum, are divided into 4 stages according to the Enneking oncologic staging system: IA, IB, IIA, and IIB. Metastatic high-grade intra-compartmental tumors are characterized as stage IIIA tumors, and extra-compartmental malignant tumors are characterized as stage IIIB. These stages are dependent on the tumor classification according to the familiar TNM staging system. In addition to the tumor extent (T), lymph node involvement (N), and presence of metastasis (M), the staging of sarcomas is also dependent on its grade. TheÂ French or FNCLCC system is predominantly used to classify sarcomas based on the degree of differentiation, mitotic count, and presence/degree of tumor necrosis.
