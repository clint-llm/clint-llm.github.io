Patients should receive continuous monitoring for proper hygiene. The frequency of assisting patients will depend on the patient’s medical status and the patient’s cultural and personal beliefs. Some patients may have a preference for when to perform specific hygienic tasks. For example, patients who follow the Islamic religion may prefer to wash their bodies before praying and may prefer to use water over hand sanitizer when washing their hands.

It is also essential to monitor the patient when assisting with hygienic tasks. For example, bathing the patient is an opportunity to check for lesions or bed sores. Helping patients with elimination is an opportunity to monitor for signs of a Clostridium difficile infection. If a patient is suspected of having infectious diarrhea, they should undergo evaluation for the cause of infection and isolated to prevent infecting other patients. While assisting patients with hygienic tasks in the perineal area, the provider should wear a gown and gloves.

Using a combination of current evidenced-based practices, open communication with the patient to discover their preferences, and frequent monitoring will allow for the best care possible for the patient.
