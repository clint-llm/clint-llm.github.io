Acute toxicity from isoproterenol can cause a significant drop in blood pressure. In instances of accidental overdosage, as evidenced mainly by tachycardia or other arrhythmias, hypotension/hypertension, or angina, either reduce the rate of isoproterenol administration or discontinue the drug until the patient has stabilized. Pulse, respiration, ECG, and blood pressure should all be monitored regularly. There is no known reversal agent for humans, although studies are underway to look for agents to address toxicity.
