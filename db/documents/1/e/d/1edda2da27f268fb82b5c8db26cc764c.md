Exertional compartment syndrome is a commonly underdiagnosed entity that occurs secondary to elevated intra-compartmental pressures in the absence of trauma. There are two forms: chronic, in which symptoms such as pain or paresthesias typically resolve with rest, and acute, which is a surgical emergency in which unremitting symptoms may cause loss of limb. This activity describes the evaluation and management of exertional compartment syndrome and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the clinical manifestations of chronic exertional compartment syndrome.
- Explain the pathophysiology of exertional compartment syndrome.
- Describe the clinical presentation of acute exertional compartment syndrome.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure appropriate identification and treatment for a patient with exertional compartment syndrome.
