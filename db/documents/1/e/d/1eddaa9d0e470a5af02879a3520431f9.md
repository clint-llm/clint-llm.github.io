Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir has significant drug-drug interactions due to the ritonavir component. As a potent CYP3A inhibitor, ritonavir can increase the plasma concentrations of concomitant medications whose metabolism depends on CYP3A, increasing the risks of serious and life-threatening toxicities. In addition, ritonavir use is associated with hepatotoxicity, with reports of hepatitis, jaundice, and elevated transaminases. Patients taking nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, with or without other medications, should be monitored for drug-related toxicities.

In the event of an overdose of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, management entails general supportive measures, including close monitoring of vital signs and observation of clinical status. There is no antidote specifically for an overdose of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. The poison center should be contacted in the case of an overdose with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for recommendations by medical toxicologists.
