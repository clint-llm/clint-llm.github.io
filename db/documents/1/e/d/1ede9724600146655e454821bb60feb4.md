The most pertinent clinical conditions on the differential diagnosis for Muehrcke's nails are Beau's lines, Mees' lines, and Terry's nails. Beau's lines are perceptible and palpable deep grooved ridges running side-to-side on the fingernail or toenail secondary to a temporary delay in nail division in the nail matrix (e.g., infection, trauma).

In Terry's nails, most of the nail plate turns white (the lunula is obliterated) with a characteristic ground glass appearance secondary to a decrease in vascularity and an increase in connective tissue in the nail bed. They were originally associated with cirrhosis, but have now been documented in up to 25% of hospitalized patients in general.
