The injury occurs in three stages with a rapid loss of lordosis.  Both the upper and lower spines experience flexion in stage one. In stage two the spine assumes an S-shape while it begins to extend and eventually straighten to make the neck lordotic again. The final phase shows the entire spine in extension with an intense sheering force that causes compression of the facet joint capsules.
