Over the years, many types of tuning forks tests had been developed to assess hearing loss, but today only two have withstood the test of time: Rinne and Weber. Both of these tests are now routinely taught in medical schools and performed regularly to assess patients with hearing problems. Heinrich Adolph Rinne (1819-1868), a German otologist, proposed the test, which was subsequently named after him.

The Rinne test is used to evaluate hearing loss in one ear. The Rinne test differentiates sound transmitted through air conduction from those transmitted through bone conduction via the mastoid bone. By comparing air and bone conduction, it helps detect conductive hearing loss in one ear. A Rinne test should be performed in conjunction with a Weber test to help distinguish betweenÂ conductive hearing loss and sensorineural hearing loss.
