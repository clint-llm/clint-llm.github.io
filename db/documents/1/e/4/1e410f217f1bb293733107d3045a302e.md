Palmaris longus is one of the most variable muscles in the human body. The morphology of the palmaris longus includes several common and uncommon anatomical variants and may be symmetric or asymmetric when assessed in cadavers. The most commonly reported atypical morphology includes unilateral and bilateral congenital absence, double muscles, split tendons, digastric muscle bellies, and varied distal insertions. Commonly reported distal insertions include the palmar aponeurosis, flexor retinaculum, forearm fascia, hypothenar muscles/fascia, abductor pollicis brevis, metacarpophalangeal joints, tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris, and the pisiform and scaphoid bones.
