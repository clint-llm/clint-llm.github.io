As all of the above conditions are genetic or developmental in origin, there is no true way to deter or prevent these conditions from occurring. Patients that present with generalized developmental defects affecting the entire dentition should be evaluated for an underlying syndrome. Treatment of the above-listed conditions is likely symptomatically or esthetically driven. Patients presenting with these conditions should be encouraged to self-monitor for new or worsening symptoms that dental professionals will evaluate and treat.
