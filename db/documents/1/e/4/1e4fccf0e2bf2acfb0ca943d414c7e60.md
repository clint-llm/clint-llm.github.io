Oral hypoglycemic agents are often prescribed by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner or PA, endocrinologist, and internist. However, it is essential to educate the patient on changes in lifestyle, which include dietary modifications and exercise therapy. A dietary consult is often necessary to educate the patient on a healthy diet. The patient should be urged to join an exercise program, stop smoking, and lower body weight. No matter what oral hypoglycemic agent the clinician prescribes,Â interprofessional team members must know the adverse effects and potential for interaction with other medications, offer counsel on diet and exercise, and work collaboratively to optimize therapeutic results.
