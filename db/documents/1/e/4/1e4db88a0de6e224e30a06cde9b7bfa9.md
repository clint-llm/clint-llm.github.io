- Have a low threshold for evaluation of stroke, especially in at-risk populations.

- CVA symptoms depend on the ischemic area of the brain and, therefore, can vary.

- If thrombotic CVA is identified within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, consider alteplase.

- Be aware of presenting blood pressure. Depending on the type of CVA, blood pressure management recommendations may include aggressive blood pressure management or permissive hypertension.

- Start an anti-platelet agent within 24 hours of presentation.

- Consider other risk factor management, including addressing hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and cardiac arrhythmias that may increase the risk of vascular disease or the risk of a thrombotic event.

- Consider early and aggressive physical and occupational therapy after the onset of CVA.
