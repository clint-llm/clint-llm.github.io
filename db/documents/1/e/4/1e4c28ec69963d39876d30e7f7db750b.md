The greater occipital nerve transverses the upper neck and posterior occiput. Dysfunction of the nerve is associated with several commonly encountered headaches, including occipital neuralgia, cervicogenic, and cluster headache. This painful disorder can reduce the quality of life and is associated with a large socioeconomic burden. A greater occipital nerve block (GON-block) involves injecting an anesthetic near the greater occipital nerve to relieve pain and inflammation. This activity outlines how to perform the greater occipital nerve block procedure while utilizing relevant anatomy. This activity will discuss targeted outcomes as well as possible complications.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for an occipital nerve block.
- Describe the technique used to perform an occipital nerve block.
- Review alternative techniques for performing an occipital nerve block.
- Outline potential complications of occipital nerve blocks.
