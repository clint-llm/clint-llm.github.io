Diffuse injury pattern related to the isodosing concept. The tumor is treated as a spheroidal mass with the most number of target cells at the center. A boost dose is given to the center of the tumor. At incremental distances from the center of the tumor, the mass is less; therefore, the delivered dose is less. However, the patient develops an additional diffuse area of injury from beam divergence. Radiation wounds demonstrate a progressive, proliferative endarteritis. This is an obliterative process that destroys the tissue blood supply. The tissue ends up chronically hypoxic, fibrotic, and with a dearth of blood vessels.

There is no satisfactory treatment of radiation necrosis using conventional therapy.  It is difficult if not impossible to provide adequate nutrients and oxygen to the devascularized tissues. Surgical reconstruction of previously irradiated tissue has a very high failure rate due to poor healing.

The 3 Hs of previously irradiated tissue

- Hypoxia

- Hypovascularity

- Hypocellularity

Delayed radiation injury is a problem of impaired and inadequate tissue turnover and wound healing.
