A subdiaphragmatic abscessÂ frequently poses a diagnostic dilemma. These patients may exhibit non-specific signs and symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, and leukocytosis. While the physical exam may reveal that the patient has abdominal tenderness, it is difficult to know without proper imaging studies. While the general surgeon is almost always involved in the care of such patients, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a radiologist, intensivist, microbiologist, and infectious disease specialist. The nurses are also a vital member of the interprofessional group as they will monitor the patient's vital signs and assist with the education of the patient and family. In the postoperative period, the pharmacist will ensure that the patient is on the right analgesics, antiemetics, and appropriate antibiotics. Without providing a proper history, the radiologist may not be sure what to look for or what additional radiologic exams may be needed, so good communication within the team is paramount. To improve outcomes, prompt consultation with an interprofessional group of specialists is recommended.
