An interprofessional team of healthcare professionals is needed for the ideal treatment of PNES. This team will include clinicians (including NPs and PAs), specialists (such as a neurologist), nursing staff, pharmacists, and mental health professionals, all collaborating across disciplinary boundaries to achieve optimal patient outcomes. Team members should be consistent in communication with the patient and family members. Neurologic evaluation and referral to appropriate psychiatric or counseling resources is an ideal course.
