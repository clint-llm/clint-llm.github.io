Patients who are candidates for osseointegrated bone conduction prosthesis must meet audiometric and clinical criteria.

Audiometric criteria

- Pure tone audiometry demonstrating conductive or mix conductive hearing loss with bone conduction less than 45 dB hearing thresholds and a speech discrimination score equal to or greater than 60%.

- Single-sided deafness with a normal hearing threshold at the unaffected ear.

Medical indications

- Chronic ear disease (history of chronic otitis externa or otitis media suppurativa that are exacerbated by conventional hearing aids).

- Congenital or acquired malformations. This included patients with a defect such as external auditory atresia, canal exostosis, or canal osteoma and patients who have undergone otological surgery such as radical mastoidectomy or meatoplasty who have uncontrolled acoustic feedback with conventional hearing aids.

- Patients unable to withstand non-ideal features of hearing aids such as discomfort due to occlusion effect.

- Conductive hearing loss at the only functional ear.
