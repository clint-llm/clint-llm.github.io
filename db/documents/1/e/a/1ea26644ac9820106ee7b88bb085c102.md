Adenocarcinomas are diverse and can involve any part of the body. The management and treatment of adenocarcinoma differ depending on the primary site of disease as well as the stage of cancer. Prior to the initiation of any treatment, it is very important to first characterize the site and type of adenocarcinoma. Multidisciplinary care is of utmost importance with the involvement of pathology, radiology, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, and medical oncology along with the other allied health professionals. The earlier stages of cancer, where surgical resection is feasible, surgery offers the best opportunity for long term survival. Depending on the location, type, stage, as well as the performance status of the patient, different types of treatments, are proposed.

Curative intent treatments usually include surgery, neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of concurrent radiation and chemotherapy, hormonal therapy in breast and prostate cancer. Management also involves close follow up of these patients with repeat blood work, surveillance scans, and long term symptom and survivorship care. The palliative treatment is proposed in the incurable setting and usually involves systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapies to prolong the survival of the patient. There is a role for palliative radiation and surgery for symptom control.
