A detailed account of symptoms in each area should guide us to list possible diseases with autonomic dysfunction. Emphasis should be placed on obtaining a good history and comprehensive examination of cardiovascular, urinary, neurological, and sudomotor manifestations. A key feature of autonomic dysfunction, either orthostatic syncope or presyncope, should guide us to suspicion of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. In this scenario, the usual orthostatic symptoms consist of lightheadedness, visual blurring or tunnel vision, neckache (coat-hanger pain), nausea, palpitations, tremulousness, weakness, and dizziness. Other symptoms include exercise intolerance, fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, anxiety, hyperventilation, acral coldness or pain, concentration difficulty, and headaches.
