A winged scapula due to rhomboid palsy is one of the more common pathologies specific to this muscle group. Rhomboid palsy most often occurs due to damage to the dorsal scapular nerve. Entrapment of theÂ dorsal scapular nerve is the most frequent cause, but the exact location of entrapment has not been specified. Additionally, direct injury to the dorsal scapular nerve through trauma, anterior shoulder dislocation, or overuse of overhead athletics (i.e., baseball and volleyball) are other noted causes of rhomboid palsy.

Patients often present with medial scapular pain, abnormal shoulder motion, and neck, back, and shoulder discomfort. Physical examination often yields subtle lateral winging of the scapula. As a result of the subtle exam finding and the deep anatomic position of the rhomboids, rhomboid palsy is often underdiagnosed. EMG is most specific for the diagnosis of rhomboid palsy and shows prolonged muscle latency of the muscle action potential.
