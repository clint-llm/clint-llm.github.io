Wilhelm Röentgen, in 1895 used the mathematical "X" to describe unknown rays, which he discovered, and two weeks after his discovery, he produced the first X-ray image of his wife’s hand, the first medical imaging photo published in December 1895.

X-rays are the most common evaluation tool utilized in orthopedics to diagnose and evaluate various musculoskeletal diseases. Mobile X-ray units developed by Madam Marie Curie were the first to run to help military surgeons on the field. While radiography provides static images, fluoroscopy uses X-rays to obtain real-time images and videos of the internal structure and function of the patient. The first fluoroscope consisted of an X-ray tube and a fluorescent screen, but the major problem was producing images with sufficient brightness for visualization. Image intensifiers using optical lenses and mirrors for magnification were developed, and later a video camera and monitor were attached to allow better viewing.

The C-arm, an X-ray machine with a half-moon frame, was developed, making the X-ray machine mobile in all directions.

This article outlines basic fluoroscopy protocols to enable young surgeons to effectively and safely use radiation to their advantage.
