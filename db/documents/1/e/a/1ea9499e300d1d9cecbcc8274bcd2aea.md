When making decisions regarding KCl use, input from the entire interprofessional healthcare team can prove valuable. The ordering/prescribing clinician needs to determine whether oral or IV administration is warranted for the patient's condition. Pharmacists can assist with dosing, particularly at times when intravenous KCl infusion rates merit careful consideration. Nurses can monitor minute-to-minute vital signs and correlate them with symptom development. With these contributions, decisions regarding using KCl are possible, with higher chances for positive outcomes. These types of interprofessional efforts across disciplinary lines will drive better patient outcomes and minimize adverse events when using potassium chloride. [Level 5]
