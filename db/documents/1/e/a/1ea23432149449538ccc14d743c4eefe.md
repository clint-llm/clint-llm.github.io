Loss of intrinsic inotropy from impaired Bowditch effect has implications in conditions like cardiomyopathy, ischemia, and heart failure, leading to systolic dysfunction. The Bowditch phenomenon is often absent or even reversed in some cases of observed failing hearts that may be due to the failing heartsâ€™ inability to provide the required blood circulation for energy due to the impaired actin-myosin interaction process even during low-stress exercise leading to decreased contractile ability. This is described as a null or inverse staircase phenomenon.
