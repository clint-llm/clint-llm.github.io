Any intrinsic or extrinsic obstructive process along the afferent limb or at the distal anastomosis may result in afferent loop syndrome. Common causes include adhesions, which may result in compression or kinking of the afferent limb, internal hernia, scarring caused by previous ulceration of the gastrojejunostomy, and recurrent disease in patients who underwent surgery for cancer. Other causes may be related to intraluminal obstruction from foreign bodies, bezoars, or enteroliths.

Overall, longer afferent loops (greater than 30 to 40 cm) are more likely to volvulize or have compressive adhesions, resulting in entrapment or kinking. Retrocolic afferent loops are susceptible to internal herniation through mesocolic defects.

The various etiologies of afferent loop syndrome correlate with varying degrees of acuity or chronicity and may require different management. For example, obstruction from the recurrent disease would be expected to present with chronic onset of symptoms and may have treatment with endoscopic or percutaneous decompression followed by salvage chemoradiation**.**
