Itraconazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent; it has an active metabolite; hydroxyitraconazole. Itraconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis, which helps maintain the cell membrane in fungi. Lanosterol must undergo a 14 alpha-demethylation reaction to become ergosterol, which is catalyzed by fungal 14 alpha-demethylase. Itraconazole blocks this reaction by interacting with the fungal 14 alpha-demethylase substrate-binding site. This impaired ergosterol synthesis leads to fungal membrane abnormalities that increase permeability and disrupt fungal cell membrane integrity, changing membrane-bound enzyme activity.

The drug is metabolized extensively via the CYP450 system; specifically, itraconazole is a CYP3A4 substrate. It has a half-life of 34 to 42 hours. The drug is excreted in the urine (35%) feces (between 3 and 18%).
