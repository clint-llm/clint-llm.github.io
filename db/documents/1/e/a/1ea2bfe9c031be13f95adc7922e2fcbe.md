It is essential to educate patients on the risk factors for renal cell carcinoma, such as smoking, alcohol use, obesity, genetic, environmental exposure, and dialysis. Patients should be counseled to quit smoking and alcohol and increase their dietary intake of vegetables and fruits. These qualities have been shown to correlate with a lower rate of renal cancer.

Depending on the clinical and renal pathology, patients should be offered genetic counseling to the patient and their families, such as Von-Hippel Lindal, hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer, Birt-Hogg-Dub√© syndrome, and hereditary papillary renal carcinoma.

Workers who have been exposed to toxic agents such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon groups should be further evaluated. Still, studies have been inconclusive about the actual link of such exposure to RCC.

Literature has linked medications to renal cell carcinoma. A 2011 prospective study showed that the more prolonged use of non-aspirin NSAID correlates with increased RCC risk.
