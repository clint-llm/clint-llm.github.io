Despite advancing preparedness and mitigation strategies, disaster is inevitable and invariably affects human populations.

Responders are interdisciplinary and from a wide variety of backgrounds.Â  For each stakeholder to work together properly, disaster plans need to have minimal complexity and be widely applicable; the correct resources need to be activated; the incident command structure must be respected; and, responders need to be well trained. Once the immediate response phase has passed, efforts can shift towards recovery and return to the normal functioning of the affected community.
