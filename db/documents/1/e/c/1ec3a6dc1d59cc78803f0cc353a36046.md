The anterior fontanelle is found at the intersection of the sagittal, coronal, and frontal suture. It is the largest fontanelle of the skull, rhomboid-shaped, and measures approximately 4 cm anterior-posterior and 2.5 cm transverse. The anterior fontanelle closes between 12 and 18 months. The median age of closure is 13.8 months. The anterior fontanelle can provide clinical information, such as a sunken anterior fontanelle indicating dehydration. Bulging anterior fontanelle may indicate increased intracranial pressure or meningitis. Anterior fontanelle closure delay is seen in several conditions, most notably achondroplasia, Down syndrome, and congenital hypothyroidism.

The average age of coronal suture closure is 24 years; however, numerous diseases and factors may cause the dysfunction of a suture. The most common dysfunction is early closure or abnormal closure of a suture or group of sutures of the skull. Premature ossification of the sutures is referred to as craniosynostosis. Several types of craniosynostosis can develop, depending on which suture or combination of sutures have fused.
