The carotid sinus isÂ a dilation at the base of the internal carotid artery. The nearby carotid body is a fibrous-covered structure that rests posteriorly to the carotid bifurcation. The blood supply to carotid sinus is by the vasa vasorum vessels. It is an observable phenomenon that atherosclerotic plaques stimulate the release of serotonin and passes through vasa vasorum vessels of the carotid sinus. This serotonin then affects nerves leading to the dysfunction of baroreceptors.
