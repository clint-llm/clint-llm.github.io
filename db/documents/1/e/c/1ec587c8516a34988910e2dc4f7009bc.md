Adenomyomatosis is a benign condition that can present with right upper quadrant pain and is characterized by hyperplasia of the gallbladder wall mucosa and muscularis propria, with pathognomonic epithelial invaginations forming cystic pockets (Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses). Although this condition is benign, it can be difficult to distinguish from gallbladder cancer based on the diagnostic imaging findings, in which case it may be treated with cholecystectomy. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of adenomyomatosis and highlights the interprofessional team's role in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of adenomyomatosis.
- Explain how to diagnose adenomyomatosis.
- Identify the differential diagnosis for adenomyomatosis.
- Review the roles of various interprofessional teams in coordinating care to improve outcomes for patients with adenomyomatosis.
