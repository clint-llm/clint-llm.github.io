Cauliflower ear, also known as wrestler's ear or perichondrial hematoma, is a deformity caused by blunt trauma to the auricle. It occurs as blood accumulates in the pinna that can disrupt the blood supply of the healthy cartilage. The resulting fibrosis leads to the development of a cauliflower ear. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of the cauliflower ear and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the role of hematomas in the pathophysiology of cauliflower ear.
- Identify the history of direct trauma in patients with cauliflower ear.
- Summarize the use of emergency aspiration, compressive dressings, and surgery in the treatment of cauliflower ear.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to educate the patients on the adequate protection of the ear while playing contact sports for those at risk for developing cauliflower ear.
