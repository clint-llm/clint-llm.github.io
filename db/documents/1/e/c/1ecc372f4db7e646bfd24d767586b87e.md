Immunizations are administered with syringes and sterile needles. The size and type of syringe and needle depend on the vaccination, the specific route of administration, and clinician preference. Personal protective equipment, including medical gloves, is also required. Alcohol or other topical disinfectant is used to prepare the skin before vaccine administration. A simple band-aid, gauze, and tape can cover the site following administration.
