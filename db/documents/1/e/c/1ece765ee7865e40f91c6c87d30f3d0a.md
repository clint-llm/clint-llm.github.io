Differentiated thyroid carcinomas are among the cancers with one of the best survival rates. Historically they have been divided into papillary, follicular, and medullary types. Hurthle cell carcinoma of the thyroid was considered a subtype of follicular thyroid carcinoma. Still, in 2017 it was classified as a distinct tumor type considering the significant histological, clinical, and prognostic differences of the tumor. This activity reviews the clinical and histological features, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of Hurthle cell thyroid carcinoma. It highlights the role of interprofessional teams in recognizing the differences in Hurthle cell carcinoma compared to other differentiated thyroid carcinomas to evaluate and treat the patients with this tumor type properly.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Hurthle cell thyroid carcinomas.
- Review the histological characteristics of Hurthle cell carcinomas of the thyroid.
- Summarize management of Hurthle cell thyroid carcinoma.
- Explain how interprofessional team strategies can contribute to improved patient outcomes in cases of Hurthle cell thyroid carcinoma.
