There are two characteristic types of lesions:

- Transient erythematous patches

- Stable hyperkeratotic plaques

Usually, one of these two features predominates, and occasionally one is missing. Migratory-shaped red areas are the initial presenting sign. These lesions are usually well-demarcated with a map-like or annular appearance. They can coalesce into large figurate patches, which vary in shape, size, number, and position over minutes, hours, or, more often, days.

Some atypical features of the disease are thought to be a probable clinical variant of EKV. That includes lesions resembling erythema gyratum repens,GJB4.

The lesions of EKV have a predilection for the extensor aspects of the limbs, buttocks, and lateral trunk in an almost symmetric distribution.

Symptoms like a burning sensation in erythematous lesions may cause discomfort in some patients.
