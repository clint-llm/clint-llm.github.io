The lung veins sometimes referred to as the pulmonary veins, are blood vessels that transfer freshly oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atria of the heart. They are the only veins in the adult human body, which contain a higher percentage of oxygenation of blood than their arterial counterpart, the pulmonary arteries.

These veins are part of the pulmonary circulatory system and are an important part of the respiratory system. The pulmonary veins can become distended in congestive heart failure (left-sided heart failure), resulting in pulmonary edema. Damage to the pulmonary veins epithelial lining can cause pleural effusionsÂ as well. However, pleural effusions have numerous etiologies such as infection, liver disease, or lymphatic dysfunction that should rank higher on a differential list than pulmonary vein damage.
