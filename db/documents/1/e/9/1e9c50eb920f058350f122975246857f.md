Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive imaging technology used to obtain high-resolution cross-sectional images of the retina. The layers within the retina can be differentiated, and retinal thickness can be measured for early detection and diagnosis of retinal diseases. Patients may be given an OCT scan for monitoring the progression of the disease, verification, or rule out of suspected swelling in the retina, or used to evaluate medication side effects. OCT testing is a standard of care for the diagnosis, management, and treatment of most retinal conditions. The OCT uses light rays to measure retinal thickness and does no exhibit radiation or X-rays. There is no contact of the eye during the OCT scan. It does not hurt and is considered to generally be uncomfortable when patients are able to easily be positioned. OCT is commonly compared to ultrasound, with the exception that it uses light rather than sound.

Patients may be administered dilating eye drops to widen the pupil for imaging. Generally, the patient will sit in front of the OCT machine, and the patient's head will rest on the support.Â  It is important that the patient remained still and follow the instructions of the imager when directed to look a certain direction. Scanning of the eye can take anywhere from 5-10 minutes, where the patient will see some lights.
