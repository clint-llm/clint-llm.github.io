There is no longer any question that nicotine is harmful and affects almost every organ in the body. It is estimated that smoking accounts for 20% of deaths in the United States and the healthcare costs exceed $300 billion. Nicotine has been linked to many cancers and even second-hand exposure to nicotine can increase the risk of lung and heart disease. Despite four decades of urging the public to stop smoking, people continue to smoke in large numbers. There is no magic pill that can help people quit smoking. All the currently available medications to help people quit smoking are no better than a placebo. The big problem is that while many people can cease smoking for a few days, the urge to smoke is overwhelming and relapse rates are high. Clinicians, pharmacists, and nurses should assist in educating patients about the adverse effects of smoking. Today both family- and school-based smoking prevention programs are in operation, but scientific evidence reveals that their benefits are limited. The majority of patients simply quit smoking on their own but why they succeed in quitting smoking and others cannot is not well understood. All healthcare workers should continue to insist that patients not smoke - even if only a few percentage stop smoking; with nicotine addiction, even 1% is considered a success.
