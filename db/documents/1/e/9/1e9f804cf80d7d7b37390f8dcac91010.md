Opioid overdose, if left untreated, often leads to severe permanent disability or death by hypoxic organ injury. Chronic use can lead to tolerance and risk for the development of opioid use disorder. Illicit use can lead to a variety of complications, largely related to injection, including endocarditis and all of its associated complications, abscess, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, retained foreign bodies, compartment syndrome, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, and scar formation. Body packers delivering potent opioids for the illicit market can have packets undergo enteral rupture, resulting in sudden, often catastrophic, loss of respiratory drive.
