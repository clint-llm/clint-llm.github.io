Plain radiographs have limited prostate evaluation utility but are rarely used as a skeletal survey to assess or follow metastases.

Other imaging modalities like bone scan are used for assessing bone metastases, and CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are used to stage prostate cancer. MRI of the prostate is sensitive and specific for assessing prostate malignancy and local extension. CT/MRI is also used to place radiation seeds before radiotherapy.
