Two main variants of the vascular supply to the trapezius develop from three common sources.[4] The most common variant involves the main blood supply from the transverse cervical artery, with collateral supply from the dorsal scapular artery for the superior portion and the posterior intercostal arterial branches for the deep portions. A less common variant has more blood supply from the dorsal scapular artery.
