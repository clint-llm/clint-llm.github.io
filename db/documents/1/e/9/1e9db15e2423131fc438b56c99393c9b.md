Uterine inversion is a clinical diagnosis and should be suspected when the fundus is not palpable abdominally. The sudden onset of brisk vaginal bleeding leads to hemodynamic instability in the mother. Traditionally, the shock has been considered disproportionate to blood loss, which is possibly mediated by parasympathetic stimulation caused by the stretching of tissues. However, careful evaluation of the need for blood transfusion should be made because blood loss is massive and is greatly underestimated. The other symptoms are mainly severe lower abdominal pain with a strong bearing down sensation, though mostÂ women may not be able to complain due to severe shock. It may occur before or after placental detachment.
