Chorea Sydenham should be differentiated from other causes of chorea, including auto-immune, toxic, vascular, and genetic causes. The acuity of onset can assist in diagnosis. The toxic/vascular causes are more acute to sub-acute versus, and the genetic causes are more gradual. Family is typically, but not always, present in the latter.

Drugs including dopaminergic and anti-dopaminergic and cholinergic, among others, have been identified as the cause of chorea (often referred to as dyskinesia or tardive dyskinesia). Cocaine and amphetamines have also been implicated.

Stroke, demyelinating disease, hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia (diabetic striatopathy), liver disease, and anoxia should be included in the differential, although these typically present in older age.

Huntington's disease presents with a slow onset with a progressive course, is typically associated with family history and ultimately leads to dementia and death. Other, rarer genetic causes can be considered if clinical or familiar history is suggestive.
