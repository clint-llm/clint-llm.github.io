Epithelial downgrowth occurs when non-keratinized epithelial cells are introduced through a traumatic or surgical wound and proliferate in the inner structures of the eye.Â Proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms include implantation of the epithelium, the introduction of a conjunctival flap into a wound, or delayed closure of a wound.

Risk factors potentially allowing for epithelial entry and proliferation include multiple intraocular surgeries, delayed wound healing, gaping wound edges, wound fistulas, iris or vitreous incarceration, and full-thickness sutures.
