Some known causes of seizures include:

- Infectious: The most common cause of epilepsy in developing countries and overall worldwide is infectious. Infections can cause both acute seizures and epilepsy. Tuberculosis, neurocysticercosis, cerebral toxoplasmosis, HIV, cerebral malaria, SSPE, and bacterial and viral meningoencephalitis are some infections known to cause seizures.

- Structural: Any structural brain abnormality like stroke, trauma, infection, tumor, hippocampal sclerosis, AVM, postsurgical changes can increase the risk of seizures and epilepsy

- Metabolic: Several inherited enzymatic disorders like GLUT-1 deficiency, cerebral folate deficiency, among others can cause seizures. Other acquired disorders like electrolyte imbalance - hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, and hypoglycemia can cause seizures.

- Genetic/chromosomal abnormalities: Several chromosomal disorders (e.g., AKT3, Fragile X syndrome) and gene defects (e.g., Down's syndrome, Klinefelter's syndrome, Angelman syndrome) have been associated with epilepsy.

- Traumatic brain injury

- Hypoxic brain injury

Etiology cannot be determined in more than half of all individuals with epilepsy. A congenital anomaly is the most common known etiology in children, and head trauma in young adults. In people, age 35 to 64 years, head trauma, tumors, and vascular disorders are common causes. In people age 65 years or more, cerebrovascular disease, and degenerative disorders are the most commonly known etiologies.

Certain situations or triggers cause seizures. Some common triggers include tiredness and lack of sleep, stress, alcohol, fever, acute medical illness, hormonal changes, substance abuse, certain medications, bright and flashing lights, and medication noncompliance.
