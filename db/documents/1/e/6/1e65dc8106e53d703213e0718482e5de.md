Cervical traction has been used in a variety of cervical pathologies:

- Cervical disc disease

- Cervical spine fracture

- Facet joint dislocation

- Atlantoaxial subluxation

- Occipitocervical synopsis

- Spondylosis

- Radiculopathy

- Foraminal Stenosis

- Myofascial tightness

Overall, most published studies on cervical traction for spondylosis and myelopathy are of low quality and include a small number of participants. Among the few studies with adequate statistical power, there is no evidence on the long-term benefits of cervical traction, although many articles suggest a definitive temporary relief. Likewise, intermittent traction was not able to achieve a more favorable outcome than its sustained counterpart, despite its theory of increasing blood flow to the spine parenchyma and nerve roots. However, the practice of cervical traction in fractures and facet joint dislocations is important when used along with closed reduction and fixation. In cases of facet joint dislocation, failure of traction suggests the need for surgical intervention.
