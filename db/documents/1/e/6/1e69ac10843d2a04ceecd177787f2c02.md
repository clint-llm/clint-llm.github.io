**What is the function of HIPAA?**

In passing the law for HIPAA, Congress required the establishment of Federal standards to guarantee electronic protected health information security to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of health information that ensure the protection of individual’s health information while also granting access for health care providers, clearinghouses, and health plans for continued medical care.

- Standards for security were needed because of the growth in exchange of protected health information between covered entities and non-covered entities. These standards guarantee availability, integrity, and confidentiality of e-PHI. Also, there are State laws with strict guidelines that apply and overrules Federal security guidelines.

- The standards mandated in the Federal Security Rule protect individual's health information while permitting appropriate access to that information by health care providers, clearinghouses, and health insurance plans. The Security Rule establishes Federal standards to ensure the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of electronic protected health information. Also, state laws also provide more stringent standards that apply over and above Federal security standards.

- Health care providers, health plans, and business associates have a strong tradition of safeguarding private health information. However, in today’s world, the old system of paper records locked in cabinets is not enough anymore. With information broadly held and transmitted electronically, the rule provides clear national standards for the protection of electronic health information.
