Globally, prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in 112 countries and the leading cause of cancer death in 48 countries.

According to the American Cancer Society, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of male cancer-related deaths in the United States, with about 268,490 new cases and 34,500 annual deaths estimated for 2022. In addition, data from the National Cancer Institute indicates that an average American male has an 11% risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer over their lifetime (the incidence increasing with age) and a 2.5% overall risk (1 out of every 41) of dying from it.

The median age of death due to prostate cancer is 80 years, with 75% of prostate cancer-specific deaths occurring in those above 75 years. The lifetime risk of dying from prostate cancer varies in different ethnic groups, with Black men having the highest risk of 4.2%.

Being the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men (other than skin cancer) does raise concerns for prostate cancer screening; however, most cases are slow-growing and may never become clinically evident. Data has suggested that many men die of other causes before prostate cancer becomes advanced. Definitive treatment is expensive and carries significant morbidity, thus making routine screening somewhat controversial.
