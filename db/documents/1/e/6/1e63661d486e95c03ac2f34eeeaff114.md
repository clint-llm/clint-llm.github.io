On initial evaluation by their pediatrician, family medicine, or other primary care provider and there is clinical suspicion for a nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, a request for imaging is necessary to be placed in conjunction with a consult for an otolaryngology (ENT) referral. Further evaluation by ENT with nasal endoscopy and imaging evaluation is warranted. Interventional radiology or neuroendovascular surgery consult will also be prudent during the preoperative planning phase, as well as for preoperative embolization if necessary.
