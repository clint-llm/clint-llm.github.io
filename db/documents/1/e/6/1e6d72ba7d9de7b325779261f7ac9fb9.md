Typhoid fever is an enteric fever characterized by systemic illness along with abdominal pain and fever in a "step-ladder" pattern. The organism responsible for enteric fever is Salmonella typhi. Other serotypes, Salmonella paratyphi (A, B, C), also cause similar syndromes but with less clinically significant disease. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of typhoid fever and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology and epidemiology of typhoid fever.
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of typhoid fever.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for typhoid fever.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care for typhoid fever and to improve outcomes.
