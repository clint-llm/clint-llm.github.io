Cauda equina syndrome and conus medullaris syndrome are rare, with an estimated prevalence of 1-3 in 100,000 people per year and the annual incidence is between 1.5 to 3.4 per million people.

Approximately 55% of spinal lesions are extradural and involve the vertebral column. Of these, 20% are located in the lumbar spine. The most common lesion is metastasis. Approximately 40% of spinal lesions are intradural extramedullary. These are generally meningiomas of the dural sac or schwannomas and neurofibromas of the nerve roots. Approximately 5% of spinal lesions are intramedullary (greater than 90% are ependymoma or astrocytoma of varying histological grades and less than 2% are metastases).
