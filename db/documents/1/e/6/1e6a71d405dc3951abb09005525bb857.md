Imaging studies are not necessary unless a complication is suspected, for example, a ruptured sinus and pneumocephalus, or if it is a recurrent case. The preferred imaging study is a sinus CT with contrast. Evaluation by an otolaryngologist with nasal endoscopy can also be diagnostic. Evaluation and imaging studies can reveal causative abnormal anatomies such as polyps, air-fluid levels, and fractures.
