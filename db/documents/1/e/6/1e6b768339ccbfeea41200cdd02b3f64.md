The superior mesenteric vein and splenic vein join to form the portal vein. It drains into the liver before dividing into the right and left portal veins into both lobes, respectively. It supplies two-thirds of the blood to the liver. The portal vein pressure is typically between 1 to 4 millimeters of mercury more than the hepatic vein pressure. ThisÂ pressure differential enables blood to flow through the liver into the systemic circulation. The veins do not have valves. If there is resistance to the flow of blood in the portal venous tract, it leads to elevated portal venous pressure, as seen in portal hypertension. The resistance occurs more commonly within the liver, as seen in cirrhosis, but it can also be pre-hepatic or post-hepatic.

The increased resistance within the organ can be due to structural or dynamic changes. Structural changes are due to the alteration of hepatic microcirculation. Such alteration results from hepatic stellate cell activation and the resultant fibrosis, regenerative nodules, vascular occlusion, and angiogenesis. The increased production of endothelial vasoconstrictors and decreased release of vasodilators within the liver leads to sinusoidal constriction.
