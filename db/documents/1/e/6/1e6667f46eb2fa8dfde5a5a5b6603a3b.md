In X-linked CGD; Cystic fibrosis, hyper IgE syndrome, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, glutathione synthetase deficiency, and Crohn disease are required to come to mind in the differential diagnosis.

In X-linked hyper IgM; PI3K- delta syndrome, ataxia telangiectasis, Nijmegen breakage syndrome, and CVID (common variable immune deficiency) are required to be considered in the differential diagnosis. Moreover, congenital rubella, use of phenytoin, T-cell leukemia, lymphoma, and nephrotic syndrome can also mimic X-linked hyper IgM syndrome.

In XLP; Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, CVID, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, Griscelli syndrome ve X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) deficiency are required to be considered in the differential diagnosis. Moreover, the entire male patients with severe infectious mononucleosis or lymphoma are required to be tested in terms of XLP.

In WAS; Eczema such as Omenn syndrome, IPEX, Netherton syndrome, hyper IgE syndrome, DOCK8 deficiency, and atopic dermatitis are required to be considered in the differential diagnosis.

In X-SCID, Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) deficiency with autosomal recessive transition causing other T-B + NK- SCID phenotype is required to be considered in the differential diagnosis. The differentiation of both diseases can be performed only by genetic tests.

In XLA; Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infants, CVID, autosomal recessive agammaglobulinemia, and combined agammaglobulinemia with T and B-cell failure should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

In IPEX; IPEX-like syndromes, neonatal enteropathy, eosinophilic enteropathies, severe combined immune deficiencies are required to be considered in the differential diagnosis.
