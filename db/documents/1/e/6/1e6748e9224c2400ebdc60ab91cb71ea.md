Vertebral osteomyelitis (additionally referred to as spinal osteomyelitis or spondylodiskitis) accounts for approximately 3% to 5% of all cases of osteomyelitis annually.

Vertebral osteomyelitis may develop after trauma to the spine, post-surgery, or via hematogeneous spread from an adjacent site. If left untreated, this infection has high morbidity leading to spinal deformity, paraplegia, and even death.
