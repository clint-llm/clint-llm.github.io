The mainstay treatment of blepharoconjunctivitis is meticulous lid hygiene. Using a warm eye compress for 5 to 10 minutes helps to soften the oil within the Meibomian glands. Massaging of the lid margin can help express the oil, and an eyelash scrub with a mild shampoo removes debris. Lid hygiene should be encouraged even after an acute exacerbation has subsided due to the chronic nature of the condition. Artificial tears can aid dry eye symptoms, and topical steroids are useful in the acute inflammatory stages of an exacerbation. Topical antibiotics should be offered if lid hygiene alone is insufficient, and this proves to be especially effective if the cause is bacterial such as in a staphylococcal infection.

Supplementation of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids to alleviate dry eye symptoms is a controversial topic. A recent Cochrane systematic review suggested that Omega-3 supplementation may be beneficial but states the quality of evidence is poor.
