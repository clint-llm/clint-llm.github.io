The pectinate line is an important anatomic landmark, as it is where the blood supply, lymphatics, and nerves differ based on being above or below the pectinate line.

Above the pectinate line, the superior rectal artery is responsible for blood supply. It is a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery. Venous drainage above the pectinate line drains to the portal venous system, which is critical to differentiate from below the pectinate line. The internal hemorrhoidal plexus drains to the superior rectal vein. This blood continues to drain through the inferior mesenteric vein, splenic vein, and then to the portal vein.

Below the pectinate line, the inferior rectal arteries and veins supply and drain the muscles and skin around the anus. The inferior rectal vessels are branches from the internal pudendal vessels. Blood from this area below the pectinate line ultimately drains to the caval venous system. Blood from the external hemorrhoidal plexus drains into the inferior rectal vein. The blood continues to drain to the internal pudendal vein, internal iliac vein, common iliac vein, and lastly, to the inferior vena cava.
