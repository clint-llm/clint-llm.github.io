Since retinal arteriolar narrowing and sheathing with pigmentary retinal degeneration can be seen in siderosis bulbi, it closely resembles retinitis pigmentosa (RP). In rare cases of suspected unilateral RP, the diagnosis clinches more towards ocular siderosis when associated with a typical history of trauma with iron FB.

Mydriasis, with a hypersensitive response to 0.1% pilocarpine in ocular siderosis, mimics Adie’s tonic pupil and must be considered as one of the differential diagnoses. The pathophysiology of Adie’s tonic pupil involves damage to the ciliary ganglion, as opposed to the local parasympathetic neuropathy in siderosis bulbi.
