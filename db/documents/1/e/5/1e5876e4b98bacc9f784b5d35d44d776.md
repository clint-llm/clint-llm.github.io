The radiocarpal joint has the ability to flex, extend, and deviate both radially and ulnarly. The musculature that allows for radiocarpal extension receives innervation from the radial nerve and its motor branches, the deep branch of the radial nerve, and the posterior interosseous nerve.

The innervation of the muscles responsible for wrist flexion is via a combination of the ulnar nerve, the median nerve, and the anterior interosseous nerve (a branch of the median nerve).

The radiocarpal joint also serves as a portion of the floor of the carpal tunnel which the median nerve travels through as it continues distally to provide sensory and motor innervation to the hand.

Cutaneous innervation of the skin overlying the radiocarpal joint originates from multiple sources. The lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve provides innervation to the proximal area of cutaneous sensory innervation on the volar and dorsal surface. The distal dorsal surface is innervated by the superficial branch of the radial nerve, and volar distal region receives nerve supply from the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve.
