Research has shown that the postganglionic fibers emerging from the otic ganglion innervate the blood vessels of the circle of Willis as opposed to the vertebrobasilar artery. The postganglionic otic fibers also terminate in the cavernous sinus via the external sphenoid nerve and form the cavernous sinus plexus with the sympathetic fibers from the internal carotid artery.

A recent study clearly shows that blood vessels in the lower lip exclusively receive innervation by postganglionic fibers originating from the otic ganglion, and not from the pterygopalatine ganglion.
