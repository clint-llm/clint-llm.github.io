As most patients who present after kratom ingestion will be first seen in the emergency department, it is best for healthcare providers to focus on the patient's airway, breathing, circulation, neurologic status, and initial resuscitation. As these patients can present with various symptoms, it is best to keep a broad differential. Labwork and imaging can vary based on the patient's presentation. If kratom toxicity is suspected or known, it is also important, and likely beneficial, for providers to consult their local poison control center early in managing patients to help guide monitoring, treatment, and patient disposition.

Monitoring and screening patients for suspected kratom ingestion can be complex, as it does not typically appear on routine drug screens. Presentation for kratom toxicity can differ as symptoms can vary based on the dose administered and whether the ingested kratom had been altered. The physiologic effects of kratom ingestion vary based on a dose-dependent manner, where stimulant-like effects are seen at lower doses, and opioid-like effects are seen at higher doses.

After kratom ingestion, a patient's presenting symptoms can help guide evaluation, work-up, and management. Multiple organ systems are at risk for potential injury after kratom ingestion. Multiple case studies have found a range of toxicities and issues due to kratom, including hepatotoxicity, seizure and coma, lung injury, kidney injury, and cardiotoxicity.
