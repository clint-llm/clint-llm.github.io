Open-angle glaucoma is often asymptomatic in its early stages, therefore, a thorough and comprehensive history and exam can be instrumental in detecting the disease early. Early changes in OAG involves a loss of peripheral vision that the patient is usually not aware of until 40% of their nerve fibers have been compromised, only then do they start to notice having "tunnel vision." Elderly patients might give clues in their history to their loss of peripheral vision by admitting to difficulties driving or running into objects around the home more frequently. In a primary care setting, patients with the aforementioned risk factors should undergo direct ophthalmoscopy in order to visualize the optic disc. Visualization of the optic disc can provide reliable diagnostic information as it often shows changes before the visual field deficits are symptomatic. OAG is often bilateral and the two optic discs can be compared to one another as a useful metric, but the damage can also be asymmetric as well. Primary care physicians should refer patients with the aforementioned risk factors, clinical findings, or symptoms suggestive of glaucoma to an ophthalmologist.

- A previous ocular history such as the history of eye pain or redness, headaches, uveitis, diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, vascular occlusions, or multicolored halos

- African-American Race

- Refractive error

- Chronic use of topical or systemic corticosteroids

- Ocular surgery like photocoagulation or refractive procedures, cataract surgery, glaucoma surgery, and systemic surgery/ medications

- Head or ocular trauma

- Take certain medications such as hypertensive medications that may influence IOP or systemic/topical steroids

- Medical history of diabetes mellitus, migraine headaches, hypertension, vasospasm, cardiovascular disease, breathlessness, cardiac arrhythmia

- Family history (e.g., first-degree relative with glaucoma, especially significant if this is a sibling) that would place them at a greater risk of developing open-angle glaucoma.

- Old medical documentation of IOP, optic disc, visual field, and others.
