Osteoradionecrosis of the jaw (ORN) is a late effect of radiation therapy. Previously irradiated head and neck tissues become hypovascular and hypoxic. If in the irradiated field, the mandible may develop aseptic, avascular necrosis which can lead to infection, tooth loss, and even pathological fracture of the jaw. Osteoradionecrosis is rarely seen in patients who received less than 6000 centiGrays (cGy) of radiation and may occur years or even decades after radiation is concluded.
