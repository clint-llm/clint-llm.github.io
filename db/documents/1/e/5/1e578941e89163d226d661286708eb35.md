Pierre-Robin sequence (PRS) poses numerous challenges to anesthesiologists.

- The airway is challenging to ventilate and intubate due to craniofacial dysmorphology in patients with PRS. Maintaining a seal for ventilation using a facemask can be challenging due to facial deformities. Direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation tend to be very difficult during infancy but generally become more manageable with age and (mandibular) growth.

- Post-operatively, PRS patients can develop spontaneous airway collapse. It may occur due to pre-existing airway obstruction, possible Obstructive Sleep Apnea, chronic hypoxia, and increased opioid sensitivity. It can be diagnosed with paradoxical breathing patterns, intercostal indrawing, subcostal, sternal recession, and tracheal tug.

- Neonates with PRS are increasingly sensitive to opioids- Infants who develop OSA due to glossoptosis have escalated opioid sensitivity due to the upregulation of opioid receptors in the brainstem. Patients with severe obstruction have significantly fewer opioid requirements and careful dose adjustments.

- Feeding difficulties, swallowing disorders, and co-existing gastroesophageal reflux are frequently complicated by bronchial microaspirations and pulmonary infections.

- PRS patients are generally malnourished and have a high frequency of failure to thrive due to difficulties with feeding and airway.
