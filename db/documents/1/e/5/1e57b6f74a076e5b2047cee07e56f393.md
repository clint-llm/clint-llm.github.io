Skill assessment is a vital part of simulation with deliberate practice exercises and task trainer usage, often being included in most simulation educational activities.

However, images and videos of simulation activities are typical of multiple learners, and the use of such records can only occur if the individual learner’s participation can be isolated from the other learners. If this is not possible without hindering the integrity of the educational activity, the learner would have the ability to review the image and/or video under FERPA guidelines (FERPA 34 CFR § 99.3).
