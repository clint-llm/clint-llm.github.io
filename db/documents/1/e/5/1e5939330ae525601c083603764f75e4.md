Culdocentesis was, at one point, a mainstay for evaluation and diagnosis of hemoperitoneum that has largely been replaced by the increasing availability of high-resolution transvaginal sonography.

It is especially important for diagnosis in countries with high rates of anemia and pelvic inflammatory disease as these can mimic ruptured ectopic pregnancy.

Culdocentesis can also aid in the diagnosis of other conditions. For example, acute salpingitis or pelvic inflammatory disease will have purulent peritoneal fluid. Endometrioma will have "chocolate" fluid, and ascitic fluid return can be seen in other conditions.

A negative culdocentesis (clear or serosanguinous fluid return) does not exclude ectopic pregnancy, and repeat culdocentesis at a later time may be needed. A negative culdocentesis supports that there is likely no hemoperitoneum and the fallopian tube is intact, but an ectopic pregnancy may still exist that has not yet ruptured. Almost 25% to 30% of ectopic pregnancies result in hemoperitoneum and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality of reproductive-aged women.
