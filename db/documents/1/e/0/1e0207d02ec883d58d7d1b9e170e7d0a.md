The diagnosis is based on the clinicopathologic correlation; it cannot be made only by clinical signs and symptoms alone. A 4-mm-deep punch biopsy specimen should be submitted for horizontal sectioning and hematoxylin-eosin staining.Â The best biopsy site is an active, symptomatic hair-bearing area with perifollicular erythema and perifollicular scale located at the margin of a bare patch with a positive anagen pull test.
