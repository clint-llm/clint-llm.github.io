GLAD lesions occur as a result of trauma to the shoulder joint. The classic pattern from the original series involves forced shoulder adduction from a position of abduction and external rotation. Typically this occurred in the context of a fall onto the outstretched arm. The humeral head being forced into the glenoid and then continuing to move with a shear force damaging the cartilage, with the energy of the injury finally tearing the superficial labral fibers, would fit with that mechanism.

In modern practice, the use of MRI, MRI arthrography (MRA), and arthroscopy to evaluate shoulder injury has increased recognition of this injury. As such, the associated types of injury mechanisms have grown, and anterior glenohumeral instability is now a recognized injury mechanism.
