The intercostal vessels travel along with the intercostal nerves in the intercostal space of each rib. These are the anterior and posterior intercostal arteries. The anterior intercostal arteries are branches of the internal thoracic artery and supply the upper six intercostal spaces. After this point, the internal thoracic artery ends by dividing into the superior epigastric artery and musculophrenic artery. The musculophrenic artery is the supply artery for the remaining anterior intercostal branches, which then anastomose with the posterior intercostal arteries arising from the thoracic aorta. The right posterior intercostal arteries are longer than those on the left due to the aorta's position to the left of the vertebral column.
