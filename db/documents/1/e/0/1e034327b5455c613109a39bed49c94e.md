“Lepidopterism” refers to various skin & systemic reactions secondary to contact with moth and butterfly larvae or caterpillars (order Lepidoptera). It is worth noting that the adult forms of moths and butterflies do not sting. “Erucism,” taken from the Latin derivation “eruca” (caterpillar) refers to the cutaneous reactions only.

Of the nearly 165000 species, only about 150 are clinically significant.  In the United States, there are over 50 species with the ability to inflict a painful sting.  The most dangerous is the puss caterpillar, also known as asp caterpillar (Megalopyge opercularis), which is the larvae of the flannel moth, found in the Southeast of North America.  These are most plentiful in late spring through early fall.

Toxicity manifests from sting reactions, toxic dermatitis (hypersensitivity reactions), and lonomism, which is a potentially fatal hemorrhagic dyscrasia.

Overall, most of the sting and hypersensitivity reactions are benign and resolve spontaneously, requiring nothing more than symptomatic treatment.  The notable exception is lonomism, which requires emergency evaluation and inpatient consultation/admission.  Prompt medical intervention is crucial in minimizing the morbidity and mortality of this disease, particularly acute kidney injury (AKI).
