The diagnosis of shigellosis often takes time and the infection can be confused with many other abdominal conditions. Thus, it is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, infectious disease specialist, gastroenterologist, and internist. The mainstay of treatment of shigellosis is medical management and includes fluid and electrolyte management. The antibiotic regimen used for the treatment can be divided into two groups based on age. Antibiotic susceptibility testing is highly recommended before as resistance to the drugs is common and may vary regionally. Immunity can occur after shigella infection and appears to be serotype-specific.

Because there is no vaccine to prevent the infection, the primary care provider and nurse specialist play a vital role in educating the public about prevention. This includes handwashing with soap and water, maintaining good personal hygiene, drinking boiled water while traveling and avoiding sexual contact with a patient with a recent diagnosis of shigellosis.

The outlook for patients who are treated promptly is good but delays in treatment can lead to multiorgan failure and even death.
