Multidetector computed tomography can be used in the workup of cardiomyopathy to differentiate between ischemic and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy etiology.

In HCM, the cardiac CT can help to identify the hypertrophy of the myocardium and the LVOT obstruction and can show an enlarged mitral valve, systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve or mitral valve regurgitation. The CCT can demonstrate the asymmetry of the ventricular hypertrophy.

In restrictive cardiomyopathy, the CCT can show the ventricular sizes similar to the echocardiogram findings. In cardiac sarcoidosis, the cardiac CT with contrast can demonstrate the enhancement of the sub-epicardiumÂ with global or regional hypokinesia.

In ARVC, cardiac CT can show dilation of the right ventricle with a bulging appearance in the right ventricular wall due to fatty deposition.
