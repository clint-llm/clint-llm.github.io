The most important thing for the patient with a distal humerus fracture to understand is that a vast majority of distal humerus fractures require surgical fixation. They should be counseled that fractures involving a major joint can have lasting effects, even when the fracture is healed. Setting realistic expectations for the patient early can help reduce the chance of confusion. Also, the practitioner should counselÂ the patient early on that ROM needs to be started early postoperatively to have the best chance of a successful outcome. The patient should expect to be seen and evaluated in the acute setting, undergo necessary imaging, and be stabilized in a temporary splint. In the setting of a closed, isolated fracture, the patient may be discharged home with a short-term follow-up to discuss surgical treatment with an orthopedic surgeon. In the setting of an open fracture or a patient with multiple injuries, in-patient admission may be indicated. In the setting of concurrent nerve injury, the patient should be counseled that it could potentially be a result of a nerve palsy due to acute swelling and/or traction and may be temporary. They should also be counseled that nerve injuries of this type can take months to resolve, and immediate intervention is rarely indicated.
