The limitation of blood flow through the coronary arteries that cause malfunctioning of the myocardium is known as coronary artery disease. Atherosclerosis is the number one cause of coronary artery disease. Other etiologies include Prinzmetal angina and congenital coronary artery abnormalities. Stenosis of the branches of the LMCA or the RCA affects specific locations of the heart. For instance, the LAD stenosis affects the anterior septum, anterior free base, and mid-cavity level, apical segments of the septum, and anterior wall. The LCx stenosis affects the anterolateral wall and the inferolateral wall. The posterior descending coronary artery stenosis affects the inferior septum and inferior free wall. These pathologies can be seen via multiple diagnostic modules such as EKG, CT angiogram, and echocardiogram, although the diagnostic gold standard test is invasive coronary angiography.

Complete occlusion of the LAD results in an anterior wall MI, which appears as ST elevations in the precordial leads (V1-V4). Occlusion of the LCx results in a lateral wall MI, which appears as ST elevations in leads I, aVL, and V5-6. Occlusion of the PDA results in an inferior infarction, which would appear in leads II, III, and aVF.
