All striated muscles of the trunk and limbs (including the deltoid) derive from the segmented paraxial mesoderm. The paraxial mesoderm divides into bilaterally paired blocks called somites. Myogenic precursors (myoblasts) in the somites migrate toward developing limb buds during the fifth week of development. These myoblasts condense into two major groups in the dorsal and ventral limb buds: dorsal and ventral muscle mass. The deltoid develops from the dorsal muscle mass.
