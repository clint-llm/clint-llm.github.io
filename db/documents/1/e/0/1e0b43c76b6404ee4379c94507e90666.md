The aortic arch derives from the left branch of the fourth pharyngeal arch during the fourth week of embryonic development. The lower part of the fetal aortic arch connects to the ductus arteriosus. This allows blood from the right ventricle to bypass the pulmonary arteries and avoid fetal lungs that are not being utilized. Soon after birth, the ductus arteriosus starts to close off and becomes the ligament arteriosum.
