In order to understand and perform a sleeve gastrectomy, you must understand the anatomy of the stomach, its surrounding structures, and the vast bloody supply from the superior mesenteric artery and celiac trunk.

**General**

The stomach is a muscular tube that begins at the diaphragmatic hiatus, the lower esophageal sphincter, and ends as it continues as the 1st portion of the duodenum. It is divided into the cardia (just distal to GE junction), fundus (abutting the left diaphragm), body, antrum, and pylorus (most distal portion entering the duodenum.) The lesser curvature lies beneath the medial segments of the liver and includes the **incisura angularis**which can be identified as the junction of the vertical and horizontal axes of the lesser curvature (marks the transition of the body to antrum).  The greater curvature is the long left lateral border of the stomach from the fundus to the pylorus which is connected to the greater omentum. The left border of the intraabdominal esophagus and the fundus meet at an acute angle termed the**“angle of His.”**Posterior to the stomach lies the lesser sac which is a potential space anterior to the pancreas and bordered by the splenic artery, spleen, left kidney, and transverse mesocolon.

**Ligaments**

Gastrohepatic ligament - lesser curvature to the medial liver edge, contains the left and right gastric arteries.  It may contain a replaced left hepatic artery

Gastrophrenic ligament - fundus to left hemidiaphragm

Gastrosplenic ligament - greater curvature to the spleen (which lies in the left upper quadrant) and contains the short gastric vessels

Gastrocolic ligament - inferior stomach to the transverse colon, considered part of the greater omentum and contained the gastroepiploic vessels

**Blood Supply**

The celiac trunk has three branches; left gastric, common hepatic, and splenic arteries.  The left gastric artery runs along the superior lesser curvature and anastomoses with the right gastric artery. The left gastric artery is the principal blood supply to the stomach after sleeve gastrectomy and it gives off many posterior branches which should remain uninterrupted during dissection of the posterior surface of the stomach. The common hepatic artery gives off the gastroduodenal artery which runs behind the first portion of the duodenum. The right gastric artery is a branch of the proper hepatic artery and joins the left gastric artery along the lesser curvature.  The right gastroepiploic artery then branches from the gastroduodenal artery and runs in the gastrocolic ligament along the greater curvature to join the left gastroepiploic artery which is a branch of the splenic artery coursing along the greater curvature from lateral to medial. The splenic artery also gives off 3-5 short gastric arteries running in the gastrosplenic ligament to the gastric fundus.
