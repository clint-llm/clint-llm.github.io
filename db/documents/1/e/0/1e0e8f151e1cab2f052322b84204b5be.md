High-velocity low amplitude (HVLA) techniques employ a rapid use of force over a short duration, distance, and/or rotational area within the anatomical range of motion of a joint to engage the restrictive barrier in one or more planes of motion to elicit the release of restriction. This activity outlines high-velocity low amplitude manipulation techniques and explains the role of the healthcare team in improving care for patients who undergo HVLA manipulation.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the common terminology associated with HVLA.
- Identify the common complications of HVLA procedures.
- Summarize the proper procedural considerations for HVLA manipulation.
- Outline the prevalence of HVLA procedures.
