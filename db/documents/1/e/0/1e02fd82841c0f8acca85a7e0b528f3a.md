The role of arterial pressure regulation is to maintain a high enough pressure that allows for proper perfusion of body tissue and organs; but not so high as to cause bodily harm. When the body enters a state of acute hypotension, the baroreflex function attempts toÂ return arterial pressure to its stable state to allow continuous perfusion.
