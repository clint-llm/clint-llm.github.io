Treatment of high myopia can be done using spectacles, contact lenses, keratorefractive procedures, CLE, and phakic IOLs Spectacles may induce aberrations in cases of high myopia, and the patient may thus be intolerant to their use. Contact lens use is cumbersome, and they need to be changed and cleaned periodically, making them unsuitable for many candidates. Keratorefractive procedures alter the normal asphericity and shape of the cornea and may lead to various complications in the postoperative period, such as haze (PRK) or flap related complications and ectasia (LASIK). Moreover, the patient needs to fit into the corneal topography and thickness criteria to be able to undergo these procedures. CLE leads to a loss of accommodation and thus is unsuitable for young aged patients.

Preoperative laser iridotomy or intraoperative surgical iridectomy needs to be performed to avoid pupillary block in the postoperative period for the anterior chamber IOLs, and the posterior chamber PRL and Visian ICL 4 models.
