The treatment of choice of chondroblastoma is surgical. It consists of complete surgical curettage with or without bone grafting, en bloc resection, or rarely, amputation. Surgical resection alleviates pain, avoids propagation into the joint and adjacent soft tissues, diminishes the likelihood of recurrence, and accurately establishes the diagnosis of chondroblastomas.  Surgical management depends on

- The extent of bone and/or joint involvement

- Anatomic location of the lesion

- Staging

Stage 1 (latent) or stage 2 (active) may be an indication for intralesional excision.

Stage 3 (aggressive) is an indication of marginal or wide resection.

Adjunctive therapy includes chemical cauterization with phenol or cryosurgery. Bone grafting and cryotherapy after surgical curettage decrease the risk of recurrence.
