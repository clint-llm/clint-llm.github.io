There are various interfering factors in testing for beta thalassemia. It can occur at any of the steps of diagnosis, including during sample collection, transport, reporting, or internal validation of laboratory results using the standard protocol. The collection, storage, and transport of the sample in anticoagulant and the ratio between the anticoagulant and the blood should be maintained, as a disproportion can cause a discrepancy in results.

In laboratories, the buffers, agents, and stains, if stored improperly, can yield false results and proper slide fixation and staining. Hemoglobin electrophoresis and HPLC can detect other hemoglobins like HbS, Hb C, Hb E, and Hb O, which can interact with beta thalassemia.

In addition, they cannot identify specific variants of beta thalassemia and may miss the diagnosis in newborns. The allele-specific methodologies in gene detection, including PCR and reverse dot-blot, are of limited use in a diverse population.
