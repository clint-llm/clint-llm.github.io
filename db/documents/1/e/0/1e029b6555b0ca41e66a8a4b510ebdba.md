The determination of the generator site in myoclonus is an important clue for diagnostic orientation.Â All neurophysiologic tools (electromyography [EMG], electroencephalography [EEG], evoked potentials) may be helpful.

In cortical myoclonus, the technique of EEG-EMG back-averaging (correlation of electrical activity in the brain with muscle jerking) shows cortical discharge preceding the activity on electromyography. Other findings may be enlarged somatosensory evoked potentials.

Imaging of the brain and spinal cord may be done to determine structural or focal lesions.

Advanced testing for specific and rare diagnoses should be considered, including, but not limited to, a cerebrospinal fluid exam, tissue biopsy of skin, and genetic testing for inherited disorders.
