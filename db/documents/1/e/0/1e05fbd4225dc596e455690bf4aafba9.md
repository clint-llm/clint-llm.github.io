Due to the clinical significance of pharmaceutical advertisements and their influence, each patient care team member plays an essential role in patient education and appropriate prescription of medications. The pharmacist, in particular, plays an important role. Pharmacists undergo extensive training in medication safety and efficacy and should be actively involved in medication decision-making and patient education. Pharmacist involvement in educating medical professionals has also been associated with improved patient outcomes.

Nurses also have an opportunity to intervene and improve care regarding pharmaceutical ads. Patients often speak with a nurse when calling their health care clinician regarding a medication, such as requesting a prescription of a drug they saw on the internet from their health care clinician. Nurses can help educate the patient regarding the medication and interface with the rest of the health care team regarding the potential appropriateness of a particular drug.

Given how commonly DTC drug advertisements are misunderstood, it is crucial that each member of the patient care team, from nurses to pharmacists and clinicians, educate patients on DTCA to which they are exposed. Additionally, there must be interprofessional communication for anyÂ potentially inappropriate prescribing patterns and drug prescriptions to improve patient outcomes.
