Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is characterized by non-caseating granulomas with epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells in the breast lobules. In the CNGM subtype, the classic histologic features are non-caseating granulomas with characteristic cystic spaces lined by neutrophils containing gram-positive cocci.
