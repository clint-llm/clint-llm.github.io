Although the development of a retrobulbar hematoma is rare, ocular trauma is fairly common and can have devastating consequences. The majority of these cases are present in the emergency room setting. The on-call ophthalmologist should be consulted immediately. However, the presence of rapidly deteriorating vision, signs and symptoms of orbital compartment syndrome, and unavailability of timely ophthalmologic consultation should prompt treatment by the available physician.

Studies have shown that further education is needed in regards to performing a lateral canthotomy and cantholysis. This is primarily due to the low frequency of RBH, which prevents emergency medicine physicians from having ample opportunity to perform this procedure. One study conducted in a level one trauma center in the United States revealed an average of only five lateral canthotomies per year.

A 2019 prospective cohort study revealed that only 37.1% of non-ophthalmic emergency medicine physicians would perform a LOCC when necessary. An overwhelming 92.2% reported an unwillingness to perform a LOCC themselves due to inadequate training. This study underscores the need for collaborative training in this area among emergency medicine physicians and ophthalmologists. The use of porcine models for LOCC practice has been documented as an excellent teaching method for residents.
