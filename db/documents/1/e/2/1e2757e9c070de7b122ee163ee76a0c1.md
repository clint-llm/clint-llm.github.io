Prevention is the first step in dealing with neurotmesis. Health economic work on prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of these injuries will significantly impact the wellbeing of patients and improve the management of this condition to improve outcomes. Patients should be educated to seek medical attention as soon as possible, as many injuries need early surgical repair. For patients with stretch, avulsion, and gunshot injuries, several weeks are needed before surgical repair is indicated. Patients will have several months of no return of sensory or motor functions as nerve growth is slow, but they should be encouraged to keep assisting in their physical therapy and rehabilitation sessions.
