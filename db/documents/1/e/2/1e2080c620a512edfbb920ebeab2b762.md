Metabolism: Liver via extensive first-pass, cytochrome P450 2C9, and cytochrome P450 3A4.

The onset of Action: Generally 0.5 to 1 hour

Half-life: 4 hours.

Bioavailability:10 to 20%

Therapeutic Index (TI): TI is wide, and dosing is limited by adverse effects as a lethal dose of IV dronabinol is estimated at 30 mg/kg or greater. As such, max doses reflect increased rates of adverse effects. See the 'Administration' section for max doses.

Hypersensitivity to Dronabinol or Sesame Oil: Patients should be monitored for signs of hypersensitivity reactions. Reported signs include lip swelling, hive, rash, oral lesions, skin burning, and throat tightness.

Other Adverse Effects: The most common adverse reactions (which generally occur in greater than 3% but less than 10% of patients) include pain in the abdomen, nausea or vomiting, feelings of joy, feelings of paranoia, and abnormal thinking. Please also see the 'Toxicity' section below.

Important Drug Interaction: Drugs that inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 2C9 and cytochrome P450 3A4 can affect the plasma concentration of dronabinol. Drugs that are typically highly bound by proteins in plasma can be displaced by dronabinol as it is a highly protein-bound drug (with a higher affinity for carrier proteins than most others), increasing patient exposure. Drugs with narrow therapeutic windows, such as warfarin, require close monitoring when co-administered with dronabinol.
