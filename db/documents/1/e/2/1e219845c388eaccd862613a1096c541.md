The exact mechanism of medication overuse headache is unclear. It is hypothesized that medication overuse headache is attributed to the depletion of 5-HT by overuse of headache abortive medications. This leads to neuronal hyperexcitability in the cerebral cortex (which can lead to cortical spreading depression) and the trigeminal system (which produces peripheral and central sensitization). The decrease in 5-HT levels leads to increased CGRP release from trigeminal ganglia, which is involved in the subsequent sensitization of nociceptive trigeminal neurons.

Other studies demonstrate structural and functional brain changes that occur in medication overuse headaches. There are notable changes in metabolism in various brain structures as seen on PET scans of medication overuse headache patients. These changes were mostly reversed upon withdrawal of analgesic medication, except for persistent hypometabolism seen in the orbitofrontal area. This particular area is known to be involved in drug dependence and is hypothesized to be a risk factor for subsequent relapse in analgesic overuse and recurrent medication overuse headache.
