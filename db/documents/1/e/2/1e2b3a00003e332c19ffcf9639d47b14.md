The acute asymmetrical facial discoloration in the background of a trigger or underlying condition is typical of Harlequin syndrome. Harlequin faces following anesthetic and surgical procedures that are short-lived and self-resolving. Hence investigations are not often necessary.

A stress test can reproduce the symptoms to objectivate the syndrome. Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing (QSART) and thermoregulatory sweat test (TST) can be used to access the sudomotor function and integrity of the sympathetic innervation if needed.

Chest X-ray, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging of lung apex, carotid arteries, spinal cord, and brain may be essential to rule out the underlying condition before considering Harlequin syndrome.
