Immature T cells get produced by the bone marrow and arrive in the thymic cortex via venules.

The blood supply to the thymus is from the internal thoracic and inferior thyroid arteries. As these arteries enter the thymus from each side, they travel within the septa before entering the cortex.

The thymus contains no afferent lymphatic vessels, thereby limiting the amount of free protein antigen entering the thymus. The efferent lymphatic vessels that exit the thymus drain into the parasternal, brachiocephalic, and tracheobronchial lymph nodes.
