A unique thing about the lung is that it receives blood supply from more than just arterial circulation. This gives the lung some resiliency in the event of an insult such as a pulmonary embolism. The lung parenchyma receives its oxygen supply from a total of three non-redundant sources: deoxygenated blood from pulmonary arteries, oxygenated blood from the bronchial circulation, and direct oxygen diffusion from alveoli.

In patients with sickle cell disease, acute chest syndrome was found to be caused by vascular infarction by direct occlusion of sickle-type hemoglobin (HbS) in 16% of cases.
