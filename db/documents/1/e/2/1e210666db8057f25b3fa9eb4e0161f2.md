Lacerations involving the canalicular system may involve the periorbital muscles which can affect the overall function of the eyelids. The most commonly cited complications of canalicular repair include pain, bleeding, infection, scarring, ptosis, or the requirement for additional procedures at a later time. Rarely, patients may require a second surgery for the management of epiphora, entropion, ectropion, or poor positioning of the eyelid. Lacerations to the canaliculi and lacrimal system may lead to scarring and stenosis.
