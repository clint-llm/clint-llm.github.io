Episcleritis is an acute unilateral or bilateral inflammation of the episclera, the thin layer of tissue between the conjunctiva and sclera. The episclera is composed of loose connective tissue. Its vascular supply comes from the anterior ciliary arteries, which are branches of the ophthalmic artery. Episcleritis can be diffuse, sectoral or nodular, and is most often idiopathic but can also be associated with systemic collagen vascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, and certain infections. The typical presentation may include erythema, mild ocular discomfort or pain, and normal visual acuity. Discharge or photophobia are rarely seen with this condition. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of episcleritis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of episcleritis.
- Describe the distinguishing features of episcleritis.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for episcleritis.
- Explain a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by episcleritis.
