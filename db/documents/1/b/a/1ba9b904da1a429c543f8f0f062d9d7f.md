The concentration of superoxides in a given cell or environment is achievable by a process called electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, which has its basis in the nucleophilic addition of the superoxide molecule to a diamagnetic cyclic nitrone, technically termed as a spin trap. This addition then results in the formation of a spin adduct, a persistent radical that is directly measurable due to its characteristic spectrum.

Classically, testing used the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction to detect superoxide, which reduced NBT to its deep blue diformazan form, thus producing a visible color change to purple.
