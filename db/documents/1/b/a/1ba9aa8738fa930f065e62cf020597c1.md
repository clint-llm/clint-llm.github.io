SSI rates after MMS can vary depending on factors such as the anatomic site, closure method, and other variables. However, these rates are generally low, typically ranging from around 1.4% to 2.7%.

Rates of endocarditis and prosthetic joint infection are even lower. A survey was sent to the American College of Mohs Surgery members in 2012. With 230 respondents, there were no reports of infective endocarditis following a cutaneous surgery and only one report of prosthetic joint infection. The prosthetic joint infection reportedly occurred following a skin infection of a biopsy site that subsequently seeded the knee joint.

This study concluded that cutaneous surgeons overuse antibiotics for prophylaxis of endocarditis and prosthetic joint infection based on the current guidelines.
