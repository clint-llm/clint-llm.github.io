Sympathetic ophthalmia is a severe bilateral uveitis that can result in permanent vision loss if appropriate therapy is not initiated immediately. Patients who have suffered any traumatic ocular injury should be counseled on the potential risk of this condition, especially within the first year of injury. Patients should contact their ophthalmologist or go to the nearest emergency room if they experience pain, redness, or vision loss in either eye.

Providers of higher-risk intraocular surgery, such as vitreoretinal surgeons, should also consider discussing the risks of sympathetic ophthalmia with their patients. Given that the inflammation in sympathetic ophthalmia may be chronic and relapsing, patients should also be educated on recognizing signs and symptoms of recurrence, including worsening vision, photophobia, eye pain, redness, and irritation.
