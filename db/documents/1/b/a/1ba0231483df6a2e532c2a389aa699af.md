CTA is helpful for diagnosing intracranial vascular pathology, including an aneurysm. In the context of ocular trauma, it is most useful for detecting carotid-cavernous fistulas, described in the previous section under “Ultrasonography.” On unenhanced CT imaging, a dilated superior ophthalmic vein, enlarged cavernous sinus, and enlarged extraocular muscles may be seen. The diagnosis is confirmed by directly visualizing the fistula on CT angiography.
