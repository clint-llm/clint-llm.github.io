Complications are bound to occur in untreated or improperly treated hematomas. A septal abscess is the most common acute complication of a septal hematoma. If left untreated, the infection can spread to the nearby anatomical structures like paranasal sinuses, orbit or intracranial structures, through the venous draining the mid-face. Avascular necrosis and secondary infection can lead to the collapse of septal cartilage causing various types of nasal deformities. Â In children, destruction can cause an altered growth of mid-face and permanent facial deformity.

Potential complications associated with untreated septal hematoma (according to the site of occurrence):

A. Local

- Nasal vestibulitis

B. Systemic

- Sepsis

- Bacteremia

C. Orbital

- Orbital cellulitis

- Sub-periosteal abscess

- Orbital abscess

D. Intracranial Complications

- Cavernous sinus thrombosis

- Epidural abscess

- Meningitis
