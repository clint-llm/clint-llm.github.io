Aortic valve repair should be performed in high volume centers. Anesthesiologists with experience in assisting with valve repair procedures are a crucial part of the team. In addition to the primary cardiothoracic surgeon performing the procedure, one or two junior assistant surgeons should be present at the time of surgery. Highly trained nursing staff should be part of the team, as well. Due to the paucity of the procedure performed in actual practice, well-trained surgical expertise is desirable when valve repair is planned.
