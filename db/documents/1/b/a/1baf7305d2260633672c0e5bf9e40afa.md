The etiology of the condition includes several hypotheses that point to sunlight deficiency and hormonal changes as playing a role in the etiology. SAD occurs only during the climatic changes where there are significant changes in the amount of sunlight, altering the concentrations of essential hormones like serotonin and melatonin. Serotonin and melatonin regulate the body's circadian rhythm. A decrease in sunlight during winter and fall results in serotonin deficiency.

SAD is directly associated with elevated levels of melatonin, a common finding in most patients. A reduction in the amount of sunlight during this period enhances the levels of melatonin in the body. Cells and organs that produce melatonin are involved in regulating the circadian rhythm inducing fatigue, relaxation, and sleep when in high amounts, which generally is helpful as it occurs at night. Continued elevated levels of this hormone during the day are harmful to one’s health.

Serotonin is dependent on vitamin D availability, which is used in the active synthesis of the hormone. Vitamin D is primarily derived from sunlight. Therefore a decrease in the amount of light lowers the amount of vitamin D and, subsequently, serotonin in the blood.
