Children with enuresis often experience increased stress, shame, and embarrassment due to enuresis. Other complications include genitourinary skin infections or rashes. There is also the financial burden of purchasing diapers, pull-ups or replacing soiled linens or mattresses.Â In some cases, enuresis can continue into adolescents and adulthood.
