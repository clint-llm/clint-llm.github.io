To provide consistent and repeatable wound closure, it is critical for the dental surgeon to understand the suturing armamentarium, including suture materials, needle types, and suturing instruments.

A variety of suturing materials are available for use at the discretion of the dental surgeon. A key consideration when choosing the most appropriate material is tensile strength. Sutures vary in how they distribute tension across the wound after re-approximation. Tensile strength is directly related to the size of the thread material. Therefore, dental surgeons should select the smallest thread that achieves appropriate tension to minimize tissue damage. The suture material also needs to be easy to handle and provide secure knots. Thread materials utilized for suturing consist of resorbable materials and non-resorbable materials.

Resorbable suture materials are most often the surgeon’s primary choice in modern dentoalveolar surgery. They eliminate the need for post-operative suture removal, reducing patient anxiety and usually result in less tissue inflammation. Resorbable suture materials consist of natural (gut and chromic gut) and synthetic materials (polyglycolic acid and polydioxanone).

Natural suture materials are composed of highly purified collagen derived from animals such as sheep and beef intestines. Surgical gut sutures are absorbed rapidly by enzymatic degradation. For this reason, surgical gut sutures are reserved for scenarios where the surgical flap is under minimal tension. The plain gut suture thread loses 50% of its tensile strength within 24 hours of exposure to the intraoral environment and completely resorbs in 3 to 5 days.

Chromic gut sutures are treated with chromium salts to extend their absorption time to approximately 7 to 10 days. These sutures maintain tensile strength for up to 5 days. As discussed before, surgical gut sutures are the most common suture material utilized in dentoalveolar surgery. Still, they are contraindicated in scenarios where the intraoral pH is decreased—for example, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), antipsychotic drug therapy, and Sjogren’s Syndrome. If the surgical gut suture is used in these scenarios, it may rapidly dissolve, resulting in surgical flap dehiscence.

The most common synthetic resorbable suture material used is made from polyglycolic acid (PGA). PGA is digested by hydrolysis, which takes 21 to 28 days in the intraoral environment. In addition to the extended absorption profile that PGA suture materials possess, it also maintains high tensile strength for approximately three weeks. PGA is the resorbable suture material of choice when placing mattress sutures to keep tension against the muscles of mastication. Its braided structure tends to improve handling characteristics and maintain knot integrity. This suture also comes coated with an antimicrobial agent. Another synthetic resorbable material commonly used to close the dermis is polydioxanone. This is a monofilament that holds 70% of its tensile strength for two weeks.

Silk and polyester are the primary non-resorbable materials used today. Silk is inexpensive and readily available, primarily manufactured with fibers in a braided configuration. The braid allows for elasticity and the material to adhere to itself, maintaining tension within the knot allowing for secure knots. However, silk sutures are more likely to cause infection, and removal is recommended one week after placement. The braided arrangement of fibers increases surface area, which wicks fluid and bacteria into the composition of the thread. As a result, the bacteria distributes into the wound, increasing the likelihood of infection. Silk is contraindicated when used at sites where permanent structures are present such as implants or particulate grafts.

Polyester sutures are another widely used non-resorbable material. Polypropylene, black monofilament, and polytetrafluoroethylene are the primary polyester sutures used in dentoalveolar surgery. It is critical to use a surgeon's knot versus a slipknot when closing with a polyester suture because of the material memory. The surgeon's knot will prevent the knot from coming untied. The non-absorbent polyester fibers decrease the likelihood of facilitating bacterial growth.

A myriad of surgical suture needles exists on the market today. Reverse-cutting suture needles are the primary choice for dentoalveolar surgeons. The reverse-cutting needle is triangular in cross-section, where the triangle's base faces the inner part of the circle created by the needle. This shape prevents tearing oral mucosa as tension is applied during the knot tying. The 3/8-circle needle is most often used in dentoalveolar settings. However, the 1/2-circle needle is sometimes preferred where working space is restricted, such as the maxillary posterior region.
