Diagnosis of Kleine–Levin syndrome can be challenging. It is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, requiring the clinician to rule out other disease processes that can mimic the symptoms of Kleine–Levin syndrome.

Decreased slow wave sleep early in Kleine–Levin syndrome attacks with a subsequent return to baseline despite continuing symptoms and, paradoxically, normal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep early in an attack but decreased REM sleep as the attack progresses has been reported.
