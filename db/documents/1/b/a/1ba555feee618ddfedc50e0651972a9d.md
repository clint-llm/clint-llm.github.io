In systemic toxicity, the goal is to maximize the patient's hemodynamics and maintain their airway. Oral intubation using direct laryngoscopy is the first choice to establish the patientâ€™s airway. If there is co-ingestion, a patient may experience third spacing, bleeding, metabolic abnormalities, or shock. Patients should have resuscitation with crystalloids. Central venous access may be necessary for aggressive resuscitation.
