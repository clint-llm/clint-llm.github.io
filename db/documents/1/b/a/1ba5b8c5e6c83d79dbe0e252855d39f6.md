**Cannabinoids: Deleterious Effects in the Retina**

Some published data suggest that cannabinoids may be deleterious to retinal and ganglion cells. Lucas et al. studied the relationship between cannabis use and retinal neural activity in a resting state in the absence of stimulation, a phenomenon known as background noise. Their findings suggest that THC use is associated with increased neuronal background noise in the retina and the brain. This may reflect the neurotoxicity of cannabis on retinal neuron dynamic, likely attributable to altered neurotransmitter release.

Schwitzer et al. have shown a delay in responses of ganglion and bipolar cells in regular cannabis users that translate into delay of visual information transmission from the retina to the brain. Utilizing multifocal electroretinogram, they demonstrated that this delay in transmission could translate into alterations in precise and color vision. This same author also published a report of transient dysfunction of retinal activity thirty minutes after cannabis use by smoking. There was a marked decrease in the amplitude of the a-wave in electroretinogram compared with the responses five hours after smoking.

**Cannabinoids: Systemic Side Effects**

Cannabis use is associated with behavioral and end-organ toxicityÂ and is contraindicated in the context of significant hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, or psychiatric disease.
