Gemfibrozil is an FDA-approved fibric acid agent (fibrate) to manage hypertriglyceridemia (particularly in type IV and V hyperlipidemia). Diet and exercise constitute the first-line treatment for mild and moderate hypertriglyceridemia. However, patients with no adequate therapeutic response to dietary measurements will benefit from the initiation of this medication. Very high levels of triglycerides represent a risk factor for the development of acute pancreatitis. Gemfibrozil is a useful medication for the reduction of triglycerides in patients with very high triglycerides serum levels. This drug is also approved for decreasing the risk of developing coronary heart disease (Type IIb), particularly in patients without a history of subsisting coronary heart disease symptoms. This activity outlines the indications, contraindications, interactions, monitoring, and other therapeutic information pertinent to members of the interprofessional healthcare team caring for patients with hyperlipidemia (particularly hypertriglyceridemia) with gemfibrozil.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of gemfibrozil.
- Describe the adverse effects of gemfibrozil.
- Review the toxicity of gemfibrozil.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance gemfibrozil and improve outcomes.
