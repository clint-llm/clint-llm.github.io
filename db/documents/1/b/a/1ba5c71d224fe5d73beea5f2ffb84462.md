The genioglossus muscle is a fan-shaped muscle that is involved in forming most of the tongue mass. It emerges from the superior mental spines and inserts on the hyoid bone as well as the inferior portion of the tongue.

- Anterior

- Posterior

- Middle

- Inferior

These portions are separated by the macro fibers that form bundles of muscular fibers.

The primary function of the genioglossus muscle is to protrude the tongue anteriorly and deviate the tongue to the opposite side.

The muscle itself also plays an essential role in both enlarging and stabilizing the upper portion of the respiratory tract, this specific section of the upper respiratory tract is very susceptible to involuntary collapse, which is why this muscle is so involved in sleep apnea patients.

The genioglossus muscle can influence the hyoid bone; the muscle size can affect the function of the temporomandibular joint. The muscle is electrically involved in the generation of maximal sniff nasal inspiratory (with higher values of electromyography) and nasal expiratory pressures.

Muscle contributes to the ability to express phonemes.
