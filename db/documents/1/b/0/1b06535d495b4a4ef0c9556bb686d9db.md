Colestipol is a bile acid sequestrant that may be offered to patients to treat various conditions, such as hypercholesterolemia or pruritus associated with chronic liver disease. Although colestipol has been available for many years, it is less commonly prescribed in the current age due to poor compliance with use and poor tolerability. Despite this, colestipol is highly effective in managing hypercholesterolemia and pruritus. Therefore, health professionals treating patients with these conditions should be familiar with its properties, as they may offer it to patients and improve their quality of life.

Nurses should be aware of colestipol's most commonly encountered adverse effects to develop strategies toÂ monitor their occurrence and report them to physicians. The pharmacist should serve as the main point of contact for those members of the interprofessional team seeking advice on the dosage and administration of colestipol and, checking for drug interactions, giving clear instructions to patients on how to use the drug and manage any adverse effects. As such, coordination between all interprofessional healthcare team members plays a crucial role in improving treatment outcomes and patient safety in those taking colestipol. [Level 5]
