Middle ear surgery requires extensive knowledge of the anatomical relationships between the tympanic membrane, ossicles, and inner ear. Surgical procedures are further complicated by the small anatomical space and anatomical abnormalities. In addition, careful attention must be placed on the nerves and blood vessels that surround the ossicles. The chorda tympani nerve is closely associated with the malleus and is commonly injured during surgery. The facial nerve is found in the posterior wall of the middle ear and runs within the temporal bone. Surgical procedures, including ossiculoplasty and stapes surgery, require taking these considerations into account.
