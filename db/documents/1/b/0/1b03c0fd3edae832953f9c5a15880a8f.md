There are two general types of renal biopsies: targeted biopsies (TB) and non-targeted biopsies (NTB). Clinicians may perform targeted biopsies to differentiate the pathologic nature of a mass lesion.  On the other hand, non-targeted biopsies are performed to sample a relatively random area of the renal cortex to diagnose a systemic disease or physiologic response of the kidney to a prior treatment (e.g., transplant kidney dysfunction, renal failure after medication administration).

Renal biopsies can also be categorized by the method used to access the specimen. These include

- Percutaneous

- transvenous

- Laparoscopic and

- Open surgical approach.

This article focuses on percutaneous image-guided targeted and non-targeted biopsies.
