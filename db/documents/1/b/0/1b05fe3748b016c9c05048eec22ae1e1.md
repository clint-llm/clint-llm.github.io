Stingray envenomations are common injuries. Practitioners should recognize that these injuries vary in level of severity, and clinical concerns should vary accordingly. The type of stingray involved and the anatomical region of injury affect the associated morbidity and, in some cases, mortality. Short-term management includes the removal of any retained barbs, wound care, and immersion of the injury in hot water to inactivate the toxin. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of stingray stings and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for stingray envenomation. 
- Outline the management of stingray envenomation. 
- Describe the complications of stingray envenomation.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration among interprofessional team members to enhance the care of stingray injuries and improve outcomes for affected patients.
