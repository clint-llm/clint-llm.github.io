Humans can synthesize cholesterol de novo and can also obtain it from the diet. De Novo synthesis occurs in the liver and the intestines, each organ accounting for ~ 10% of total cholesterol in the body. Dietary triglycerides and cholesterol are packaged together with Apo proteins in the liver before being released into the circulation as very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Packaging of cholesterol together with Apo protein is essential as the hydrophobic nature of cholesterol makes it impossible for transportation through the blood. VLDL contains triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Degradation of triglycerides in VLDL results in smaller low-density lipoproteins (LDL) that are rich in cholesterol.
