It is essential to diagnose and appropriately manage lymphocytic hypophysitis as soon as possible due to the complications that follow.

Due to rapid development of secondary adrenal insufficiency, a cosyntropin stimulation test may be normal because there is not enough time for adrenal glands to atrophy. An insulin induced hypoglycemia test may be required to assess adrenal insufficiency early on. Other hormone deficiencies can occur and prolactin, IGF-1, growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, electrolyte levels, anti-diuretic hormone and serum and urine osmolality should be measures as well.

Pituitary gland enlargement can also cause neurological symptoms such as visual field defects due to mass effect and can lead to compression of the optic nerve, optic chiasm and cavernous sinus cranial nerves III, IV and VI.Â Visual field defects can include poor color vision perception, ophthalmoplegia and diplopia.
