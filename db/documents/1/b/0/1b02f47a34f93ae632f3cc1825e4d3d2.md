Before the induction of neuraxial anesthesia, a thorough history and physical examination should take place.  Pertinent in history is an understanding of previous exposure to anesthetic medication, review of allergies, family history of any anesthetic problems.

The physical exam generally focuses on the site of spinal anesthesia placement. The back should receive a full examination. A check for systemic or local skin infections, spine abnormalities (e.g., scoliosis, spinal stenosis, previous back surgery, spina bifida, history of tethered cord), the pre-procedural neurological exam for strength and sensation are also crucial for assessment and documentation.

A procedural time-out should be performed, confirming the patient's identity, planned procedure, allergy, check for consent, and verbal statement of coagulation status.
