The treatment of choice is oral triclabendazole 10 mg/kg daily taken after a meal for 2 days. Triclabendazole is an imidazole derivative and works by preventing the polymerization of tubulin into microtubules rendering cells incapable of producing their cytoskeletal structures. It is effective against all stages of fascioliasis with a cure rate of over 90%.****Fasciola species do not respond well to ivermectin, praziquantel, artesunate, mebendazole, or albendazole.
