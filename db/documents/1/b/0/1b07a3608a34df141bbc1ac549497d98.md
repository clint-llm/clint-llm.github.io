Tricuspid regurgitation is comparativelyÂ a common anomaly. Structural modifications of any or all of the tricuspid valve apparatus may cause the development of tricuspid regurgitation.

**Anatomy**

The right atrioventricular valve apparatus, or tricuspid valve, consists of the following components:

- Three valve leaflets: It may have as few as two and as many as six leaflets.

- Annulus

- Supporting chordae tendineae

- Papillary muscles: From 2 to 9.

The conduction system and the supporting structure of the fibroelastic cardiac skeleton coordinate the actions of the tricuspid valve. The tricuspid valve is located between the right atrium and the right ventricle. It has a valve area of 4 to 6 cm2.

The pathophysiological variants of the tricuspid valve include:

- Ebstein anomaly

- Tricuspid atresia

- Congenital tricuspid stenosis

- Congenital cleft of the anterior leaflet
