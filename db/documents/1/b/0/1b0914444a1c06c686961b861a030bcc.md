The differential diagnosis of an acute joint effusion includes other notable disease processes. Conditions which can be mistaken for an acute hemarthrosis include:

- Septic arthritis

- Lyme disease

- Tuberculosis

- Gout (monosodium urate crystals)

- Pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate crystals)

- Rheumatoid arthritis

- Systemic lupus erythematosus

- Leukemia

- Seronegative spondyloarthropathies (psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease arthritis)

- Osteoarthritis

This may be especially true if associated with trauma is remote, unclear, or unknown. Arthrocentesis with synovial fluid analysis, diagnostic imaging, and further laboratory workup specific to these other disease processes may be required to differentiate between the causes of an acute joint effusion.
