Calcium gluconate is not used in patients with hypercalcemia, hypersensitivity to calcium gluconate, and sarcoidosis. In addition, its use requires caution in patients with severe hypophosphatemia.

In neonates, intravenous calcium gluconate should not be administered with ceftriaxone as ceftriaxone forms insoluble microparticles by binding to calcium. In older patients, IV lines should be flushed between the administration of calcium and ceftriaxone.

It has been considered that IV calcium is contraindicated in hyperkalemia in the setting of digoxin toxicity. However,Â a 2011 study by Levin et al. showed no dysrhythmia occurring within 4 hours of calcium administration in 23 patients diagnosed with digoxin toxicity and who also received calcium. Thus, the evidence behind this contraindication is not clear. In life-threatening cases of hyperkalemia, calcium gluconate should not be withheld.
