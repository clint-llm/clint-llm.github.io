Abnormal protein folding is known to cause other diseases, including Alzheimer disease.  In a recent literature review,

Denk, in his publication, notes that MDB formation occurs secondary to abnormal hyperkeratosis, which has links to Vitamin A deficiency.  In his animal study, Vitamin A level was decreased from 30% at day 12 of treatment with Griseofulvin down to13% at 60 days.

In patients with alcoholic liver disease, about 70 to 75% have MDB.  However, in patients with NAFLD, MDB ranges from 7% to 90%.[4] The wide range of MDB in NAFLD is likely the result of not having the specific amount which qualifies as excessive alcohol use, which would categorize the patient as alcoholic rather than non-alcoholic.

In severe alcoholic hepatitis, non-responders to corticosteroids had high histopathological findings of ballooning degeneration and MDB suggesting that histopathology findings can identify those who may respond to corticosteroids.

Methyl donors like Betaine and SAMe prevent MDB formation. SAMe prevents demethylation of histones, which occurs with DDC while Betaine prevents MDB formation by preventing the changes in methionine metabolism and by betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) methionine increases from homocysteine.
