Orbital pain, vision loss, and proptosis are symptoms that patients may present to the primary care physician or general ophthalmologist prior to referral to an oculoplastics surgeon, neuro-ophthalmologist, or neurosurgeon. Pediatricians, internal medicine, and family physicians should be aware of the risk of vision loss if a referral is delayed. Imaging of the orbits and brain is appropriate prior to referral. Additionally, the oculoplastic surgeon, neuro-ophthalmologist, and neurosurgeon may need to work together to monitor the patient after surgery for a recurrence of the lesion.
