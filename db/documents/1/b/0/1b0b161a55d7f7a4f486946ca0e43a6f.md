The pyramidal tract, specifically the corticospinal tract, spans an incredibly long distance along the body. Damage to specific vasculature structures can lead to damage to the tract.

The pyramidal tract originates in the primary motor cortex. The primary motor cortex for the face and upper extremities receive blood from the middle cerebral artery (MCA) while the primary motor cortex for the lower extremities receives blood from the anterior cerebral artery (ACA). An occlusion of either of these arteries can lead to weakness in the associated extremities. As the corticospinal tract passes down, it will go through the corona radiata and internal capsule, which are innervated by the lenticulostriate arteries (branches of the MCA). The occlusion of these arteries will lead to the contralateral weakness of both upper and lower extremities. As the corticospinal tract passes down into the brainstem, it gets supplied by the basilar artery. TheÂ blockage of blood here can result in a variety of symptoms ranging from isolated nerve palsies to tetraplegia or death.
