Gallbladder disease occurs in men and women. Certain populations are more prone to gallbladder disease. The risk of gallbladder disease increases in women, obese patients, pregnant women, and patients in their 40s. Drastic weight loss or acute illnesses may also increase the risk. There is also a family propensity for this condition and the formation of gallstones. Other conditions that cause breakdown of blood cells, for example, sickle cell disease, also increase the incidence of gallstones.
