With the patient in the supine position, the ultrasound probe is placed on a transverse plane over the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS). Once the ASIS is identified, the transducer is aligned with the pubic ramus and rotated at approximately 45 degrees, parallel to the inguinal crease. The transducer is then slid medially along this axis until the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS), iliopubic eminence (IPE), and the psoas tendon is clearly identified, serving as anatomic landmarks.

Sliding the probe distally or gently tilting the caudal will expose the head of the femur. Returning to the initial starting position, a standard 20-22 gauge 100mm needle is inserted in-plane, from lateral to medial, in the plane between the psoas tendon and the pubic ramus. 15-20ml of a long-lasting local anesthetic ((i.e., 0.5% ropivacaine) is then deposited in this plane, lifting the psoas tendon. Care should be taken to avoid puncturing the psoas tendon.
