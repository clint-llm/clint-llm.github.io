Vasectomy can take place in a variety of clinical settings with many technique variations possible. The two main requirements of a vasectomy are isolation and occlusion. A thorough history and physical exam needs to be performed, and the patient needs clear instructions as to the risks, benefits, alternatives, and expectations of vasectomies. Patients who are considering a possible vasectomy reversal at a future time should probably be advised to obtain an alternative contraceptive procedure.

Vasectomy is generally an office procedure requiring a trained clinician but may also need an assistant. Pain is typically minimal but can cause patients to become faint during the procedure. The role of the nurse is instrumental in the monitoring of the patient during the surgery and providing post-operative care. Patients require education about the postoperative course, pain control, wound care, diet, sexual activity, showering, and physical activity; the surgeon or the nurse can provide this counsel.

Best outcomes occur when patients are adequately informed about vasectomy. A vasectomy is an excellent form of birth control, but before intercourse, post-vasectomy patients require PVSA to ensure azoospermia or rare non-motile sperm.
