- Infiltrate the skin with 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia around the needle insertion site.

- Using a sterile ultrasound conduction medium, use the bedside ultrasound to identify the target vein. The vein will appear round with a black center that is easily collapsable under pressure applied to the probe. The adjacent artery (carotid or femoral) will have apparent pulsations and minimal collapsibility.

- If using landmarks, then follow the site-specific guidelines described below:

- For internal jugular vein CVL (central approach), the needle should be inserted at the triangle's apex formed by the sternocleidomastoid muscle's two heads above the medial clavicle and is usually 5 cm superior to the clavicle. The needle should be inserted at 30 to 45 degrees into the skin. This should be lateral to the carotid pulsation, and the needle should be directed laterally in the sagittal plane towards the ipsilateral nipple.
- For the subclavian vein CVL (infraclavicular approach), the needle should be inserted approximately 2 to 3 cm inferior to the midpoint of the clavicle, which is 1 to 2 cm lateral to the "bend." The needle should be directed posterior to the suprasternal notch.
- For femoral line CVL, the needle insertion site should be located approximately 1 to 3 cm below the inguinal ligament and 0.5 to 1 cm medial where the femoral artery pulsates.

- Insert the introducer needle with negative pressure until venous blood is aspirated. For the subclavian CVL, insert the needle at an angle as close to parallel to the skin as possible until making contact with the clavicle, then advance the needle under and along the inferior aspect of the clavicle. Next, direct the tip of the needle towards the suprasternal notch until venous blood is aspirated. Whenever possible, the introducer needle should be advanced under ultrasound guidance to ensure the tip does not enter the incorrect vessel or puncture through the distal edge of the vein.

- Once venous blood is aspirated, stop advancing the needle. Carefully remove the syringe and thread the guidewire through the introducer needle hub. The guidewire should only be inserted beyond the anticipated catheter length, avoiding intracardiac advancement. The telemetry monitor should be carefully watched to identify any arrhythmias induced by the guidewire. If an arrhythmia does occur, the guidewire should be pulled back until it resolves.
- The average distance from a right internal jugular access site to the cavoatrial junction is 16 cm.
- Care is necessary to properly orient the J-tip guidewire when placing a subclavian venous catheter. In an infraclavicular approach, the bevel of the needle should be directed caudally to ensure adequate placement in the superior vena cava as opposed to internal jugular placement.

- While holding the guidewire in place, remove the introducer needle hub.

- If possible, use the ultrasound to confirm the guidewire is in the target vessel in two different views.

- Next, use the scalpel tip to stab the skin against the wire, just large enough to accommodate the dilator. Insert the dilator with a twisting motion. The dilator need only be advanced to the anticipated depth of the targeted vein without dilating the vein itself. In an internal jugular venous access, this is usually 3 to 4 cm, and for subclavian access, this is usually 3 to 5 cm.

- Advance the CVL over the guidewire. Ensure the distal lumen of the central line is uncapped to facilitate the passage of the guidewire. As discussed above, insertion length should be considered when placing the catheter. For most adults, 16 to 18 cm for right-sided and 20 cm for left-sided jugular catheters is sufficient.

- Once the CVL is in place, remove the guidewire. Next, flush and aspirate all ports with sterile saline.

- Secure the CVL with sutures and place a sterile dressing over the site.

- The sterile dressing is placed over the exit site of the catheter.

- Confirmation of the catheter tip position with chest radiography is required before use when internal jugular and subclavian access is obtained.
