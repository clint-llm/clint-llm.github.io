Even mild cases of Ascaris infection should be treated to prevent complications from parasite migration, and however, during active migration through the lungs, medical therapy is not indicated, secondary to the increased risk of pneumonitis. Medical therapy with albendazole 400 mg as a single dose is the drug of choice. The second choice of treatment is mebendazole 100 mg twice a day for three days or 500 mg as a single dose or ivermectin 100 microgram/kg to 200 microgram/kg once. In pregnancy, piperazine 50 mg/kg/day for five days or 75 mg/kg one dose or pyrantel pamoate (11 mg/kg up to a maximum of 1 g) is administered as a single dose; the latter is the drug of choice. Medical therapy will target adult worms, which is the reason why treatment should be repeated after one to three months, to give time to larvae that can be present to mature to adulthood and be susceptible to therapy. Alternative agents include nitazoxanide and levamisole.

If partial bowel obstruction is present, a nasogastric tube should be placed, give nothing per mouth, give intravenous fluids and piperazine. If total bowel obstruction is present, the patient may need laparotomy for enterotomy for the extraction of worms, but if necrosis is found, they may need resection and reanastomosis. Once the surgery is performed and intestinal transit is restored, medical anti-parasitic treatment should be given to kill any residual eggs.
