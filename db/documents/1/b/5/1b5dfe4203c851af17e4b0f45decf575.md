Prevention is the key of prediabetes. The best preventative measures are:

- Maintaining a diet rich in fiber

- Exercising regularly

- Losing weight

- Adhering to medications prescribed by your doctor

- Smoking cessation

Many studies suggest that a low-carbohydrate diet can help control insulin resistance, blood glucose levels, and weight issues. Consuming low sodium at levels less than 1500 mg per day, limiting alcohol to zero or one drink per day, and cutting out added sugar and unhealthy fats will also help prevent prediabetes from developing. Prediabetes is reversible and can only be managed byÂ making these significant lifestyle changes and having physicians who know how to educate patients on adopting healthier lifestyle habits.
