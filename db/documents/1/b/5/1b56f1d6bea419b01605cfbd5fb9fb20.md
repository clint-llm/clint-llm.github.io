Lipid metabolism divides into two main pathways: exogenous and endogenous. Lipids derive from exogenous sources, such as the diet, or endogenous sources, such as synthesis by the liver. Lipids found in the diet are packaged as chylomicrons in the small intestine and carried as triglycerides in the molecule's hydrophobic core. In the intestinal cell, free fatty acids react with glycerol to produce triglycerides. Cholesterol also becomes esterified by acyl-coenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). ACAT’s role in lipid metabolism first became established in animal models with ACAT deficiency. These animals were resistant to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia due to the inability to esterify cholesterol and reduced ability to absorb cholesterol.

The Neiman-Pick C1-like-1 protein (NPC1L1) is a human sterol transport protein expressed at the enterocyte/gut lumen and hepatobiliary interface. This protein has a sterol sensing domain that facilitates the internalization of free cholesterol into the enterocyte. When extracellular cholesterol is high, cholesterol is incorporated into the cell membrane and is sensed by the NPC1L1, which internalizes the cholesterol through interaction with the AP2-clathrin complex. The lipid-lowering medication ezetimibe prevents this interaction and thus leads to reduced plasma LDL-cholesterol levels.

Triglycerides get packaged into the chylomicron through its interaction with the apoB48, the backbone apolipoprotein. ApoC-II and E are acquired from HDL as the chylomicron circulates. A cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) promotes the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to apoB containing lipoproteins, including VLDL, VLDL remnant, IDL, and LDL in exchange for triglycerides. As a result, HDL cholesterol decreases, and cholesterol content in VLDL increases.

In the endogenous pathway, lipid metabolism starts with VLDL synthesis, which contains a core of triglycerides and cholesterol esters. On the surface of VLDL, there is the apo B-100, C-II, and E. Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), an intracellular lipid transfer protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, is critical to VLDL  lipidation. If the MTP is not functional, VLDL does not get secreted into the circulation. In nascent VLDL, the triglyceride core is metabolized in the muscle and adipose tissue, releasing fatty acids through its interaction with LPL, which is activated by apoCII. LPL helps in catalyzing the triglyceride hydrolysis into fatty acids for absorption. Insulin increases the regulation of apoCII. Once the VLDL core gets reduced, a remnant particle, called IDL, is made.  This particle is depleted of triglycerides by a process that is similar to the chylomicron remnant.

Ultimately, LDL can be recycled in the liver cells’ Golgi apparatus to make more lipoproteins, or it can get excreted through bile. The “empty” HDL can enter the circulation to pick up excess cholesterol from the tissues. This transfer is mediated by ABCA1, and mutations to ABCA1 genes carry links with low serum HDL cholesterol and familial HDL deficiency, Tangiers Disease. HDL can also acquire cholesterol from cells via SR-B1 or passive diffusion and directly transport cholesterol to the liver by interacting with hepatic SR-B1 or indirectly by transferring cholesterol to VLDL or LDL, facilitated by CETP. Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) which is activated by apoA1 on HDL and mediates the esterification of cholesterol in HDL. Other ABC transporters may carry implications in cholesterol metabolism. Sitosterolemia is a rare genetic disorder that presents with elevated plasma levels of plant sterols, including sitosterol and premature atherosclerosis. Mutations to the ABC half transporters, ABCG5 and ABCG8, can increase intestinal uptake of plant sterols since there is a failure to efflux plant sterols into the lumen. Overexpression of the ABCG5 and 8 lead to increased biliary cholesterol secretion and lead researchers to suspect that they may regulate biliary cholesterol secretion.
