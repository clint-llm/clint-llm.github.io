Visual decline and even loss of visual acuity due to CAR may occur even before the diagnosis of cancer. When CAR is associated with recoverin antibodies, the condition can progress to profound vision loss to even no perception of light.

Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment is a prerequisite for the preservation of vision. However, a targeted decimation of the photoreceptors and the support cells occurs; thus, despite even immunomodulatory therapy, the visual prognosis remains poor. Hence, in any patient, if there is an acute or subacute loss of visual acuity, visual field alterations, and vascular attenuation in the fundus without any other etiology, a suspicion for CAR should be made. Visual prognosis is not affected by treatment of underlying cancer. Overall survival of the patient depends upon the underlying tumor and stage at which it was diagnosed and the available treatment options.

Adamus et al., after examination of 209 cancer patients, concluded that patients who are at risk for developing CAR could be identified early using the anti-retinal autoantibodies. This may prevent vision loss in such vulnerable patients.
