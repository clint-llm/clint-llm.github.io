A systematic literature review reported poor population-based data to accurately identify the true incidence and prevalence of thunderclap headaches.

A population-based study in Italy showed a 0.3% lifetime prevalence of TCH in men and women aged 55 to 94.

TCH in the pediatric population is considered very rare, but data are limited. In a recent retrospective study of children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years presenting to a pediatric emergency department, TCH was diagnosed in 19 out of 2290 (0.8%) of the included patients.

In patients presenting with a TCH, subarachnoid hemorrhage is found in 11 to 25% and other intracranial hemorrhages in 5 and 10%.

TCH is the presenting symptom in 20% of patients with cervical artery dissection, 2 to 16% with cerebral venous thrombosis, 15% with intracranial hypotension, and 2% with bacterial or viral meningitis.

Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is a group of disorders characterized by severe headaches and cerebral vasoconstriction. The most common symptom of RCVS is a sudden, intense, thunderclap headache. RCVS represents a multitude of pathologies, so the true incidence of thunderclap is unknown.
