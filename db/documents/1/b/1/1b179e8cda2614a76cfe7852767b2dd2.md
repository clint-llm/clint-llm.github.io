MRIÂ is the modality of choice given the high tissue spatial resolution and absence of ionizing radiation. The different layers of the uterus are distinctly visualized. The junctional zone can experience thickening in adenomyosis. The advantage of MRI is that it can also evaluate the adjacent structures such as the ovaries, fallopian tubes, urinary bladder, and rectum. Deep pelvic lymph nodes, which are not well visualized on ultrasound, can also be assessed on MRI. Multiple sequences in different planes are obtained. Most common sequences include a sagittal T2 weighted image, coronal and axial T2, sagittal and or axial fat-saturated T2 weighted sequence, angled axials to evaluate the cervix and Mullerian duct anomalies, axial T1 weighted sequence including in and out of phase sequence, diffusion-weighted sequences, and dynamic sequences for evaluating the enhancement characteristics of the various uterine lesions.
