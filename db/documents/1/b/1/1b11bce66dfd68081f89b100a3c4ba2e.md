With the increasing application of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) as the standard of care for patients with acute chest pain, health care providers will encounter both coronary artery anomalies and variants more frequently. The majority of coronary artery anomalies and variants do not have clinical significance; however, some can cause myocardial ischemia due to flow-limiting effects of the anomalous artery. It is important to distinguish those clinically important and may require intervention from incidental coronary artery variants that pose little to no risk to the patient. This activity educates the interprofessional team about the incidence, imaging, hemodynamic significance, and treatment of congenital coronary artery anomalies.

**Objectives:**
- Review the incidence of coronary artery anomalies.
- Describe the features of hemodynamically significant coronary artery anomalies.
- Identify which coronary artery anomalies require treatment.
- Summarize the accepted imaging techniques for evaluating coronary artery anomalies.
