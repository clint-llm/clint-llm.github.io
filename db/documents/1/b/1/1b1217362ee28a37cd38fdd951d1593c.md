The superior petrosal venous complex drains into the superior petrosal sinus; there are three different identified drainage pattern variants. Type I describes a superior petrosal venous complex that empties into the superior petrosal sinus above and lateral to the boundaries of the internal acoustic meatus. Type II describes drainage between the lateral trigeminal nerve and the medial facial nerve at the internal acoustic meatus. Type III describes drainage above or medial to the Meckel cave. Of the three types, Type II is the most common drainage pattern.
