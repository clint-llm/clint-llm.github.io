Pulse oximeters are non-invasive and well tolerated. Tissue beds most commonly used are finger or toenail beds. Since clinicians are most interested in arterial saturation, the algorithm of the machine is looking for arterial pulsations, which are very small in the arteriolar/capillary tissue beds. Subsequently, in patients with low perfusion to or excessive movement of the extremities, a reliable signal may not be easily obtained. Other application sites such as earlobes and forehead
