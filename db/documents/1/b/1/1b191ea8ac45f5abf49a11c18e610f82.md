A definite diagnosis of CI requires specific physical evaluation criterion including:

- Exophoria (XP) greater at near than far by at least 4 prism diopters

- Receded Near Point of Convergence (NPC) of 6 cm or more

- Insufficient Positive Fusional Vergence (PFV) to meet Sheard's Criterion

- Symptomatic according to the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS)

Phorias, the natural ocular alignment, are best measured by performing an alternating cover test and neutralizing eye movements to determine the magnitude. Exophoria describes temporally deviated ocular alignment, whereas esophoria describes nasally deviated alignment.

NPC measures the magnitude of convergence by following a target in towards the nose. The magnitude is measured when the patient subjectively reports diplopia or when the examiner objectively observes an eye drift outwards. This number is generally recorded in cm and is labeled as the "break" point. A normative value for this measurement is approximately 5 cm break from the nasal bridge. Three acceptable targets can be used to measure the breakpoint, including 1) an accommodative target, 2) a penlight, and 3) a penlight with red/green glasses.

PFV measures the magnitude of convergence by placing base out prism in front of the patient in increasing strengths until the patient reports blur then diplopia (or break). The strength of prism is then decreased until fusion (or recovery) is reported. It is recorded as Blur/Break/Recovery. PFV may be measured with either rotary prism in a phoropter or with a prism bar. Measurement repeatability between the two methods demonstrates the trend of higher breakpoints when measuring with a phoropter and higher recovery points when measuring with a prism bar; however, the two methods have been found to be repeatable within 6 prism diopters.

The CISS is a survey designed to quantify a patient's severity of symptoms based on 15 questions associated with CI.
