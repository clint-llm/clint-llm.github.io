The left atrial appendage is often described as a small ear-shaped outpouching of the muscular wall of the left atrium. It lies anteriorly in the atrioventricular sulcus, close to the left circumflex artery, phrenic nerve, and pulmonary veins.

In normal cardiac physiology, the LAA is an essential modulator of intravascular volume. In response to increased myocyte stretch, the LAA releases atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) into the coronary sinus. From here, these peptides enter the general circulation and regulate blood pressure and volume via their diuretic, natriuretic, and vasodilatory effects.
