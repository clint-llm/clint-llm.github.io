Absolute contraindications to bursal injections include patient refusal, active systemic infection, cellulitis over the injection site, and significant immunocompromise. The injection-associated risk of hemarthrosis is low, and anticoagulation medications may be continued without changes. Coagulation studies are not required. However, patients with a recently documented supratherapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR) should reschedule the procedure until after the INR has returned to therapeutic levels.
