Characteristics of fibrous dysplasia include an increased number of thin and irregular trabeculae. The marrow spaces get replaced by fibroblastic tissue.  Lesions may be monostotic (involving one bone) or polyostotic (multiple bones involved). Commonly identified by radiograph, fibrodysplasia shows a hazy, radiolucent, ground-glass pattern due to defective mineralization.
