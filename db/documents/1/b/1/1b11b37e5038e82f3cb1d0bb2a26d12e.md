Treatment has not varied for a decade, according to recommendations from the 2010 IDSA (Infectious Diseases Society of America) update. The first-line antifungal treatment is based on the induction, consolidation, and maintenance of the following three types of patients

**HIV-Related Disease**

- **Induction therapy**

- Amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.7 to 1.0 mg/kg/day) + flucytosine (100 mg/kg/day orally) for 2 weeks (A1 Evidence)
- Liposomal amphotericin B (3 to 4 mg/kg/day) or amphotericin B lipid complex (5 mg/kg/day; kidney function surveillance) + flucytosine (100 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks (B2 Evidence)
- Amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.7 to 1.0 mg/kg/day) or liposomal amphotericin B (3 to 4 mg/kg/day) or amphotericin B lipid complex (5 mg/kg/day, for patients who do not tolerate flucytosine) for 4 to 6 weeks (B2 Evidence)

- **Induction therapy alternatives**
- Amphotericin B deoxycholate + fluconazole (B1 Evidence)
- Fluconazole + flucytosine (B2 Evidence)
- Fluconazole (B2 Evidence)
- Itraconazole (C2 Evidence)

- **Consolidation therapy**
- Fluconazole (400 mg/day) for 8 weeks (A1 Evidence)

- **Maintenance therapy**
- Fluconazole (200 mg/day) for 1 or more years (A1 Evidence)

- **Maintenance therapy alternatives**
- Itraconazole (400 mg/day) for 1 or more years (C1 Evidence)
- Amphotericin B deoxycholate (1 mg/kg/week) for 1 or more years (C1 Evidence)

**Transplant Related Disease**

- **Induction therapy**

- Liposomal amphotericin B (3 to 4 mg/kg/day) or amphotericin B lipid complex (5 mg/kg/day) + flucytosine (100 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks (B3 Evidence)

- **Induction therapy alternatives**

- Liposomal amphotericin B (6 mg/kg/day) or amphotericin B lipid complex (5 mg/kg/day) for 4 to 6 weeks (B3 Evidence)
- Amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.7 mg/kg/day) for 4 to 6 weeks (B3 Evidence)

- **Consolidation therapy** 

- Fluconazole (400 to 800 mg/day) for 8 weeks (B3 Evidence)

- **Maintenance therapy**

- Fluconazole (200 to 400 mg/day) for 6 months to 1 year (B3 Evidence)

**Not HIV/Transplant Related Disease**

- **Induction therapy**
- Amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.7 to 1.0 mg/kg/day) + flucytosine (100 mg/kg/day) for 4 or more weeks (B2 Evidence)
- Amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.7 to 1.0 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks (B2 Evidence)
- Liposomal amphotericin B (3 to 4 mg/kg/day) or amphotericin B lipid complex (5 mg/kg/day) combined with flucytosine, 4 weeks (B3 Evidence)
- Amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.7 mg/kg/day) + flucytosine (100 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks (B2 Evidence)

- **Consolidation therapy**

- Fluconazole (400 to 800 mg/day) for 8 weeks (B3 Evidence)

- **Maintenance therapy**

- Fluconazole (200 mg/day) for 6 to 12 months (B3 Evidence)

The combination of amphotericin B and flucytosine has proved the most effective measure to clear the infection, and it showed a greater survival benefit over amphotericin alone. However, due to its cost, flucytosine is often unavailable in poor-resource settings where the disease burden is significant. Combinations of amphotericin B and fluconazole have been studied, and greater results have been found over amphotericin B alone.

Without treatment, the clinical course progresses to confusion, seizures, reduced level of consciousness, and coma.

Headache refractory to pain-killers can be treated with spinal decompression after an adequate neuroimaging evaluation with a CT scan or MRI. The safe maximum volume of CSF that can be drained at one lumbar puncture is unclear, but up to 30 mL are frequently removed with the pressure checked after each 10 mL removed.
