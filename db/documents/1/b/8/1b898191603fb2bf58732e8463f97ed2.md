Evaluating patients with neuropathy involves a detailed history and physical, including a review of current and past medications. Although there are no standard laboratory or imaging studies to test for peripheral neuropathies, the following studies may aid in the diagnosis and help narrow down the underlying cause of the neuropathy (e.g., inflammatory, infectious, metabolic):

- Complete Blood Count (Macrocytic anemia may clue the clinician to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, or even alcohol abuse)

- Metabolic Panels such as BMP or CMP (Look for electrolyte imbalances that can contribute to neuropathy along with renal failure as uremia can also lead to neuropathy).

- HbA1c Testing (Diabetes is a common cause of neuropathy)

- Testing for vitamin and mineral deficiencies such as copper, thiamine, pyridoxine, folate, B12, and vitamin E, which play fundamental roles in nervous system development and maintenance.

- Heavy metal toxicities such as mercury, lead, and arsenic are known to cause peripheral nerve toxicities along with CNS disturbances.

- Infectious workup for Lyme disease, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C, HIV, and syphilis as a long-standing disease may manifest with peripheral neuropathies and paresthesias.

- Thyroid function testing.

- Antibody testing for specific autoimmune diseases known to cause peripheral neuropathies such as Sjogren syndrome, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.

- Nerve conduction study and electromyography (EMG)

- MRI or CT scans in cases where compression of the nerve is of concern

- Nerve biopsy

- Genetic testing (for inherited neuropathies)

- Urine Test (looking for Bence-Jones proteins as multiple myeloma and its treatments can cause peripheral neuropathy)
