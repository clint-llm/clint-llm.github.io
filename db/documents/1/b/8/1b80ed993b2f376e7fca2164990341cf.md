On gross pathologic examination, granular deposits and solid nodules deposited in the involved area and mild cortical atrophy are seen.

On histological examination, concentric calcium deposited along the walls of small ad medium-sized arteries is seen with less common involvement of veins. Sometimes, droplet calcifications can be observed. Ischemic changes and diffuse gliosis can be observed in the surroundings of large deposits.

OnÂ electron microscopy, calcium appears as amorphous or crystalline material surrounded by a basal membrane. In the cytoplasm of neuronal and glial cells, calcium granules can be seen.
