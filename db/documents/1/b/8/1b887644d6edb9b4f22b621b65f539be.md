The prognosis of patients with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease disorders varies over the spectrum. Patients with connatal forms usually live until childhood. Some of them die very early due to respiratory complications. Proper care can extend their lives up to the third decade. Patients of classic PMD survive longer up to the seventh decade. On the other hand, patients on the mild end of the spectrum (SPG2 and null syndrome) have a near-normal life expectancy.
