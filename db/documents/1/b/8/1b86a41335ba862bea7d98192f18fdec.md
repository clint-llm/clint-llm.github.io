Clinically dental fluorosis can be mistaken for a variety of dental conditions.

There is a limited window of opportunity for dental fluorosis to develop, starting around birth and ending at approximately eight years of age.

Dental professionals and medical professionals, particularly those in contact with expectant mothers and pediatric patients, have a responsibility to inform patients about the risks associated with excessive chronic fluoride intake and provide appropriate advice. A careful balance must be made between the beneficial anti-cariogenic properties of fluoride and the negative effects associated with excessive intake.

Most patients with mild to moderate dental fluorosis are suitable for management by dentists in primary care.
