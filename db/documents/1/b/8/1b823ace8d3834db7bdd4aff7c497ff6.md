HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are lipid-lowering medications used in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and mechanism of action of statins for the management of coronary heart disease and familial dyslipidemias. This activity will cover the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse events, and other critical elements of statin therapy, and highlight the crucial role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with clinically significant atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or individuals with risk factors for heart disease who can benefit from statin therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins).
- Identify potential adverse events and contraindications to statin use.
- Outline the appropriate follow-up and monitoring of statins.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance patient adherence to statin medications.
