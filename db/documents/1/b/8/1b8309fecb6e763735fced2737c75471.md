Osteonecrosis of the hip, commonly known as avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hip, is the death of the femoral head as a result of vascular disruption. AVN is more common in males than in females. It typically presents as the insidious onset of pain around the hip. This activity outlines evaluation and management strategies for hip osteonecrosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify populations that should routinely be asked about hip pain due to their increased risk of developing hip osteonecrosis.
- Describe the typical presentation of a patient with hip osteonecrosis.
- Outline the management options available for patients with hip osteonecrosis.
- Explain an interprofessional team approach to improve the detection of hip osteonecrosis and to provide optimal care to patients diagnosed with this condition.
