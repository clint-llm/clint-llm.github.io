Eye development takes place from week 3 to week 10. Ocular blood vessels originate from mesenchyme. First, optic grooves grow outward, forming optic vesicles. The optic vesicles attach to the forebrain via the optic stalk which later becomes the optic nerve. On the inferior surface of the optic vesicles and stalk a C-shaped fissure, known as the choroidal fissure, forms. The choroidal fissure serves as the entrance point for blood vessels. Through this fissure, the hyaloid artery can access the growing lens.

Persistent fetal vasculature can lead to impairment in vision or even blindness. Ocular examination findings vary depending on degree and area of vessel persistence.
