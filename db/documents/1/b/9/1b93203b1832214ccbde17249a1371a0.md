Acetylcholine (ACh) is clinically significant in many disease processes, the most commonly seen of which include Alzheimer disease (AD), Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), and myasthenia gravis (MG).

Patients with AD have reduced cerebral content of choline acetyltransferase, which leads to a decrease in acetylcholine synthesis and impaired cortical cholinergic function. Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) increase cholinergic transmission by inhibiting cholinesterase at the synaptic cleft and provide modest symptomatic benefit in some patients with dementia.

MG is an autoimmune disorder recognized by the rapid weakening of the skeletal muscles after repeated use. The weakness is due to an antibody-mediated process in which antibodies are produced that have a tropism for acetylcholine receptors or their associated proteins located in the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction.

LEMS is a disorder of reduced Ach release from the presynaptic nerve terminals, despite normal ACh vesicle number, normal ACh presynaptic concentration, and normal postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors. This condition occurs when there is autoimmunity (production of autoantibodies) to the voltage-gated calcium channels found on presynaptic neurons' axon terminus.
