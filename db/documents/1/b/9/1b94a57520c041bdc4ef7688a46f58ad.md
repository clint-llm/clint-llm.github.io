Bones are crucial for skeletal support to the body; it is a site of hemopoietic cells and a reservoir of calcium and phosphate.

The periosteum and endosteum are essential for growing, fracture healing, and remodeling of the bone.

Periosteum and endosteum contain cells (osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteoprogenitor cells) required for bone development and remodeling of the bone. Understanding the histology of the endosteum and periosteum will help to decode the pathological conditions of bone.
