To reduce the potential for visual impairment, neurologic disabilities, and physical limitations, optic neuritis must be recognizedÂ quickly and accurately.

Patients with acute optic neuritis and the following characteristics have a lower risk of developing multiple sclerosis:

- No demyelinating lesions on MRI.

- Optic disc swelling.

- Male gender.

Other causes of optic nerve disease should be considered when:

- Vision loss is bilateral, especially in older patients.

- Deterioration in visual due to presumed optic neuritis persists without improvement after five weeks.

- Vision loss is not accompanied by eye pain.

- Retinal hemorrhage or marked optic disc edema is present.
