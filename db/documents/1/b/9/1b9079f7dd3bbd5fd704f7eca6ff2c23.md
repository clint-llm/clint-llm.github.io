In 1990 the annual incidence of hip fractures globally was 1.3 million, and this is predicted to rise to 7 to 21 million by 2050.

It is estimated that a patient spends $40,000 in the first year following a hip fracture, and the cost of hip fracture care annually in the U.S. is in excess of $17 billion.
