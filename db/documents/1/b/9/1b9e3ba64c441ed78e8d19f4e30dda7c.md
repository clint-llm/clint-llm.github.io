No universal antidote or treatment exists for all sympathomimetic agents and is beyond the scope of this review. Although specific adrenergic antagonists may prove beneficial in certain adrenergic toxicities, frequently, withdrawal of the offending agent and supportive care is sufficient. When available, the correct balance of adrenergic antagonists may prove beneficial, but choosing the incorrect agents and/or dosing them incorrectly makes it possible to exacerbate toxic effects. The classic example of this is the use of beta-blockers in acute cocaine intoxication, potentially causing hypertensive crisis through unopposed alpha-1 vasoconstriction.

Phentolamine, for another example, is an effective treatment for pheochromocytoma or norepinephrine overdose by antagonizing alpha-1 receptors.
