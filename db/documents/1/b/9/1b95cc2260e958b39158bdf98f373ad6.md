The medial meniscus is derived from mesenchymal cells found within the intermediate layer of mesenchymal tissue and begins to take shape between weeks eight and ten of development.

The extracellular matrix of the medial meniscus is arranged into three distinct layers. The innermost layer is mainly collagen type I; other layers contain collagen types III and V. The innermost layer contains fibroblast-like cells that communicate with other cells and the extracellular matrix.

Altogether, this unique layered arrangement functions in concert to dissipate compressive stress into circumferential stress giving the meniscus its shock-absorbing properties.
