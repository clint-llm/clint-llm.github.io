ALCL patients receive treatment with an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen with the goal of achieving a complete remission (CR). The anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) with or without etoposide is the standard treatment approach. Patients less than 60 years should receive six cycles of CHOEP for induction and patients greater than 60 years should receive six cycles of CHOP for induction. Patients should then undergo CT/PET imaging one month after completion of treatment to assess the response. If the patient is more than 40 years and has an International Prognostic Index greater than 3, autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation should is an option to be offered. Otherwise, patients should be observed until progression. High-risk patients should go through high-dose consolidation chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Refractory ALCL (ALK-positive) patients may benefit from clinical trials utilizing small-molecule inhibitors of ALK kinase or CD30 antibody-drug conjugates.
