Ergotamine/caffeine has several various formulations, including aerosol, oral, and suppository, though the aerosol form is slowly being withdrawn from the market. It is available in 1 mg (ergotamine)+100 mg (caffeine) tablets under multiple brand names. It is also available as 2 mg rectal suppositories or a 2 mg sublingual form. Ergotamine/caffeine should be administered orally or sublingually for a slowly developing migraine that does not present with early-onset nausea and for treating cluster headaches. At the first sign of a migraine, the patient can place one 2 mg tablet under the tongue, and another tablet should be taken at 30-minute intervals following the initial tablet, if necessary.****For severe and rapid onset migraines with nausea and/or vomiting, ergotamine should be administered via rectal suppository in combination with caffeine, as this is the most effective form.
