Because there are numerous physical examination findings and specific chief complaints with respect to the aging neck, a discussion of indications for intervention should focus on the specific anatomical changes encountered in an individual patient. For example, skin laxity is easily addressed with a neck lift procedure, but if the skin appears wrinkled in the absence of significant redundancy, CO2 or Er:YAG laser resurfacing with conservative settings may be a more appropriate treatment modality.

Similarly, if mild platysmal banding is the only complaint, injection of 10Â to 30 units of onabotulinumtoxin, or its equivalent, per side may correct the issue; however, if vertical platysmal bands and skin redundancy are present together, a plastymaplasty can address the banding during the rhytidectomy for skin laxity. Submental liposuction can be performed for excess adiposity on its own or in conjunction with rhytidectomy; cryotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and deoxycholic acid injections can also be used to reduce submental fat, typically as stand-alone procedures.
