The active metabolite of irinotecan, SN-38, is about 100 to 1000-fold more cytotoxic than irinotecan. SN-38 is inactivated by enzymatic conversion through UDP-glucuronosyltransferase into SN-38G.

The monitoring of appropriate concentrations of irinotecan for patients is through total bilirubin levels.
