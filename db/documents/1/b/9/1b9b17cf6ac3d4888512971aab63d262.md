Tardive dyskinesia is caused due to long-term exposure to first and second-generation neuroleptics, certain antidepressants, lithium, and some antiemetic medications. Typically, the first-generation antipsychotics with increased dopamine D2 receptor affinity are affiliated with a higher risk of inducing tardive dyskinesia. Atypical antipsychotics have been associated with a decreased tardive dyskinesia diathesis--as well as fewer extrapyramidal side effects compared to typical antipsychotics--due to their lower affinity for dopamine D2 receptors in the dorsal striatum and concomitant blockade of serotonin 5-HT2A/2C receptors.

Metoclopramide can also cause tardive dyskinesia, especially in older individuals.Â The condition may also occur with certain antihistamines, amoxapine, and fluoxetine.
