If SCVT is diagnosed, anticoagulation must be started immediately. Doppler ultrasound is the first choice of diagnostic modality. If a patient has cancer, the patient must be treated with anticoagulation while being treated for active cancer. If the physical exam suggests a thrombus in a patient with risk factors and the patient is complaining of chest pain, the patient should be started on anticoagulation immediately if the testing modality is delayed due to the risk of pulmonary embolism. If chronic catheters are required, and SCVT is diagnosed, then anticoagulation must be continued for at least 3 to 6 months with close follow-up depending on the individual underlying risk factors.
