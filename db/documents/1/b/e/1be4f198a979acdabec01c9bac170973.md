Radiographic imaging is the first diagnostic step when history and physical examination suggests a diagnosis of a malignant soft tissue tumor. Contrast-enhanced MRI is the preferred procedure to evaluate tumors of the extremities or pelvis and will provide information pertaining to a tumor's size, margins, signal density, degree of necrosis, and vascularization. CT Scans may also be employed to assess for tumors of the retroperitoneum or to identify any possible bony involvement. Fibrosarcomas appear as localized, nonspecific ovoid lesions with slightly irregular margins. One will see the displacement of surrounding tissue.

If imaging suggests the presence of a soft tissue malignancy, a biopsy in the form of a core needle biopsy is warranted, as a fine needle aspiration (FNA) has been criticized as being unsuitable for providing an accurate initial diagnosis. FNA does, however, have utility in monitoring progression, as well as identifying tumor recurrence or metastasis if previous cytological studies are available for comparison. Finally, in tumors where minimally invasive biopsy techniques have failed or are untenable, more invasive surgical biopsies may be warranted. Excisional biopsy is generally recommended when you suspect a soft tissue sarcoma of 3 to 5 cm in size, whereas partial incisional biopsies are appropriate when tumor size exceeds 5 cm.
