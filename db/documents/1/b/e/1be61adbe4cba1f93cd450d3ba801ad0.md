The diagnosis of genital warts is usually made visually, although a biopsy may be necessary for confirmation. Small warts may sometimes be confused with molluscum contagiosum. Genital warts typically rise above the skin surface, have parakeratosis, and demonstrate nuclear changes typical of HPV infections (nuclear enlargement with perinuclear clearing). Because genital warts are caused by low-risk HPV types, DNA tests should not be used for diagnosis or in low-risk HPV infections.

Some practitioners use an acetic acid solution to help identify small warts and affected skin areas, but this practice is controversial.

A biopsy is recommended if there is uncertainty about the diagnosis or if the patient is immunocompromised. Pigmented and ulcerated lesions should also be considered for biopsy.

Cystoscopy should be considered in patients where the glans is involved, the patient has lower urinary tract symptoms, or there are significant urethral symptoms. In patients who have no symptoms, some experts have suggested waiting until any glans lesions have healed to avoid possible transfer of the HPV virus into the urethra.
