Acute aflatoxicosis has no known antidote, and removal of the contaminated food and replacement with an uncontaminated food source may help stop further poisoning. The management is mainly focused on symptomatic and supportive care. Meeting optimum dietary requirements with the help of supplementation may aid recovery. Largely, the focus of management should be on symptomatic control. Acute symptoms, such as fever, nausea, vomiting, and convulsions, should be carefully addressed. If signs and symptoms suggest acute liver failure, it must be recognized early, and subsequent care should follow in a critical care setting.
