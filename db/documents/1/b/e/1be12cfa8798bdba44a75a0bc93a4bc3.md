In the absence of established systemic leukemia, confirming the diagnosis of suspected cases of leukemia cutis proves to be challenging. In all cases, a judicious correlation between clinical features, histopathology, and immunophenotyping is necessary.

A complete blood count and peripheral smear must be performed to assess abnormalities in cell counts (cytopenias generally present) and evidence of circulating leukemic cells. A bone marrow biopsy is imperative for the definitive diagnosis of systemic leukemia. In addition to immunohistochemistry, biopsy samples should have cytogenetics and flow cytometry studies.

A skin biopsy and immunophenotyping must be performed in all suspected patients, regardless of prior leukemia history, as transformation or development of different leukemia may occur. The identification of leukemia can be performed based on CD markers. Common CD markers associated with each of the leukemias are below in table 1.

Other appropriate tests needed may include coagulation studies, complete metabolic profile, liver and kidney function tests, uric acid, and lactate dehydrogenase. If the patient develops high unrelenting fevers, especially during the course of treatment, an infectious workup is necessary as these patients are immunocompromised and prone to infections.

A thorough search for other sites of systemic involvement is crucial. Imaging studies can invariably help to determine the extent of systemic involvement.
