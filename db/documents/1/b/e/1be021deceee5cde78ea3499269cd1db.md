**Direct damage:**

Direct damage is done by worm activity itself, such as internal organ blockage or direct pressure effects by growing parasites.

- Adult Ascaris blocks the intestine that leads to small bowel obstruction, volvulus, or intussusception, especially in children, or can invade orifices leading to appendicitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and gastric ascariasis. Migrating Ascaris can also block the bile duct and may also alter the intestinal microbiota. Mucosal bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract or generalized inflammation leads to anemia.

- Trichuris lies in intestinal mucosa and can cause petechial lesions, blotchy mucosal hemorrhage, oozing, and colonic inflammation. It can also cause severe anemia in pregnant women.

- Schistosomiasis infection is acquired by contact with contaminated freshwater, especially during swimming or washing.

- Wuchereria bancrofti causes lymphatic obstruction leads to elephantiasisEchinococcus granulosus) leads to pressure atrophy.

- Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm, frequently develops in the intestine leads to taeniasis, and in the central nervous system leads to cysticercosis.

- Ancylostoma and Necator burrow their teeth into mucosa and submucosa, create negative pressure by contracting their muscular esophagi that lead to rupture of the capillaries and arterioles and actively sucks blood. Blood vessels are ruptured by both mechanical compressions and hydrolytic enzymes secreted by these hookworms. These worms also secrete anticoagulants that lead to prolonged bleeding and, ultimately, significant blood loss. They can cause significant anemia, especially in children and pregnant women, along with schistosomiasis, these can increase neonatal prematurity and maternal morbidity and mortality, also causes protein loss by inflammation.

- Diphyllobothrium latum causes vitamin B12 deficiency through interfering with the absorption through the intestine. Migration through body tissue, many helminths cause direct tissue damage and also by hypersensitivity reactions, whereas most affected organs are skin, lungs, liver, and intestines.

**Indirect damage:**

Indirect damage is done by the host immune response against helminth.

- All helminths are antigenic to the body because they are foreign bodies and stimulate the immune response. Lymphatic blockage by W. bancrofti and granuloma formation by schistosomes in the liver and bladder are associated with hypersensitivity reaction against these helminths.

- Strongyloides and Trichinella may induce prolonged inflammation of the intestine that causes villous atrophy; in severe cases, it may cause protein-losing enteropathy.

- S stercoralis can cause Loeffler syndrome by type 1 hypersensitivity reaction.

- Trichuris, which is also known as whipworm, can cause inflammation of the colon that leads to blood loss and rectal prolapse.

- Indirect damage depends on the severity of the inflammation and the duration of inflammation. If the duration is prolonged, many worms produce extensive inflammatory damage to tissues that is an irreversible and functional loss of the tissues, such as bile duct hyperplasia by long term infection with liver flukes, fibrosis caused by schistosomiasis and skin atrophy caused by onchocerciasis.
