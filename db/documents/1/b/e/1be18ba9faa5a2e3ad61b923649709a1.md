The diagnosis and management of esophageal diverticulum is best done with an interprofessional team. Most patients have no symptoms and the diverticulum is often discovered incidentally during the workup of another disorder. Symptomatic patients may present with non-specific complaints and it is vital to refer the patient to a gastroenterologist for workup. The treatment of esophageal diverticula is continuing to evolve and thus, patient education is key.

It is important for the diagnosing physician, whether it be the patient's primary care physician or gastroenterologist, to discuss the diagnosis with the patient and its implications prior toÂ deciding on a treatment plan. A treatment plan will need to involve careful consideration of the patient's comorbidities prior to consultation with a surgeon.

Communication between the primary care clinicians, the gastroenterologist, and thoracic surgery is key to obtaining the best outcomes.
