Temporary cardiac pacing may be indicated for any symptomatic bradydysrhythmia when permanent cardiac pacing is not immediately indicated, unavailable, or too risky, such as severe hemodynamic instability. The most common indication is symptomatic bradycardia due to AV nodal block. There are a variety of reversible causes of bradycardia for which TCP may be indicated, including acute myocardial infarction, electrolyte disturbances, drug toxicity, damage to the intrinsic conduction system during cardiac surgery or valve replacement/repair, cardiac trauma, cardiac abscess, myocarditis, heart transplant, and others. TCP may also be indicated for refractory ventricular tachycardia, electrical storm, or refractory polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Prophylactically, TCP may be an option for preventing tachydysrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter following cardiac surgery.
