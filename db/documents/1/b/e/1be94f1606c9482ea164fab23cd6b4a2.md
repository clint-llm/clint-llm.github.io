Uremia is a clinical condition associated with worsening renal function. It is characterized by fluid, electrolyte, hormonal, and metabolic abnormalities. Uremia most commonly occurs in the setting of chronic and end-stage renal disease but may also occur due to acute kidney injury. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of uremia and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the leading causes of uremia.
- Describe the pathophysiology of uremia.
- Summarize the evaluation of a patient with suspected uremia.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of uremic patients.
