In healthy infants, it is advisable to provide exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months of infancy, and the progressive introduction of solid foods after 6 months to possibly prevent food allergies or intolerance. Infants with cow's milk allergy must avoid formula milk and should be breastfed. It is advisable for nursing mothers to avoid dairy products in their diet. If the affected infant is not breastfeeding, an extensively hydrolyzed formula can be prescribed. Healthcare providers should inform patients about the importance of diet elimination whenever protein intolerance or allergy is suspected. Patients should look out for the suspected ingredient in manufactured foods. Patients on an elimination diet should also appropriately receive guidance from a dietitian or a nutritionist. Patients with a history of acute hypersensitive reactions to food proteins should be prescribed epinephrine injection pens.
