Formulating a treatment plan includes a multidisciplinary team including surgical, medical, and radiation oncologists. The recommended modality of treatment is maximal surgical resection followed by chemoradiotherapy.

According to NCCN guidelines, patients are divided into age >70 and age < 70. Each category is further divided into good and poor performance status to form a treatment plan accordingly. For patients with age > 70 and poor performance status, hypofractionated radiotherapy can be given rather than the standard 6-week course with concurrent chemotherapy.

Treatment slightly varies in patients with methylated MGMT status as they are shown to have maximal benefit from temozolomide, an alkylating agent. So radiotherapy alone is not recommended in these patients, whereas radiotherapy alone is recommended at times for unmethylated patients.
