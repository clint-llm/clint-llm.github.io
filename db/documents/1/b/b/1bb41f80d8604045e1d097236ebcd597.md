Systemic sclerosis poses enormous morbidity on patients, leading to severe disability. The disease has no cure, and only symptomatic treatment is available. The condition can affect several organ systems, and hence an interprofessional approach is recommended, including the patient's primary care provider, rheumatologists, gastroenterologists, cardiologists, pulmonologists, nephrologists, and dermatologists. At the same time, nurses and pharmacists also play a vital role in patient education.Â The pharmacist should ensure that the patient is on no medications that cause vasoconstriction and should educate the patient on the importance of compliance with the blood pressure medications. All patients with scleroderma need to be followed up closely. The nursing team can play a crucial role in patient education and close monitoring and follow-up. Patient Education to manage manifestations of SSc can prevent long-term morbidity. [Level 5]
