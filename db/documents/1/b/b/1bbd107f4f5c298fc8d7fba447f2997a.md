Clinical screening for hearing loss is ineffective in early diagnosis; meanwhile, the late diagnosis correlates with irreversible long-term speech, language, and cognitive deficits.

The earlier the intervention is performed (before six months of age), the better and higher score for language, social, and behavior adjustment the children will get in comparison with hearing-impaired children who get the intervention later on.

Understanding the major impact on hearing loss to the child's cognitive development exerts the need of hearing newborn screening for all newborns, including developed and developing countries.
