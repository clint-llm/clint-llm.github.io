Based on the 2013 CBTRUS (Central Brain Tumour Registry of the United States) report, the average annual age-adjusted incidence rate (IR) of GBM is 3.19/100,000 population. This is the highest incidence rate among malignant brain and CNS tumors. GBM is primarily diagnosed in adults with a median age of 64 years. It is very rare in children. The incidence increases with age with a peak at 75-84 years of age and a drop after 85 years. The number of cases is expected to increase, given the increasing aging population in the United States.

GBMs are reported more in men; the incidence rate in men is 1.57 % more than that of women.
