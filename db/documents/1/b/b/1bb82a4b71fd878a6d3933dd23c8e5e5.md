Signs of systemic toxicity emerge rapidly including tachycardia and fever, followed by shock and multiorgan failure. Bacteremia occurs in about 15% of cases and may be associated with brisk intravascular hemolysis. Additional complications of clostridial myonecrosis include jaundice, renal failure, hypotension, and liver necrosis. Renal failure is largely due to the combined effects of hypotension, hemoglobinuria, and myoglobinuria. Bacterial toxins may also exert a direct effect on renal tubular cells.
