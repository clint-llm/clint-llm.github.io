A meta-analysis conducted by Ten Hove et al. found that out of the 2904 cases of CC, 11% developed cancer. The prognosis of those who develop a malignancy is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of around 5%. Additionally, it is important to note that the risk of developing malignancy in cases who only underwent surgical drainage of the cysts without excision was four times higher than those who have undergone surgical excision of the cysts. Hence early diagnosis and appropriate management are needed for the best prognosis. It was also noted that the median age of cholangiocarcinoma in patients without choledochal cyst is 65 years compared to a median age of 49.5 years in patients with this condition. Consequently, it is recommended that adult patients with asymptomatic choledochal cysts must undergo complete surgical cyst excision.

In general, the excision of the choledochal cyst has shown excellent results with an 89% event-free rate and an overall 5-year survival rate above 90%.
