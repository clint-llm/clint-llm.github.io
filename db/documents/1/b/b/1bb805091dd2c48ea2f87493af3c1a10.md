The Morel-Lavallee lesion is commonly associated with an inciting trauma event. However, up to thirty-three percent of cases show delayed presentation.

Clinical findings may resemble a regional contusion. Patients may also experience cutaneous hypoesthesia or anesthesia because of the damage to the subdermal afferent nerves and increased mobility of the skin. Overlying secondary skin changes, including ecchymosis, cracking, drying, abrasions, and even frank necrosis, may also be seen.
