Carpal tunnel syndrome poses a unique challenge to doctors in many specialties. As the most common peripheral nerve entrapment syndrome, it is extremely prevalent throughout the population. Wrist and hand pain, in general, can have a myriad of etiologies, including DeQuervain tenosynovitis, trigger finger, gout, carpal tunnel syndrome. Wrist and hand pain can even be referred from the neck in cervical radiculopathy or even from a cardiac condition like myocardial infarction.

Usually, a primary care practitioner is the first person a patient sees with carpal tunnel syndrome. This provider may start conservative therapies, but for more advanced treatment options, proper coordination with a pain management doctor, rheumatologist, or orthopedist is needed. Radiologists play a vital role as well to rule out potential fractures or dislocations at the wrist after trauma. In the office setting, many pain physicians will need a team of nurse practitioners to help during the procedure to maintain sterility and help with ultrasound guidance throughout the injection.

Proper coordination of care through different medical professionals gives patients with carpal tunnel syndrome the best chance at resolving their symptomatology.
