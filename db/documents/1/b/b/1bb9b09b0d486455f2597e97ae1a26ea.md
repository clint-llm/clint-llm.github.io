Organize information before speaking with the patient. Specific instruction is associated with higher compliance.

Reminding patients of upcoming appointments and assisting with referrals can also yield higher compliance.

Productive communication programs, such as videotaping patient encounters, provide feedback.

Interact with patients when there are no administrative duties to perform, such as drawing blood or administering medication. For example, ask about how their day is going or ask if they have any worries.
