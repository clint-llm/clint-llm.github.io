Most patients with KS will present with tall-stature and long limbs, reflected in a low upper/lower segment ratio. Mean height is at the 75th percentile, with weight and head circumference at the 50th percentile.

In childhood, the phallus and testes may be relatively small. During adolescence, there is discordant pubertal development with fairly normal phallus and pubic hair development, although testes rarely exceed 4 mL and are characteristically firm due to hyalinization and fibrosis. Testosterone levels are usually in the low to the low-normal range. Gynecomastia is common.

A wide range of intelligence quotients (IQs) has been described; however, the mean full-scale IQ is between 85 to 90. Verbal IQ is higher than performance due to problems with expressive language and auditory processing. Behavioral difficulties, including immaturity, insecurity, shyness, poor judgment, and the formation of meaningful peer relationships, may be affected. Between 20% to 50% of individuals with KS have intention tremors.
