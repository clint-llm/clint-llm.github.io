Abaloparatide is well tolerated and has mild adverse effects.

In a two-year animal study, abaloparatide administration showed increased events of osteosarcoma and osteoblastoma.[1]Â A comprehensive pathology study of rats undergoing prolonged PTH analog treatment exhibited increased rates of osteosarcoma, osteosarcoma-related mortality, and metastatic potential. It is still unknown if this occurs in humans.
