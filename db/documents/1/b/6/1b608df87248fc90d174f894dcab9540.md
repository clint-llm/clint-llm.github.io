Often within a few days of initiating treatment the patient's symptoms begin to improve. After several weeks CT imaging may demonstrate resolution of the mass. Full resolution of all associated manifestations is dependent on the degree of severity of the disease and the degree of entrapment of retroperitoneal structures. If medical management is not effective in treating the mass, surgical therapy can effectively remove the fibrotic tissue and protect the ureters.
