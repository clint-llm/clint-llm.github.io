The positioning of patients in contrast-enhanced CT or MRIs is limited to the obstruction of vascular flow and the layering of extravascular contrast. The positioning of arms is often changed to prevent signal loss and increased doses. Technicians must take care when positioning the arms to prevent the compression of vascular structures, especially on the limb through which injection occurs. Compressed limbs cause increased extravasation and poor contrast bolus formation.

Evaluation of the urological system utilizes extracted contrast to evaluate the ureters and bladder.Â The normal peristalsis will limit the evaluation of the ureters, and multiple time points may be an option before the complete pacification of the ureters. As contrast fills the bladder, there will be mixing artifacts and possible layering of dense contrast. To minimize mixing artifact to allow the most sensitive evaluation for the bladder wall, the patient is often asked to roll several times. In non-mobile patients, the inability to mix contrast within the bladder may lead to inconclusive or false-positive studies.
