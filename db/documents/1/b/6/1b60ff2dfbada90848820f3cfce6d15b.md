Elder abuse is a widespread, global problem with an estimated prevalence of 5-10% in the general population of older adults in the U.S.

Other groups found to have disproportionately high levels of abuse include women, people older than 80, minority populations, residents of long-term care facilities, and people with multiple comorbidities. Due to limited and conflicting data, it is difficult to determine whether factors such as race, ethnicity, and gender are independent risk factors of abuse once corrected for confounding factors such as socioeconomic status and comorbidities.

Demographics do vary by abuse type, with women being victims of sexual abuse much more frequently than men.
