Lower eyelid laxity is part of the normal aging process. Sagging and malposition of the lower eyelid can be frequently seen in the elderly. Understanding the relevant surgical anatomy and how it can be affected by the aging process is crucial for assessing lower eyelid laxity. This helps the surgeons to formulate a reasonable patient-specific management plan to ensure good postoperative results. This activity reviews the relevant surgical anatomy of the lower eyelid, the effect of aging on the lower lid and periorbital region, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomy of the lower eyelid and its relevance when assessing lower eyelid laxity.
- Understand the aging process of the periorbital region and its effect on the lower lid laxity.

- Identify different indications of lower lid laxity assessment.

- Describe how to assess lower eyelid laxity in a systemic approach.
