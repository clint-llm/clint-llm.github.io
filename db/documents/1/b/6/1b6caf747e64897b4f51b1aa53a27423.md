Physiological variations, especially those located in the upper thoracic regions (T2 to T5), are abundant for white rami communicantes:

- In the T1 level, the white rami communicantes of the spinal nerve can appear medial to its corresponding gray rami communicantes. Normally, white rami are lateral to gray rami.

- The horizontal distance from the sympathetic trunk to the distal point of a white ramus communicans can range from 2.5 to 28.5 millimeters.

- Sometimes T5 can also send postganglionic sympathetic neurons into the cardiothoracic nerve branches.

- In T2, T3, and T4 levels, it is possible for additional gray or white rami to extend to a different level ganglion of the sympathetic trunk. T2 experiences the most significant presence of ascending and descending rami.

- It is possible, in fact, quite frequent (85.7%), to observe bilateral asymmetry when comparing white and gray rami.

- When considering both gray and white rami communicantes, one of each communicating rami are expected to enter each ganglion. However, it is possible for a sympathetic ganglion in T2, T3, and T4 ganglion levels to have anywhere from 1 to 4 communicating rami.

- Occasionally, white rami might exist at the L3 level.
