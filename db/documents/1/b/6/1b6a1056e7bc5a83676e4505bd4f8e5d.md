Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is defined by frequent episodes of apnea and hypopnea associated with symptoms such as excessive daytime and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a condition in which there is a dynamic collapse of upper airway tissues during sleep. This may result in recurrent respiratory-related events and both short-term symptomatic consequences and long-term physiologic consequences. This activity reviews the evaluation, workup, and management of adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of obstructive sleep apnea.
- Outline appropriate evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea.
- Review the management options for obstructive sleep apnea.
- Describe how the interprofessional healthcare team can implement strategies to improve patient outcomes in sleep apnea syndrome.
