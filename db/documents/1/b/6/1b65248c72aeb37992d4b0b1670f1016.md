Quinolones have been relatively contraindicated for use in pregnant women and children due to the nature of their mechanism of action as well as their arthropathic potential in children.

In multiple animal studies, quinolones have demonstrated to accumulate in the immature articular cartilage of juvenile animals, leading to the development of arthropathies and damage to the cartilage of weight-bearing joints. There are concerns regarding the potential of permanent damage to growing cartilage in human children, but there are only limited safety studies on quinolone use in pediatric patients. However, of the studies performed, all cases of arthropathy or other related musculoskeletal adverse events in children appear to self-resolve after discontinuation of the drug.

Quinolones act by impairing DNA synthesis through the inhibition of bacterial type II topoisomerases (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV). In pregnant women, there are theoretical concerns that the quinolones could potentially inhibit DNA synthesis in the growing fetus, leading to fetal organ agenesis, mutagenesis, and carcinogenesis.
