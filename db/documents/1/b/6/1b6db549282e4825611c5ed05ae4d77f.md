**Non-Scarring Alopecias of Childhood**

- Short anagen syndrome (SAS):Â Caused by a shortened anagen phase.Similar clinical history (i.e., hair does not grow long and does not require cutting, short hair, diffuse alopecia)

- Distinguished by SAS having a predominance of telogen hairs with trichoscopy and a lack of distinguishing features)
- Similar treatment to loose anagen syndrome

- Telogen effluvium: Also presents as diffuse thinning but is uncommon in childhood. Clinical history may reveal physical or psychological trauma 3 to 4 months preceding onset. Telogen hairs will be seen with light microscopy.

- Aopecia areata: Often focal or diffuse areas of complete hair loss as opposed to the diffuse areas of thinning hair as seen in loose anagen hair syndrome.

- Androgenetic alopecia: Gradual thinning; miniaturization of follicles seen with a frontal or temporal distribution of hair loss. Telogen hair is seen with light microscopy.

- Trichotillomania: Unusual shape and size of hair loss. Often patchy with hairs at different stages of growth. Telogen hairs with fractures on light microscopy.

**Hair Shaft Disorders without Increased Fragility**

- Uncombable hair syndrome: Clinically hair cannot be combed flat. The entire hair shaft is rigid with a triangular shape. Hair loss is not a predominant feature.

- Pili Annulati: characteristic alternating light and dark bands in the hair shafts that can be seen on clinical and microscopic exam.
