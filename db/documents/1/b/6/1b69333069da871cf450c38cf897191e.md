Breast reconstruction with a transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap is a type of breast reconstruction that allows for delayed or immediate breast restoration. Using the patient's own tissue is beneficial because it allows for the avoidance of common complications associated with breast implants such as an inflammatory reaction or capsular contracture. Additionally, the abdominal donor site can be hidden under most clothing styles. This activity reviews the anatomy, preoperative optimization, and techniques involved in transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous breast recunstruction surgery and underscores the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for unipedicled transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap breast reconstruction surgery.
- Describe potential complications of unipedicled transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap breast reconstruction surgery.
- Describe the techniques involved in unipedicled transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap breast reconstruction surgery.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure appropriate selection of candidates for unpipedicled a transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneoubreast reconstruction surgery.
