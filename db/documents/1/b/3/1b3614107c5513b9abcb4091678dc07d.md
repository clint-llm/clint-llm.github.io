Over the past two decades, the rate of overdose from opiates has increased significantly. Opiate misuse is associated with enormous morbidity and mortality; people are reportedly overdosing on opioids nationwide. Naloxone has been the only antidote to opioids for over 50 years, and the drug has been readily available as a parenteral formula. The belief is that naloxone acts as a pure mu-opiate receptor competitive antagonist. Besides being available in hospitals, the drug is carried by emergency medical staff as well as law enforcement personnel. Also, the availability of naloxone over the counter has made it easier for family members and caregivers of those with opioid misuse disorder to administer the drug. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of naloxone, so providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes when opioid toxicity is an issue.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of naloxone.
- Explain the approved and off label indications for naloxone.
- Outline the contraindication and adverse effects of naloxone.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who can benefit from therapy with naloxone, especially in light of the current opioid crisis.
