Definitive prenatal diagnosis by fetal echocardiography requires visualization of a single arterial outflow tract, a VSD, and the absence of a pulmonary valve. Postnatal diagnosis is suggested by the history and physical findings mentioned above along with abnormal results of the CCHD screening test. An electrocardiogram shows non-specific changes in early infancy with LV or RV hypertrophy, or higher QRS and P-wave voltages in older patients with increased PBF. Chest plain films will depict cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings. Echocardiogram confirms the diagnosis and can delineate the anatomy in great detail. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), catheterization, and angiography can be used toÂ assess the anatomy and cardiac function further if needed for pre-surgical planning and post-surgical evaluation. Genetic testing is recommended for all patients born with truncus arteriosus due to the frequent association with 22q11 genetic mutations.
