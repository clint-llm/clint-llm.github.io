Thorough knowledge of the anatomy of the femoral triangle and the structures contained within is critical before surgical intervention. The structures of the femoral triangle are of high importance to the health of the limb and could potentially suffer damage during femoral hernia repairs, nerve blocks, or other surgical proceduresÂ in the area. The femoral triangle is also an important area for lymphatic drainage and can be evaluated to assess for primary or metastatic cancer in the superficial and deep inguinal lymph nodes.
