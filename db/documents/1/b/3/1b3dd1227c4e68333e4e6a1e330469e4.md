Embedded within the premise of Ericsson's model of procedural skill acquisition is skill assessment. The model requires a coach to observe the practitioner's performance and provide immediate, actional, feedback to incorporate the feedback into the subsequent performance event. Thus, assessment during DP is formative as the goal is to improve performance. When performing a skill for a summative assessment with the intent to pass judgment on practitioner competency, unsatisfactory performance may prompt a course of remediation to include DP as a means by which the practitioner may practice the skill and improve until achieving competency. Documentation of performance is common via a checklist or rubric.
