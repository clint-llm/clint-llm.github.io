**General complications**include bleeding, failure of the treatment regime, skin maceration, and infection.

**Specific Complications**

**Leech therapy:**The mouth and digestive tract of the leech containAeromonas spp., which aids in the digestion of the blood. It is pathogenic to man, and the presence of venous congestion leads to localized immuno-suppression. Hence the need for antibiotic prophylaxis. Persistent, prolonged bleeding can occur, which may be significant, especially in children. Therefore, daily monitoring of the hemoglobin level is mandatory. Allergic reactions, migration to healthy tissues, and pre-renal azotemia are also reported complications.

**Hyperbaric oxygen:**Potential unwanted effects include claustrophobia, ear discomfort, potential neural toxicity due to high oxygen pressure.
