Histopathology of the cornea will reveal five epithelial type layers. The first and outmost is called the epithelium. Classically this is 5 to 6 cell layers thick, consisting of epithelial cells. Below lies a single layer of basal epithelial cells referred to as Bowmanâ€™s layer. The stroma is the thickest layer, the thickest layer, comprises keratocytes. Beneath this lies Descemet membrane, and finally, a monolayer of corneal endothelium cells derived from neural crest cells. The five-layered cornea contains no vasculature and derives its nutrients from the aqueous humor of the anterior chamber itself. On microscopic exam, disruption with a foreign body can occur at any level.
