Data regarding the incidence of ventilator-associated lung injury is unavailable at this stage. However, the injury is expected to be more frequent in ARDS patients. When the lungs are pathologically injured, the mechanical ventilation (especially in the absence of lung-protective strategies) will further damage the injured lungs via the previously mentioned mechanisms.Â A study on 332 mechanically ventilated patients without acute lung injury at the initiation of mechanical ventilation observed ventilator-induced lung injury in 24 % of the patients within the first five days.
