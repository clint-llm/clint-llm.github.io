Hydrogen sulfide toxicity typically results from gaseous exposure and acts as an irritant initially and later acts by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. Inhalation is the most common route of administration for the toxic substance to enter the bloodstream though it can be absorbed through the skin as well.

The combustible nature of the gas increases the risk of explosions and burns as another mechanism of injury. Hydrogen sulfide is heavier than air and therefore tends to accumulate and concentrate near the floors of poorly ventilated rooms rather than disperse into the air.
