The regulation of the function of the popliteal artery is via a proper balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers.

The integration of afferent information from the popliteal artery (shear stress, compression from external tissues, stretching, etc.) undergoes interpretation in the central nervous system, which collaborates the autonomic system to manage the arterial function.
