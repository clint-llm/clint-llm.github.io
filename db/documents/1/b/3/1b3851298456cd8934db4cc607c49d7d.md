Subclavian artery stenosis is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes family clinicians, vascular surgeons, cardiologists, interventional radiologists, nurses, and pharmacists. Today, isolated subclavian artery stenosis is best managed by an endovascular procedure as it is effective and has much less morbidity than surgery. Short-term results are very good after stenting, but patient monitoring is required as recurrences have been reported.

Clinicians and specialists will direct overall case management, and open communication between all disciplines and specialties is crucial to positive outcomes. Nurses will assist in patient evaluation, counsel the patient on their condition, and help with surgical prep and monitoring when necessary, as well as post-operative care. Sometimes pharmacists will play a role when anticoagulation is warranted, performing medication reconciliation and counseling. Everyone on the care team must maintain accurate update records, so the entire team has the most accurate information. Open communication lines are essential for the team to operate as a cohesive unit. This interprofessional approach will yield optimal patient results with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]
