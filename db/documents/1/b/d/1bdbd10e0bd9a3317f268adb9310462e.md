Etiologies of hypercalcemia can be grouped into the following categories: Endocrine disorders, malignancies, inflammatory diseases, medication-induced, and immobilization. Resistant hypercalcemia is caused by primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy-associated hypercalcemia from various conditions. The following describes the multiple etiologies of hypercalcemia.

Hypercalcemia due to endocrine disorders can be divided into two categories.

The first category includes endocrine disorders with the overproduction of parathyroid hormones (PTH), such as:

- Primary sporadic hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid adenoma, parathyroid hyperplasia, parathyroid carcinoma)

- Primary familial hyperparathyroidism or syndromic hyperparathyroidism (multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN), type I and II, jaw tumor syndrome)

- Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH), including both the heterozygotes and homozygotes (neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism)

- Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (non-syndromic hyperparathyroidism)

- Tertiary hyperparathyroidism, including chronic kidney disease and hypercalcemia related to phosphate treatment of hypophosphatemia crickets or osteomalacia

The second category includes endocrine disorders without overproduction of parathyroid hormones, such as:

- Hypothyroidism

- Pheochromocytoma

- Hypoadrenalism,

- VIPoma

- Jansen metaphyseal chondrodysplasia

Malignancy-related hypercalcemia (MHCM) constitutes about 90% of in-hospital hypercalcemia cases. It can be further classified according to parathyroid hormone levels. MHCM with elevated parathyroid hormone usually involves solid cancers, including breast, lung, kidney, and hematologic cancers, i.e., lymphoma and some leukemias. MHCM with normal parathyroid hormone levels includes lung cancers, ovarian cancers, and thyroid cancers. Various medications have been implicated in raising serum calcium levels, including lithium, aluminum intoxication, aminophylline/theophylline, tamoxifen, vitamin A, vitamin D, thiazide diuretics, and acid suppressants.

Infectious/inflammatory disorders, primarily granulomatous diseases, cause hypercalcemia secondary to extrarenal 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D production. These include:

- Sarcoidosis

- Wegener's granulomatosis

- Histoplasmosis

- Tuberculosis

- Cytomegalovirus infections

- Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infections

Pediatric syndromes such as Idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia and Williams syndrome are also etiologies of hypercalcemia. Immobilization occurs mainly in children or adults with restricted mobility due to spinal injury or other debilitating disorders. There is increased osteoclastic bone resorption, leading to elevated serum calcium levels.
