An ideal tuning fork of choice for the Weber test would be one that has a long period of tone decay; in other words, the tone maintains/lasts long after the tuning fork has been struck and cannot be detected by the sense of bone vibration, therefore preventing misinterpretation of the vibration as sound.

**512-Hz Tuning Fork**

In clinical practice, the 512-Hz tuning fork has traditionally been preferred. At this frequency, it provides the best balance of time of tone decay and tactile vibration. Lower-frequency tuning forks like the 256-Hz tuning fork provide greater tactile vibration. In other words, they are better felt than heard. Higher-frequency tuning forks, for example, the 1024-Hz tuning fork, have a shorter tone decay time.

**256-Hz Tuning Fork: An Alternative**

The 256-Hz tuning fork and the 128-Hz tuning fork are commonly used as part of neurological examination due to their greater tactile vibration characteristic. However, evidence suggests that the 256-Hz provides better reliability when compared to the 512-Hz.
