Jod-Basedow syndrome, also known as iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, is a rare cause of thyrotoxicosis typically seen after administering exogenous iodine. This syndrome often carries an association with iodinated contrast media (ICM) used in conjunction with computed tomography (CT) scans, angiography, and various other imaging studies. The problem is very frequently missed, and better awareness of it needs to be raised among physicians in primary care as well as in different specialties. It has been described in all ages, and although it is expected to be completely resolved, case reports describe occasional remnant thyroid dysfunction. This activity illustrates the etiology, pathophysiology, clinical symptomatology, and differential diagnosis of the Jod-Basedow syndrome and highlights the role of healthcare-provider team collaboration in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of the Jod-Basedow phenomenon.
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of the Jod-Basedow syndrome.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for the Jod-Basedow syndrome.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance care for Jod-Basedow syndrome, should it occur, and also highlight the roles of radiology, emergency medicine, endocrinology, and all other healthcare professionals involved in dealing with this potentially life-threatening condition.
