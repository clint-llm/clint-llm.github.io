Osteoporosis is a disorder of bone microarchitecture resulting in increased bone fragility that can result in fractures with minimal or no trauma.

Secondary causes for bone loss can involve any underlying process and medical problem as well as the use of certain medications that can either affect achieving peak bone mass as a young adult or result in excessive bone resorption affecting bone health and quality.
