Several criteria are used to define AKI, including Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN), Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, ESKD (RIFLE), and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO).

AKIN: Any of the following within 48 hours: Increased sCr x1.5, sCr increase 0.3 mg/dl or more, or urine output less than 0.5 ml/kg/h for more than 6 hours

RIFLE: Any of the following within 7 days: Doubled sCr, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decrease more than 50%, or urine output less than 0.5 ml/kg/hour

KDIGO: Any of the following: Increase in sCr by ≥ 0.3 mg/dl (≥ 26.5 micromoles/l) within 48 hours, increase in sCr to 1.5 times baseline which is presumed to have occurred within the prior seven days, or urine volume less than 0.5 ml/kg/hour for 6 hours

Innovations in laboratory analysis of AKI have determined the existence of AKI biomarkers that can be detected before renal mass is lost.

Early identification of high-risk patients can be made using these biomarkers, with early application of KDIGO bundles. In patients for whom bundled care is initiated early, there are lower rates of moderate and severe AKI when compared to patients with AKI that are treated with standard therapy.
