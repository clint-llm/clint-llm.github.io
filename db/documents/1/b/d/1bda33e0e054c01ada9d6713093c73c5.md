Prognosis is related to the extent of the injuries sustained as well as the clinical condition of the patient. If there are many injuries, various specialists and subspecialists may be required to treat the patient. Ultimately, isolated frontal sinus fractures have a good prognosis, regardless of whether or not the nasofrontal outflow tract or posterior table is involved. Advancements in surgical technique and equipment have improved the chances of preservation of the frontal sinuses as well as patientsâ€™ anticipated quality of life.
