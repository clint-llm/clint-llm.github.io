The application and education of the patient in regards to cervical traction may be done by EMS, physical therapists, physicians, and orthopedic nurses. While the procedure is simple, it is important that the patient be monitored by the nurse and physical therapist for complications and improvement. The nurse and therapist should coordinate reporting with the treating clinician.

Complications are rare, providing that patients are adequately screened for conditions that are contraindicated. Postprocedural increase in peripheral nerve pain and a decrease in central pain, increase in neurological symptoms, or sudden disappearance of central pain are alarming signs of traction-induced spinal cord compromise.
