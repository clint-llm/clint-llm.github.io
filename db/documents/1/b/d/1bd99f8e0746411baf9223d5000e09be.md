Prolapse may have associated complications usually involving bladder, bowel, or sexual health.

Before proceeding with surgical intervention, bladder trials with a simple cystometrogram or urodynamic testing can evaluate for possible postoperative potential incontinence; this is primarily due to the unkinking of the urethra that occurs after reduction of the prolapse.

Bowel symptomology could present as either fecal incontinence or obstruction. Patients may state they need to insert a finger into the vagina and push the posterior vaginal vault or perineal body to aid in their defecation - this is called splinting and is likely due to the laxity in pelvic ligaments or damaged connective tissue preventing normal opening and closure of the anus.

Sexual health may also be affected by prolapse. Although prolapse alone should not be painful, there is an associated negative body image. This negative image not only affects women’s sexual health due to embarrassment but also can affect some women’s professional activities when they have to adjust or stop their activities due to discomfort.
