Every day, patients seek medical care following injuries involving high heat, extreme cold, sizeable mechanical force, or noxious chemical exposure. Patients are only aware of their injuries because of the functional nociceptors found throughout their bodies. Nociceptors transition acute pain into inflammatory pain when the duration of stimulus persists, and nociceptors release their pro-inflammatory markers, sensitizing local, responsive cells.
