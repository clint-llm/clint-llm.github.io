The chronic pulsatile stimulation from the overlying common iliac artery irritates the endothelium of the left iliofemoral vein, which leads to the formation of bands, which are often referred to as spurs. Most patients are clinically asymptomatic as either venous collaterals develop to maintain the continuity of the blood flow, or the obstruction is not critical.Â Only in the presence of transient risk factors like surgery, pregnancy, or post-partum can it precipitate a DVT.
