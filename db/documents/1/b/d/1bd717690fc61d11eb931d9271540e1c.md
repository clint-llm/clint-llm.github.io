Unlike spastic CP, which is more commonly associated with preterm delivery or prolonged moderate-intensity hypoxic events resulting in periventricular leukomalacia and diffuse white matter injury, dyskinetic CP (DCP) is associated with basal ganglia and thalamic injuries. These injuries are usually seen with brief but profound hypoxic insults. Patients with dyskinetic CP are more commonly term infants versus those with spastic CP.

Another common cause is neonatal hyperbilirubinemia induced kernicterus as there is bilirubin deposition in the basal ganglia. As kernicterus has become less common because of preventive strategies in hyperbilirubinemia, there has been a decrease in the incidence of DCP. Additionally, any insults such as intracranial hemorrhage, stroke, or cerebral infection to the basal ganglia and thalamus can result in dyskinetic CP.
