This activity addresses the topic of median nerve palsy in great detail. The median nerve is a critical neurological structure in the upper extremity for function and use of the hand. Palsies of the median nerve can, therefore, be debilitating and sometimes painful. The goal of this activity is to familiarize practitioners with the clinical presentation of median nerve palsies and its mimicking conditions, as well as to review relevant anatomy and treatment options.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomy of the median nerve, with special attention to how to identify compressive neuropathies based on location.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of median nerve palsies.
- Outline the appropriate treatment options for patients suffering from a median nerve palsy.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to appropriately treat median nerve palsies and improve clinical outcomes.
