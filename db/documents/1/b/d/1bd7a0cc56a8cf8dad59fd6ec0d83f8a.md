Evaluation is directed toward identifying the specific cause to institute appropriate therapy.

**Laboratory Evaluation**

Various tests are required in appropriate clinical settings.

- Complete blood count, peripheral smear

- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C reactive protein

- Gram stain and culture on blood agar

- Potassium hydroxide mount, Sabourauds dextrose agar

- Polymerase chain reaction

- Veneral Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA), rapid plasma reagin (RPR)

- Mantoux test, high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest, interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) for tuberculosis

- Blood sugars, glycosylated hemoglobin

- Angiotensin-converting enzyme

- Perineuclera and cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (P ANCA & C ANCA) and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)

- Orbital doppler, orbital ultrasounds, CT angiography, and catheter angiography

**Radiological Investigations**

The 3-tesla MRI is superior to 1 to 1.5-tesla MRI to visualize the sellar anatomy and deduce the involvement of the cavernous sinus. MRI imaging with contrast and fat suppression may help us to visualize the orbital apex. Computed tomography (CT)  is superior to magnetic resonance imaging in visualizing the bony anatomy.



CT may help in imaging the paranasal sinuses to look for features of sinusitis, pre-existing orbital cellulitis, or subperiosteal abscess.

Hypointense in T1 weighted images and hyperintense in T2 weighted images. It has a cone shape when the infection is localized to the orbital apex and a dumbbell shape when the superior orbital fissure is involved.

MRI is preferred over CT.

- MRI helps detect optic nerve involvement by nerve enhancement and optic nerve sheath thickening.

- Idiopathic orbital inflammation may be characterized by involvement of the lacrimal glands, diffuse extraocular involvement, including tendons and orbital fat, and optic nerve enhancement.

- Thyroid ophthalmopathy is characterized by the involvement of the muscle bellies with sparing of the tendinous insertions.

- Tolosa Hunt syndrome is characterized by extension into the cavernous sinus through the orbital fissure.
