The main treatment options for confluent and reticulated papillomatosis are antimicrobials. Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis is usually asymptomatic. Treatment can help with emotional distress and cosmetic appearance.

**Antibiotics**

First-line treatment is oral minocycline. Minocycline 50 mg twice a day for six weeks produces a good response with minimal side effects. Possible side effects include drug-induced hypersensitivity, drug-induced lupus, pigment changes, and vestibular toxicity. It is a category D medication and is not recommended in pregnancy. Azithromycin is a good alternative and can be used in pregnancy because of its category B rating. Azithromycin 500 mg once a day for two weeks and azithromycin 500 mg three times a week for three weeks can improve the appearance of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis. Oral clarithromycin 500 mg once a day for five weeks and erythromycin 1000 mg daily for six weeks have been shown to produce a good response. These antibiotics are effective because they are antibacterial and anti-inflammatory. The anti-inflammatory response of tetracyclines is due to their inhibition metalloproteinases, hydrolases, phospholipase A2, TNF-a, IL-1B, and IL-6. Macrolides work through inhibiting IL-8 and decreasing neutrophil oxidative burst.

**Antifungals**

- Acanthosis nigricans

- Achlorydria

- Dermatopathia pigmentosaa reticularis

- Epidermal nevus syndrome

- Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis

- Keratosis folicularis

- Pityriasis rubra pilaris

- Pseudoatrophoderma colli

- Seborrheic keratosis

- Syringoma

The use of antifungals is due in large part to the previous theory that Malassezia furfur causes confluent and reticulated papillomatosis. Topical selenium sulfide applied once a day for three weeks and then once a week for another three weeks produced a good response, but this could be due to its keratolytic properties. Other antifungals, such as ketoconazole, tolnaftate, and itraconazole, have worked, but recurrences were common.

**Topical therapy and other treatments**

Systemic retinoids, like isotretinoin and etretinate, have shown to be effective, but minocycline and azithromycin are safer and are preferred. Topical therapies such as topical retinoids, urea, calcipotriol, and tacrolimus have been successful. Ozdemir et al. reported a case of a patient with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and confluent and reticulated papillomatosis that was treated successfully with oral contraceptives that contained drospirenone.
