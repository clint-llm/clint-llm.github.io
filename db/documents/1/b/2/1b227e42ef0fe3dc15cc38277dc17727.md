Every evaluation should begin with a rapid assessment of the ABC status of the patient. Once these are determined to be stable, and no life-threatening status present, a complete history, and physical exam can be collected. Vital signs should be assessed for heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, body mass index (BMI), and oxygen saturation.  Fever may indicate an infectious etiology. A chest x-ray is the first diagnostic test that should be utilized in evaluating dyspnea. If abnormal the disease process is likely cardiac or a primary pulmonary process. An echocardiogram is needed to evaluate cardiac function and valvular function. Additionally, an electrocardiogram should be obtained to evaluate for myocardial infarction or right-sided heart pattern strain. Elevated pro-BNP levels can further a congestive heart disease diagnosis.  If the chest x-ray is normal, then spirometry is needed to determine lung function. Abnormal spirometry can indicate either an obstructive pathology such as asthma, COPD, or physical airway obstruction or restrictive disease processes such as interstitial fibrosis. Spirometry can also indicate the presence of respiratory muscle weakness from muscular or neurological abnormalities. Normal spirometry indicates a need to evaluate for hypoxia as a source of dyspnea. Arterial blood gas testing is used for this purpose as well as to calculate the A-a gradient and assess for an acidotic state. If hypoxic at PaO2 less than 70 mm Hg a V/Q scan is needed. Detection of a mismatch indicates pulmonary embolism. If a pulmonary embolism is clinically suspected, d-Dimer testing may be pursued, but this test has a low specificity and a high sensitivity and should be only used in high clinical suspicion of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Spiral CT of the chest is an alternative to V/Q scanning. A normal scan necessitates cardiac catheterization to determine pulmonary hypertension, intracardiac shunting, or coronary artery disease. A normal cardiac catheterization diagnosis idiopathic dyspnea. If hypoxia is not present with a PaO2 greater than 70 mm Hg, correlation with oxygen saturation is needed. Abnormal oxygen saturation indicates possible carbon monoxide poisoning methemoglobinemia or an abnormal hemoglobin molecule. Normal oxygen saturation requires a complete blood count (CBC) to evaluate hemoglobin content and hematocrit values. The white blood count also assesses for an immune response to possible infection. Hematocrit less than 35% is anemia. Hematocrit greater than 35% necessitates evaluation with exercise pulmonary function testing. Abnormal pulmonary function testing indicates a fixed cardiac output or exercise-induced asthma. Normal exercise pulmonary function testing indicates deconditioning, psychogenic dyspnea, or a hypermetabolic state.

If an infectious etiology is suspected, culturing of the organism from the infected site should be attempted. In pneumonia, this is via sputum culture or bronchoalveolar lavage. In systemic infections or sepsis, this is via serial blood culture. Culture allows for appropriate targeted antibiotic therapy.

Testing should be targeted toward clinical suspicion, history, and physical exam to avoid over-testing and minimize cost to the patient.
