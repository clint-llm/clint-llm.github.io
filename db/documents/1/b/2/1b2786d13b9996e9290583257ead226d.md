Sedation vacations can sometimes result in complications, and each should be addressed accordingly. When sedation is turned off, the patient may not remember that they were intubated and may be unaware of all the tubes and lines going into their body. Upon awakening, they may be confused and anxious and pull out the endotracheal tube or other deep lines. This may result in laryngeal injury/laryngeal edema, and if not addressed promptly, it can lead to respiratory failure and may result in death. If the patient is very anxious after the sedation is turned off, the sympathetic drive might be very high, resulting in tachycardia and high blood pressure. High blood pressure,Â especially in elderly persons, can cause a stroke or myocardial infarction.
