Krukenburg tumor is a metastatic malignancy of the ovary characterized by mucin-rich signet-ring adenocarcinoma that primarily arises from a gastrointestinal site in most cases and less commonly from other sites. Often these tumors are bilateral (over 80%), given their metastatic nature. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of Kruckenberg tumors and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in their diagnosis and management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of the Kruckenberg tumor.
- Review the presentation of the Krukenberg tumor.
- Summarize the treatment options for the Krukenberg tumor.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by the Kruckenberg tumor.
