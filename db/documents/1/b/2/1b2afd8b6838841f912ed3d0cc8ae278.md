The Trendelenburg sign is useful in assessing different hip dysfunctions, but the interpretation of the results remains controversial as there is no clearly established standard for a positive test. According to Bailey et al., only two authors have objectively defined the point at which pelvic drop can be considered a positive Trendelenburg test result: Asayama et al. established a positive Trendelenburg test result as a pelvic tilt angle of greater than 2 degrees, while Westhoff et al. (2005) considered “positive” to be a pelvic drop in the non-stance limb during the single-stance phase of over 4 degrees and/or a maximum pelvic drop in the stance phase exceeding 8 degrees (Bailey et al.,

False positives can occur with:

- Obesity

- Fixed adduction deformity

- Medialization of lower limb axis, such as coxa vara, genu varum, and malunited supracondylar femur with varus deformity

- Non-intact quadratus lumborum (pulls the pelvis on the unaffected side up if it is not intact)

- Pain

- Poor balance

- Lack of cooperation or understanding

- Costo-pelvic impingement

- Scoliosis

- Pelvic drop can occur even in healthy individuals with normal abductor mechanism when the abductor muscles are not working adequately.

False negatives can occur with

- Use of supra-pelvic muscles

- Use of psoas and rectus femoris

- Wide lateral translocation of the trunk to allow balance over the hip as a fulcrum

- In patients with early stages of osteonecrosis, despite having an abductor mechanism defect, Trendelenburg sign and, therefore, gait remain masked.
