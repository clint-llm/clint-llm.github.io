The pathophysiology of pharyngeal pouch malformations covers a broad range of diagnoses due to various derivatives of each pouch. Most recognizable anomalies in pharyngeal pouch development causing DiGeorge syndrome, branchio-oto-renal syndrome, and congenital cysts are discussed below.

DiGeorge syndrome is a result of a 22q11.2 chromosomal microdeletion causing subsequent malformations in derivatives arising from the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches. DiGeorge syndrome is the most common microdeletion syndrome in humans, with a prevalence of one to every 2000 to 4000 newborns.

Branchio-oto-renal syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease, producing cyst formation in branchial arch remnants, auricular malformations, and renal anomalies.

Congenital cysts arising from the development of the third and fourth pharyngeal arches can present in newborns. The cysts tend to be large and filled with fluid and air, displacing organs such as the trachea and esophagus anteriorly since their location is in the anterior neck. In some cases, cysts become adherent to organs such as the thyroid gland and, in other cases, abscesses form, compressing the airway creating respiratory distress.
