The role of chemotherapy varies based on the primary malignancy. Certain malignancies are chemosensitive, while others are chemoresistant. Generally, chemotherapy protocols are devised using multiple agents. Chemotherapy, when indicated, may be performed in the neoadjuvant (preoperative) or adjuvant (postoperative) setting. Risks and benefits of chemotherapy must be considered in light of a patient's comorbidities, age, and functional status. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) has devised a useful classification scale, which is commonly considered when making a decision to proceed with chemotherapy. The scale runs from 0-5, as follows: 0-asymptomatic, 1-symptomatic but ambulatory, 2-<50% in bed, 3->50% in bed, 4-bedbound, and 5-death.
