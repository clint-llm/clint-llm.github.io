The peroneus longus muscle receives innervation from the superficial peroneal nerve. The superficial peroneal nerve is one of the terminal branches of the common peroneal nerve, which originates from the sciatic nerve (L4-S3).

The common peroneal artery follows the medial border of the biceps femoris, running in a lateral and inferior direction and continuing over the head of the gastrocnemius.
