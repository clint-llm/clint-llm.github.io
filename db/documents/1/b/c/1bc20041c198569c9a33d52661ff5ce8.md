Pancreatic pseudocysts are the most common type of cystic lesion formed by an acute or chronic insult to the pancreatic duct system. Most pseudocysts resolve spontaneously and management is often conservative. However, symptoms that would warrant intervention include acute worsening of pain, persistent nausea or vomiting, inadequate oral intake, fever, chills, or hypotension. A CT scan of the abdomen is the initial imaging study of choice to identify the size, location, or complicating factors prior to any intervention. There are multiple procedure-oriented treatment options available. In order to ensure the best possible outcome, involving an interprofessional team including radiologists, gastroenterologists, or surgeons is advisable.
