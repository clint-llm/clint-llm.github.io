At this point, prevention seems to be the most logical answer for a second impact syndrome. Parents and athletes should be educated on the potential complications of a concussion, symptoms, and an expected time course for recovery. Included in this would be discussing the potential problems related to returning to play too soon, including prolonged recovery, persistent symptoms, and a second impact syndrome. Encouragement from parents and coaches will help the athlete to avoid minimizing symptoms and from returning to play too soon. Most return to play protocols will take at least seven days before the athlete is cleared to participate.
