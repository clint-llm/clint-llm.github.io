Patients with eyelid lacerations often present to the emergency department or the urgent clinic. The emergency department physician may manage a simple eyelid laceration, but all other lacerations should be referred to the ophthalmologist or plastic surgeon. Prior to any repair, the ophthalmic nurse should assess the patient's visual acuity. Complex eyelid lacerations are often associated with other eye injuries, which require a full evaluation prior to repair. The outlook for simple eyelid lacerations is excellent. All interprofessional team members, including clinicians, specialists, mid-level providers, pharmacists, and nursing staff, must work as a cohesive unit to optimize patient outcomes in these procedures.
