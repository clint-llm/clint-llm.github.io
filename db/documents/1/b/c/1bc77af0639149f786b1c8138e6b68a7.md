Patients with diaphyseal forearm fractures usually complain of pain at the site of injury. An examination should begin with visual inspection paying close attention to the skin and soft tissue for visible bony deformities, muscle contusions, skin lacerations, tendon damage and neurovascular deficits. ItÂ is imperative to identify wounds overlying fracture sites (i.e., open fracture), which requires immediate surgical intervention. Gentle palpation should be performed identifying deformities and focal tenderness. Examination of the proximal and distal joint should be performed to identify concomitant injuries. Avoid probing open wounds. High mechanism crush injuries warrant a detailed neurovascular exam with repeat serial exams looking for signs of acute compartment syndrome. Inquire about numbness, weakness, paresthesias, and radiating pain. Although nerve injury is less common, examination of the radial and median nerve distribution is essential in identifying nerve damage. Ulnar nerve injury is rare.
