Patients with suspected breast cancer should have an examination for axillary lymphadenopathy. Those with enlarged lymph nodes may be considered for a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and/or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The sentinel node is the first lymph node into which a primary tumor drains.

If an ALND is performed, there are classically three surgical levels of removal:

- Level I: lateral to the pectoralis minor muscle

- Level II: posterior to the pectoralis minor muscle

- Level III (infraclavicular): medial to the pectoralis minor muscle

There are many possible complications of an ALND for carcinoma of the breast. These usually affect the ipsilateral upper limb and may include numbness (39%), pain (39%), arm swelling (25%), and limitation of arm movement (16%).****lymph accumulates in the subcutaneous tissue leading to symptoms such as pain and altered sensation, limb heaviness, and difficulty fitting into clothing.

Despite these complications, ALNDs commonly occur unnecessarily in women without nodal involvement. Some authors, therefore, recommend that the clinician perform an SLNB first to confirm the nodal status of the patient.
