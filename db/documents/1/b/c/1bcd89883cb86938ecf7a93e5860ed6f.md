Untreated BV can lead to increased risk of STIs, including HIV and pregnancy complications.

During pregnancy, BV has been associated with a two-fold increased risk of preterm delivery (particularly if BV is diagnosed in the early second trimester) and a three to five-fold increased risk of spontaneous abortion in women diagnosed with BV in the first trimester.
