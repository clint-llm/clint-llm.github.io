In general, an ulnar nerve block is best suited for procedures not requiring a tourniquet, and procedures expected to last under 20 minutes.Â  These include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Surgery of the little finger or fifth metacarpal

- Reduction of fifth metacarpal fractures or MCP dislocation

- Repair of multiple lacerations of the ulnar aspect of the hand and little fingers

- Analgesia for burns to the hand

- Rescue analgesia or anesthesia for failed/inadequate brachial plexus block

- Supplemental block to median nerve block either for procedures involving the ring finger or for incomplete block due to anastomoses
