An interprofessional team that provides an integrated approach to evaluating hypertelorism can help achieve the best possible outcomes.Â A finding of ocular hypertelorism warrants further evaluation by a geneticist to evaluate the extent of hypertelorism, as well as to completing a head to toe dysmorphology exam to identify additional dysmorphic findings. Additional studies may be indicated, pending evaluation by an expert in dysmorphology. These may include CT head (to evaluate craniosynostosis), CT orbits, echocardiogram (to evaluated congenital heart disease), a renal ultrasound (to evaluate structural congenital malformations), skeletal survey, brain MRI (to evaluate underlying neuronal changes or evaluate for mass as indicated), retinal exam, audiology testing, sleep study, and others depending on the underlying etiology or genetic syndrome contributing to the finding of hypertelorism.
