Sensory integration (SI) is a framework conceptualized by Dr. A. Jean Ayers, Ph.D. in the 1970s; hence it is currently known as Ayres Sensory Integration (ASI).

SI describes how the nervous system integrates sensory input into action. Two structures may be affected in registration and modulation disturbances: the limbic system and the vestibular and proprioceptive systems. The vestibular system is in charge of the sensory information from body movement through space. The proprioceptive system has a role in processing sensory input from joints and muscles. When impaired, it can lead to issues such as hand flapping

Based on Ayer's theory, lack of sensory integration may be one of the underlying causes of the behavioral problems in children with autism.
