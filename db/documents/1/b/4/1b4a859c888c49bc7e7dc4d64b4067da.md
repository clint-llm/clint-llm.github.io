HIV-associated lipodystrophy is a syndrome characterized by body habitus changes associated with HIV treatment. The syndrome comprises two distinct clinical manifestations that can sometimes occur together. Lipodystrophy is defined as a redistribution of adipose tissue, manifesting as abnormal fat accumulation resulting in central adiposity or subcutaneous fat loss resulting in severe body image changes from lipoatrophy. Several treatment options have been identified to help decrease the morbidity patients may experience due to this condition. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of HIV-associated lipodystrophy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of HIV-associated lipodystrophy.
- Describe the typical physical exam of a patient with HIV-associated lipoatrophy.
- Review the treatment and management options available for the various clinical manifestations of HIV-associated lipodystrophy.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of patients with HIV-associated lipodystrophy and improve outcomes.
