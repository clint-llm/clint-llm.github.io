Left ventricular pseudoaneurysms (LVP) are very rare but commonly lethal complications that are secondary to myocardial infarctions, cardiac surgeries, trauma, or infections. Patients with LVP may present with congestive heart failure and arrhythmias. Development of tamponade after left ventricular rupture is usually fatal. This activity describes the pathophysiology of left ventricular pseudoaneurysms and reviews the indications, contraindications, and technique involved in percutaneous transcatheter left ventricular pseudoaneurysm closure. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of a left ventricular pseudoaneurysm.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with a left ventricular pseudoaneurysm.
- Describe the technique involved in percutaneous transcatheter left ventricular pseudoaneurysm closure.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies to enhance care coordination and communication to optimize the performance of percutaneous transcatheter left ventricular pseudoaneurysm closure and decrease patient morbidity.
