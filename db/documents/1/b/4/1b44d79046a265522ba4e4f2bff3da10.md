The incidence of hiatal hernias increases with age. Approximately 55%-60% of individuals over the age of 50 have a hiatal hernia. However, only about 9% have symptoms, and it depends on the type and competency of the lower esophageal sphincter. The vast majority of these hernias are type I sliding hiatal hernias. Type II, paraesophageal hernias, only make up about 5% of hiatal hernias where the LES remains stationary, but the stomach protrudes above the diaphragm. There is also an increased prevalence in women, which could be attributed to increased intraabdominal pressure during pregnancy. Hiatal hernias are most common in Western Europe and North America and are rare in rural Africa.
