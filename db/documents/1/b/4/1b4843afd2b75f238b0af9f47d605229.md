Gastroparesis gets evaluated in clinical practice through the recognition of the clinical symptoms and documentation of delayed gastric emptying. The goal of the evaluation is to exclude a mechanical obstruction and establish the diagnosis of gastroparesis by an assessment of gastric motility. Robust patient history should point to suspicion of a possible diagnosis. Gastroparesis should be a suspicion in patients with chronic nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, abdominal pain, or bloating. The next step would be ruling out mechanical obstruction, which could be done with a careful upper GI endoscopy to rule out malignancy or strictures due to peptic ulcer disease.

Imaging modalities like computed tomographic (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abdomen may be needed to exclude mechanical obstruction. After ruling out mechanical causes, gastric emptying studies (GES) are performed by scintigraphy to confirm the presence of delayed gastric emptying of solids. A solid or liquid radioisotope containing meal may be used to measure gastric emptying.
