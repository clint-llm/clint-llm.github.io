Hemophilia A and B are inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. In hemophilia A there is a deficiency in factor VIII. In hemophilia B there is a deficiency in factor IX.

Hemophilia C is an autosomal recessive mutation, where there is a deficiency in factor XI.

Factor V Leiden is a genetic mutation more prevalent in people European descent. This defect causes a state of hypercoagulability. The genetic mutation causes a defect in factor V such that protein C cannot inactivate it, allowing factor V to continuously activate downstream factors.

Deficiencies in protein C and S also can lead to hypercoagulable states due to an inability to appropriately inhibit factors V and VIII respectively.
