Sarcopenia is characterized by decreased muscle strength, quantity, and physical performance. Patients with sarcopenia are often elderly, sedentary, and may present with various comorbidities or disabilities, with a subsequent decrease in function and quality of life. A patient history consistent with sarcopenia includes progressive loss of muscle mass, strength, and function to the extent that daily activities become increasingly difficult to accomplish.
