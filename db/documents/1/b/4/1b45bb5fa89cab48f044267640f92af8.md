The radial nerve, which arises from the C5-T1 nerve roots, provides motor and sensory function to portions of the upper extremity. It initially traverses the triangular interval with the profunda brachii artery and courses with it until the profunda brachii artery splits into the radial collateral artery and middle collateral artery.Â  At this point, the radial nerve takes a more superficial course, following the anterior radial collateral artery into the anterior compartment of the arm.
