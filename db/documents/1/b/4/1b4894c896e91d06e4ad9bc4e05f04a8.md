The hypothalamus secretes corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which stimulates the release of ACTH from the pituitary. CRH, in turn, is stimulated by several factors and hormones like ANS (atrial natriuretic peptide), vasopressin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. ACTH then stimulates the adrenal cortex to release cortisol, which in turn provides negative feedback to the pituitary decreasing ACTH secretion. This maintains cardiovascular function, among other things, in critically ill patients. This is a dynamic process and is constantly influenced by several factors. Adrenal insufficiency is an inability to produce sufficient cortisol at baseline and/or under stress.

The cortisol physiology in critically ill patients is slightly different and warrants some discussion. There is an initial rise of both ACTH and cortisol in response to critical illness. After the initial phase, although cortisol remains high, ACTH levels may decline. It is hypothesized that factors other than ACTH like the adrenergic system, cytokines, adipokines, and neuropeptides may be responsible for sustained cortisol rise although ACTH levels are low. Also, there may be a decrease in cortisol metabolism, contributing to higher levels. There is some evidence that there is a higher ratio of cortisol to cortisone in critically ill or trauma patients. This reflects the activity of 11-beta-hydroxysteroid in these patients.
