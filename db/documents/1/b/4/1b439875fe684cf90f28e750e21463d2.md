Drug testing detects the presence or absence of a drug or its metabolites in a biological sample. This process can be completed in a variety of settings and with a variety of techniques. Despite the drawbacks, drug testing plays an essential role in the clinical setting because clinical examination, patient self-reporting, and collateral reporting will often underestimate the actual incidence of substance use. However, drug testing should always be used with history/physical and psychosocial assessment. This activity describes the process of drug testing, the nuances of drug testing, the interpretation of false positive and false negative results, and the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who use illicit drugs.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the function of drug testing.
