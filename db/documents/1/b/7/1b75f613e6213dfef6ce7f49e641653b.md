Secondary amenorrhea occurs when a patient who has passed menarche goes six months or longer without menses. While some sources only require three months without menses to diagnose amenorrhea, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists uses the former definition. There are many causes of secondary amenorrhea, and thus it is important to have an interprofessional team involved in the investigation and management of this disorder. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of secondary amenorrhea and explains the role of the interprofessional team in the management and care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of secondary amenorrhea, and how it differs from primary amenorrhea.
- Summarize treatment options for secondary amenorrhea by underlying etiology.
- Review the potential differential diagnoses for secondary amenorrhea.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance diagnosis and care of secondary amenorrhea to improve outcomes.
