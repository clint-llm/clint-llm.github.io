Enchondromas are benign, lobulated neoplasms of hyaline cartilage, most commonly occurring in the short tubular bones of the hands and feet. The femur and humerus are the two most common sites for long bone involvement. These tumors can, however, arise in any bone formed from cartilage. Enchondromas are the most prevalent intraosseous cartilage tumors, accounting for approximately 3% of bone tumors and 13% of benign bone tumors.

Most enchondromas begin in the medullary portion of the diaphysis, arising from ectopic cartilaginous nests in the metaphyseal region, and expand outward towards the cortex.
