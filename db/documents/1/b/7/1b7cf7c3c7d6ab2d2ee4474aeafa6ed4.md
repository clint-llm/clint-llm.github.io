The principles of management are to avoid exacerbating factors and to control symptoms as long as CSU persists. Pharmacological agents are directed at preventing mast cell degranulation and/or the effects of mast cell mediators released.

Second-generation H1-antihistamines (e.g., cetirizine, loratadine, fexofenadine), taken regularly, are the first-line pharmacological treatment. The dose can be up-titrated to 4 times standard dose if symptoms remain at 2 to 4-week intervals. Due to anticholinergic properties and the adverse effect profile on the central nervous system, the routine use of first-generation H1-antihistamines is no longer recommended.

The primary difference in treatment between CSU and CIndU is that as needed, treatment may be used for the latter if the patient knows his trigger and is able to plan by taking an H1-antihistamine approximately two hours before being exposed to it.

Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody with a high affinity for free IgE. Given as a subcutaneous injection, the standard dosing regimen is 300 mg every 4 weeks. This has been shown to be efficacious as a second-line adjunct therapy for CSU that is unresponsive to H1-antihistamines.

Ciclosporin is recommended as a third-line agent for CSU that remains refractory to the combination of H1-antihistamine and omalizumab. CSU is an off-label indication, and the dose and duration of ciclosporin should be minimized to avoid adverse events, including nephrotoxicity and hypertension.

For acute flares of CSU, short courses only of systemic corticosteroids may help alleviate symptom severity and reduce the duration of the flare.

There is limited low-quality evidence for alternate therapeutic options, including leukotriene antagonists, dapsone, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, plasmapheresis, phototherapy, and intravenous immunoglobulin.
