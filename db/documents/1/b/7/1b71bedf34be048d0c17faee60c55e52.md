The USPSTF (US Preventive Services Task Force) recommends screening for a major depressive disorder (MDD) in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years.

- PHQ9: The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, scores each of the nine DSM criteria as "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day), providing a 0 to 27 severity score

- The Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale: A 20-item self-report questionnaire.

- The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II): 21-item self-report inventory

There is no specific blood test or imaging that can be done to diagnose depression. However, the evaluation of depression needs to include some investigations to rule out some of the differential diagnoses. Examples are:

- Complete blood count (CBC) and vitamin B-12 levels

- Electrolytes including magnesium, calcium, and phosphate.

- TSH, T3, free T4

- Liver function tests, renal function test (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine)

Other investigations should be ordered whenever other medical illnesses are suspected, for example, urine toxicology screen, blood alcohol level, HIV test, dexamethasone suppression test, and an ACTH stimulation test.
