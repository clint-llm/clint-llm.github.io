While temporal bone fractures may occur as isolated injuries, they more often occur in conjunction with polytrauma, and therefore patients with temporal bone fractures frequently require care from multiple specialists.

Neurologists may likewise be consulted for concussions and orthopedists and trauma surgeons for other injuries that may occur simultaneously. Longer-term care will also likely involve physical and occupational therapists and may require audiologists, vestibular therapists, and others.
