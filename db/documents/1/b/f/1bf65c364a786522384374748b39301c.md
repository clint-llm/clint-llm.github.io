The treatment of dermatophyte infections usually involves the use of topical or oral preparations.

Localized tinea corporis commonly responds to topical therapy typically applied once or twice daily, usually for two to three weeks. However, the endpoint of therapy is a clinical resolution of the symptoms.  In general, nystatin topical is not effective for tinea corporis.

Suggested topical regimens include one of the following:

- Clotrimazole: 1% cream/ointment/solution applied topically twice daily

- Ketoconazole: 2% cream/shampoo/gel/foam applied once daily

- Miconazole: 2% cream/ointment/solution/lotion/powder applied twice daily

- Naftifine: 1% cream, applied once daily or 1% or 2% gel twice daily

- Terbinafine: 1% cream/gel/spray solution once or twice daily

Oral therapy is necessary in more widespread infections or cases that have failed topical treatment.  Oral terbinafine or itraconazole is usually the preferred first-line treatments and is expected to clear the condition in about 2 to 3 weeks.

Suggested oral regimens include one of the following (for adults):

- Terbinafine: 250 mg orally once daily for two weeks

- Itraconazole: 100 mg once daily for 2 weeks or 200 mg once daily for one week; give capsules with food

- Fluconazole: 150 to 200 mg once weekly or 50 to 100 mg/day for 2 to 4 weeks

- Griseofulvin: 500 to 1000 mg once daily for 2 to 4 weeks
