An interprofessional approach is needed to deal with patients with biliary tract cancer, which includes a team of oncologists, radiologists, gastroenterologists, and experienced surgeons to manage such challenging tumors. Tumors that are not advanced can be treated with surgical resection. For unresectable tumors, multiple treatment approaches are available such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, palliative treatment, targeted molecular therapy, and immunotherapy. Recent clinical studies and data suggests promising results of immunotherapy and targeted molecular therapy.
