Coronary artery anomalies can cause signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia in adults but are far less common than atherosclerotic coronary lesions that induce ischemia. Rarely, a transseptal course of an interarterial anomaly can be associated with dysrhythmia. Sudden cardiac death in athletes and young adults can occur secondary to a coronary artery anomaly but is less common a cause than is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy induced fatal ventricular dysrhythmia.
