An iris coloboma is a hole in the iris usually due to incomplete closure of the fetal fissure during organogenesis. Colobomas can range from a simple hole in the iris to more severe involvement of the posterior pole, coloboma of the optic nerve of the choroid of the retina.CHD7 gene that regulates chromatin remodeling.

Traumatic mydriasis is usually the result of blunt injury to the eye and can present with iris sphincter tears that alter the shape of the pupil in the affected eye. Treatment initially involves cycloplegia to prevent posterior synechiae in patients with iritis. Patients are then observed clinically for the return of function. If the function does not return, and the patients are symptomatic, surgical intervention can be considered. Ocular trauma can also cause pupillary miosis though this is less common than mydriasis and tends to be related to anterior chamber inflammation.
