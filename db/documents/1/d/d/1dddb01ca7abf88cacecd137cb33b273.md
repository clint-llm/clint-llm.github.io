Temporal mandibular joint (TMJ) dislocation can occur as a result of atraumatic etiologies or trauma to the mandible. Factors leading to atraumatic dislocation can include anything that results in forceful, over-opening of the jaw, such as yawning, seizures, or repeated mastication, as well as underlying anatomic causes such as ligamentous laxity, aberrant anatomy, or connective tissue disorders. Atraumatic causes can include very ordinary daily activities like laughing, yawning, singing, vomiting, kissing.

Risk factors for TMJ dislocation are important in identifying possible causes of the dislocation and the risk of recurrence. Risk factors include previous dislocation, structural or anatomic deficits, connective tissue disorders that affect stability (e.g., Marfan syndrome, Ehler-Danlos syndrome, muscular dystrophy, orofacial dystrophy), neurodegenerative or neurodysfunctional disorders (e.g., Huntington disease, multiple sclerosis or epilepsy), increasing age, and changes in the patient's dentition.
