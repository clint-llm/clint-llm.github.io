Neurogenic shock can be a difficult diagnosis to make and requires meticulous investigation. Neurogenic shock is most commonly associated with a blunt cervical spine injury. Identification of traumatic cord injury is vital to the investigation of neurogenic shock. Providers should ascertain the mechanism of injury, the presence of midline spinal tenderness, a distracting injury that may take attention from a spinal area, loss of consciousness, neurologic deficits, or intoxication that may misconstrue the exam, as these are associated with a vertebral injury. Though neurogenic shock should be considered only after a hemorrhagic shock has been ruled out in a traumatic patient, the presence of vertebral fracture or dislocation raises the concern for a neurogenic shock. Bradyarrhythmia, hypotension, flushed warm skin are the classic signs associated with neurogenic shock. The joint committee of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) and the International Spinal Cord Society (ISCoS) proposed the definition of a neurogenic shock to be general autonomic nervous system dysfunction that also includes symptoms such as orthostatic hypotension, autonomic dysreflexia, temperature dysregulation.Â A focal neurologic deficit is not necessary for the diagnosis of neurogenic shock.
