Respiratory depression is the most potentially dangerous adverse reaction of opioid administration. The incidence is low with commonly used doses, being dose-dependent for both hydrophilic and lipophilic opioids. The overall risk of respiratory depression after neuraxial opioids is less than 1%, very similar to that of opioids administered via the parenteral route.
