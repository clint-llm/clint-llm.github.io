Thin layer chromatography can be performed on gastric aspirate and urine samples to evaluate for strychnine poisoning. Blood testing is unreliable, due to the transient nature in which strychnine is found in the blood after any route of ingestion. Other blood assays should include basic metabolic panel, arterial or venous blood gas, lactate, and urinalysis. Tests should focus on assessing for hyperkalemia, acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure.
