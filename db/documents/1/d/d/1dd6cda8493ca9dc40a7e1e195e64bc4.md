Pembrolizumab is FDA-approved for intravenous use. It comes in either a 50 mg lyophilized powder for reconstitution or a 25 mg/mL solution. Â The most common administration schedule is a 200 mg infusion given over 30 minutes every three weeks. Most monoclonal antibodies are dosed based on body size; however, studies have shown that pembrolizumab fixed-dosing provides adequate coverage and yields the advantage of reduced dosage errors, convenience, and less waste (for an expensive therapy).
