There are numerous indications for pericardiocentesis. Either blunt or penetrating traumatic injuries may cause accumulation of blood in the pericardial space (hemopericardium) and cardiac tamponade. Penetrating trauma to "the box" (the region of the anterior chest delineated superiorly by the clavicles, inferiorly by the costal margin, and laterally by the nipple line) from projectiles or sharp-tipped objects has the potential to injure any of the structures in the area and cause pericardial tamponade. Pericardiocentesis is indicated in blunt or penetrating trauma patients who present with hemodynamic instability, cardiac arrest - most commonly used or pulseless electrical activity (PEA) or asystole, or evidence of pericardial effusion on the Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam and hypotension without another clear etiology. This procedure is performed emergently at the bedside as a temporizing measure to stabilize the patient and facilitate transfer to the operating room (OR) where definitive treatment, such as the creation of a pericardial window or thoracotomy and surgical pericardiotomy, can be performed. If the pericardiocentesis is unsuccessful, a bedside thoracotomy can be performed to allow for pericardiotomy and drainage of pericardial tamponade.
