The most common presenting signs and symptoms of different small bowel cancers are generally vague in nature. Most of these neoplastic processes include chronic or recurrent abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, or signs consistent with further complications from the cancerous lesions that may include gastrointestinal bleeding or obstructive-type symptoms. Patients with NETs may have more unique symptoms that may help increase the clinicianâ€™s index of suspicion and lead to earlier diagnosis. This is primarily because certain NET tumors are associated with carcinoid syndrome. The associated products of the tumor can cause a series of symptoms that are otherwise not seen with small bowel cancers. Therefore, the differential diagnosis includes irritable bowel syndrome, peptic ulcer disease, esophagitis, inflammatory bowel disease, lipomas, hemangiomas, functional abdominal pain, and adenomas.
