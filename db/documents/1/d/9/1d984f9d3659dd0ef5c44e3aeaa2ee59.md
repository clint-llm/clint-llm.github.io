Traditionally, ependymomas are classified using the World Health Organization (WHO) system to classify tumors of the nervous system. This histological grading commonly aids in predicting the clinical and biological behavior of central nervous tumors. In ependymoma, however, the molecular and genomic profiles may provide more accurate information than only using histological grade.

Tumor grading using the WHO classification system for nervous system tumors is based on different histological grades, this classification by itself would often not provide a reliable estimate of clinical course in patients with ependymoma. With increasing information about molecular pathogenetic mechanisms in ependymomas, the 2016 classification for nervous system tumors from WHO now includes in their classification the presence or absence of specific genetic alterations, RELA fusion-positive or negative, for ependymomas.

There are nine molecular subgroups described in ependymomas, which correlate with different anatomical locations, genetics, and demographic characteristics. These new findings offer the opportunity of potentially improving the classification, management, and prognostic information for ependymomas based on their molecular subgroup.

No current molecular or immunohistochemical markers are in routine use in the diagnostic workup for patients with ependymoma.
