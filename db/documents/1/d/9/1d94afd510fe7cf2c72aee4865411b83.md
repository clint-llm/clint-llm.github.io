Colesevelam comes in three major forms that are available to patients. Healthcare providers have the option of choosing an oral tablet formulation, a prepared suspension, as well as a recently approved chewable bar form. The recommendation is to take either once or twice daily to achieve therapeutic effects. Also, patients with susceptibility to fat-soluble vitamin and folic acid deficiencies should take the vitamins at least 4 hours after taking colesevelam to allow for proper absorption of the vitamins. This principle also applies to statins. Statins need to be taken at least 4 hours after taking colesevelam. Patients should be counseled on proper fluid intake once started on colesevelam.

- Chewable bar
