Patients presenting with an animal bite or scratch should receive an X-ray of the affected area to evaluate for any fractures, retained foreign body, signs of osteomyelitis, or signs of necrotizing infection. A complete blood count (CBC) can be ordered to look for evidence of immune response to infection. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and c-reactive protein (CRP) may also be ordered to assess for inflammatory response and osteomyelitis risk. Wound cultures can be collected to identify local infection and blood cultures if there is a concern for systemic infection. In cases of suspected osteomyelitis, a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) can be ordered to further evaluate. If septic arthritis is a concern, arthrocentesis should be performed for confirmation. For those presenting with respiratory complaints, a sputum culture may aid in a definitive diagnosis. Patients presenting with symptoms of meningitis should undergo lumbar puncture, and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture should be sent to determine the ultimate pathogen.

The recommended medium on which to grow Pasteurella multocida is 5% sheep's blood agar at 37 degrees celsius. The bacteria are gram-negative, non-motile coccobacilli that are facultative anaerobes. Most strains are penicillin-sensitive and test positive for catalase, oxidase, indole, sucrose, and decarboxylate ornithine.
