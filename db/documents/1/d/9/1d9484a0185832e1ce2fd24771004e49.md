Rapid administration of sodium bicarbonate may increase intravascular fluid volume, leading to acute pulmonary edema. Additionally, the medication must be administered judiciously in those with congestive heart failure, significant renal disease, or sodium retention due to exacerbation of sodium retention and edema.

Sodium bicarbonate administration in a rapid infusion or as large boluses can result in acute metabolic alkalosis resulting in reduced serum ionized calcium. This acute shift in ionized calcium can result in tetany. This severe alkalosis is potentially treatable with ammonium chloride. Hypocalcemia may be addressed with calcium gluconate. An addition of 0.9 % NS infusion and potassium supplementation may also be indicated.
