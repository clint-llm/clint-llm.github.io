Radiation therapy is delivered via high-energy x-rays targeted at the disease site using linear accelerators. In contrast to curative radiotherapy delivered in multiple small doses, palliative treatments require lower total doses, focusing on relieving symptoms derived from the mass effect, particularly in tumors on the spinal cord. By utilizing largely daily doses, practitioners can decrease the overall treatment burden and shorten the course of therapy.

New techniques such as targeted stereotactic radiotherapy will deliver more focused therapy to a smaller area and thus minimize damage to surrounding healthy tissue.
