The index of refraction (n) is an essential parameter in optics that determines the speed by which light travels through a medium other than a vacuum. A vacuum, like is present in outer space, is the only medium in which electromagnetic waves experience no dispersion and travel at the speed of light c. Traveling through all other media slows the sine propagation wave of light, and thus the resultant speed is given by the index of refraction: n = speed of light (c) / speed of light in material (v).

The index of refraction is an important parameter used in optics to determine the angle by which light is reflected and refracted through different materials. It is an intrinsic property that is fundamental in the development ofÂ eyeglasses, contact lenses, and optical equipment such as cameras and telescopes.
