Postoperative patient monitoring is essential for recognizing some early complications, especially CSF leakage from dural sac tears; it is crucial to evaluate the wound by looking for some suggestive signs, such as wound bulging or CSF sinus. Clinical signs of CSF leakage, such as headache and dizziness, should raise alert from possible complications.

The presence of erythema, increased pain, or swelling may raise the suspicion of wound infection.
