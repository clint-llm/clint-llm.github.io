Botulism is a rare, potentially fatal syndrome of diffuse, flaccid paralysis caused by botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) which is elaborated by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. It begins with cranial nerve paralysis which progresses down to the symmetrical weakness of the trunk and extremities with eventual flaccid paralysis. This activity describes the evaluation and management of botulism and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the Clostridium species in the etiology of botulism.
- Describe the pathophysiology of botulism.
- Explain the use of antitoxin in the management of botulism.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by botulism.
