Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a zoonotic disease transmitted through aerosolized feces from rodents. The disease is caused by various serotypes within the Hantavirus genus in the Bunyaviridae family. It is endemic to Asia and Europe; the most common serotypes causing HFRS are Dobrava, Hantaan, Seoul, and Puumala. Annual cases range from 60,000-150,000 and correlate with rodent populations. The outcome of the disease is usually self-limited with a very low morbidity rate. The mortality rate varies from 0.43% to 15% depending on the strain of the virus.

In North America, the most common serotype is SNV-Sin Nombre Virus, and in South America, the Andes virus; these strains are associated with a different outcome of a disease called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
