Loratadine-induced cardiotoxicity, including cardiac arrhythmias and prolongation of QT-interval, is possible in patients, especiallyÂ in the elderly, if taking a higher than the recommended 24-hour dose. Though rare, overdosing on loratadine may cause significant toxicity, including agitation and symptoms of the anticholinergic syndrome. Symptoms include, but are not limited to, mydriasis, urinary retention, tachycardia, and skin flushing.

Treatment protocol for loratadine toxicity may involve providing emesis (except for patients with impaired consciousness), supplemental oxygen, and cardiac monitoring. Clinicians may give sodium bicarbonate to treat arrhythmias and prolonged QT intervals in patients with suspected toxicity. Alleviation of agitation can be with benzodiazepines due to their high therapeutic index. Adults with symptoms of anticholinergic poisoning due to loratadine toxicity may receive physostigmine antidote therapy (recommended dose is between 0.5 to 2 mg IV). The recommendation is that only a medical toxicologist should supervise antidote therapy.

There is no evidence of abuse potential or dependency with loratadine.
