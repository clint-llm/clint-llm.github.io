The proximal portion of the genitourinary tract, consisting of both kidneys and upper ureters, is supplied by the renal arteries, which are branches of the abdominal aorta, located at the L1-L4 vertebrate. The majority of the distal genitourinary tract, including the distal ureters, bladder, and urethra, receives vascular supply via the superior and inferior vesical arteries, which are branches of the internal iliac artery.

The testes and epididymis arterial supply, venous, and lymphatic drainage reflect the path of descent of the gonad. As the testes descend through the spermatic cord, the relevant artery, veins, and lymphatics follow the testes into the scrotum. The lymphatics of the pelvic organs derive their names from their associated blood vessels. The four primary pelvic lymph nodes are located adjacent to the pelvis, consisting of the external iliac, internal iliac, sacral, and common iliac lymph nodes.
