Eyelid retraction is usually acquired and associated with thyroid eye disease.

Facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) paralysis from any cause will result in lagophthalmos (without eyelid retraction). The more common etiologies include Bell palsy, sarcoidosis, cerebral ischaemic event, and post-surgical tumor excision. Orbicularis oculi paralysis will lead to the unopposed action of the levator. For the lower lid, this will cause loss of tonus, which will result in a scleral show and a progressive ectropion. Epiphora (tearing) occurs due to lacrimal pump malfunction and increased reflex lacrimal secretion secondary to corneal exposure.
