The polysomnogram serves as an important diagnostic tool for PLMD.

According to ICSD-3, the diagnostic criteria includes the presence of PLMS of more than 15 periodic limb movements per hour in adults and more than five periodic limb movements per hour in children causing sleep problems, which impacts daytime functioning in the absence of any other sleep, psychiatry, or medical illnesses. In studies with sleep complaints related to other medical conditions, a cut-off of 5 distinct events recorded per hour of sleep is considered pathologic PLMS.

As per the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) scoring criteria, each LM (limb movement) is scored if there is an increase in anterior tibialis EMG activity of >8 microvolts above the EMG activity at rest, lasting for a duration of 0.5 to 10 seconds. If there are > 4 LMs, then they can be included as PLM series (PLMS) as long as they are 5 to 90 seconds apart.

Once again, PLMD is a diagnosis of exclusion.

Recently, it has been recognized that PLMS can be caused by upper airway resistance syndrome or mild obstructive sleep apnea, and correction with CPAP improved symptoms. However, it is interesting to note that the masking of underlying PLMS in severe OSA worsens during treatment. Also, CPAP by itself can cause PLMS.
