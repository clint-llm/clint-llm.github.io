The presence of plaque in large-caliber arteries like aorta and its branches leads to spontaneous, traumatic, or iatrogenic plaque rupture. Plaque debris, including cholesterol crystals, fibrins, platelets, calcified debris embolize, and lodge into small to medium arteries causing mechanical occlusion. The combined effect of mechanical occlusion and resultant inflammation from the foreign body, leukocyte infiltration, and complement activation, leads to end-organ damage.
