Several papers dealing with the regional incidence of peritonitis induced sepsis in a particular population have reported inconclusive data which cannotÂ be extrapolated to generalized observations. However, when dealing specifically with a sub-group of peritonitis, the reported incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in a patient with ascites is estimated to be between 7% to 30% per year.
