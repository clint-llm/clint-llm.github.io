The knee contains multiple bursae, which are sac-like structures consisting of synovial fluid. The bursae are located between the skin and bony prominences. Some of these bursae communicate with the knee joint. Fluid accumulation in the intra-articular space and bursae of a joint is called an effusion. Small, asymptomatic effusions can occur in healthy individuals. Larger joint effusions indicate pathology. In the knee joint, trauma, overuse, infections, systemic causes, or changes in osteoarthritis may cause the effusion. These large effusions can also result in cysts within the popliteal fossa. A knee effusion can consist of synovial fluid or hemarthrosis.
