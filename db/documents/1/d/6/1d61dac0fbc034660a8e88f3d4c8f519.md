The primary differential diagnosis of subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is sclerema neonatorum, extensive and symmetric sclerosis of the skin and subcutaneous fat; it is mostly reported in ill premature newborns; sclerema neonatorum is associated with congenital malformations, while SCFN is a self-limited benign condition, sclerema neonatorum carries a high mortality rate. Another differential diagnosis is neonatal scleroderma, which presents with progressive edema of the lower extremities; even though it is considered benign, gastrointestinal or respiratory infections usually precede it.
