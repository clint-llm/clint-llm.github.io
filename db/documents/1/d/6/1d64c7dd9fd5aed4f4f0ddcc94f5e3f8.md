A cystocele, otherwise known as a protrusion of the bladder, occurs when the bladder descends into the vagina.

Pelvic floor muscles and endopelvic fascia provide anatomical support of pelvic viscera in women. This pelvic support consists of three muscles: pubococcygeus, puborectalis, and iliococcygeus, which form a complex called the levator ani muscle group. In addition, the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments provide additional support and stabilization. A prolapsed or herniated bladder can have a negative impact on the quality of life, affecting daily functioning and sexual activity. In some women, symptoms may be mild and require no treatment and, in some cases, prolapses regress following menopause.
