WHO classification based on the mechanism or underlying etiology:

- Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) can be idiopathic (i.e., primary pulmonary hypertension) or due to the congenital left to right intracardiac shunts, portal hypertension, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, collagen vascular diseases, HIV infection, drugs, and toxins.

- Group 2: Pulmonary hypertension secondary to left heart disease, valvular heart disease, restrictive cardiomyopathy (pulmonary venous hypertension). The most common causes are mitral valve stenosis and left heart diastolic dysfunction.

- Group 3: Pulmonary hypertension associated with advanced chronic lung disease and environmental hypoxemia. It includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, sleep-disordered breathing, and alveolar hypoventilation disorder.

- Group 4: Pulmonary hypertension due to chronic thrombotic disease, embolic disease, or both

- Group 5: A miscellaneous complex group of disorders leading to PH which includes metabolic disorders, systemic disorders, hematologic diseases, and miscellaneous causes.
- Metabolic disorders such as glycogen storage disease, thyroid disease, Gaucher disease
- Systemic diseases include sarcoidosis, vasculitis, neurofibromatosis type 1.
- Hematologic diseases like myeloproliferative disorders.
- Other causes include end-stage renal disease on dialysis, extrinsic compression of pulmonary vessels, embolization of the tumor
