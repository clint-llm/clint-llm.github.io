In response to several high-profile healthcare-associated deaths in the USA, the National Academy of Sciences in 2000 produced a document entitled “To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System.”

Reliably safe care, and therefore the minimization of preventable medical errors, requires both a high degree of technical proficiency amongst individual healthcare workers but also highly effective non-technical skills – otherwise known of human factors, as discussed above. Human factors encompass person-specific skills and interpersonal skills, including communication, task management, crisis resource management, task prioritization, decision-making, and leadership.

The aviation industry has long a pioneer in utilizing evidence-based and validated training to improve safety. A 1979 paper demonstrated how experienced flight crew can, and have, made significant errors, not due to lack of technical skills, but through poor communication, lack of effective leadership, and inconsistent decision making.

Human factors can be formulated, assessed, or evaluated during a simulation. Within anesthesia, human factor SBME has long been central to both training and practice.
