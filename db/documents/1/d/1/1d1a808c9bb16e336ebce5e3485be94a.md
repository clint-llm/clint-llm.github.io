As a rare subtype of a rare tumor, Leydig cell tumors had traditionally been considered a very infrequent diagnosis, comprising only 1% to 3% of total testicular tumors removed each year.

Interestingly, more contemporary data sets have questioned the rarity of Leydig cell tumors and have found them to be a potentially more common entity with estimates of the tumor incidence being anywhere from 14% to 22% of all surgically removed testicular cancer.
