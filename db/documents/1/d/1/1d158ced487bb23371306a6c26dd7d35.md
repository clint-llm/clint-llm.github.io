Nitric oxide, which exists in a gaseous state and is composed of two atoms, can be found in the natural environment and within parts of the human body. Its administration in the clinical scenario as an inhalant (iNO) for adjunctive rescue therapy and improved oxygenation of persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborns (PPHN) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

**Clinical Indications**

The FDA approved a new inhaled nitric oxide product in 1999 and another in 2019 for the treatment of:

- Term and near-term infants((>34 weeks gestation) with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with clinical or echocardiographic signs of pulmonary hypertension to improve oxygenation and lower the risk of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation

**Off-label Indications**

- ARDS: ARDS d presents with acute-onset hypoxemia in the presence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates of non-cardiac origin. ARDS can lead to the development of life-threatening hypoxemia. In addition, pulmonary hypertension complicates the course of neonatal respiratory failure and is reportedly present in over 10 percent of these cases. However, researchers failed to demonstrate a decrease in mortality, length of hospitalization, or an improved outcome with the use of iNO in ARDS patients; therefore, it is not recommended by the FDA for regular use.

- Acute Bronchiolitis: This condition is the leading cause of infant mortality and is generally treated with supportive measures. iNO has anti-viral, enhances oxygenation, and is safe in infants. In a study, high dose iNO (160 ppm) proved to be the safe, well-tolerated, reduced length of stay in the hospital and displayed rapid improvement of oxygen saturation compared to the standard treatment. However, more research is needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of iNO in patients with acute bronchiolitis.

- COVID-19: Exogenous nitric oxide effectively lowers systemic hyper inflammation and oxidative stress, enhances arterial oxygenation, and restores pulmonary alveolar cellular integrity to control pulmonary damage. Therapy with iNO could pave the way for better management of COVID-19 before the commencement of disease-related complications.
