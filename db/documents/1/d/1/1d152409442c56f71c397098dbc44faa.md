Enophthalmos is defined as the posterior displacement of the globe in an anteroposterior plane within the orbit. This is to be distinguished from hyperglobus, hypoglobus, esoglobus, and exoglobus.

Clinically, the eye may appear sunken and have a deeper superior sulcus with either an upper eyelid retraction, upper eyelid ptosis, or, often, both, eyelid retraction with lagophthalmos as well as ptosis because of the three-dimensional change in the orbital tissues and the eyelid. Dryness may be the initial presenting symptom. Some patients will notice the asymmetry in their eye positions. It should be remembered that the normal position of the globe varies according to age, ethnic background, and sex. African orbits are shallower than White orbits, resulting in the appearance of relatively "proud eyes."
