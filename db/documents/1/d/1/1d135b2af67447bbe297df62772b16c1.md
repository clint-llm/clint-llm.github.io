As discogenic pain is axial, other causes of axial back painÂ should be considered. This includes facet arthropathy, paraspinal muscle sprain or strain, ligament sprain or strain, lumbar spondylosis, lumbar spondylolysis, and lumbar spondylolisthesis. Therefore a detailed history and careful physical exam, along with pertinent imaging, can help to make the correct diagnosis.
