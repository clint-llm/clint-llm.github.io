Dentists must select the impression material according to the patient's therapeutic need. The materials used for primary impressions for removable complete dentures include alginate, impression compound, and elastomers in putty consistency.

Alginate and elastomers are used to impress the oral tissues in partial removable and fixed dentures. Addition-cured silicones and polyether are the most commonly used impression materials in implant prosthodontics.
