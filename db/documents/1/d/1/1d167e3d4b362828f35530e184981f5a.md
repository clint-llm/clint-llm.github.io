Patients should also be encouraged to make appropriate lifestyle modifications that comprise of smoking cessation, avoidance of alcohol abuse, and increase mobility in an effort to minimize their risk of developing osteoporosis. Early anticipatory counseling of patients is likely to improve patient follow-up rates and adherence to future therapy.
