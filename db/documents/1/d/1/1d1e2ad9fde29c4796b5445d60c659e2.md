CSTÂ is a standard test for the evaluation of AI. A CST test can be performed with a high dose of cosyntropin or a low dose. High dose CST (250 mcg) is considered a gold standard to diagnose primary AI. 1 mcg CST or low dose CST can be considered in the evaluation of secondary or tertiary AI.

Baseline or morning ACTH (adrenocorticotropin hormone) levels help to differentiate primary from secondary AI.
