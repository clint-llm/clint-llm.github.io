Muscle and myocutaneous flaps are common reconstructive options for patients with acquired traumatic or oncologic defects. While fasciocutaneous and perforator flaps have emerged as elegant reconstructive options for various indications, muscle and myocutaneous flaps remain workhorse flaps, especially in large or infected wounds. Therefore, knowledge of flap anatomy and surgical techniques is paramount for plastic and reconstructive surgeons. This activity reviews muscle and myocutaneous flaps, highlighting the anatomy, technique, pitfalls, and role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of muscle and myocutaneous flaps.
- Describe the technique in regards to muscle and myocutaneous flaps.
- Review appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of muscle and myocutaneous flaps.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance muscle and myocutaneous flap surgeries and improve outcomes.
