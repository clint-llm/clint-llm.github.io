The management of Nipah virus infection is best accomplished via an inter-professional team approach that includes infectious disease specialists, clinicians, mid-level practitioners, and nursing staff. The infection has no cure, and treatment options are limited. The patient needs consultations from numerous specialists. Since no effective treatment exists, prevention is critical. This can be achieved by preventing exposure to bats, pigs, and bat-bitten fruits in addition to avoiding consumption of date palm sap. In the context of an outbreak, adequate infection control practices are necessary to prevent human-to-human transmission. The outcome for patients with NiV infection is guarded. In addition to infectious diseases clinicians, the involvement of a neurologist and subsequently a physiatrist may be required due to the residual neuropsychiatric deficits following recovery.
