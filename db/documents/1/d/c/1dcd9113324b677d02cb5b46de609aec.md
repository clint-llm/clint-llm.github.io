Pituitary adenomas (both micro and macroadenomas) constitute the most frequent indication for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. Surgery is indicated for nonsecreting adenomas that cause vision disorders, hypopituitarism, pituitary apoplexy, or demonstrate the progression on serial imaging. Surgery is recommended for secreting adenomas that do not respond to medical management. Other sellar lesions can be approached similarly, such as Rathkeâ€™s cyst, craniopharyngiomas, meningiomas, chordomas, or metastatic lesions.
