The pungent smell of ammonia in the air is detectable at concentrations as low as 5 ppm. Hence, significant exposure to ammonia in the air without the patientâ€™s knowledge is rare. Ammonia concentrations of up to 100 ppm in the air are tolerated well for up to several hours.

There is minimal absorption of ammonia into the systemic circulation if there is short-term (under 120 seconds) inhalational exposure.

Ingested ammonia readily absorbs into the bloodstream, and the liver plays a significant role in its elimination.

There is currently no evidence suggesting that dermal exposure to ammonia results in any form of systemic absorption.
