Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are non-surgical procedures that are recommended once a patient is diagnosed with unstable angina, non-ST elevated myocardial infarction, or ST-elevated myocardial infarction. The goal of this procedure is toÂ relieve the narrowing or occlusion of the coronary artery. PCI includes procedures such as angiography, angioplasty, and stent placement and should be done within 90 minutes of the patient's arrival to the emergency department. These procedures are done in the cath lab to help visualize the obstruction and revascularize the heart. Angioplasty allows the visualization of the arteries and localizing of the narrowing of the coronary artery. After narrowing is identified a balloon angioplasty can be done where a balloon is inflated causing expansion of the narrowed artery and improving blood flow. A stent is a mesh tube that can be placed to keep the coronary artery open.
