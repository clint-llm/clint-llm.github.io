The clinical significance of a healthy bladder is difficult to overstate.  An estimation using data from 2008 postulated that >45% of people over the age of 20 had been affected by lower urinary tract symptoms at some point in their lives, with an estimation for 2.8 billion people to be affected by 2018.

Overactive bladder, a common condition, is characterized by a recurrent sensation of a need to urinate occurring both day and night that impairs one quality of life and occasionally causes incontinence.

Bladder outlet obstruction is a condition in which urine is prevented from flowing from the bladder through the urethra and to the outside world.  While there are numerous potential causes of this phenomenon, one of the most common is that of benign prostatic hyperplasia.  The prostate is a male reproductive organ inferior to the bladder, and the urethra runs through the center of the prostate.  Many men experience hyperplasia of their prostate late in life, such that the organ expands and compresses the urethra, thereby making urination difficult or even impossible.
