The prognosis of these patients depends on the risk of malignancy and the presence of neurocutaneous involvement.

The risk of melanoma in patients with congenital melanocytic nevi has historically been overestimated. Prognosis in small and medium-sized single CMN is usually excellent, and their lifetime risk of developing melanoma is estimated to be around 1%, being extremely rare before puberty. In patients with large or giant CMN, the risk is estimated to be around 5%, being greater as the size increases. In the latter, melanomas tend to arise earlier on in life (during childhood).

The other associated condition which has a huge impact on morbidity and mortality is neurocutaneous melanosis. The estimated risk in big and giant CMN ranges between 10% to 33% and, as with melanomas, is greatly dependent on size and satellitosis. The prognosis is much worse when neurological signs and/or symptoms are present.
