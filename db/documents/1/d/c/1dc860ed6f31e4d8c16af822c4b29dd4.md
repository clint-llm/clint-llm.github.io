Isoproterenol is a beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist indicated primarily for bradydysrhythmias. The administration and subsequent post-administration monitoring of this medication are complex and necessitate an interprofessional approach to its usage. This activity covers isoproterenol, including mechanism of action, pharmacology, adverse event profiles, eligible patient populations, contraindications, monitoring, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of isoproterenol therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify indications for the use of isoproterenol.
- Describe the mechanism of action of isoproterenol.
- Review potential complications arising from the use of isoproterenol.
- Summarize the importance of an interprofessional team approach to the use of isoproterenol.
