The lack of proper knowledge and even a formal definition of Castleman disease made it challenging to assess its epidemiology. A study was conducted in 2008 by Simpson which showed that:

- The incidence of UCD is 16 per million patient-years and affects all age groups.

- The incidence of HHV-8 associated CD varies widely, but it is more common in HIV-positive men.

- The incidence of iMCD is 5 per million patient-years.

Another study conducted in the US from 2000 to 2009 concluded that out of 59 patients with MCD, 61% were males with the mean age of 53 years, and 68% were white.

The hyaline-vascular variant is more common than the plasma-cell type, comprising 91% of the total cases.

Its predominance in any specific sex or race is not noted. Castleman disease usually develops in most patients before reaching 30, although the age range is broad.
