Scabies is classically diagnosed by visulization of the rash as well as patient history.

Scabies can be diagnosed by visualizing mites in skin scrapings in the stratum corneum

Other methods, such as the non-invasive  videodermatoscopy, can be utilized during the physical examination

Dermoscopy, also called dermatoscopy, is similar to videodermatoscopy but is handheld and does not require connection to a computer.  Dermoscopy is now commonly used in most Dermatology offices in the United States.  Dermoscopy has a lens with up to 10x magnification. With a dermatoscope, it is  possible to observe the burrow structure in scabies, also known as the "jetliner trail."  The burrows are also poorly visualized in dark skin or hairy areas.

If the diagnosis is ambiguous, a skin biopsy can be used to confirm the diagnosis. In addition to biopsy, a newly developed serologic test can aid in the diagnosis of scabies
