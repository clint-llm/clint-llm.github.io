In general, leukocytosis is routinely identified in the acute setting, such as in an emergency room or urgent care facility. Quick identification and treatment of the driving force for the leukocytosis prompts the resolution of the CBC abnormality. Prognosis is, therefore, good in these patients. In more severe cases, where the driving force of the leukocytosis is an underlying malignancy or myeloproliferative disease, the prognosis depends on staging. As such, the lymph node, organ system involvement,Â and the genetic profile of the disease process, determine prognosis.
