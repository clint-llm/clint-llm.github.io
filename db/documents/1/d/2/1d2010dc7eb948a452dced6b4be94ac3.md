Conjunctivitis results from inflammation of the conjunctiva. The cause of this inflammation can be due to infectious pathogens or non-infectious irritants. The result of this irritation or infection is injection or dilation of the conjunctival vessels; this results in the classic redness or hyperemia and edema of the conjunctiva. The entire conjunctiva is involved, and there is often discharge as well. The quality of discharge varies depending on the causative agent. In bacterial conjunctivitis, the surface tissues of the eye are colonized by normal flora, such as staphylococci, streptococci, and corynebacteria. The primary defense mechanism against infection is the epithelial covering of the conjunctiva. Any disruption in this barrier can cause infection.
