Intervertebral disc degeneration is a cellular, pro-inflammatory, and molecular process. Aging, genetic disposition, and abnormal mechanical loading all contribute to the acceleration of this process. Disc pain arises from sensitization secondary to the ingrowth of nerve fibers within annular fissures. In a healthy disc, neural penetration through the annulus is about 3 mm. Degenerative discs have shown penetration deeper into the inner third and even nucleus of the disc.
