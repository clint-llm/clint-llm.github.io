With many people favoring water-based activities, it is inevitable that cone snail toxicity will occur in some individuals. The majority of patients with cone snail toxicity first present to the emergency department and hence, the triage nurse must be aware of its potential morbidity and mortality. Quick triage and prompt notification of the emergency department team are key to survival. Over the years, fatalities have been reported to several species of cones, with death occurring within 5-8 hours after envenomation. The vast majority of patients will develop a chronic wound with ulceration that often requires meticulous care. The key to cone snail toxicity is patient education. Anyone who is into water sports should have some idea what cone snails look like and should only handle them with proper gloves. Swimmers should be urged not to carry a live cone on them close to the skin. Finally, when going to the beach, it is important for the public to wear appropriate footwear and avoid reaching blindly under rocks or crevices.
