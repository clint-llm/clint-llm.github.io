The management of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia requires an interprofessional approach as the differential diagnosis is large. The primary care physician, nurse practitioner, internist, pediatrician and gastroenterologist are most likely to encounter patients with Gilber syndrome and Crigler Najjar syndrome. The former is a benign condition that requires no treatment. The key is patient education and avodiance of medications that interfere with liver function. Crigler Najjar syndrome is managed in multiple ways including exchange transfusion, phototherapy and sometimes liver transplantation.Â Gene therapy could be the most prominent therapy given the recent succes with other severe genetic disorders. Because Crigler Najjar syndrome type 2 is much less severe, lifelong phenobarbital therapy is sufficient. Phenobarbital, by inducing UGT1A1, can reduce the bilirubin concentration by more than 25%. The outcomes for Gilbert syndrome are excellent but for patients with Crigler Najjar syndrome, the outcomes are fair to guarded.
