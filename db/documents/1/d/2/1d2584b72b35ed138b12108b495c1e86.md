Histologically, keloids are characterized by abundant, tightly packed but disorganized collagen. The epidermal layer may appear normal, but the dermis becomes persistently infiltrated with inflammatory cells and hypo-cellular collagen bundles, made up of large, thick, and wavy type-I and type-II hyalinized fibers. Hypertrophic scars are distinguished from keloids by the presence of finer, more organized collagen bundles that run parallel to the epidermal surface. Additionally, infiltration of inflammatory cells may be present in fresh hypertrophic scars but decreases as the scar ages.
