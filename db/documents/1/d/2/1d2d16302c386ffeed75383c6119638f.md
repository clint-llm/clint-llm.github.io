Most clinicians do not have extensive experience in the management of GT, but medical literature suggests certain approaches that can be beneficial. All of the following approaches have evidence levels of V.

When possible, HLA-matched, single donor, leukocyte-reduced platelets should be used for patients with GT to reduce the development of anti-HLA antibodies. Patients receiving platelets should also be assessed for antibodies periodically. For girls and women of reproductive-age, platelet transfusion should be avoided if possible to prevent the formation of antibodies.

The perioperative use of rFVIIa is both safe and effective.

Antifibrinolytic agents should not be used in GT patients with bleeding in the urinary tract due to potential clots.

An interprofessional approach involving specialized nursing, social workers, and physical therapy can promote recognition of abnormal bleeding and teach techniques for self-management. Nurses looking after patients post-surgery should monitor for bleeding and ensure that rFVIIa is available in the blood bank

Appropriate athletic activities, vocational training, and other psychosocial issues can also be addressed.

Only through such a team approach can the morbidity of GT be reduced.
