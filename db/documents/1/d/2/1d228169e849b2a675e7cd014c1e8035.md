Lenvatinib exerts its mechanism of action via inhibition of multiple receptors of tyrosine kinases: VEGFR-1 (FLT1), VEGFR-2( KDR), VEGFR-3 (FLT4), FGFR-1, FGFR-2, FGFR-3, FGFR-4, PDGFRa, RET, and c-KIT. Tumor growth is dependent on the development and proliferation of new blood vessels (neovascularization).

The inhibition of the VEGF receptors prevents tumor angiogenesis, and the inhibition of FGFR, RET, PDGFRÎ±, and KIT prevents the further proliferation of malignant cells.
