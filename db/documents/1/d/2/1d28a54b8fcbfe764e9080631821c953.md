The diagnosis of cholangitis is characterized by clinical presentation, abnormal laboratory results, and imaging studies implying infection and biliary obstruction.

The first-line imaging study of choice is abdominal ultrasonography. It is highly sensitive and specific in examing the gallbladder and investigating for biliary duct dilatation. A classic finding of ascending cholangitis is the thickening of the walls of the bile ducts, dilatation of biliary ducts, including the common bile duct, as well as evidence of cholelithiasis and pyogenic material. It can help differentiate intrahepatic versus extrahepatic obstruction. However, a normal abdominal sonogram does not necessarily rule out ascending cholangitis. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) can be performed as an adjunct to investigate co-existing pathologies such as hepatic/pancreatic tumors, metastasis, or hepatic abscess.

The most sensitive modalities for detecting common bile duct stones are magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). MRCP is a noninvasive imaging study that can detect the cause and the level of biliary obstruction, including choledocholithiasis, strictures, and biliary dilatations.
