Intraosseous access has been available to the medical community since 1922 and has had limited use since the advent of intravenous catheters.

IO access can be accomplished by training pre-hospital personnel and all hospital physicians and nursing staff. For IO access to serve as a useful life-saving tool to its full extent, the entire health care team, including the operating room and inpatient staff, requires education on the process. Unfortunately, to this date, only small case series have been conducted to try and increase training and comfort level in establishing IO access.
