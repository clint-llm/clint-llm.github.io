Various diseases have been included in the differential diagnosis of Cogan syndrome due to the audiovestibular and ocular associations such as these:

- Susac syndrome (retinocochleocerberal vasculopathy or SICRET syndrome-small infarctions of cochlear, retinal, and encephalic tissue): Susac syndrome is characterized by lesions of the cochlear, retinal, and cerebral arterioles.

- Congenital syphilis: The Hutchinson triad of congenital syphilis includes Hutchinson teeth (notched peg-shaped upper incisors), interstitial keratitis, and sensorineural hearing loss.

- The association of necrotizing vasculitis after acute serous otitis media and acute episcleritis described by Sergent and Christian in 1994 (with no inner ear involvement)

- Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome is identified by diminished visual acuity, sensorineural hearing loss, and uveoencephalitis with meningism (which sometimes occurs in Cogan syndrome), poliosis, and alopecia. Meningism may occur in patients with Cogan syndrome. However, alopecia and poliosis do not.

- Polyarteritis nodosa

- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis often involves the ear and eye. Vasculitic changes involving small vessels, pulmonary infiltrates, glomerulonephritis, hemorrhagic lesions of the nose and throat, and the presence of c-ANCA (cytoplasmic ANCA) are usually seen in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously called Wegner granulomatosis). Cogan syndrome patients do not fulfill these criteria.

- Takayasu arteritis

It is challenging to diagnose Cogan syndrome during the early stages of the disease. However, the coexistence between Cogan syndrome and other autoimmune disorders has been revealed by a literature review, such as the presence of Cogan syndrome with rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and tubulointerstitial nephritis, and uveitis (TINU syndrome).

A study showed that four patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) presented with Cogan syndrome, ocular inflammation, and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) after the GI (gastrointestinal) symptoms.

Differential diagnoses of interstitial keratitis include syphilis, chlamydia, leprosy, tuberculosis, brucellosis, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, herpes, measles, mumps, pox, parasitic infestation (onchocerciasis), and autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis).
