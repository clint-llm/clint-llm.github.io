When performing Mohs micrographic facial surgery, many different closure techniques are available to preserve function and cosmesis.

The traditional design of the island pedicle flap is a triangle with a short base and 2 long legs of near equal length; variations exist. The base of the triangle is advanced into the position of the primary defect. This flap design allows for convenient closure of the secondary defect because the 2 longer legs of the triangle are already positioned for a linear closure. The original incisions of the flap are V-shaped, with the resulting suture lines in the shape of a Y, which gives the island pedicle flap another name—the V-Y advancement flap.
