Treatment of orthostatic syncope depends on the underlying cause and includes both nonpharmacological and pharmacological measures.

Nonpharmacological treatment measures aim at either increasing venous return to the heart while decreasing venous pooling in the lower extremities or increasing blood volume to maintain blood pressure in the supine position and include

- Avoiding physical deconditioning in the elderly which helps maintain muscle tone in lower extremities

- External compression devices such as waist-high compression stockings, abdominal binders

- Physical maneuvers such as lunges, calf-raise, squatting, leg crossing

- Review of home medications and discontinue diuretics and vasodilators if possible

- Increase water and fluid intake to about 2-3 liters per day, avoid dehydration, bolus water ingestion of 500mls of water in 2 to 3 minutes especially in the morning

- Dietary measures including liberal salt diet 6-10g/day, eating small frequent low carbohydrate meals a day in case of postprandial orthostatic hypotension, avoid alcohol intake

- In patients with autonomic dysfunction and supine hypertension, raising the head of the bed to 10 degrees at night reduces nocturnal diuresis

- Life style modification by avoiding activities that increase core temperature and cause peripheral vasodilatation such as avoiding saunas, spas, hot tubes, prolonged hot showers and excessive high intensity exercise

The goal of pharmacological treatment is to increase blood volume or peripheral vascular resistance and includes

- Midodrine 2.5 to 15mg orally once to thrice daily

- Fludrocortisone 0.1 to 0.2mg daily in the morning titrated up to 1mg daily if needed

- Pyridostigmine 30 to 60 mg orally trice daily

- Yohimbine 5.4 to 10.8mg orally trice daily

- Octreotide 12.5 to 50 ug subcutaneously twice daily

- Cafergot such as caffeine 100mg and ergotamine 100mg
