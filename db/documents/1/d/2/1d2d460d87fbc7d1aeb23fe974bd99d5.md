Patients generally require 30 to 60 hyperbaric oxygen treatments, depending on the severity of their condition. There are daily, 90-minute sessions at hyperbaric pressure. Treatment pressures vary among providers, ranging from 1.5 atmospheres absolute (ATA) to 2.5 ATA.  There is a paucity of research regarding optimal treatment pressure and protocol.
