Diagnosis requires radiography in the two orthogonal projections, but since the thumb lies on a different plane from the rest of the hand,

- Robert view (true AP of the thumb)

- The forearm is in maximum pronation with the dorsum of the thumb lying against the cassette

- True lateral of the thumb

- Hand pronated 30 degrees; radiographic beam angled 15 degrees distally

- Oblique view

In particular, the Robert view allows us to obtain an accurate anteroposterior view; it requires that the back aspect of the thumb rests on the radiographic plate, with the hand in overpronation. The Bett view, instead, allows an actual lateral image of the tarsometatarsal joint. It can be obtained by placing the palmar aspect of the hand on the radiographic cassette, pronated with an inclination between 15 and 35 degrees with the beam inclined at 15 degrees distal to proximal.

CT scans obtained with collimation, and slice thickness between 0.5 and 1.0 mm, complemented by multiplanar and 3D reconstructions can provide valuable information for surgical planning.
