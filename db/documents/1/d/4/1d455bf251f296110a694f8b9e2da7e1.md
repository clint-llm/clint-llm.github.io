The supraorbital nerve block is a procedure best performed with a group of professionals in the healthcare team, which includes a physician or midlevel provider, nursing staff, and a pharmacist. The staff must elicit a full history and physical exam including a history of adverse drug reactions, in particular, prior history of local anesthetic use to identify alternatives if needed. Approaching this procedure in a team-based manner will help to limit adverse events. The interprofessional team paradigm is optimally suited to manage these cases, leading to better outcomes via coordination and communication between clinicians, nursing, pharmacists, and other ancillary personnel.

The following list should be assessed and adequate provisions identified before the start of the procedure:

- Assessment of any adverse events that the patient may have had to local anesthetics

- Calculation of maximum weight-based dosage of chosen local anesthetic

- Consultation with a pharmacist about the availability of a lipid emulsifying agent in the event of local anesthetic systemic toxicity

- Patient monitoring for signs and symptoms of local anesthetic systemic toxicity such as the perception of a metallic taste, altered mental status, respiratory distress, seizures, tachycardia, dysrhythmia, atrioventricular block, or cardiovascularÂ collapse.

- Availability of staff trained in advanced cardiac life support in the event of cardiovascular symptoms or emergency.
