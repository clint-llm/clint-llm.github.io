An interdisciplinary team involving nurses, palliative care, care coordinators is extremely important in addition to medical, surgical, and radiation oncologists in the management of patients with GBM. Primary care physicians and neurologists most commonly refer patients with this condition.

Due to the aggressive nature of the tumor, palliative care should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is made. It is important to determine the goals of care and wishes of patients throughout the continuum of care. Discussions about prognosis need to be done with patients and families to set expectations about the disease. The overall goal is to maintain the patient’s quality of life as long as possible with adequate management of symptoms. Nevertheless, discussion regarding newer therapies and clinical trials should be done in eligible patients.
