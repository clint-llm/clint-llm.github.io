Vision-threatening complications associated with poorly controlled diabetic retinopathy include diabetic macular edema, tractional retinal detachment, and vitreous hemorrhage

Management of Diabetic retinopathy with anti-VEGF therapy, laser photocoagulation, or vitrectomy surgery is also not free of complications.

**Complications Related to Anti-VEGF Medications**

- IOP spike

- Cataract formation

- Iatrogenic retinal/posterior capsular tear

- Vitreous hemorrhage

- Rhegmatogenous Retinal detachment

- Worsening of traction over the macula if given in patients with tractional retinal detachment

- Endophthalmitis

**Complications Related to Laser Photocoagulation**

- Vitreous hemorrhage

- Exudative retinal detachment and choroidal detachment if too many laser shots are given in a single sitting

- Reduction of contrast sensitivity, peripheral vision, and night vision after pan-retinal photocoagulation

- Permanent scotomas in the visual field

- Worsening of preexisting macular edema or development of macular edema after laser/PRP

- Chances of worsening optic disc pallor

**Complications Related to Vitrectomy**

- Cataract formation

- IOP spike because of gas or oil tamponade

- Iatrogenic secondary tears leading to rhegmatogenous retinal detachment

- In chronic macular edema, the macular roof is very thin, so there are chances of deroofing at the macular region leading to a macular hole
