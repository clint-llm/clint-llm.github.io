The sciatic nerve exits the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen before coursing into and through the posterior thigh, deep to the long head of biceps femoris, before bifurcating at the superior border of the popliteal fossa into the tibial and common peroneal nerve.

The posterior femoral cutaneous nerve also exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. However, the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve travels superficially to the long head of the biceps femoris before traveling down the midline of the posterior thigh deep to the fascia lata until it reaches the popliteal fossa.
