Hypomelanosis of Ito (HI), or pigmentary mosaicism, was previously named incontinentia pigmenti achromians. The disease is currently named hypomelanosis of Ito to distinguish this condition from incontinentia pigmenti. HI was first described by Ito in 1952. Hypomelanosis of Ito represents the third most frequent neurocutaneous disease, after neurofibromatosis type 1 and tuberous sclerosis. This activity explains when this condition should be considered on a differential diagnosis, articulates how to properly evaluate for this condition, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of hypomelanosis of Ito.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with hypomelanosis of Ito.
- Summarize the differentials to consider for hypomelanosis of Ito.
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of hypomelanosis of Ito.
