General treatment of leprosy usually involves multiple drug therapy (MDT) to ensure no microbial resistance. The MDT treatment is effective against M. leprae and quickly gets the patient to a non-infectious state. Using MDT also decreases the chances of drug resistance M. leprae and M. lepromatosis.

Historically, the initial antimicrobial agent used for the treatment of leprosy was promine,****a sulfone. This sulfate's efficacy was further proved with dapsone, its related compound.

In 1982, the World Health Organization published a recommendation to use dapsone and rifampin for tuberculoid leprosy and in combination with clofazimine for managing the lepromatous disease.

The effectiveness of the agents has been clinically proven alongside mouse trials.

**Selecting a Regimen**

Treatment is as follows:

- Tuberculoid disease: dapsone (100 mg daily) with rifampicin (600 mg daily) for 12 months

- Lepromatous disease: dapsone, rifampicin, and clofazimine (50 mg daily) for 24 months

The treatment approach presented by the United States National Hansen's Disease Program (NHDP) is usually the general consensus.

2018 WHO guidelines now advise for uniform MDT with the recommendations for treatment from 1998 still maintained. This entails administering three drugs: rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine, to individuals despite the classified type. The variance from prior regimens is the added daily clofazimine for the paucibacillary disease. There is no change in multibacillary cases. Using the uniform MDT treatment decreases the chances of undertreatment of individuals with multibacillary disease misclassified as paucibacillary.

Other potential drugs that could be used include minocycline, ofloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and clarithromycin. There is still work that needs to be done to demonstrate the overall effectiveness of these drugs.

**Clinical Response and Follow Up**

Once therapy has begun, the general erythema and hardening of the lesions should dissipate after some months. However, it may be a few years for lesions involving cutaneous features to fully clear. All cases vary, depending on the general number of lesions and severity of the infection.

Bacilli killed by the treatment are removed from tissues at a decreased rate, lasting for a couple of years.M. leprae and M. lepromatosis. Also, just having bacilli present in tissues cannot give us a definitive understanding of whether treatment is effective or not. There has been no established correlation between treatment and removal of dead bacilli from bodily tissues.

Studies have shown that M. leprae is killed at an elevated rate once in contact with rifampin and other drugs.

**Treatment of Immunologic Reactions**

Immune reactions are inflammatory responses that generally ensure before treatment, during, or even months to years after completion of the regimen.

Type 1 reaction (T1R)

Mild cases without symptoms such as ulceration or neuritis could be carefully approached with assistive care. Severe situations with neuritis may need immediate clinical intervention with corticosteroids to minimize irreversible nerve damage.

Secondary treatment options for type 1 reactions include cyclosporine, useful for patients non-responsive in corticosteroid treatment.

Type 2 reaction (T2R)

Mild reactions can be cared for through carefully planned clinician management. In severe type 2 reaction cases, immediate treatment with corticosteroids is administered to prevent nerve damage. Prednisone, approximately 40 to 60 mg/day, is given until the case is under control. It is recommended to gradually decrease the dosage, over at least a two-week window, after control is achieved. If extended therapy is necessary, adjusting doses to an alternate day schedule could lower the overall side effects of the steroids.

Clofazimine is valuable in chronic cases with minimal effect for acute type 2 reactions. Increasing doses of approximately 300 mg daily for one month with a gradual decrease to 100 mg/day in one year. Clofazimine may have a role in protection against some reactions since it's the reduction in usage after MDT gained popularity. Clofazimine prescription in the US requires an investigational drug request to the FDA.

Thalidomide is considered an extremely viable option to treat type 2 reactions, but it could affect women capable of childbearing.

Alternative Agents

Cytokines are not readily used for leprosy treatment, but there is some data discussing the effect of using these agents. Inhibition of TNF-alpha has been seen to help in several cases of type 2 reactions.

Research of lepromatous leprosy through intralesional injection of interferon or interleukin-2 has shown signs of promise. But an inadvertent increase in the percentage of type 2 reaction development has been seen with the administration of this treatment.
