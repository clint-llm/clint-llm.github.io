As CdLS affects multiple organ systems, complications may arise that require specialty-specific treatment, including:

- **Gastroenterology**: Repair of pyloric stenosis, malrotation, volvulus, or congenital diaphragmatic hernia may be necessary in early infancy.

- **Urology**:Â Cryptorchidism or hypospadias are often seen in males with CdLS during infancy. Orchidopexy to repair cryptorchidism is recommended, due to the risk of testicular carcinoma.

- **Nephrology**: Renal cyst and renal hypoplasia are common complications in children with CdLS.

Signs of premature aging, including osteoporosis or canities (greying of hair prematurely), have been observed in young patients with CdLS.
