During epidural anesthesia or analgesia, the epidural space is reached by inserting an epidural needle between two vertebrae in the cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine. The needle goes through different layers of tissues to reach the epidural space.

The boundaries of the epidural space are:

- Upper limit: foramen magnum

- Lower limit: sacrococcygeal membrane

- Anterior: posterior longitudinal ligament

- Posterior: ligamentum flavum, the capsule of the facet joints, and the laminae.
