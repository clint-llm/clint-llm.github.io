**Bedside Procedures in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)**

When a neonate is not stable enough to transport to the operating room, the anesthesia care team or pediatric anesthesiologist may be asked to provide bedside anesthesia and resuscitation. This involves special considerations including, use of a ventilator in the NICU, possible use of an oscillator for ventilation, and transport of all necessary anesthesia OR equipment to the NICU for use including, but not limited to: blood/fluid warmers, forced air warmers, overhead heat lamps, transwarmer, IV tubing, anesthesia medications (paralytics, fentanyl, midazolam), pressor medications, saline flushes, endotracheal tubes, intubation equipment (LMA, video laryngoscope, regular laryngoscope, stylet), and oral/nasal airways. It is important to recall that in the NICU, one may not have the necessary setup and may be dependent on bringing in everything that is needed. It is common among pediatric anesthesiologists to keep the NICU respiratory therapist present for a case in the NICU or nearby in case of emergency, as it is not common to manage NICU vents and/or high flow oscillators and may require assistance making urgent ventilation adjustments. Common challenges encountered while doing surgical cases in the NICU include:

- Keeping the baby warm

- Lack of access to IV and arterial lines

- Lack of access to the airway

- Difficulty drawing an arterial blood gas with the NICU tubing

- Rules in the NICU regarding giving medications with blood products (which is common practice in the OR but not in the NICU)

It is also recommended to bring IV tubing or at least an IV extension set to use for IV push medications, as the NICU commonly gives medications via infusion on a pump using high-pressure tubing, which is difficult to flush, making it challenging to give IV medications, fluids, and blood when they are needed quickly.Â  With appropriate planning and communication, surgical cases can safely take place in the NICU.

**Complications**

Neonates undergoing anesthesia are at risk for postoperative apnea.
