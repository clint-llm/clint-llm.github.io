Given the rarity of this congenital condition, a precise etiology implicating the development of annular pancreas is not well defined, but AP is considered to be an embryopathy.

Several theories, some dating back to the 1900s, have been proposed to explain the formation of AP, but none of them have convincingly been able to explain the same in all cases of AP. However, immunohistochemistry studies have shown the origin of AP to be of the ventral pancreatic anlage.
