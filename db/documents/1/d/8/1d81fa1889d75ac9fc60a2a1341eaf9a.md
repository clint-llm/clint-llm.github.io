The anesthesia team may have to control for significant variations in blood pressure secondary to the manipulation of the carotid bulb during surgery.

For patients with complex medical comorbidities, the expertise of hospitalists is invaluable in ensuring patients' other health parameters are maximized both before and after surgery.

Nursing staff caring for head and neck patients should be familiar with common postoperative complications so they can be identified promptly. Additionally, front-line caregivers can provide important information on a patient's mental state, as depression and anxiety are commonly seen in head and neck cancer patients.

Nutritionists may assist in ensuring that patients are given adequate nutrition to promote healing and prevent wound breakdown. Speech-language pathologists also play a crucial role in rehabilitating swallowing, which is frequently affected after surgery.

The care of head and neck cancer patients requires a truly interprofessional effort with open lines of communication to maximize patient outcomes.
