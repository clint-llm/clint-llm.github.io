Several NLRP3 mutations have been grouped into a category of autosomal dominantly inherited autoinflammatory diseases termed cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS). This group of autoimmune inflammatory conditions also includes familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome, Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID). However, these mutations are at different genetic loci.

The NLR family of proteins encodes for inflammatory-based molecules in numerous cell lines. NLRP3 is expressed specifically in peripheral leukocytes as well as ocular structures such as lens epithelium and corneal endotheliumÂ and plays a central role in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

It has been shown that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is associated with corneal inflammation, and inhibition of NLRP3 has been shown to improve corneal wound healing.NLRP3 genes were shown to have decreased corneal scarring and significantly decreased opacity grade after sterile burn injury compared to mice with functional NLRP3 genes.

As a result of the inflammatory effects, swelling and edema may develop in the corneal stroma. Proposals exist, suggesting that this occurs secondarily to a vasogenic process, thus resulting in visual impairment and symptomatic halos and diplopia.
