The limits of topically applied oxygen therapy using advanced systems are still under investigation. For example, it remains yet to be determined if there is a lower limit on ischemia in a wound that would restrict the use of topically applied oxygen. However, because the oxygen diffuses directly into the tissue, it is hypothesized that there may be no lower limit for the therapy to work.

There are few contraindications or precautions for the therapy, yet the same precautions that apply to moist wound therapy apply to topical oxygen. Ensure the wound is free from necrotic tissue.Â  Removing eschar and slough allows oxygen to access the wound directly and has been shown to improve results.
