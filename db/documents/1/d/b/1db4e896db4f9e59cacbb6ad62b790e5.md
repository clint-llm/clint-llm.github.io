Any electively extubated patient may need reintubation either due to ventilation failure or extubation failure in up to 10% cases. Conservative medical measures and close monitoring are initially tried in symptomatic patients with extubation failure, before proceeding to reintubation mostly happening within the first 24 hours of extubation. The patient and relatives should be made aware of this fact in all planned extubations. In patients admitted to the ICUs, the risk of post-extubation laryngeal edema prompting reintubation in about 10% of the cases needs to be explained to family in advance. The patient and family also need to be aware that tracheostomy would be indicated in a small number of cases who fail to improve after 24-48 hours of anti-laryngeal edema measures after a reintubation event.
