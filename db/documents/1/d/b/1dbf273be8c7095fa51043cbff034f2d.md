The exact etiology of hypergammaglobulinemia (polyclonal gammopathy) is unknown. However, the association between hypergammaglobulinemia (polyclonal gammopathy) and a heterogeneous group of conditions is well established. Among them, liver disease is the most common cause.

Other important causes are autoimmune conditions such as Sjögren syndrome, hematologic disorders such as idiopathic neutropenia, nonhematologic malignancies, infections such as human immunodeficiency virus, IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), and iatrogenic (intravenous immunoglobulin therapy).
