Esophageal cancer is a deadly malignancy with very low survival, even with treatment. Over the past few decades, the rates of squamous cell cancers have declined, but the rates of adenocarcinoma have gradually increased, chiefly because of GERD. The care of a patient with esophageal cancer is interprofessional. The inability to eat affects every organ in the body. At presentation, the majority of patients are severely emaciated. The role of the nurse in looking after these patients after surgery and teaching about prevention cannot be overemphasized. In the postoperative period, the nurse is responsible for initiating J-tube feeds, weighing the patient, and monitoring for side effects. Many patients develop a whole host of complications that gradually leads to poor quality of life. A dietitian should be involved in the care of these patients to ensure they are receiving adequate calories. The key preventive measure that nurses should emphasize is the discontinuation of tobacco and abstaining from alcohol. In addition, patients should maintain a healthy body weight and get GERD treated. Since many of these patients are not able to eat, the pharmacist is responsible for ensuring that the medications available are in liquid form so that they can be administered via the J-tube. Since the patients are weak and frail, consultation with a physical therapist and an occupational therapist is recommended.

**Outcomes**

For both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer, the prognosis depends on the stage. In general, the survival rates per stage are similar for both cancers.

Once a patient has positive lymph nodes, survival is decreased. Less than 20% of patients with esophageal cancer are alive at 5 years, with stage IV having the worst prognosis. [Level 2]

Surgery has slightly increased survival rates, but the postoperative complications are often serious, and the quality of life is poor.
