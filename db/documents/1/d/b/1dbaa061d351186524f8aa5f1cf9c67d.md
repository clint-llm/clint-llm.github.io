The following labs may be beneficial in the setting of cinchonism:

- Basic metabolic profile to assess for kidney/electrolyte abnormalities from diarrhea and vomiting

- Liver function testing to evaluate for hepatic dysfunction reducing clearance of medications

- Plasma quinine levels: Concentrations above 15 mg/L were associated with increased risks of permanent visual damage and cardiac arrhythmias.

The following radiologic studies may be beneficial in the setting of cinchonism:

- Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain if the patient is encephalopathic to rule out intracranial pathologic processes.

- Multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) may show response density reduction at all retinal locations.

- Optical coherence tomography may show thinning of the middle and inner retina by 25% to 35%, with preservation of the photoreceptor layer.

Electrocardiogram (ECG): Ventricular tachycardia is not part of the spectrum of cinchonism. Nonetheless, if there is evidence of cinchonism, an ECG should be obtained to assess for QT prolongation and evaluateÂ the risk of torsades de pointes.
