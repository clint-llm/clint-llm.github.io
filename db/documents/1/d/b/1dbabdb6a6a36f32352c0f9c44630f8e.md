The main disadvantage of manual blood pressure measurement utilizing Korotkoff sounds is human error, which may include an improperly placed sphygmomanometer, stethoscope, or missed Korotkoff sounds due to background noise or inattention. This simple procedure's variability is extensive and depends on multiple factors, including appropriate cuff pressure, stethoscope positioning, and sound cutoff.

A study performed at Chengdu University in China concluded that differences in stethoscope positioning resulted in Korotkoff sounds being heard earlier or later, resulting in a blood pressure reading higher or lower than the actual blood pressure. This same study, via multiple comparisons and trials, concluded the proper placement of the sphygmomanometer, which yielded the most accurate blood pressure readings, to be just above the elbow, with the stethoscope placed directly under the cuff.

Another issue of concern is the accuracy of Kortkoff sounds. Numerous studies have concluded that non-invasive blood pressure measurements tend to underestimate the true systolic blood pressure and overestimate the diastolic blood pressure. As of today, the cause of these errors is not fully known; however, it has been suggested that arterial stiffness may largely contribute to the recorded errors, meaning that the underestimation of systolic blood pressure will be more significant in patients with stiff arteries (as in atherosclerosis) than in patients with more compliant arteries.
