A pancreatic abscess is defined as a circumscribed intraabdominal collection of pus that is typically in the vicinity of the pancreas and contains little pancreatic necrosis. Infection is thought to occur via colonic translocation of bacteria. It usually develops in patients with pancreatic pseudocyst that become infected. Hence, its causative organisms are usually gram-negative flora bacteria, especially Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas, although gram-positive bacteria are also seen, most commonly Enterococcus. Patients that present with pancreatitis that do not improve after initial management and start developing systemic inflammatory response syndrome should increase the suspicion of some form of intraabdominal infection, especially of the pancreas.

Other causes might include penetrating peptic ulcers, gallstones, and excessive alcohol consumption because they increase the risk and the number of pancreatitis episodes. In rare cases, medications, blunt trauma, and the extension of abscesses from nearby structures can occur.
