Both these conditions are uncommon. Only a few cases have been reported in the literature. We feel this is both because the diagnosis may be easily missed if there are minimal symptoms or just under-reported when encountered and treated.

Whereas cilia incarnata internum will present with symptoms of a foreign body, patients with cilia incarnata externum will generally be asymptomatic. Some females may present with a complaint of a cosmetically unacceptable bump but without any other symptoms. Therefore, these external buried lashes will only be picked up if one looks carefully under the biomicroscope. There has been no evidence that rubbing of eyelids (in floppy eyelid syndrome, for example) or trauma predispose patients to either of these conditions.
