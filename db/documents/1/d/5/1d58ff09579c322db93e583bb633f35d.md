Many healthcare practitioners insert central lines. Central line placement is essential in caring for many critically ill and hospitalized patients. Like any procedure, it has its complications, some of which can be life-threatening. Complications of central line placement include pneumothorax, hematoma, bleeding, infection, and extravasation. Understanding this procedure's proper technique and potential complications can help minimize central line-associated complications and improve clinical outcomes. This activity reviews the indications, techniques, possible complications, and ways to reduce the risk of complications associated with central line placement to increase healthcare provider knowledge and ability of the procedure and improve clinical outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy that is relevant to central line placement.
- Outline the complications associated with central line placement.
- Summarize the equipment required for central line placement.
- Explain a structured, interprofessional team approach to provide effective care and appropriate surveillance of patients undergoing central line placement.
