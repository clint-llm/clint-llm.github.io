Hepatic hemangiomas are five times more common in females than males. They can be seen in any age group, but the majority are diagnosed in those between the ages of 30 to 50 years (60 % to 80%).Â  The prevalence may be higher, but since they are generally asymptomatic, they are not often diagnosed unless the patient is undergoing imaging of the abdomen for unrelated causes.
