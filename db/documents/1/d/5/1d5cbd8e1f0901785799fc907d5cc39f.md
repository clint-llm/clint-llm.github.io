Clinical signs and symptoms, a pregnancy test, and an ultrasound exam confirm the diagnosis.

**A pregnancy test** can be obtained using urine or serum hCG levels.

**Ultrasound exam** (transabdominal or transvaginal) classically demonstrates an empty gestational sac without an embryo.

An anembryonic pregnancy is established on endovaginal ultrasound technique when there is no discernable embryo seen in a gestational sac with a mean sac diameter of ≥25 mm.

Alternatively, an anembryonic pregnancy can be established when there is no embryo on a follow-up endovaginal scan:

- ≥11 days after a scan demonstrating a gestational sac with a yolk sac, but an absent embryo

- ≥ 2 weeks (14 days) after a scan demonstrating a gestational sac without an embryo or a yolk sac
