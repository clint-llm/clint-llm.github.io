Simulation fulfills the sentiment expressed by Dr. William Mayo nearly a century ago: “there is no excuse today… to learn on the patient.” It improves procedural skills among trainees and may lead to fewer patient complications and better clinical outcomes.et al. (2009) reported a reduction in catheter-related bloodstream infections following the implementation of a simulation training program of central line placement for internal and emergency medicine residents.

Healthcare is complex and requires a team approach; however, most health professional training occurs separately from one another. Interprofessional simulations are important because they foster teamwork, which is necessary for modern medicine.et al. (2017) identified aspects of interprofessional collaboration that led to good patient care. However, mutual lapses in the team and patient communication were apparent, which led to oversight of clinical changes and overall poor management. Even high individual ratings of medical knowledge among residents and nurses did not necessarily translate into effective team management and patient care.
