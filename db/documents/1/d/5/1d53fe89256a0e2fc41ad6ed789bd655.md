Cetuximab is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor with the following FDA-approved indications: colorectal cancer, metastatic, KRAS wild-type (without mutation), and head and neck cancer (squamous cell). 
Non-FDA-approved uses include colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR-expressing, advanced, and squamous cell skin cancer. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of cetuximab, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team for the treatment of patients with malignancies for which it is indicated.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the approved and non-approved indications for therapy with cetuximab.
- Outline the mechanism of action of cetuximab.
- Describe the adverse effects and monitoring for cetuximab.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients receiving treatment with cetuximab.
