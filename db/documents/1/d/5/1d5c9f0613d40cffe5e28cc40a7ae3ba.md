In certain patient populations, the nasoseptal flap is unavailable or ill-advised. Many extensive sinonasal tumors extend into the septal mucosa or sphenopalatine artery and branches, rendering it non-viable. Prior surgical history can be a contraindication in the case of posterior septectomy, sphenoid sinus surgery, and SPA ligation. Notably, prior uncomplicated septoplasty is not a contraindication to a nasoseptal flap.

When an ipsilateral nasoseptal flap is contraindicated, there are many alternatives. Often a contralateral nasoseptal flap can be utilized.

Alternatives to nasoseptal flapsÂ include inferior and middle turbinate flaps.
