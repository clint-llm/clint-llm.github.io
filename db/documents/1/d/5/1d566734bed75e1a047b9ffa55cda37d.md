Cystine stones are due to an inherited defect in the transport of the amino acid cystine leading to excessive excretion in the kidney, causing cystinuria. Cystinuria causes supersaturation in the kidney, predisposing to the development of stones. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of cystine stones and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of cystine stones.
- Describe the development of hematuria and acute flank pain in the history and physical examination of patients with cystine stones.
- Summarize the use of the sodium cyanide-nitroprusside test and other, newer tests in the laboratory screening and evaluation of cystinuria.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients affected by cystine stones.
