A visual acuity test is only one part of a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. The goal of the visual acuity test is to determine the visual clarity or sharpness of vision of a patient. This is tested using the ability to distinguish different optotypes (stylized letters or symbols) at a standard distance. This activity describes and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating patients who undergo visual acuity testing.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the indications for performing visual acuity testing.
- Describe the equipment required, technique, and documentation in regard to visual acuity testing.
- Identify barriers and special circumstances that may arise when selecting a method to test visual acuity.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients diagnosed with low vision by visual acuity testing.
