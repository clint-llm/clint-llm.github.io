Ramsay Hunt syndrome affects patients in a myriad of ways, with pain, paralysis, cochleovestibular symptoms, and behavioral health concerns all occurring commonly in the acute period. While most patients do recover the majority of their premorbid function when managed appropriately, long-term pain, facial dysfunction, scarring, and behavioral health concerns may all persist. For this reason, optimal patient outcomes occur when healthcare teams include members with expertise across a broad range of specialties. In the short term, primary care, otolaryngology, neurology, ophthalmology, and psychology/psychiatry are often required. In the long-term, facial plastic surgery or otolaryngology, pain management, ophthalmology, speech or physical therapy, and psychology/psychiatry may be needed. Patients who develop synkinesis may require regular visits over the course of many years with a physician or nurse who can administer botulinum toxin injections; it is critical to surround these patients with an experienced interprofessional team early on in the treatment process in order to provide the care and support they need to maximize their quality of life outcomes.[Level 1]
