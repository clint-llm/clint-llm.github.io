Other causes of dysphagia are much more common than Plummer-Vinson syndrome; even the presence of iron deficiency anemia or an esophageal web should not lead to a diagnosis of PVS. Tracheoesophageal fistula in neonates, injuries to the esophagus like blunt trauma or penetrating injuries, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), vascular rings, and diverticula are some of the conditions which can present with similar dysphagia and spectrum of symptoms. Motility disorders like scleroderma, achalasia and diffuse esophageal spasm may present with the esophageal web and dysphagia. Benign and malignant tumors of the esophagus can have a similar presentation.

Other conditions to consider in the differentials of PVS include the following:

- Heterotopic gastric mucosa with stricture

- Pill-induced stricture

- Hypopharyngeal bar

- Inflammatory conditions associated with webs, such as chronic graft versus host disease, blistering skin diseases, etc.,
