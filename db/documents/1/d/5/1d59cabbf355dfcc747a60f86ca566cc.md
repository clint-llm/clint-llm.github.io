Studies have shown BTMs to be useful in identifying patients in accelerated bone turnover states, establishing a prognosis for fragility fracture, and monitoring for treatment efficacy and regimen adherence.

There is considerable interest in BTM as a primary tool even after a year of pharmacotherapy. However, due to the multiple limitations of DXA scans, it is the current gold standard for assessing treatment response. Serial imaging is expensive and often of little utility to the clinician as changes in bone mass are visually challenging to perceive and are subject to human error when being measured. In contrast, BTMs respond rapidly to changes in tolerant bone turnover physiology and maintain constant levels in the setting of pharmacotherapy. Thus they are a clinically useful method for confirming continued patient compliance throughout the entire duration of treatment.
