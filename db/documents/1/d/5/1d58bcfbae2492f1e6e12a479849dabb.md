The gold standard for diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia is mesenteric angiography. However, computed tomography (CT) angiography is a sufficient initial diagnostic modality. Lab tests, including white blood cell count, d-dimer, and lactate can aid in the diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia, but clinicians should not solely rely on these tests. In fact, lactate and d-dimer are not very specific. A thorough history and physical examination, along with serial abdominal exams, are more important.
