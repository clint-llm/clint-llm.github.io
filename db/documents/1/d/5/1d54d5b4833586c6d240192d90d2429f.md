Beta-blockers are a broad class of medications that are used for various clinical benefits but also carry the potential for adverse effects. They are prescribed by clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, or PAs) in both outpatient and inpatient settings, largely for the treatment of cardiovascular-related illnesses. While a patient is admitted to an inpatient ward, monitoring the clinical effects and potential adverse effects is an interprofessional task. This is crucial because excessively high serum levels can have serious or even fatal consequences.

Nurses will generally be the first caregivers to take note of any unwanted effects, such as a change in vital signs. In contrast, outpatient settings differ in that the pharmacist may be the closest line of healthcare contact for a patient. The pharmacist will dispense the medication, perform medication reconciliation, verify dosing, and also advise other interprofessional team members and the patient of any potential adverse effects. It is also imperative to take note of any patients who are currently on beta-blockers as it provides a clinical context for potential symptoms. Many clinical trials have been conducted on beta-blockers and shown to prolong life in patients with cardiovascular disease.

The interprofessional healthcare team needs to prescribe, manage, and monitor the use of beta-blockers safely and effectively. [Level 5]
