During pregnancy, the extradural venous plexus can become engorged when the gravid uterus lay supine and restricts blood supply to the inferior vena cava. The blood would then shunt to the external venous plexus. Because of the increasing supply of blood to the area, some studies claim that fewer spinal anesthetics would be necessary during pregnancy.
