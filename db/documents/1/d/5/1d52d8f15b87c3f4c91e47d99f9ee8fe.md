A subdural hematoma is one of the intracranial injuries associated with abusive head trauma (AHT). Other injuries discovered with AHT include epidural hematoma, diffuse axonal injury and parenchymal injury among others. The result of epidemiological studies report these injuries under a common heading for child abuse. The data for abusive head trauma is more robust in Europe and the United-States than in other geographic areas, with an incidence up to 17 per 100.000 child-years. However, the incidence of subdural hematoma occurring in children less than 2 years reaches close to 13 per 100,000 child-years.  The risk of developing a subdural hematoma is higher below the age of one year (1:4761) according to a study in South Wales, England with an incidence reaching up to 21 per 100,000 child-years in this age group.  Developing countries report similar rates; however, the data is very limited. There is no reported difference in gender for a subdural hematoma in the early stages; however, accidental subdural hematoma caused by trauma in the teenage years favors the male gender.
