The main goal of forearm splinting is to prevent pronation and supination of the forearm. There are a variety of indications for forearm splinting, including soft tissue strains or sprains, fractures, joint dislocations, tendon lacerations, and compression neuropathy. Forearm splints aim to decrease pain and debility, prevent further injury and facilitate the healing process. In the acute setting, forearm splints are often used for distal radius and/or ulna fractures, radial and/or ulnar shaft fractures, flexor tendon lacerations within the forearm and radial nerve palsies that manifest with wrist drop. In the chronic setting, forearm splinting is commonly used for De Quervainâ€™s tenosynovitis, medial and lateral epicondylitis and any compressive neuropathies affecting the nerves in the forearm. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and complications of forearm splinting and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients requiring forearm splints.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the technique involved in forearm splinting.
- Describe the indications for forearm splinting.
- Review the contraindications to forearm splinting.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to improve the utilization of proper technique for forearm splinting.
