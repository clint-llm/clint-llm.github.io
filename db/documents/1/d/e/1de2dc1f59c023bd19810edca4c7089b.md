**Thermal Energy**

Some of the earliest uses of therapeutic ultrasound relied on the transference of thermal energy through supersonic waves. The energy of these waves causes vibration and heating of the tissues under the probe. The thermal energy absorbed, in turn, can induce dilation of blood vessels, which can increase cellular metabolism through oxygen and nutrient delivery. At low powers, many physical therapists can treat stretch pain and shoulder pathologies with the thermal energy produced by the ultrasound

**Cavitation**

Cavitation is the major mechanism that drives procedures like extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) and ultrasound assistive thrombolysis. Cavitation occurs when pressure variations exist within a liquid. The supersonic waves conducted from the ultrasound probe create pressure differences within fluids. As a result, bubbles form. Research models suggest that these bubbles burst as they run into solids, and this interaction can create a shockwave. These shockwaves exert force on the surface of solids and create motion within the fluid. Shockwaves in ESWL break up kidney stones and makes them easier to eliminate through voiding, while additional motion in the fluid can enhance the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapies.

**Conversion**

In ultrasound diathermy, ultrasound energy is converted to heat energy. The effect increases the temperature of the deeper tissues (muscle, fascia) for therapeutic purposes such as muscle relaxation.
