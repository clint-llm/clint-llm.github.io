The mental nerve supplies sensation to the lower lip, buccal mucosa, and skin of the chin ventral to the mental foramen. Mental nerve blocks allow for excellent anesthesia during a variety of procedures, including during dental work and intraoral and lower facial laceration repair. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques involved in performing a mental nerve block and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the indications for a mental nerve block.
- Explain the location of the mental foramen and the sensory distribution of the mental nerve.
- Summarize the intraoral and percutaneous mental nerve block techniques.
- Review the importance of improving coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients undergoing mental nerve blocks.
