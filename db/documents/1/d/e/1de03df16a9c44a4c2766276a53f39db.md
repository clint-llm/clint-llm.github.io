Even though HDV is dependent on HBV, its geographical distribution differs from that of HBV, partly due to the differences in mode of transmission. HDV is mainly transmitted via the parenteral route through exposure to blood or blood products. While sexual transmission (even in gay men) is infrequent, vertical transmission is rare.
