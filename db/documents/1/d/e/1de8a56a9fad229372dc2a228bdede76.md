Exercise is considered safe and beneficial in most pregnancies. It improves the health of the mother and the well-being of the infant. Continued exercise after delivery is recommended to diminish the pregnancy weight gain and overall health of the mother. The important thing is that any type of exercise is good during pregnancy. Some women may want to join a gym or have an exercise trainer. However, one can simply walk for 45 to 60 minutes every day, and that alone is as good as any exercise. Swimming is another great exercise that eases the pressure off the lower back. However, one should not get carried away with exercise; extreme physical activity is not recommended as this can lead to a fall and jeopardize the health of the fetus. As the pregnancy advances, the tolerable amount of exercise will lessen, but one should continue to walk. To avoid leg swelling during exercise, wear compression stockings. Exercise has repercussions way beyond just pregnancy- regular exercise can relieve stress, allows you to enjoy nature, lose weight, lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, and, more importantly, enhances self-confidence.
