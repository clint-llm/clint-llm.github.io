Anthropometric measurements are noninvasive and, as such, do not have any contraindications for their use. There are situations in which the measurements might give inaccurate results (such as acute illness) or be impossible to measure (such as a limb deformity or casting). Using anthropometric measurement in such situations can give falsely reassuring or alarming data and should be avoided.
