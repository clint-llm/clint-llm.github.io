Overall, the prognosis of NHL is dependent on the staging of the disease, histopathology, extranodal involvement, age, and performance status. Treatment response is monitored by clinical examination, laboratory values, and imaging studies. The international prognostic index (IPI) can be used for prognostification in DLBCL. Age more than 60 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance greater than 2, LDH elevated, clinical-stage III/IV, and more than 1 extranodal involvement correlates with decreased overall survival (OS).

DLBCL is an aggressive disease that can be cured in up to 50% of the patients who achieve a complete remission following treatment with first-line therapy. GCB cell type has a better prognosis compared to the ABC type. Double hit and triple hit lymphomas carry a poor prognosis when compared to DLBCL.
