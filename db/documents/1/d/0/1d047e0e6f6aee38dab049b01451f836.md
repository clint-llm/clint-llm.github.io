For young children: Place the patient supine with an assistant standing at the head of the bed, holding the patient in a frog-leg position.

For adults: Have the patient lay supine.

- Ultrasound increases the likelihood of successful suprapubic aspiration.

- Locate the midline pubic symphysis. The needle injection site is 1 cm to 2 cm above this spot in children and about 2 cm to 4 cm above this spot in adults.

- If using topical anesthesia, infiltrate a few milliliters of 1% lidocaine into the soft tissues and abdominal wall muscles.

- In children, insert the aspiration needle 1 cm to 2 cm above the midline of the pubic symphysis at a slightly cephalad angle, so it is 10 to 20 degrees from vertical. In adults, insert the aspiration needle 2 cm to 4 cm above the midline of the pubic symphysis at a slightly caudad angle.

- Advance needle while applying negative pressure until urine is aspirated. If using ultrasound guidance, visualize the needle entering the bladder.

- Remove the needle and transfer aspirated urine into a sterile collection cup.

- Apply a bandage to the aspiration site.
