Perinatal drug addiction is best managed by an interprofessional approach which provides optimal care for the infant and the mother. Various disciplines including occupational, nursing and physical therapy; social services and child life should be included in patient care in addition to physician and nursing staff. Appropriate post-discharge planning and follow-up care are as important as services during the hospital stay.

The outcomes for patients with addiction to drugs are guarded. Failure to comply with therapy is a problem and relapses are common.
