Initial laboratory workup should include a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, liver function test, and urinalysis. Inflammatory markers like erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) can be useful, though they are non-specific. More specific testing like viral hepatitis serology, serum cryoglobulins, ANCA, antinuclear antibody (ANA), and rheumatoid factor are necessary for selected patients. Serum lactic acid should always get tested in patients with suspected bowel ischemia. In patients with suspected DADA2, genetic testing and functional ADA2 estimation are a recommendation.
