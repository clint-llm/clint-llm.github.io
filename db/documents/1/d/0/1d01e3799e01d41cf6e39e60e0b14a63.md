Patients with gastrointestinal tuberculosis commonly present with the following complaints:

- Abdominal pain

- Anorexia

- Fever

- Change in bowel habits – diarrhea more common than constipation

- Nausea and vomiting

- Melena

However, some patients may not manifest any symptoms of GI TB.

On examination, they are commonly found to have the following signs:

- Weight loss

- Pallor and anemia

- Rectal bleeding

- Abdominal distension and ascites

- Hepatomegaly

- Splenomegaly

- Lymphadenopathy

- Abdominal mass

A family history of TB may not be evident in all patients. Thus, GI TB must be considered even in the absence of family history. Similarly, only a few patients may have concomitant pulmonary TB or a past medical history of TB.
