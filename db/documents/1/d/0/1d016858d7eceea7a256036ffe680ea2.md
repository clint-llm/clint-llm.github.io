DPP-4 is a ubiquitous enzyme that acts on incretin hormones, mainly GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (gastric inhibitory peptide), which maintain glucose homeostasis by increasing insulin secretion and decreasing glucagon secretion.

GLP-1 is a hormone secreted by enteroendocrine L cells of the small intestine, which lowers blood glucose by stimulating insulin secretion, reducing glucagon concentrations, and delaying gastric emptying.

These incretins are released within minutes of food intake, and DPP-4 degrades these hormones immediately due to their short half-life.Â By inhibiting the DPP-4 enzyme, DPP-4 inhibitors increase the levels of GLP-1 and GIP, which in turn increase beta-cell insulin secretion in the pancreas, thereby reducing postprandial and fasting hyperglycemia.
