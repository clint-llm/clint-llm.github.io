To perform echocardiography requires an interprofessional team that includes a cardiologist and an echo technician. It is vital to take a proper historyÂ and to perform a physical examination pre-procedure to determine the indication of the procedure. Communication between echo technicians and the cardiologist is essential, especially when there is a discrepancy in results.
