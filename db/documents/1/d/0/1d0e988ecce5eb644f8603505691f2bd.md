In patients with suspected or confirmed allergic interstitial nephritis, the mainstay of treatment is the discontinuation of the offending agent. Immunosuppressive therapy has been used to treat AINs, but the paucity of randomized controlled trials has limited the evidence for this approach. Several small, uncontrolled studies have suggested improvement with the use of steroids, with the most improvement noted in patients receiving steroids within seven days of drug withdrawal. A wide variety of treatment regimens have been employed, with steroid therapy administered for one to 12 weeks. There is currently no preferred standard treatment regimen, although experts agree that a short course of steroids (less than 12 weeks) is likely sufficient. Steroids are generally considered if there has been no improvement in renal function within three to seven days after withdrawal of the offending drug.

There have been small case series evaluating mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine as therapy options in glucocorticoid-dependent and resistant patients. Further study will need to be performed before this approach can be recommended.
