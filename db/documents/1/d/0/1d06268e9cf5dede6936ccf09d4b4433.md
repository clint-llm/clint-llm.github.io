The disease can lead to aneurysm formation, heart failure, MI, myocarditis, valvulitis, pericarditis with pericardial effusion, and rupture of the coronary arteries leading to hemopericardium and sudden death.

- Fever >8 days (most important risk factor)

- Recurrence of fever after a period of being afebrile for 48 hours

- Male (3 times more likely to develop giant aneurysms)

- Cardiomegaly

- <1 year old of age

- Asian or Pacific Islander descent

- Hispanic ethnicity

- Lower IgG levels

- Increased pro-BNP levels

- Increased TNF-alpha levels

- Thrombocytopenia at initial presentation

- Incomplete Kawasaki Disease Diagnosis

Aneurysms are defined as vessel diameter >3mm in children younger than 5 years old and >4mm in children older than 5 years.

In those who aneurysms resolve, there will be significant thickening of the vessel leading to an increased risk of premature coronary atherosclerotic disease.
