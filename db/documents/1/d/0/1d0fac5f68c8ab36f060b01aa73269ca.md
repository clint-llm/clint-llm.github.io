Caspofungin has significant assets, which include its safety profile and minimal drug interactions, but its use still requires the efforts of an engaged interprofessional team. These factors have led to its use in the treatment of several medical conditions.

- The clinical pharmacist ensures that concomitant administration of the patient’s current medications and caspofungin is permissible. In the event of drug-drug interactions, the clinical pharmacist should notify the prescribing physician, who can then decide the appropriate course of action based on the patient’s clinical findings and comorbidities.

- The obstetrician-gynecologist, as the use of caspofungin in pregnancy, is currently not recommended in the US.

Nursing will also play a significant role in inpatient administration, monitoring treatment effectiveness, checking for adverse effects of the medication, and reporting findings to the healthcare team.

Ultimately, adopting an interprofessional team approach with collaboration with infectious disease physicians and other sub-specialties, primary care physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare personnel is essential to facilitate the administration of the drugs based on current guidelines and maximize patient outcomes while minimizing any adverse reactions.
