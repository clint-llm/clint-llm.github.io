The posterior pituitary gland secretes ADH and oxytocin hormones synthesized in the hypothalamus and are released into the neurohypophyseal capillaries that surround the gland. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is synthesized in the supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus, while oxytocin is synthesized in the paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. Both hormones are packaged in secretory granules and travel down the axon where they are stored in the Herring bodies, neurosecretory structures found in the posterior pituitary. In contrast to the posterior pituitary, the anterior pituitary hormones are not stored. Instead, they are secreted into the surrounding capillaries moments after being synthesized by the hypothalamus. Once the hormones are released into the systemic circulation, they bind to their respective target sites and prevent diuresis and stimulate lactation and/or uterine contraction.
