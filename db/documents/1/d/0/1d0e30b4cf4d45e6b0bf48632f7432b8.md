Anesthesia via nerve block of the mental nerve just as it exits the mental foramen provides excellent anesthesia to the skin and soft tissues of the ipsilateral chin and the lower lip. This block is relatively easy to perform following the landmarks, is safe, and is simple to teach to operators. It can prevent the need for procedural sedation or the risk of tissue distortion occurring with local infiltration in an outpatient emergency, dermatology, or surgical setting.
