Pepsin depends on an acidic environment for protein digestion. Therefore, it is most effective at a pH of approximately 1.5 to 2. Low pH allows pepsinogen to cleave itself and form active pepsin. When it reaches the duodenum, though, it assumes an inactive form as the pH rises above 6. Nonetheless, protein digestion continues to take place throughout the small intestines via the effects of pancreatic enzymes: trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase. As such, pepsin is not essential for life, and protein digestion can still take place in the absence of pepsin. It is worth mentioning that pepsin remains structurally stable until at least a pH of 8. Therefore, it can always be reactivated as long as pH remains below 8. This characteristic proves relevant in the pathophysiology of laryngopharyngeal reflux, as discussed later in the article.

As mentioned earlier, the stomach provides pepsin with an ideal environment for protein digestion. Doing so helps with breaking down proteins into smaller nutrients, but at the same time, puts the stomach at risk of autodigestion. Therefore, a protective mechanism should exist to help maintain mucosal integrity. Fortunately, a mucus lining loaded with bicarbonate molecules helps protect against hydrochloric acid and creates a near-neutral pH environment that deactivates pepsin.
