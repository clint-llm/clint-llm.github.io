The use of retrograde cardioplegia for myocardial protection through the coronary sinus for procedures requiring cardiac bypass has limitations due to shunting through the Thebesian veins. The right ventricle and the posterior left ventricle do not receive enough flow when using this solution. Therefore, different modes of administration of retrograde cardioplegia have been developed and implemented to reduce the shunt flow.

Also, transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMLR) is a procedure for poor surgical candidates for coronary artery bypass grafting. TMLR involves the creation of channels in the left ventricular wall, providing a direct connectionÂ between the lumen of the chamber and the myocardial muscle to improve oxygen flow to myocardial tissue in advanced coronary artery disease.
