Transient synovitis (TS) is an acute, non-specific, inflammatory process affecting the joint synovium. Transient synovitis of the hip is a common cause of hip pain in the pediatric patient population. Although the condition is benign and self-limited, providers must recognize the critical importance of differentiating transient synovitis from acute infectious processes. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of transient synovitis and highlights the importance of collaboration among members of the interprofessional team to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify risk factors for transient synovitis. 
- Describe the differential diagnosis of transient synovitis. 
- Explain the management of transient synovitis. 
- Summarize the importance of improving coordination amongst members of the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by transient synovitis.
