Patients with recurrent laryngeal nerve injuries should be educated based on the suspected etiology. If the nerve injury occurred after surgical intervention where no transection of the nerve was noted, patients could generally be assured that the resulting vocal cord palsy is likely temporary. However, if concerning symptoms of underlying malignancy is present, the patient should be educated about the importance of follow-up. In general, patients with no concerning signs of underlying malignancy or trauma can be reassured that one of the leading causes of injury is idiopathic and typically not permanent. Although, as previously stated, patients should undergo appropriate workup as this is a diagnosis of exclusion.
