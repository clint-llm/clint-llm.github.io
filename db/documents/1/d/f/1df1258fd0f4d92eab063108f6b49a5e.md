Hydralazine should not be considered a first-line agent for essential hypertension but can be considered in hypertension refractory to other first-line medications. The newer hypertensive medications are more efficacious with fewer adverse effects. The recommended dosing of three to four times daily makes hydralazine patient compliance a challenge. Patients tend to tolerate this medication better when the hydralazine is given with a beta-blocker and/or diuretic.

IV hydralazine has had increased off-label use for the treatment of hypertensive urgency or emergency.

For African Americans with HFrEF, the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate can be added to medication therapy if the patient is already receiving an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or ARNI and a beta-blocker.

While hydralazine is relatively safe, it is important to be aware of some of its adverse effects, which, although rare, include triggering lupus-like syndrome.

An interprofessional team approach involving clinicians, mid-level practitioners, and specialists, plus the nursing staff and pharmacists, can help monitor the patient's therapeutic results, watch for potential adverse events, provide patient medication counseling regarding dosing and signs of toxicity, check for drug-drug interactions, and alert the prescriber. These types of interprofessional strategies will result in improved outcomes from hydralazine therapy. [Level 5]
