A staging system should be used to assess all pressure injuries. At this time, there is a lack of a universal classification system for pressure injuries, but the National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel staging system is widely used as listed below

- stage 1: non-blanchable erythema of intact skin and erythema remains for greater than one hour after relief of pressure

- stage 2: partial-thickness loss of skin with exposed dermis

- stage 3: full-thickness loss of skin tissue; subcutaneous skin and muscle may be visible

- stage 4: full-thickness loss of skin tissue; tendons, bone, and joints may be visible

- unstageable: full-thickness loss of skin tissue that is obscured by eschar or slough

- deep tissue: skin that is persistently non-blanchable, with maroon or purple discoloration

The laboratory studies listed below can be obtained to assess for conditions that can lead to the formation of non-healing injuries, such as infection, anemia, poor nutritional status, and diabetes

- comprehensive metabolic panel

- complete blood count with differential

- albumin and pre-albumin (to assess nutrition status)

- hemoglobin A1c

Wound cultures from superficial swabs may not be clinically useful as they usually reflect colonization rather than infection. Cultures from bone or deep tissue should not be used as a sole indicator of infection; they should be interpreted in the context of the clinical setting and other histopathological data.
