The etiology of lymphadenopathy includes the following:

- Infectious disease

- Neoplasm

- Inflammatory disease

- Autoimmune disease

- Inborn metabolic storage disorder

- Exposure to toxic/medication

Infectious disease can be of viral, bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, or parasitic etiology:

- Viral etiologies of lymphadenopathy include HIV, mononucleosis caused by EBV or CMV, roseola, HSV, varicella, and adenovirus.

- Bacterial etiologies of lymphadenopathy include Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Salmonella,  Syphilis, and Yersinia.

- Mycobacterial etiology of lymphadenopathy include tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAI)

- Fungal etiology of lymphadenopathy includes coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and Candida.

- Parasitic etiology of lymphadenopathy includes toxoplasmosis, Chagas, and many ectoparasites.

- Neoplastic causes of lymphadenopathy include both primary malignancies and metastatic malignancies: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, neuroblastoma, pediatric acute myelocytic leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, metastatic carcinoma of the lung, metastatic carcinoma of the viscera of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, metastatic breast cancer, and metastatic thyroid cancer and metastatic renal cancer.

- Autoimmune disease these causes of lymphadenopathy include sarcoidosis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), serum sickness, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

- Exposures to toxins and medications that are common causes of lymphadenopathy include the medications allopurinol, atenolol, captopril, carbamazepine, many of the cephalosporins, gold, hydralazine, penicillin, phenytoin, primidone, para methylamine, quinidine, the sulfonamides, and sulindac. Lifestyle exposures to alcohol, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and tobacco can cause cancers with secondary lymphadenopathy.

- Inborn metabolic storage disorders (including Niemann-Pick disease and Gaucher disease) are possible additional causes of lymphadenopathy
