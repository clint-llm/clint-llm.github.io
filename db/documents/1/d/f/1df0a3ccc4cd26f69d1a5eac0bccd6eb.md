Often the evaluation and treatment of a health professional with alcohol or drug addiction are challenging. Typical treatment occurs over months to years and includes follow up and monitoring, sometimes by legal entities. The most important predictor of successful treatment is when a healthcare professional admit the addiction and is willing to accept and stick with the prescribed treatment. In many cases, treatment is forced upon a health practitioner by a court or medical board, or it occurs due to peers, family, and friends encouraging therapy. Those who are self-motivated and have insight into their disease are much more likely to have a successful treatment outcome.

All healthcare providers need to be familiar with peer reporting requirements with alcohol or drug addiction within their institution and in their specific state. If someone suspects a colleague has an alcohol or substance use problem, they should refer the impaired health practitioner to the proper authority in your institution or state. In several states, reporting is required by law. In states where it is required, as long as reporting that is deemed false is not done with malicious intent, immunity is usually granted. Besides the state and institutional requirements, all health professionals have a duty to "first do no harm" and protect patients from the harm that might come from an impaired professional.

Do not wait until impairment affects performance; all health professionals must report at the first sign of impairment. This report should be considered an act of kindness as the short and long-term consequences are grave for health; an impaired health professional can harm a patient.

**Evaluation and Treatment Referral Programs**

The following are some of the treatment options available to help alcohol and drug-impaired health professionals:

- Professional associations offer peer assistance programs to assist impaired professionals.

- State boards offer peer assistance programs and support for health professionals that voluntarily or through mandate seek counseling and treatment.

- Professional schools provide programs for their students.

- In Florida, Rule 64B31-10.001 pairs an impaired practitioner with a program or consultant to provide intervention, evaluation, and referral of impaired health professionals. The program monitors the impaired practitioner. No medical services are provided.

The following are two types of programs:

- State licensing boards operate practitioner programs for impaired health professionals to deal with health care providers with an impairment resulting in harm to patients.

- Practitioner health programs are managed by societies, which seek to help health professionals with substance use issues before they harm patients or commit crimes.

Evaluation and treatment programs are state-licensed and accredited. Programs usually have a multidisciplinary team to manage the health professional. Services, depending on the degree of addiction, might be in either an outpatient or inpatient setting. Services are modified depending on the impairment affecting the health professional.

**Treatment Techniques**

It is challenging to treat any patient for alcohol or drug use disorder, and it is more challenging if the treatment is under duress. Treatment usually involves the following steps:

- Intervention - voluntarily, institution, or mandated by a licensing board.

- Evaluation - health professional is evaluated to determine the degree of their impairment.

- Setting - depending on their degree of addiction and whether they may or may not suffer withdrawal, the practitioner will be considered for in- or outpatient treatment.

- Treatment - counseling, group therapy, or residential inpatient treatment program. In some cases, they are hospitalized for a few days until withdrawal symptoms resolve.

Health professionals who accept their disease and are willing to undergo treatment, in general, have a high success rate. They are usually bright, have a history of high achievement, and a will to succeed. These characteristics typically bode well for treatment success. The recovery rates for health practitioners generally are higher than the general population. Most health professionals who undergo intervention and treatment early and have not harmed a patient or committed a crime can retain their licenses and eventually return to clinical practice.

**Florida Mandated Impaired Practitioner Treatment**

Under Chapter 456, there are designated treatment program requirements for impaired practitioners.

In Florida, a health professional can avoid disciplinary action if they complete the following:

- Admit the impairment

- Voluntarily enroll in a treatment program

- Withdraw or limit practice as prescribed by the impairment consultant managing the case

- Release all medical records to the consultant managing the case

**Florida Intervention Project for Nurses**

In Florida, nurses have the option of the Intervention Project for Nurses [S. 456.076]. This is a statutorily approved evaluation and treatment program approved for impaired nurses

- All treatment programs in Florida must gain approval from the Intervention Project for Nurses.

- The Intervention Project for Nurses does not provide treatment; it only providers referral and monitoring.

- Programs include state-licensed psychiatrists, counselors, and addiction specialists that specifically treat healthcare professionals.

- Intervention Project for Nurses facilities hold a multi-disciplinary, state-licensed, and they may include outpatient, residential, partial, or complete hospitalization.

- Treatment programs are accredited through the CARF International or the Joint Commission.

- Treatment programs and providers must apply and gain approval from the Intervention Project for Nurses.

- The Intervention Project for Nurses provides a list of available programs and providers.

**Types of Treatment Programs**

**Intensive Outpatient Programs**

These programs provide regular, intense treatment but limit the disruption to family, school, or work schedules. The practitioner typically stops practice until successful treatment is completed, and they have reached the stage of monitoring where they are allowed to return to patient care. Outpatient licensed counselors usually meet with the practitioner for several hours, multiple times each week.

**Residential Programs
**

Typically these programs are located within a hospital or a specialized facility. Patients live in a highly structured environment. Typically, patients live in the facility for 30 to 90 days. In the early phase, they may undergo medical withdrawal and detoxification. Eventually, these patients transition to outpatient programs.

**Partial Hospitalization Programs
**

Includes regular intensive daily sessions, usually five days per week, but the patient does not stay overnight.

**Institutional Programs 
**

An employer may mandate an employee to obtain treatment for impairment or face reporting and termination. Some employers offer addiction assistance programs to help with alcohol or drug problems. Programs often include:

- Health promotion

- Education

- Referral to treatment centers

- Treatment

- Often employer paid

It is expensive for an employer to hire and train a health professional. Employers often are willing to assist an employee with the help they need to maintain their job and career. By treating an employee, the employer will save the cost of replacing the employee, avoid accidents that harm patient safety and cause liability issues for the institution, decrease absenteeism, and avoid worker compensation claims.

- Many institutions will provide general education to employees regarding the use of alcohol or drugs. For example, they may educate employees on avoiding binge drinking as it results in hangovers, which impair performance and cognitive function. Much like pilots that do not drink 12 hours before a flight, it is similarly vital for a medical professional to avoid alcohol or drug consumption at least 12 hours before a shift.

- Other education programs may encourage employees to recognize the early warning signs and symptoms of alcohol and drug addiction and help early interdiction before developing serious complications.

- Employees are often instructed on how to identify impaired peers. Individuals who work with an alcohol or drug-impaired individual are more likely to discover and report if they are trained in the signs and symptoms to suspect.

Drug and alcohol use are common problems for health professionals, particularly nurses and doctors. With the prevalence being high among health practitioners and the risk of consequences rising to career-ending, there is an increasing awareness of the issues. Further, the implications for patients may be life-threatening.

Fortunately, there is an increasing trend to recognize that individuals with alcohol and drug issues need evaluation and treatment instead of punitive sanctions.

All health providers need to recognize the signs and symptoms of substance use. There are appropriate tools to assist peers who need help. Together healthcare providers can work toward improving patient safety and avoiding the permanent loss of a practitioner who has devoted years to their training.
