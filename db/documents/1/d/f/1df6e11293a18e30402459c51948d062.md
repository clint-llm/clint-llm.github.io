Exophthalmos is the protrusion of one or both eyes anteriorly out of the orbit due to an increase in orbital contents within the rigid bony orbit. It most commonly manifests in thyroid-associated eye disease such as Graves' disease ophthalmopathy. Clinicians need to be aware of the differential diagnoses that may also result in exophthalmos, as these could be easily missed in patients with deranged thyroid function. To restore and maintain optimum vision, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of exophthalmos and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of exophthalmos.
- Summarize the evaluation of exophthalmos.
- Outline the management options for exophthalmos.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the care of patients with exophthalmos and improve outcomes.
