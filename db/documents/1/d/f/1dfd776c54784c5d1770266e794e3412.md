The HbS gene is found in African countries, India, the Caribbean, and Central and South America. In the United States, 1 in every 600 African Americans has the HbSS genotype, which means most hemoglobin is HbS.P. falciparum malaria. The spread of the ßs allele in North America and Western Europe can be seen as a result of population movements such as during the slave trade. In today's world, the disease burden is higher in sub-Saharan Africa.

An estimated 50 to 90% of affected children die before five years of age from pneumococcal and malarial infections. Continued population movements are projected to increase the incidence of SCD, with an estimated 400,000 newborns annually by 2050.
