The initial workup of biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal should include digital rectal examination (DRE), inguinal lymph node evaluation with biopsy of suspicious nodes, chest and abdominal CT, pelvic CT/MRI, anoscopy, HIV testing (if HIV status unknown), CBC, CMP, and gynecologic exam for women, including cervical cancer screening per NCCN guidelines. PET/CT is useful in radiation treatment planning and to evaluate for distant metastatic disease.
