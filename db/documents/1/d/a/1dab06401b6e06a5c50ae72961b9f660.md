Antithrombin is part of a family of serine protease inhibitors known as serpins. Serpins generally consist of a highly conserved structure of amino acid chains organized into three beta-sheets, nine alpha sheets, and a reactive center loop (RCL) designated as the sequence of amino acids which serve as the reactive site for protease interaction

Synthesis of antithrombin occurs primarily in the liver initially as an immature protein chain made up of 464 amino acid residues. The amino acid chain is then cleaved at the N-terminal by 32 amino acids, thereby creating a mature 432 amino acid sequence protein. The mature protein contains three disulfide bonds that intermolecularly link six cysteine residues together. This configuration allows for four potential glycosylation sites to exist within the molecule.

Alpha antithrombin refers to antithrombin in which oligosaccharides bind all four glycosylation sites. It is the predominant configuration of antithrombin, presenting as around 90% of the antithrombin in the plasma.
