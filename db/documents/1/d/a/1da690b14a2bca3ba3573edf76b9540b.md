**Child Abuse**

There are various conditions where the clinical manifestations may be mistaken for child abuse. The provider must be familiar with these diseases as some may require prompt initiation of appropriate therapy for the actual underlying condition and to avoid unnecessary evaluation for child abuse.

This is summarized below by the clinical findings:

- Bruising

- Bleeding disorders (i.e. hemophilia A, von Willebrand disease, Vitamin K deficiency, immune thrombocytopenia)
- Exploratory ingestion of medications (i.e. Salicylates)
- Vasculitides (i.e. Henoch-Schonlein purpura)
- Congenital birthmarks (i.e. dermal melanosis/Mongolian spots)
- Benign Tumors (i.e. hemangiomas)
- Delayed subaponeurotic fluid mass
- Hypersensitivity syndromes (i.e. erythema multiforme)
- Cultural practices to improve circulation and relieve common symptoms (such as coining, spooning, cupping)

- Fractures

- Osteogenesis imperfecta
- Osteopenia
- Metabolic bone disease (i.e. Rickets, vitamin C and Copper deficiency, or oncological disorders)
- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
- Injury during resuscitation (i.e. rib fractures, internal organ contusions, retinal hemorrhages)

- Burns

- Chemical and irritants (i.e. bleach, complementary and alternative therapies)
- Infection (i.e. impetigo, blistering distal dactylitis, ringworm)
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome
- Toxic epidermal necrolysis
- Dermatological conditions (i.e. diaper dermatitis)

- Intracranial Hemorrhage

- Trauma not secondary to abuse (i.e. vacuum extraction during delivery)
- Inborn errors of metabolism (i.e. glutaric aciduria type I)
- Neoplastic diseases (i.e. brain tumor)
- Congenital vascular conditions (i.e. arteriovenous malformation, aneurysms)
- Bleeding disorders
- Collagen vascular disease (i.e. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome)

**Elder Abuse**

For elderÂ abuse and neglect the following conditions should be considered:

- Anorexia

- Depression or other psychiatric conditions
- Dementia
- Delirium
- Adverse effects of prescribed, over-the-counter, herbal medications
- Cerebral vascular accidents (multiple resulting in increasing difficulty or dependency in completing activities of daily living)
- Use of alcohol or illicit drugs
- Dysphagia
- Dental problems
- Acute and chronic infection (i.e. urinary tract infection, sepsis, tuberculosis, endocarditis)
- Endocrinologic diseases (i.e. hyperthyroidism)

- Fractures

- Malignancy (resulting in pathologic fractures)
- Osteopenia (resulting in pathologic fractures)
