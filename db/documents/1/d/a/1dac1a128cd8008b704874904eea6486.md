The catheterization procedure is begun by obtaining vascular access through the right femoral vein and right femoral artery. Profiling of the VSD should be done through angiographic evaluation of the left ventricle at a 55 degrees/20degrees left anterior oblique projection/cranial. The location, size, and relationship of the VSD with the aortic valve should be carefully assessed. The diameter of the VSD should be measured at the peak of the diastolic phase. The occlude should be selected based on VSD type and measurements. If the VSD type and sizes are consistent with intervention, then an arteriovenous (AV) circuit is created via a femoral vein approach at the access site. Once the appropriate occlude is selected, a 5 Fr catheter should be advanced from the LV across the defect. Advance a long sheath (6 to 12 Fr) to the LV through the AV circuit and position it under the aortic valve. Through the long sheath, deploy the VSD occluder using fluoroscopic and echocardiographic guidance. Angiography of the LV and ascending aorta should be performed to verify complete occlusion and to identify any new-onset aortic valve regurgitation. After the intervention, patients should be monitored inpatient for 24 hours with continuous ECG monitoring as this period has the highest arrhythmia risk. All patients should receive aspirin (5 mg/kg daily) to decrease the risk of thromboembolism.
