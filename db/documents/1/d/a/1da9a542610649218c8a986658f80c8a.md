The TPVB is currently performed in the majority of hospital institutions under ultrasound guidance to minimize the risk of nerve and/or pleural damage which can lead to pneumothorax. To perform the procedure we need the following equipment:

- Ultrasound guidance with the high-frequency probe or low-frequency curvilinear probe depending on the patient's body

- Sterile sleeve and gel

- One 23 to 25 gauge needle for skin infiltration

- 25 mL of local anesthetic

- Needle size: 80mm B-bevel nerve block needle

- 1 pack of gauze 4-inch x 4-inch

- Chlorhexidine gluconate solution for skin asepsis

- Sterile gloves

- Marking pen for anatomical landmarks
