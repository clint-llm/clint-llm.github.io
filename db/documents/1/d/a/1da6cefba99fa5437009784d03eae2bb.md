Amebic colitis results from invasive infection of the colonic mucosa by Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica). Losch first reported disease due to E. histolytica in 1875; he found amoebas in colonic ulcers at autopsy and showed that the disease could be experimentally induced in vivo by rectal inoculation with human feces. Work by other scientists showed that the amoeba was the cause of the disease. E. histolytica has a worldwide distribution but uncommon in the United States, although it occurs with increased frequencies in patients with AIDS and men who have sex with other men. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, histology, diagnostic evaluation, complications, and treatment of amebic colitis. Moreover, it highlights the interprofessional team's role in educating the patients to prevent the disease and its complications.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of amebic colitis.
- Explain the best methods to diagnose amebic colitis.
- Explain the importance of two-step medication treatment to eliminate amebic infection completely. 
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team that can enhance patient care when encountering the extracolonic complications of amebic colitis.
