The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been monitoring cases of botulism in the United States since 1973. From years 2011 through 2015, an average of 162 annual cases were reported. These primarily included infant botulism at 71% to 88%, followed by foodborne botulism, wound botulism, and botulism of unknown origin. Except for rare, large outbreaks, the total number of botulism cases has remained relatively stable over the past ten years.

Mortality from botulism is low. The mortality rate had decreased significantly from over 60% in the 1950s to a mere 3% in 2009. Most deaths reported are due to botulism of unknown origin, followed by foodborne, wound, and infant botulism (less than 1%).
