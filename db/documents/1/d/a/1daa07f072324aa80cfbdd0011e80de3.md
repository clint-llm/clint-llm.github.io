A thorough history and physical examination are essential when evaluating patients for Er:YAG laser therapy. Before initiating treatment, patients must be fully informed of treatment risks and expectations; they should also be assessed for contraindications to therapy. If perioral treatment is planned, the patient should be asked about a history of cold sores, which could be reactivated by the laser. Underlying cutaneous conditions at the treatment sites, such as vitiligo, should be assessed. The history should also include an account of sun exposure, sunscreen use, and family/personal history of skin cancers.

Prior to laser resurfacing, if the perioral area is to be treated, patients should receive prophylactic antiviral medications to prevent herpes simplex outbreaks in the post-treatment period. Herpes lesions can cause scarring and may also be superinfected with bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus. An example of an effective prophylactic regimen is valacyclovir 500 mg PO BID x14 days starting the day prior to or the day of treatment.
