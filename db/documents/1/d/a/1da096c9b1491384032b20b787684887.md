The clinical presentation of ampullary cancers often resembles the presentation of distal biliary ductal cancers (cholangiocarcinomas), pancreatic cancers, or colon cancers. Often the FNAC is difficult to differentiate ampullary from other periampullary cancers. Definitive surgery allows prospectively identifying histology accurately. From the biologic behavior standpoint, ampullary cancers are associated with a better prognosis compared to other periampullary malignancies.
