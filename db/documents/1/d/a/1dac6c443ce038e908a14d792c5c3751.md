Dopamine receptor antagonists should be avoided whenever possible by selecting other medications that have a lower potential to cause tardive dyskinesia. Furthermore, chronic use of first-generation antipsychotics should be avoided whenever possible. To date, treatment options remain sparse. The American Academy of Neurology only recommends a few treatment options, which include clonazepam and ginkgo biloba. Valbenazine, a vesicular monoamine transport type 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor, was approved by the FDA on April 11, 2017, to treat tardive dyskinesia. The KINECT 3 trial results revealed valbenazine improved tardive dyskinesia when compared to the placebo drug. However, the best treatment option is primary prevention.
