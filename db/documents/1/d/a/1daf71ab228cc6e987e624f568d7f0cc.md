Osteochondritis of the knee can pose a diagnostic dilemma, as the lesion may either be asymptomatic or mimic other causes of knee pain.  Managing osteochondritis dissecans of the knee requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that includes a physician, physical therapists for conservative management, a radiologist trained in reading musculoskeletal imaging, and an experienced orthopedic surgeon. The physician will need to keep osteochondritis dissecans of the knee in their differential diagnosis for possibly vague presentations of knee pain and must order the correct radiographs as well as MRI for proper identification and staging of these lesions. Physical therapists will be required to manage most patients with osteochondritis dissecans of the knee properly, whether they receive conservative therapy or surgical therapy and need strengthening as well as gait retraining after a period of non-weight bearing. A well-trained radiologist will be required to identify and grade osteochondritis dissecans lesions in the knee properly. An experienced orthopedic surgeon is essential to provide guidance regarding the likelihood of successful treatment with conservative therapy versus surgery. Timely diagnosis and recognition are critical, as stable osteochondritis dissecans lesions with intact articular surfaces are likely to heal with nonoperative treatment, especially in pediatric patients.
