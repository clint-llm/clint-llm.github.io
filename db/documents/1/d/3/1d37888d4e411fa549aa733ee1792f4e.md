Fear of going to school was first called "school phobia" in 1941. Approximately 2% to 5% of all school-aged children experience school refusal. The incidence is similar between boys and girls. Although school refusal occurs at all ages, it is more common in children ages 5 to 6 and 10 to 11 years of age. The longer a child is out of school, the harder it is to return. No socioeconomic differences have been noted.
