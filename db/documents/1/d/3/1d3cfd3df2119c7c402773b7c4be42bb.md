Previously known as Lyell syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are variants of the same condition and are distinct from erythema multiforme major staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome­, and other drug eruptions.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis is a rare, acute, serious, and potentially fatal skin reaction in which there are sheet-like skin and mucosal loss accompanied by systemic symptoms. Medications are causative in over 80% of cases.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis is classified by the extent of the detached skin surface area.

- Stevens-Johnson syndrome: less than 10% body surface area

- Overlap Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis: 10% to 30% body surface area

- Toxic epidermal necrolysis more than 30% body surface area
