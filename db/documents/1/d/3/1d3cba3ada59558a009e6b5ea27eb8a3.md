Polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an autosomal dominant disorder. It's a multisystem and progressive disease with cysts formation and kidney enlargement along with other organ involvement (e.g., liver, pancreas, spleen).

In the adult population, it is the most frequent genetic cause of renal failure, with 6% to 8% of patients on dialysis in the US. By the age of 60 years, 50% of them need renal replacement therapy. Cysts may be detected in childhood or in utero, but clinical manifestations appear in the third or fourth decade of life.
