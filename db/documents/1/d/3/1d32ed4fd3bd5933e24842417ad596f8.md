According to the DSM-5, the following differential diagnoses should be ruled out before a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder:

**Autism Spectrum Disorders**

Children on the autism spectrum often exhibit many of the same features as those with reactive attachment disorder; however, restricted range of interest, sensory processing difficulties, and rigid adherence to rituals or routines are specific to autism spectrum disorder.

**Intellectual Impairment**

For a diagnosis of RAD to be made, the child must have attained a developmental age of at least 9 months, and another medical or mental health disorder must not cause social impairments. Impairments in social relatedness commensurate with developmental age should be viewed as an overall feature of the developmental delay and not solely a response to severe neglect.

**Depressive Disorders**

Symptoms of anhedonia may mirror many of the withdrawal symptoms of RAD; however, children suffering from depression maintain the ability to attach and to seek and receive comfort from preferred caregivers.
