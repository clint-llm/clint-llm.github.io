With the advances in prenatal imaging, about two-thirds of the cases of congenital diaphragmatic hernia are detected in the antenatal period. The presentation in the postnatal period depends on the size of the defect. Large diaphragmatic hernias usually present at birth with respiratory distress, cyanosis, decreased breath sounds on the affected side, displaced heart sounds, and scaphoid abdomen. Small hernias may have a delayed presentation with mild respiratory distress and/or feeding problems. As discussed earlier, CDH can be part of a genetic syndrome or associated with involvement of other organ systems with resulting congenital heart defects, neural tube defects, intestinal anomalies, renal anomalies, etc.
