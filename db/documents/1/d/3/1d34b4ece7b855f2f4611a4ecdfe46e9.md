Tumors of the pineal region are rare and account for 1% of all intracranial tumors in adults and up to 8% in children. Multiple pathologies are associated with this region due to the variety of cells in the gland and structures located adjacent to the gland. Tumors of the pineal region are classified into those arising from the pineal parenchyma, germ cell neoplasms, metastasis from other organs, and lesions arising from adjacent structures. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of pineal gland tumors and explains the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pineal gland tumors.
- Review the evaluation of pineal gland tumors.
- Describe the management options available for pineal gland tumors.
