In 1962, there was a need for new antiarrhythmic drugs other than quinidine and procainamide, the main available antiarrhythmic agents available at that time. From more than 500 compounds synthesized for the research program of new antiarrhythmic agents, disopyramide is the selected agent. The chemical structures of disopyramide resemble the synthetic muscarinic antagonist, lachesine, which explained its anticholinergic property.

Despite rarely used now for heart rhythm abnormalities because of the availability of newer drugs that provided better efficacy and favorable side effect profiles, disopyramide is still the drug of choice for vagally mediated atrial fibrillation such as sleep-induced or atrial fibrillation in athlete groups.

It is also a third-line antiarrhythmic agent for a patient with coronary artery disease. Moreover, in a patient with left ventricular hypertrophy, there is impaired depolarization, which can induce torsade de pointes. Hence, antiarrhythmics that prolong QT interval are avoided, but if sotalol or amiodarone either fail or are inappropriate, disopyramide can be an alternative.

A high symptom burden can be present in patients with a ventricular premature beat (VPB) or premature ventricular complexes (PVC). Disopyramide can be used for patients without structural heart disease can be treated with, albeit their efficacy is lower compared to ablation.
