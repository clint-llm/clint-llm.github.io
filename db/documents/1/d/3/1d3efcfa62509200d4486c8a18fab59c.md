Mitral valve commissurotomy is a surgical technique used in the treatment of mitral stenosis. Mitral stenosis occurs from a multitude of different etiologies but is most commonly due to rheumatic heart disease, which leads to commissural fibrosis. The commissurotomy can be performed through many approaches, including an open, closed, and even percutaneous ballooning technique. The closed technique for repair was used for several years, but this has slowly changed to open repair and, more recently, to percutaneous technique. A skilled physician should have both techniques for mitral stenosis repair in their armamentarium but, most importantly, know when to use them throughout the evolution of mitral stenosis.
