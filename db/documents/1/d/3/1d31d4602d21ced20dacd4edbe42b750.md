AC injuries are frequently seen after sporting events, car accidents, falls from a bicycle, and other sports-related activities (e.g. skiing). AC joint injuries may account for as much as 40% of all shoulder injuries and nearly 10% of all injuries in collision sports such as football, lacrosse, and ice hockey.
