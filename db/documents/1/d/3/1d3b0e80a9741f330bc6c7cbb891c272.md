The deep branch of the radial nerve normally passes between the heads of the supinator muscle as it becomes the posterior interosseous nerve to innervate the muscles of the posterior compartment of the forearm. A variant can occur where the deep branch of the radial nerve passes through the Arcade of Frohse (supinator arch), which can increase the likelihood of impingement.
