Dapsone is considered the first line of treatment with a good response.

The use of dapsone, however, may have a few side effects, including but not limited to anemia, hepatitis, or hypersensitivity syndrome. In the event of intolerance, systemic manifestation, or extensive skin involvement, the use of steroids may be considered.

Several steroid-sparing agents have been used in the literature with variable efficacy. These immunosuppressive medications include cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, with modest results. Rituximab has shown some promise with refractory cases.

Less infrequently, anakinra and intravenous immunoglobulins have been reported.
