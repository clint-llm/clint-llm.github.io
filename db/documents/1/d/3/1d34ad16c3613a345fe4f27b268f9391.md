Child development is a complex process that begins in the womb and continues until adulthood. It is influenced by biology and the environment, and it can be shaped by these, either positively or negatively. The mental health of a person depends greatly on the development they had as a child. It is crucial to follow a childâ€™s development to ensure that it is adequate. This is done mainly by parents and primary doctors through parental observations, routine visits, and screening tools. Once a gap or delay is identified, the correct services should be arranged in order to optimize the well-being of a child, and thus, the well-being of the future adult.
