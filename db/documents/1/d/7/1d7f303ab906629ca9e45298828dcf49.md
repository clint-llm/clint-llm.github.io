Unless the etiology of irritation on the ischio-gluteal bursa is accurately identified and addressed, ischial bursitis will usually not spontaneously remit. The pain may abate with a period of lay-off or treatment, but reinitiating activity will still lead to excessive friction on the bursa, causing inflammation and the recurrence of pain.
