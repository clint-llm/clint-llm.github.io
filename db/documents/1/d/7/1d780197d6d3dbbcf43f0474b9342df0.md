SMRs, including methocarbamol, are commonly prescribed for non-specific musculoskeletal pain. In 2004, an estimated two million American adults took a muscle relaxant, the most common indication being low back pain.

Despite more than three million methocarbamol prescriptions yearly in the United States, there is limited high-quality data describing clinical efficacy.

MDs, DOs, PAs, NPs, and physical therapists should be vigilant while prescribing methocarbamol in older patients, those at risk of polypharmacy, and those with a history of addiction. Clinicians should keep in mind that there is no high-quality evidence to suggest methocarbamol is more effective than NSAIDs for acute musculoskeletal pain. Nurses and pharmacists should verify methocarbamol is used only in select patients as part of multi-modal treatment withÂ close monitoring of efficacy, adverse effects, and polypharmacy. Additionally, extensive randomized controlled trials are warranted to guide the clinical decision-making for a drug that appears to be a popular clinical tool for prescribers without solid evidence. Integrated and collaborative work of the healthcare team could bring the best possible outcomes for patients using methocarbamol. [Level 5]
