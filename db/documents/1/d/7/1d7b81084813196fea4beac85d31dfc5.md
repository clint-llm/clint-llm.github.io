Degeneration of the substantia nigra occurs in patients with Parkinson disease. This condition results in the disruption of the nigrostriatal pathway and thus decreases the striatal dopamine levels. Unlike dopamine, levodopa can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Levodopa converts to dopamine in both the CNS and periphery.
