Hyperphosphatemia can have a delayed diagnosis, as most patients remain asymptomatic. However, as theÂ regulation of phosphate intricately links to calcium regulation, hyperphosphatemia can have significant effects on overall calcium phosphate homeostasis.

The key is to manage and treat the condition with an interprofessional team.

As the condition is more common in patients with renal disorders, nephrologists commonly encounter this condition in their clinical practice. However, a large number of specialists, including endocrinologists, pediatricians, pathologists, and radiologists play an essential role in its management.

The evaluation of hyperphosphatemia needs to have a broad vision, as several factors can affect phosphate levels.

The most crucial management action is the treatment of the underlying cause. The immediate management involves reducing the phosphate load in the body, either by promoting urinary excretion or by hemodialysis.

Several phosphate binders are also available and useful in patients with renal failure.
