Initial laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood count to rule out leukocytosis, hemolysis, and thrombocytopenia. A complete metabolic profile will aid in ruling out dehydration, electrolyte disturbance, and uremia. The majority of patients with E. coli 0157:H7 colitis will have a leukocytosis above 10,000/microL. Initial diagnosis of E. coli O157: H7 utilizes the stool culture of a diarrheal sample within the first days after onset. Most cultures positive for E. coli 0157:H7 will come from patients complaining of hemorrhagic diarrhea or grossly bloody diarrheal samples. Despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation that all diarrheal samples submitted for culture undergo screening for E. coli O157: H7, many laboratories will not routinely screen for this organism necessitating the clinician to request testing for E. coli 0157:H7 specifically. Culture the diarrheal specimen with sorbitol MacConkey agar, which allows for differentiation of non-pathogenic E. coli from pathogenic E. coli O157 based on the latterâ€™s inability to metabolize sorbitol. Diagnostic confirmation utilizes testing for the presence of E. coli O157: H7 antigens in the stool or toxin genes with polymerase chain reaction. Commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays can detect Shiga toxins in hemorrhagic stool samples.
