Abnormal coordination of the motor functions of the stomach results in delayed gastric emptying; this could be due to various pathology and can affect different areas of the stomach like fundus, body, and antrum. In patients with diabetes, the pathophysiology is noted at various levels, including intrinsic and extrinsic neurons, smooth muscle, and interstitial cells of Cajal. OxidativeÂ damage results in abnormal motor coordination in the antral region, causing dysfunctional contractions and impaired postprandial gastric accommodation phenomenon.
