Normally the external auditory canal (EAC) contains a layer of stratified squamous epithelium covering the underlying connective tissue along the osseous, while the osteocartilaginous junction and regions of the osseous canal are made of a thick subepithelial fibrous tissue. In patients with MOE, Biopsy of the external auditory canal (EAC) might show ulceration and loss of epithelium, with bacteria and inflammation reaching to the dense fibrous tissue. In the areas where the epithelium is not broken, reactive changes vary from mild hyperplasia to prominent pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia. Acute and chronic inflammation, including abscess formation, is common. In biopsy samples overlying the cartilaginous canal, the inflammation extends into the apopilosebaceous apparatus. Reactive capillary proliferation is evident within the granulation tissue. However, chronic granulomatous inflammation with granuloma formation is not associated with MOE. The identification of microorganisms is usually made by tissue staining. In case no organism has been identified, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay might help in detecting the causative organism.

It can be difficult to differentiate very well-differentiated squamous carcinoma form MOE in the presence of pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia; therefore, the presence of MOE should not exclude malignancy, as these can occur concurrently.
