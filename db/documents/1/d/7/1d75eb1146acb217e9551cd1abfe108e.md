Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis is uncommon, found worldwide, and has a 4:1 female to male predominance. The average age of onset is 30 to 60 years, but it can occur in infants and in the elderly. At least half of all patients have an identifiable underlying association. Internal malignancy is found in 15 to 30%, and hematologic malignancy is more common than solid organ cancer. 25% of patients have a preceding infection, and 10% have exposure to a potentially causative drug.
