Although there is no opening of the bowel lumen in the surgical procedure, resumption of the enteral feeds may be delayed in some patients. This is usually seen in those patients who have gross distension of the stomach and/or duodenum, have an element of dysmotility, or had undergone resection of the necrotic bowel with anastomosis. In these conditions, a nasogastric tube provides optimal bowel decompression. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) can be considered in patients who require prolonged fasting due to resection of a major proportion of the small bowel. Children who had failure to thrive in the preoperative period might also require a regular follow-up after discharge to ensure optimal catch-up growth.
