A thorough history and physical examination are essential first steps in evaluating a child with an antalgic gait. The clinician must ask if a child has reached specific developmental milestones, particularly motor milestones such as crawling or cruising in infants and toddlers or the ability to climb in toddlers and school-age children. This is crucial when the etiology of the child’s pain is due to a fracture. Underlying medical conditions such as osteogenesis imperfect can result in significant injuries even in the setting of apparently trivial trauma and must be taken into account in approaching these children.

The physical examination of the child needs to be developmentally appropriate. Pediatric vital signs vary with age. Often it is helpful to simply observe the child as they interact with their caregiver before performing a physical examination. Examining the non-affected extremity first, followed by gradually examining the area in question, is a useful technique to ease stranger anxiety. Note for any signs of edema, erythema, deformity, or diminished range of motion. Pay close attention to the hips (particularly in infants) and perform a thorough range of motion examination, looking for any signs of distress. If developmentally appropriate, having the child attempt to ambulate to the parents may help determine the location of the pain as one observes the child’s gait pattern.
