The prognosis for patients with typhoid fever depends on how quickly the diagnosis is made and antibiotics are started. The average rate of mortality is less than 1% worldwide, but that varies depending on the region. Mortality rates are highest among the very young (less than 1 year) and the very old.

Approximately 1% to 5% of patients will become chronic carriers of Salmonella enterica serotype typhi despite adequate antimicrobial therapy.
