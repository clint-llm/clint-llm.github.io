The most common reported adverse effects are fatigue, rash, atrial fibrillation, eczema, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, vertigo, constipation, and headache. Less frequent (less than 1 percent) reported adverse effects are myalgia, rhabdomyolysis (more frequent if coadministering gemfibrozil with a statin), acute appendicitis, cholelithiasis, angioedema, hypokalemia, eosinophilia, myopathy, synovitis, taste disturbance, xerostomia, flatulence.
