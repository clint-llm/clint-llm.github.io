Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), synonymous with extracorporeal life support (ECLS), is used as a lifesaving mechanical form of bypassing a patient’s cardiopulmonary system when in failure. Historically, it was adapted during the 1970s from perioperative cardiopulmonary bypass performed during cardiac surgery and was initially pioneered for children. As a result, much of the knowledge about ECMO today has been extrapolated from the pediatric and neonatal populations. ECMO is a highly specialized technology with limited availability in children’s hospitals but is associated with improved survival.

ECMO use is increasing worldwide due to improved survival rates in children who have been placed on ECMO.
