- Tonsils receive the afferent supply from the tonsillar plexus, with contributions from the trigeminal nerve (CN 5) via the lesser palatine nerves, as well as the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX).

- CN IX continues distally to the tonsils supplying general sensory and taste sensation to the posterior one-third of the tongue. CN IX is the nerve most likely to be damaged during a tonsillectomy.
