Unlike its’ cousin Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) used in chemistry and biochemistry to characterize molecules, Magnetic Resonance Imaging does not possess high sensitivity for single imaging molecules. MRI can only detect molecular motions and compositions in relationship to the characteristics of the surrounding tissues. Gadolinium-based MRI can detect changes and differences in molecular compositions and motions and hence have a significant role in the development of MR for molecular imaging. Gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents alter one or more of their physicochemical properties dynamically when interacting with their surrounding tissues environment. A multidisciplinary research approach, scientists and physicians with a thorough understanding of molecular and cell biology, chemistry and biochemistry, physiology, biomedical engineering of imaging methods, and radiology, is often required to develop and apply Gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents to biological and/or biomedical studies.

Diagnosis and treatment planning in over 100 million patients around the world have employed gadolinium-based, MRI contrast agents in the last 25 years. Quality of MR images are enhanced using gadolinium-based contrast agents, by the perturbation of nearby water protons’ magnetic properties in the body. Gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents, aid physicians to diagnose and treat a variety of pathological processes by improving the visualization of specific organs, tissues, and blood vessels**.**
