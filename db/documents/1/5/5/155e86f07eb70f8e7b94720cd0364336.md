The discovery of the aquaporin-4 antibody has led to serologic testing for this antibody, taking a key role in diagnosing NMOSD.

MRI with and without gadolinium can aid in the evaluation of NMOSD. Characteristic findings in optic neuritis include white matter lesions and optic nerve enhancement (T2-hyperintense lesions or T1-weighted contrast-enhancing images).

Those patients with area postrema syndrome will demonstrate lesions at the dorsal medulla region or area postrema. Those with acute brainstem syndrome will show lesions at the peri-ependymal brainstem. When MRI lesions show enhancement in the optic nerves and spinal cord, the main differential diagnosis of NMOSD is MS. It is important to distinguish these clinical entities as the prognosis and management differ considerably, and some MS drugs can worsen NMOSD.

In contrast with MS, NMOSD has some distinct radiologic features that differentiate it as a clinical entity. NMOSD shows longitudinal spinal cord lesions extending over three or more segments, while MS typically has short, multiple lesions.
