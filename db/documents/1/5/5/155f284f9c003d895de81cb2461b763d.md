Premalignant endometrial lesions are a characteristic sequence of endometrial hyperplasia (EH) that progress to endometrial carcinoma (EC). Two types of precursor lesions can lead to the two types of endometrial carcinoma.

Type 1 endometrial carcinoma accounts for nearly 80Â to 85% of all endometrial malignancies. AH shows many of the mutations that are seen in invasive endometrioid carcinoma.
