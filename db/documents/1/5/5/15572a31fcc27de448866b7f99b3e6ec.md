ISCA is an enigmatic clinical entity with the tendency for multispectral patterns of presentations such as:

- Acutely mimicking transverse myelitis.

- Progressive dorsal pain with neurological deficits

- Insidious pattern, mimicking a spinal tumor or chronic myelopathy

An interprofessional team comprising a neurologist, a neurosurgeon, a neuroradiologist, an infectious disease specialist, a pathologist, and a rehabilitation specialist is essential for managing ISCA.

The prognosis is good, with prompt surgical treatment and antibiotics. However, the size, location of the abscess, and severity of the neurological deficits determine the eventual outcome. Despite advances in treatment, spinal cord abscess still carries a mortality of 4 to 8%, and most patients are left with some type of residual neurological deficit. Therefore intensive neuro-rehabilitation is invariably justified.
