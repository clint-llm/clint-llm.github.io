Ongoing research in different aspects of COVID-19 will shed more light on the pathophysiology and treatment of cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19. Cardiac complications and side effects of the disease per se, drugs, and vaccines will also become more apparent as time passes and more data is available. Newer therapies and improved vaccines will arise, leading to better treatment and eradicating the virus. As we gain more data, more extensive retrospective studies will guide us regarding what caused higher morbidity and mortality and better prognosis.
