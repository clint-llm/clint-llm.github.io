The history and physical exam should ascertain whether there are any chronic underlying cardiovascular or pulmonary illnesses. Key components of history include onset, duration, aggravating factors, and alleviating factors. The presence of cough may indicate the presence of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or pneumonia. A severe sore throat could indicate epiglottitis. Pleuritic quality chest pain may indicate pericarditis, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or pneumonia. Orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and edema suggest a possible diagnosis of congestive heart failure. Tobacco use is a common history finding that increases the likelihood of COPD, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary embolism. If indigestion or dysphagia is present, consider gastroesophageal reflux disease or gastric secretion aspiration in the lungs. A barking quality cough, especially in children, may suggest croup. The presence of fever strongly suggests an infectious etiology.

The physical exam should begin with a rapid assessment of the ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation). Once determined to be stable, a full physical exam can be done. To determine the severity of dyspnea, one needs to observe respiratory effort, use of accessory muscles, mental status, and ability to speak. Engorgement of the neck veins may imply cor pulmonale caused by severe COPD, congestive heart failure, or cardiac tamponade. Thyromegaly may indicate hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Percussion of the lung lobes for dullness can determine the presence or absence of consolidation and effusion. Hyperresonance on percussion is a worrisome finding that indicates possible pneumothorax or severe bullous emphysema. Lung auscultation may reveal absent breath sounds indicating the presence of region occupying mass, such as pleural effusion or malignancy. The presence of wheezing is highly consistent with the diagnosis of obstructive lung diseases such as asthma or COPD. However, wheezing may be associated with pulmonary edema or pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary edema and pneumonia may present with rales on auscultation. Auscultation of the heart may reveal the presence of dysrhythmia, cardiac murmurs, or aberrant heart gallops. An S3 gallop indicates cardiac overfilling seen in left ventricular systolic dysfunction and congestive heart failure (CHF). An S4 gallop suggests left ventricular dysmotility and dysfunction. A loud P2 indicates possible pulmonary hypertension. Murmurs may indicate valvular dysfunction. Diminished heart sounds may indicate cardiac tamponade. Pericarditis may present with a rubbing cardiac sound on auscultation. On abdominal examination, hepatomegaly, ascites, positive hepatojugular reflux may suggest a diagnosis of CHF. Lower extremity edema is associated with CHF, and extreme swelling of the extremities suggests possible deep venous thrombosis that can lead to a pulmonary embolism. Digital clubbing is present in some forms of lung malignancy or severe chronic hypoxia. Cyanosis of the extremities indicates hypoxia.
