The development of the peripheral vestibular system begins with the formation of the otic placodes from surface ectoderm in the third week. During the fourth week, the otic placodes become the otic pits when they become surrounded by embryonic mesoderm. The otic pits then develop into the otic vesicles. The upper portion of the otic vesicle becomes the vestibular apparatus. As the otic vesicle lengthens, a division occurs between the ventral saccular portion and the dorsal utricular portion. The ventral saccular portion becomes the adult saccule and cochlear duct while the dorsal utricular portion forms the utricle and semicircular canals. Ossification of the system begins at 19 weeks gestation and reaches adult size by 25 weeks except for the internal aperture of the vestibular aqueduct that continues to develop until birth. Hair cells and otoconia develop at seven weeks with differentiation of Type 1 and Type 2 hair cells occurring between 11 and 13 weeks.
