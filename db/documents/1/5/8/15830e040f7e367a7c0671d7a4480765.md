During fetal development, the primitive umbilical ring appears as early as 4th week of gestation on the ventral surface of the body. It contains umbilical vessels (one vein and two arteries), allantois, vitelline duct, vitelline vessels and loop of midgut. As the herniated midgut return back, the definitive umbilical cord will develop which contains the umbilical vessels surrounded by Wharton's jelly. The Umbilical vessels obliterate after birth and will be replaced by a ligamentous structure
