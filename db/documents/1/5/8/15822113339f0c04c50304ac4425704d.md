Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the third most common cause of cardiovascular death in the United States of America. It is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is one of the newest treatment options for pulmonary embolism. This activity describes the technique involved in catheter-directed thrombolysis of a PE, the indication and contraindications of the procedure, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe which categories of PE patients will benefit from catheter-directed thrombolysis therapy.
- Review the current clinical trial data in regards to catheter-directed thrombolysis therapy for the treatment of PE.
- Identify the contraindications and complications of catheter-directed thrombolysis of PE.
- Outline the role of the pulmonary embolism response team in the delivery of catheter-directed thrombolysis of PE.
