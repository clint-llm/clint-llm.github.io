All infants irrespective of race, sex, color, religion, national origin, etc. are known to be affected by vitamin K deficiency bleeding. However, in a study conducted on 50 newborns, VKDB was found to have an increased incidence amongst male infants, breastfed infants, and those born via spontaneous vaginal delivery.

In early VKDB, the incidence in infants who have not received vitamin K prophylaxis ranges from about 6% to 12%. In classic VKDB, the incidence has gone down from 0.25% to 1.5% in earlier studies to 0.01% to 0.44% in recent studies. This has been achieved due to the inclusion of vitamin K prophylaxis in routine newborn care. In late VKDB, the incidence is 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 20,000 births and is seen predominantly in exclusively breastfed babies or babies with cholestasis or malabsorption (as vitamin K absorption is dependent on bile). The most common presenting symptom of late VKDB is intracranial bleeding, which has a mortality of 20%–50% and associated morbidity.
