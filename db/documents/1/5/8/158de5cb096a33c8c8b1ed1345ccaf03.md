As the trigeminal nerve exits the pons, it will divide into the ophthalmic nerve, the maxillary nerve, and the mandibular nerve. The mandibular nerve leaves the skull through the foramen ovale to give rise to a meningeal nerve called the nervus spinosus, which re-enters the skull through the foramen spinosum, and a nerve for the medial pterygoid muscle

The mental nerve will provide sensory innervation to the anterior territory of the buccal mucosa, lower lip, and the skin of the chin ventral to its foramen. Once leaving the mental foramen, it usually divides into three branches beneath the depressor anguli oris muscle. One descends toward the chin to give sensory innervation to the skin of the anterior chin. The other two branches will ascend to the lower lip and buccal gingivae around the premolar teeth

The orifice of exit of the mental nerve, mental foramen, is most commonly located halfway between the alveolar crest and the inferior border of the mandibular bone in the vertical plane
