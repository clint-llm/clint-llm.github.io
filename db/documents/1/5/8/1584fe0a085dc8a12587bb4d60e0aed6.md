The human heart is a pivotal organ in the circulatory system, and it beats more than 2 billion times during normal life. This functioning of the heart depends on the cardiac conduction system, which includes impulse generators (e.g., sino-atrial node) and the impulse propagating (His-Purkinje) system.

The current standard of care for symptomatic bradyarrhythmias due to conduction system diseases is the implantation of a cardiac implantable electronic device.

Despite their success, electronic pacemakers have limitations, including complications related to implantation, limited battery life, the potential for infection, lack of physiologic autonomic responsiveness, and size restriction in younger patients.
