Patient education and providing clear expectations are essential for patients presenting with GTPS. Health providers must educate patients that greater trochanteric pain syndrome can take 2 to 3 months (or longer) to resolve with conservative management. Physical therapy and activity modifications must be encouraged. Patients should be made aware of the concern for the use of corticosteroid injection (CSI) resulting in the possibility of weakening the tendon structure in the long term.
