A skin biopsy is mandatory in all patients with suspected squamous cell carcinoma. Histopathologically, squamous cell carcinoma is notable for irregular nests, cords and sheets of neoplastic keratinocytes invading the dermis. Lesion thickness is of particular importance when predicting risk for metastasis with a thickness more than 4 mm associated with a higher risk. Immunoperoxidase staining for cytokeratins 5/6/AE1/AE3 is useful in situations where the diagnosis is in question, especially with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
