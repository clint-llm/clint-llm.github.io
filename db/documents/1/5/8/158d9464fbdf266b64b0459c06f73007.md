Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog that inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion through direct stimulation of prostaglandin E1 receptors on parietal cells in the stomach. This action inhibits gastric acid secretion secondary to stimulation from food, alcohol, NSAIDs, histamine, caffeine, etc.  This effect tends to have a dose-dependent relationship.

Misoprostol induces mucus and bicarbonate secretion as well edema of the mucosa and submucosa, which causes thickening of the mucosal bilayer, which results in a reduced backflow of hydrogen ions and improved regulation of mucosal blood flow, which ultimately leads to the preservation of the mucosa's ability to produce new cells.

Uterotonic effects are caused by prostaglandin binding to smooth muscle cells in the uterine lining; this is responsible for its abortifacient properties, as well as its ability to promote labor and cervical ripening. Cervical dilation is produced primarily via degradation of collagen in the connective tissue of the stroma and reduction in cervical tone from increased amplitude and frequency of contractions. Its uterotonic properties are also useful to help decrease postpartum bleeding.

Abdominal pain and diarrhea appear to be a result of exposure to the misoprostolic acid released during metabolism, as symptoms seem to correlate with the misoprostolic acid peak plasma concentration.
