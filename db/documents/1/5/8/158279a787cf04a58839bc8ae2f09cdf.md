Given TTN is a self-limited condition, supportive care is the mainstay of treatment.

- Rule of 2 hours: Two hours after onset of respiratory distress, if an infant’s condition has not improved or has worsened or if FiO2 required is more than 0.4 or chest x-ray is abnormal, consider transferring infant to a center with a higher level of neonatal care.

- Routine NICU care including continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring, maintenance of neutral thermal environment, securing intravenous (IV) access, blood glucose checks, and observation for sepsis should be provided.

**Respiratory**

- Oxygen support may be required if pulse oximetry or ABG suggest hypoxemia.

- An oxygen hood is the preferred initial method; however, nasal cannula, CPAP can also be used.

- Concentration should be adjusted to maintain oxygen saturation in low 90s.

- Endotracheal intubation and requirement of ECMO support is usually uncommon but should always be considered in patients with declining respiratory status.

- Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis should be repeated, and pulse oximetry monitoring should be continued until signs of respiratory distress have resolved.

**Nutrition**

- Neonates’ respiratory status is the usual determinant for the degree of nutritional support required.

- Tachypnea of over 80 breaths per minute with associated increased work of breathing often makes it unsafe for the infant to receive oral feeds.

- Such infants should be kept nil per oral (NPO), and intravenous (IV) fluids should be started at 60 to 80 ml per kg per day.

- If respiratory distress is resolving, diagnosis is certain and respiratory rate is less than 80 breaths per minute; enteral feeds can be started.

- Enteral feeds should always be started slowly with progressive increments in volume of feeds until tachypnea has completely resolved

**Infectious**

- Since TTN may be difficult to distinguish from early neonatal sepsis and pneumonia, empiric antibiotic therapy with ampicillin and gentamicin should always be considered.

**Medications**

- Randomized control trials studying the efficacy of furosemide

- Salbutamol (inhaled beta2-agonist) has been shown to decrease the duration of symptoms and hospital stay; however, more evidence-based studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety.
