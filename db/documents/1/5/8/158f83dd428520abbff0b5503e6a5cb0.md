Stress imaging may be performed directly by a provider trained in stress imaging or by a nurse, exercise physiologist, or medical technician operating under the provider's supervision. Sonographers and nuclear technicians trained in image acquisition and machine operations for the respective modalities are the primary technical personal. A cardiologist trained in echocardiography and/or nuclear imaging provides the interpretations.
