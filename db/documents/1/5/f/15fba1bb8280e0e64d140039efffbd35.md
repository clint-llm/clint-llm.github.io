**Cerebral Aneurysms**

The majority of unruptured cerebral aneurysms are found incidentally during brain imaging for some other reasons. High-risk individuals like those with a family history of cerebral aneurysms or those with medical conditions associated with cerebral aneurysms may be screened with magnetic reasoning angiography (MRA), computerized tomography angiography (CTA), or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). In view of the inflammatory changes and macrophage deposition occurring at the aneurysm wall, magnetic resonance imaging with contrast may be utilized to detect those aneurysms prone to rupture as their wall may enhance.

**Aortic Aneurysms**

Like cerebral aneurysms, they are usually found incidentally during imaging for other reasons. Chest X-ray (CXR) is the study that most commonly identifies asymptomatic aortic aneurysms. CXR usually shows mediastinal widening, aortic knob enlargement, or tracheal deviation. It may also show the displacement of aortic calcifications, aortic kinking, and aortopulmonary window opacification. Aortic aneurysms may also be incidentally discovered with an echocardiogram, chest CT scan, or chest MRI performed for other reasons. In symptomatic patients, CTA or MRA is the imaging of choice for better characterization of aortic diameter, vessel anatomy, and to identify aortic dissection or aneurysm rupture. The choice of imaging technique depends on the clinical circumstances. In highly symptomatic patients, CTA is a better choice as it is readily available and requires much less time to perform. MRA is better than CTA in aneurysms involving aortic root sinus. It is also a more useful tool due to the lack of ionizing radiation for patients requiring repeated imaging. Transthoracic echocardiography should be performed in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve to assess the diameter of an aortic sinus. Transesophageal echocardiography is preferred over transthoracic echocardiography for the evaluation of the entire aorta.
