Adverse effects from normal use of KCl are typically related to the administration route. The FDA notes particular adverse effects for each administration route. In general, oral formulations most commonly correlate with GI irritation, including vomiting and diarrhea. Tablet and capsule forms may cause ulcerative/stenotic lesions with prolonged exposure to GI surfaces. Injectable KCl formulations have the potential to cause injection site complications (e.g., phlebitis, erythema, thrombosis, etc.). Also, rapid injection of KCl can precipitate mild hyperkalemia. This review discusses the symptoms of hyperkalemia in the Toxicity section.
