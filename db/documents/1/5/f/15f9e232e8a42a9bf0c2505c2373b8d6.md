Pediatric cataracts usually present with the whitish opacity in the eye first noticed by the attending parents. Various causes of the white reflex (leukocoria) must be ruled out before diagnosing a pediatric cataract alone. Causes of leukocoria include:

- Abnormalities in the cornea (corneal opacity)

- Lens abnormalities (cataract)

- Vitreous causes (vitreous hemorrhage, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous)

- Retinal diseases (Coat disease, retinoblastoma, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, retinal detachment, retinopathy of prematurity, coloboma, etc.).

- Tumors such as medulloepithelioma, retinal astrocytoma, etc.

Cataracts can occur in isolation or association with other causes of leukocoria mentioned above. The differential diagnosis can be narrowed down based on history, family history, and a thorough ophthalmic examination.
