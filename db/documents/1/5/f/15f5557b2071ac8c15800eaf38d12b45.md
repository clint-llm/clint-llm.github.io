Complications related to surgery include the following:

Neuropraxia associated with stretching of the radial sensory nerve. The neuropraxia may last 6-12 months.

Post-surgical stiffness of the interphalangeal and MCP joint is a very common complication. Hence, rehabilitation is a must.

For those who do not seek timely treatment, chronic instability is common. The longer the delay for treatment, the less likely will the repair be successful. In addition, the dorsal capsule, extensor pollicis longus, and extensor pollicis brevis muscles will atrophy, which further adds to the instability of the joint. The patient will notice that the thumb rotates into supination and will be displaced volarly.
